			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRIVATE PANEL CALLS FOR FEDERAL PAY RAISE  </P> <P> A private commission examining how to make government service more attractive  recommended Wednesday that salaries for top Administration officials, judges  and members of Congress be increased.  </P> <P> The 36-member National Commission on Public Service, headed by former Federal  Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker, recommended a pay raise that could end up as  large as the one Congress killed last month after public opposition.  </P> <P> Volcker would not speculate on whether he believed Congress would endorse a pay  increase, but he said that, based on talks with lawmakers: "I do find some  renewal of interest in the subject."  </P> <P> The commission's pay proposal is similar to the one made in the final weeks of  the Ronald Reagan Administration by a congressionally created commission that  assesses federal pay every four years. Reagan and President Bush endorsed that  proposed 51% increase.  </P> <P> Under the Volcker commission plan, a pay increase of 25% would be effective  immediately. A second pay raise would wait until a new Congress convenes in  1991. Also, members of Congress would have to give up speaking fees, or  honorariums, with which many lawmakers supplement their incomes.  </P> <P> Currently, most members of Congress are paid $89,500, Cabinet-level officials  are paid $99,500 and directors of various bureaus, deputy secretaries,  assistant secretaries and other top officials are paid from $75,500 to $89,500.  </P> <P> The commission also recommended pay raises for rank-and-file federal employees,  but the panel suggested that the increases be absorbed into existing budgets by  reductions in force and the elimination of programs. It also suggested that the  pay rates vary from locality to locality, based on the cost of living.  </P> <P> Among other commission recommendations:  </P> <P>  -- The number of presidential political appointees should be reduced from the  current level of about 3,000 to about 2,000 and career officials should more  frequently be considered for sub-Cabinet appointments.  </P> <P>  -- The President and Congress should establish a public service scholarship  program open to 1,000 students who would receive tuition and costs in return  for a commitment to a specified term of government service.  </P> <P>  -- The President should "set the highest standards of ethical conduct for  those who hold the public trust, and act quickly and firmly to remove those who  violate that trust."  </P> <P> In comments to a group of high school students who visited the White House on  Wednesday, Bush lauded the commission's report. He had met earlier in the day  with the commission but was non-committal on the pay raise proposal.  </P></p>

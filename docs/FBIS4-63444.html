			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Here is what Eduard Shevardnadze said at the  meeting in the parliament hall dedicated to the festivities to  be held on Georgia's Independence Day.    [Begin Shevardnadze recording]] This will be a demonstration  of what our troops are, what guarantees we have to defend our  statehood if needed. [passage omitted]    I would like to ask the organizers of the festivities to pay  specil heed to refugees in Tbilisi as well in other places.  Unfortunately, we are not rich but a kind word and basic  concern can be spared in order that the refugees can feel that  this is their celebration and their festival and that the  Georgian state is concerned with their interest and is ready to  protect each of its citizen and every family. [passage  indistinct] We have taken an immense commitment. I request  everyone to get to work. If our intentions do not come true and  we fail to justify all hopes and redeem a promise given to our  people and refugees in the first instance, a day will come when  we will have to answer to these people for everything. That is  why posing any obstacles is inadmissible today. The authorities  must be given an opportunity to bring their endeavor to an end.  The aim of all of us, including parties and political forces  who are raging a battle against the authorities, is to secure a  positive completion of the cause. Their target is the same. I  do not believe that they are fighting to overthrow the  government. They are fighting for a safe return of refugees,  for getting guarantees of security. They doubt that ours is the  right way. But only time can show whether the way is right or  wrong. Therefore, while discussing this issue today, I have  regarded it necessary to say a few words about this.    I request all political parties, their leaders, members of  parliament and leaders of public organizations to participate in  these festive arrangements actively. [passage omitted]    Lack of hope can drive the country to destruction. Our whole  history has been a struggle for freedom, for independence, for  hope. The hope saved Georgia. I appeal to all political parties  to establish this hope on 26 May and let us all try to  demonstrate unity and integrity for the sake of the country.</p>

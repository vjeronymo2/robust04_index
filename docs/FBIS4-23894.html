			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Colette Braeckman: "The Rwandan Plane Shot Down </F> by Two Frenchmen?"]    [Text] While French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe is saying  that France is prepared to mount an intervention on Rwandan  soil, "to protect the groups threatened with extermination,"  information has reached us casting suspicion on two French  soldiers in the attack on [former] President Habyarimana's  plane, which took place on 6 April.    A report from Kigali, which is consistent on some points  with  the current state of the investigation being carried out in  Belgium by the military prosecutor's office and which is  consistent with other information in our possession, asserts  that the plane carrying President Habyarimana and Cyprien  Ntaryamira, his Burundian counterpart, was shot down by two  French soldiers from the DAMI [Military Training Assistance  Detachment], serving the CDR [Coalition for the Defense of the  Republic]. The CDR are the extremists of "Hutu power" accused  of having spearheaded the subsequent massacres. It was French  soldiers from the DAMI who remained in Kigali until last  December, before being replaced by the UNAMIR [UN Assistance  Mission in Rwanda] Blue Helmets which include 450 Belgian  paratroopers. However, some DAMI members were seen in Kigali  again in February.    The report states that these two French soldiers put on  Belgian uniforms to leave the area and were seen by two soldiers  of the National Guard. Hence the official accusation,  reiterated by the Rwandans, against the UNAMIR Belgians who were  present at the airport. Only four CDR officials were informed  of this plot against President Habyarimana's plane. This report  is consistent with other information, gathered in Rwanda during  the withdrawal of expatriates and in Brussels where the  investigation of the military prosecutor's office, opened after  the death of 10 Belgian paratroopers, is being continued.    It now seems almost certain that the plane was shot down by  a  portable missile, probably a Soviet-made SAM of the Strela  series. Such weapons are not rare in Africa, they are found in  Uganda, but also in Angola, and others, from Eastern Europe,  have been sold on the private market. However, all the Belgian  and foreign aid workers and observers think there is no question  that the two rockets which downed the plane could have been the  work of Rwandan soldiers: They have never been trained in that  kind of exercise. The hypothesis most frequently cited so far  was that of unidentified "mercenaries." It also seems, and we  were confirmed this on the spot, that the fire came from a place  called "Massaka," which is situated behind the Kanombe military  camp, where the Presidential Guard was posted. In the three  days which followed the attack, all possible witnesses were  liquidated. More than 3,000 people were thus eliminated in the  area around Massaka by the Rwandan paratroopers from Kanombe  camp.    How could the perpetrators of the missile fire have procured  Belgian paratrooper uniforms? As easily as anything,  apparently: The Belgian Blue Helmets were in the habit of giving  their laundry to the Hotel Meridien and they were often  surprised to find that pieces of their uniform were disappearing.    Other indications seem worrying to the investigators, for  instance the fact that when the plane from Dar es Salaam was  approaching Kigali, the control tower several times asked who  was on board the plane, notably finding out about the presence  of the Burundian president.    However, it must be pointed out that the airplane crew was  French and that Major Jacky Heraud, Colonel Jean-Pierre  Minaberry, and Chief Warrant Officer Jean-Marie Perrinne, the  mechanic on board, perished alongside the two heads of state and  their fellow passengers.    This possible involvement by two French soldiers in the  attack on [former] President Habyarimana's plane raises  essential questions: In what framework did they act? Did they  operate as mercenaries? What was the motive for such an act,  which launched the killings, plunging Rwanda into an  unprecedented tragedy?    Given the present information, it is virtually certain that  the Rwandan president, who was under strong pressure to accept  the Arusha agreements, had finally given way during the meeting  held in Dar es Salaam by President Mwinyi, Tanzanian "mediator,"  and was preparing to deliver a speech on radio on his return to  Kigali, announcing the formation of a broadly based transitional  government, including five Patriotic Front ministers. This  implementation of the Arusha agreements, making provision for  power sharing, annoyed the regime's "hardliners" who had long  planned [former] President Habyarimana's elimination if he  showed weakness.    There have also been questions about the extent to which the  president's family, and more especially his in-laws, were  informed of these plans by the extremists. The report we have  received from Kigali states that the president's family was not  informed.</p>

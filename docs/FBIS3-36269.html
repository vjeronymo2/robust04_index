			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Vyzhutovich: "By Closing the Door to the </F> Press the Government is Depriving Society of Information About  its Work"]    [Text] A session of the Russian Cabinet of Ministers was  held on 3 February in Government House on Krasnopresnenskaya  Embankment. The following matters were considered: the  economic conditions in which the agro-industrial complex will be  functioning in 1994, meaures to maintain and develop small  businesses, state mamagement of labor protection, progress in  the implementation of decisions on overcoming the aftermath of  the Ossetian-Ingush armed conflict, and also the government work  schedule for the first and second quarters.    At that point IZVESTIYA is forced to conclude its account of  the government session -- the paper has no further details. The  same goes for correspondents of other papers. Henceforth, on  instructions from the head of the government apparatus, only the  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA representative will be allowed to attend  Cabinet sessions.    The apparatus' denying journalists access to government news  is big news in itself. As ITAR-TASS reported, for the first  time in two and one-half years even news agency and television  correspondents were barred from a Cabinet session. But we must  be more precise: It is not the journalists, whom the government  apparatus head probably does not respect, who have been deprived  of information. No, it is society that is being starved of  government information, its interest in the government having  been whetted by the reshuffle and the perturbing statements by  the premier.    Actually, that is probably the reason why the door was  hastily and brusquely closed to Russian and foreign  correspondents. Presumably, the kind of thing that another  venerator of press freedom -- Ruslan Khasbulatov -- described as  "attacks" and "subversive activity," advising the press "not to  harbor any illusions about being a fourth power," will no longer  seep through the narrow crack left for ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, the  official government organ.    Were the questions submitted for government examination on 3  February secret? No, the press service spokesman who relieved  journalists of their professional duties that day, did not refer  to any secrecy. Which makes it all the more interesting. Even  more interesting than before, when, whether approving of or  cursing the government, citizens at least knew or could guess  what to expect of it. Even more interesting, because at the  moment few people have any idea what "nonmonetarist methods" of  combatting inflation mean or how to reconcile the statement that  handing out "preferential credits right, left, and center" is to  stop, with the intention to issue them "selectively."    We will find out in the end, probably very soon. Closed  doors, behind which government policy will apparently be  conducted henceforth, are the most unreliable method of guarding  against public and, as is the custom everywhere, critical  attention to the work of the Cabinet of Ministers. This is  confirmed by the absurd way the Council of Ministers has  isolated itself from the press, a method borrowed from the  practice of the unforgettable Politburo.</p>

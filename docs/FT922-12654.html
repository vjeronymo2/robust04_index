			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: Skanska profits halve after write-downs SKANSKA, Scandinavia's largest construction and property company, said profits for 1991 more than halved, following huge write-downs on properties and share investments. The Swedish group's profit after financial items plummeted to SKr1bn (Dollars 168m) last year - from SKr2.36bn in 1990 - after write-downs amounting to SKr1.47bn. Skanska proposed raising the dividend to SKr3.25 from SKr3.13 and said it did not expect profit after financial items for 1992 to fall below the 1991 level of SKr1.001bn. Group revenue dropped by 10 per cent to SKr33.55bn in 1991, with revenue from the contracting operations falling 13 per cent to SKr30.4bn. Skanska's rental revenue, both from development properties and from property management, increased to SKr3.12bn from SKr2.43bn. The fall in real estate prices - both in Sweden and abroad - has forced Skanska to write down its development and investment properties by a total of SKr1.15bn. Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, yesterday placed the ratings of Skandia, Hafnia and Uni Storebrand on CreditWatch following last week's announced deal between the three Scandinavian insurance groups. Under the proposed deal, Skandia of Sweden will take over Hafnia of Denmark and will sell most of its own international reinsurance business to Uni Storebrand of Norway. S&amp;P has placed Skandia International Insurance's AA claims paying ability, AA senior debt rating and A1 plus commercial paper rating on CreditWatch with negative implications. Uni Storebrand's A1 commercial paper rating has been placed on CreditWatch with negative implications. Hafnia Insurance Group's A claims-paying ability and its merchant bank's A2 Eurocommercial paper rating have been placed on CreditWatch with developing implications, which means they could be either raised or lowered. S&amp;P said the proposed takeover was likely to be positive for Hafnia.</p>

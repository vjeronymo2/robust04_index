			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Arts: Light enough to take to bed - Art books need not break either your arm or your bank balance At Christmas, we do things that we never - well hardly ever - do during the rest of the year, such as giving each other lavish art-books. Here are my recommendations of recent ones which I have found stimulating and readable, on subjects ranging from felines in Ancient Egypt to the intimacy of Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenburg. In the case of art-books, readability is in large part a function of size. My own limit for comfortable reading in bed is two kilos, which is still considerably too heavy for reading on a plane. Publishers should think harder about the trade-off between glamour and portability. A book like Jeffrey Ruda's pleasantly written monograph on Filippo Lippi (Phaidon; Pounds 95.00, 560pp) is arm-breakingly beautiful at over three kilos. The fault is not the writer's prolixity, but the flashy and wasteful design. At the opposite extreme, modest yet good art-books can cost as little as a tenner. Thames and Hudson's venerable World of Art paperback series costs only Pounds 6.95 as does its wallet-sized New Horizons series, which has serious texts and masses of remarkably good and often unusual images. Van Gogh, Rembrandt, The Aztecs and others would make ideal stocking-fillers. So, too, would the British Museum Press's attractive series on Medieval Craftsmen and Eastern Art (Pounds 6.95 and Pounds 9.95). Sharon Fermor's Piero di Cosimo; Fiction, Invention and 'Fantasia' (Reaktion Books 226pp, Pounds 29) is lucid and absorbing, a book for anyone who wants to understand better the nature of the Renaissance in Florence. Piero, painter of the famous 'Forest Fire' in Oxford, was found dead at the foot of a staircase in 1521. In all the books he is characterised as an odd-ball, an interpretation which rests wholly on Vasari's biography. The wild garden had yet to be invented in Renaissance Florence, yet here was a man who never pruned or hoed, but just let everything grow wild. He lived off hard-boiled eggs, cooking (but not eating) 50 at a time. Piero di Cosimo, as vividly presented by Vasari, was as anti-social and bestiale as Leonardo da Vinci was courtly and refined. These days, art-historians are disinclined to take Vasari literally, and Fermor shows that his life of Piero was written as a cautionary tale. Vasari granted that the misanthrope had great gifts, particularly imagination, or fantasia, in which respect he was like Leonardo who could also see pictures in gobs of spit on a wall. But Piero's relative failure spelled a moral dear to Vasari's heart; artists who wanted to get on had to be urbane and sociable. Fermor sheds light on the meaning of many of Piero's paintings, attractively reproduced. The bare-breasted portrait said to be Simonetta Vespucci is, in fact, a highly erotic Cleopatra. The National Gallery's much-discussed scene is firmly identified as 'The Death of Procris' (below), painted according to a contemporary play. Procris was accidentally slain as a result of her sexual jealousy. Piero's version is dreamy rather than tragic, because in the play Procris is restored to life. Fermor thinks that this edifying tale was just the sort of thing a Florentine would have wanted in the nuptial chamber. Another enjoyable monograph is Judith Leyster; A Dutch Master and Her World, by James Welu and Pieter Biesboer (Yale; 391pp, Pounds 45). This year marked the centenary of the rediscovery of Leyster (1609-60), the Haarlem genre painter who is the second most famous female Old Master after Artemisia Gentileschi. Yet Leyster's success as an independent artist is in a sense more remarkable because she was not the daughter of an artist. The book, which is in fact an exhibition catalogue, presents a well-written and stimulating picture of Leyster's place among artists of the Dutch Golden Age. John Gage's Colour and Culture; Practice and Meaning from Antiquity to Abstraction (Thames and Hudson; 335pp; Pounds 38.00) is a remarkable achievement. It would appeal inter alia to scientists, gardeners, psychologists and designers. Gage explores the vast, limitlessly fascinating subject of Western man's attempts to grasp the elusive nature of colour. Beautifully illustrated and massively learned, this weighty book requires concentration but the effort is amply rewarded. I second my colleague Colin Amery's praise for Timothy Mowl's Elizabethan and Jacobean Style (Phaidon; 240pp; Pounds 29.95), a fizzing polemic which sees Inigo Jones as tantamount to a national disaster. For just the one chapter on how Great Halls of houses like Hardwick were used as theatres, this book would justify its cost. More temperate appreciation of English style comes in Charles Saumarez Smith's Eighteenth-century Decoration (Weidenfeld and Nicolson; 406pp; Pounds 50), a splendid guide to the look of homes from cottages to castles. Another book I will often be turning to over the years is Nicholas Penny's The Materials of Sculpture (Yale; 318pp; Pounds 35.00). Looking at sculpture and carved ornament, how well do we appreciate the challenges which the materials posed their makers? Penny picks and chooses from the art of East and West, helped with sumptuous illustrations. He writes with exemplary clarity. Lastly, two highly readable books on over-worked subjects, cats and love. The world is crawling with cat-lovers whose horizons will surely be expanded by Jaromir Malek's fascinating book, The Cat in Ancient Egypt (British Museum Press; 144pp; Pounds 14.95). This is a lovely book, written so simply that a child could follow it. As for the passion of Jasper and Robert, it and other literary and artistic pairings such as Bell and Grant, Jackson and Krasner, are chewed over in Significant Others; Creativity and Intimate Partnerships edited by Whitney Chadwick (Thames and Hudson, 256pp; Pounds 14.95).</p>

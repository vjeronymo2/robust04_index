			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by (Antonio Paneso); from "Caracol's 0600 to </F> 0900" newscast]    [Text] International treaties are usually agreements  benefiting two parties; one party cannot decide when to comply  and when not to. It seems that this is the case now with an  agreement signed by the United States and Colombia on bases for  the surveillance of drug trafficking.    In this case it was clear that Colombia rendered a service  to  the United States and not the other way around. It would be  preferable for our policy to be increasingly independent,  because those installations are not useful even for monitoring  civilian air traffic in Colombia, rather for rendering service  only to U.S. addicts [viciosos].</p>

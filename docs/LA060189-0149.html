			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'PHANTOM' TICKETS DRAW TOP PRICES  </P> <P> Wanted: Buyers for "Phantom of the Opera" tickets.  </P> <P> "I can't tell you how I got the tickets," said Joan Yeoman of Los Angeles, who  was one of 33 people who put ads in The Times' Sunday edition trying to sell  "Phantom" tickets, "but I'll take the best offer." She, like the many others,  hiked her asking price to $500 a ticket for the hit musical, which opened  Wednesday at the Music Center, but were slowly dropping the price just to sell  them.  </P> <P> "I didn't buy them to pitch them, I bought them as gifts," said Yeoman, who  didn't have to wait in line for her six tickets (face value $50 each). Her  boyfriend knew someone in the business. "But two of the relatives can't go so I  decided to give it a shot. . . . Seeing the show will be great, but selling  them will be even greater, I'm money hungry."  </P> <P> Joe Miller, a salesman at Front Row Center Ticket Service, said tickets to  "Phantom" are very hard to get. His firm was selling tickets in the first three  rows for $200. "I'd say . . . it's the biggest that I can remember. 'Evita' was  big, '42nd Street.' 'Les Miz,' $100 for the first seven or eight rows.  'Phantom' is a much broader demand and broader audience, almost a pop event."  </P> <P> But most Los Angeles ticket brokers said that while the musical is certainly  one of the most popular events to hit the city, they are not so scarce that one  needs to pay more than $200 per ticket.  </P> <P> "The 'Phantom' is doing very well, but it's not a matter of being the biggest  thing to hit town," said a spokeswoman for Equity Theatre Ticket Service. "I  can get a ticket for you for tonight, right now, no problem."  </P> <P> Her asking price was $200 for orchestra. She said people who think they have to  pay outrageous prices are under the wrong impression: "I saw a ticket in the  classified for $5,000, but if you called that guy right now, I'm sure he still  has the ticket. It's not that big of a play."  </P> <P> Mark Wagman of Dynamite Tickets in Los Angeles said there seems to be a greater  demand for tickets for the Laker basketball finals than for "Phantom" tickets:  "We've been swamped all morning," he said Tuesday, when the tickets for the  basketball finals first went on sale. "This makes the 'Phantom' look like  nothing."  </P> <P> A spokeswoman at Good Time Tickets in Los Angeles said people who are  advertising "Phantom" tickets for more than $200 are "crazy," and those who are  actually buying them are "totally insane."  </P> <P> "The tickets are scarce for the month of June and July," she said, "but they  are not impossible to get. . . . To try to sell a ticket for such a high price,  that's really gouging. I would be really curious to see if anyone is really  buying them for those prices."  </P> <P> Many private-enterprise ticket sellers did not want to give their names, but  after calling several the highest asking price turned out to be $750 each for  orchestra seats during a June 2 performance.  </P> <P> One seller who managed to unload his tickets said: "I paid $350 for each ticket  and I barely broke even." His seats, for which he was asking $500, were second  row, center. He added that he will be out of town on the performance date.  "Believe me, I was more than happy just to get rid of them."  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for the "Phantom" said although orchestra seats are sold out for  the show through next week, there are plenty of seats available through the end  of November. The tickets, she said, are $50-$32.50. The play, which set a  record $15.3 million in advance sales, is expected to run two years in Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> "We in no way condone scalpers," she said, "but we cannot stop someone from  buying tickets and turning around and selling them."  </P></p>

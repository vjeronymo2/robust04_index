			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RIGHTIST REGIME FORMED IN ISRAEL;  </P> <P> COALITION: SHAMIR'S NEW GOVERNMENT IS COMMITTED TO EXPANDING SETTLEMENTS AND  QUELLING THE PALESTINIAN UPRISING. U.S. PEACE EFFORTS APPEAR DOOMED.  </P> <P> Just hours before a sundown Friday deadline, caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak  Shamir cobbled together a new government committed to expanding Israeli  settlements in the rebellious West Bank and Gaza Strip and squashing the  Palestinian uprising.  </P> <P> The combination of Shamir's Likud Party, far-right and religious groups appears  to doom already flagging efforts by the Bush Administration to broker peace  talks between Israel and Palestinians.  </P> <P> The coalition marks the first time since 1984 and the turmoil of the Lebanon  invasion that Israel will be ruled by a fully right-wing government. A six-year  era of national unity governments linking Likud with the center-left Labor  Party fell apart over how to resolve Israel's conflict with the Palestinians.  </P> <P> Shamir indirectly referred to the possible discord that might break out in a  government that some describe as the most right-wing in Israel's history.  </P> <P> "I pray that national unity will exist in this government that we are forming  today and that all of us will act together for the Israeli people and the land  of Israel," he said.  </P> <P> Shamir will present his new Cabinet for approval in the Knesset, Israel's  Parliament, on Monday. He is expected to win the support of at least 62 members  in the 120-seat body. The narrow majority may widen if the Agudat Israel, a  hold-out religious party, joins in.  </P> <P> President Bush, flying from Des Moines to Omaha on a political fund-raising  trip, said he is willing to work with the new Israeli government. But he  emphasized that U.S. policy will continue to urge peace talks between Israel  and its foes in the Middle East.  </P> <P> Palestinian leaders reacted negatively to the new government. Faisal Husseini,  a top political leader of the 30-month-old Palestinian uprising in  Israeli-occupied areas, said: "We believe peace efforts will be set back. This  is a government that will put obstacles in the way of talks."  </P> <P> The occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip on Friday appeared to be quiet, however.  Many Palestinians were preparing to watch the opening match of the World Cup on  television and seemed uninterested in Israel's politics of the moment.  </P> <P> Shamir's announcement ended three months of political drift that began when  Labor Cabinet ministers quit a partnership government with Likud because he  refused to accept the terms of an invitation from U.S. Secretary of State James  A. Baker III to hold peace talks with Palestinians.  </P> <P> The new government's guidelines commit Shamir "to strengthen, expand and  develop the settlements" in Gaza and the West Bank. The pledge puts Israel on a  renewed collision course with Washington, which opposes settlements in the  occupied territories as an obstacle to peace.  </P> <P> The Shamir government also affirmed the right of newly arrived Soviet  immigrants to settle in the occupied lands, another point of difference with  the Bush Administration.  </P> <P> (In a Moscow news conference, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev repeated  his threat to act if Israel continues to allow that kind of settlement. But  notably, he did not repeat his threat to halt Jewish emigration.)  </P> <P> Shamir appears poised to take tougher measures to put down the Palestinian  revolt. Israeli soldiers and civilians have killed more than 650 Palestinians  during the uprising, about 150 of them children; 44 Israelis have died at the  hands of Palestinians and about 220 Palestinians have been killed by other  Palestinians on suspicion of collaborating with Israel.  </P> <P> Shamir's government is pledged "to uproot the phenomenon of violence and  disturbances and create tranquility in all parts of Israel."  </P> <P> In an apparent effort to rally wide national support, Shamir said the new  government's main goal is to ensure the smooth welcome for new Soviet  immigrants. About 150,000 are expected to arrive this year alone.  </P> <P> "The major effort of the government will be made on the most important issue we  are facing today, the absorption of the mass immigration," he said. "Together  with that, we'll deal with all the other issues -- advancing the peace process,  solving economic and social problems."  </P> <P> After six weeks of hard bargaining, Shamir ensured that his hold on the prime  minister's post, dating to 1986, continues uninterrupted. His Cabinet lineup  gives key posts to ministers in favor of keeping all the West Bank and Gaza,  and all have spoken against Baker's peace plan.  </P> <P> Among key members of the new Cabinet are Moshe Arens, the former foreign  minister, who will become defense minister; David Levy, the outgoing housing  minister and now foreign minister; Ariel Sharon, former defense minister, now  housing minister, and Yitzhak Modai, former economics minister now in charge of  finance.  </P> <P> In the past government, Levy, Sharon and Modai were known as the "constraints  ministers," or by critics, the "Gang of Three" because they campaigned  vigorously against Baker's peace approach.  </P> <P> Asked in a radio interview if he would encourage the newcomers to settle in the  disputed land, Sharon replied, "Israel is a democratic country. Everyone can  settle where he wants."  </P> <P> Israeli commentators noted that Levy, a native of Morocco, will be the first  Israeli foreign minister not to speak English. On Friday, he pointed out that  he speaks good French.  </P> <P> Rafael Eitan, from the small Crossroads Party, is a newcomer to the Cabinet and  will head the Agriculture Ministry. Another newcomer, nuclear expert Yuval  Neeman, will be science minister.  </P> <P> The commitments made by the new government reaffirm support for Shamir's peace  proposal, which included holding elections for a Palestinian negotiating team.  But top aides to Shamir have hinted that he will try to take the spotlight off  the vote proposal and steer debate to other points in his plan. These include  talks with hostile Arab countries and foreign funding to help Palestinian  refugees establish themselves in neighboring countries.  </P> <P> "We want the plan to return to its original spirit," said Yosef Ben-Aharon, a  senior adviser. Ben-Aharon and other Shamir supporters have accused the United  States of distorting Shamir's effort by only emphasizing elections.  </P> <P> Not all of the Cabinet portfolios have been handed out yet. Religious parties  are still vying for control of marriage, immigration and social matters as well  as funding for education and housing.  </P> <P> One religious group, Shas, reportedly gained control of the Communications  Ministry and Israel's broadcasting system.  </P> <P> During the six weeks of coalition talks, Shamir's continued hold on power  sometimes seemed to depend as much on his taste in seafood as on as his  attitude toward peace talks. One religious leader lambasted him for enjoying  shellfish in disregard for Jewish dietary laws.  </P> <P> Technically, Shamir had until midnight to forge a coalition, but the Jewish  Sabbath began at sundown and any labor done after dark could have lost him the  entire support of the religious parties. He met the deadline by informing  President Chaim Herzog by phone of his success.  </P> <P> As part of the coalition agreement, the government has pledged to ban sales of  pork, a non-kosher commodity that is treated as a delicacy by some secular Jews  in Israel.  </P> <P> The Labor Party, meanwhile, prepared to go into the opposition. Its head,  Shimon Peres, the former finance minister and a former prime minister, will  probably have to fight off a leadership challenge from rival Yitzhak Rabin, who  was minister of defense in the joint government under Shamir.  </P> <P> </P> <P> KEY ISRAELI CABINET MEMBERS  </P> <P>  Here are six of the people in Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's new rightist  government. Several slots have not been announced yet.  </P> <P> Moshe Arens, Defense Minister  </P> <P> Protege of Shamir who served as foreign minister in the past government. Like  Shamir, favors perpetual Israeli control of occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> David Levy, Foreign Minister  </P> <P> Served as housing minister in the last government. Engineered government  financial backing for the controversial purchase of a lease on a Greek Orthodox  Church building in Jerusalem's Old City on behalf of a militant Jewish  nationalist group.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ariel Sharon, Housing Minister  </P> <P> As defense minister in 1982, led Israel into Lebanon invasion. Campaigned for  Defense Ministry job again. Will have special authority to manage fast-paced  arrival of Soviet immigrants and can also possibly channel funds to West Bank  and Gaza development.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Finance, Agriculture, Science.  </P> <P> Three other members are Yitzhak Modai, finance minister; Rafael Eitan,  agriculture minister and Yuval Neeman, science minister. Modai, former  economics minister, once suggested sending Palestinian stone throwers into  exile. In past government, Levy, Sharon and Modai were known as "constraints  ministers" because they campaigned against U.S.-brokered peace plan. Eitan is  from small Crossroads Party and a newcomer to Cabinet. Chief of staff during  Lebanon invasion, he once referred to Palestinians as "cockroaches in a  bottle." Neeman is nuclear expert whose Tehiya Party advocates annexing the  West Bank and Gaza.  </P></p>

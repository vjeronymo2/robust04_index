			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT /POLLUTION TRAP;  </P> <P> DESIGNER SAYS NEW DEVICE SPOTS DIRTY CARS ON ROAD;  </P> <P> WHEN HOOKED TO A CAMERA, IT RECORDS LICENSE PLATES OF EMISSIONS VIOLATORS.  ILLINOIS IS TESTING SYSTEM; CALIFORNIA HAS RESERVATIONS.  </P> <P> Speed traps have long been a spoiler for motorists. Now, get ready for  pollution traps.  </P> <P> Donald Stedman, a University of Denver chemistry professor, spent four days  recently along Chicago's busy Eisenhower Expressway testing a new system that  he designed to spot badly polluting cars as they drive on entry or exit ramps.  </P> <P> Environmental officials here hope Stedman's invention will one day become an  integral tool in the fight against excessive exhaust emissions and reduce the  need for costly and inconvenient emissions testing programs such as those  required of motorists in the Chicago area as well as California.  </P> <P> "This has become so much more compelling now than three weeks ago," said  Stedman, referring to the recent spiraling cost of fuel. A car in need of a  tune-up not only pollutes the air but also uses more gasoline.  </P> <P> Stedman's contraption, known as Fuel Efficiency Automobile Test, or FEAT, beams  an infrared light at tailpipe level across the ramp. A sensor on the opposite  side of the ramp reads carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions of vehicles  that break the beam. Simultaneously, a video camera records license plate  numbers and matches them with the readings.  </P> <P> In theory, the license data would be used to track down owners of any cars  found to be in violation of federal emission standards. They could be ticketed  or ordered to come to a center for further testing.  </P> <P> Previous research with the equipment led Stedman to conclude that a minority of  cars causes the majority of auto-related pollution. He said that about 70% of  vehicles seem to run clean enough to meet government guidelines, 28% sometimes  exceed pollution limits and the rest are always in violation when the motor is  running.  </P> <P> In total, about half of all toxic carbon monoxide emitted by vehicles in the  Chicago area can be linked to a scant 8% of those on the road, according to his  research. Pinpoint the small number of bad guys and you've gone a long way  toward solving the car pollution problem, his methodology suggests.  </P> <P> That's precisely the result that the Illinois Department of Energy and Natural  Resources hopes can come out of Stedman's research, which the agency is  spending $50,000 to fund.  </P> <P> At present, all cars in Northern Illinois must be tested annually at state  drive-in facilities. Stedman and his supporters question the value of such  tests because they are done when cars are idling in neutral and don't  necessarily reflect how they operate under highway conditions.  </P> <P> "This is a split second in time, but it is real time," Stedman said of his  curbside testing device.  </P> <P> Bill Denham, research economist for the Illinois clean air agency, said random  exhaust monitoring with FEAT could be far more effective than the present  system.  </P> <P> "If you take the (on-site) test and the car goes out of tune a day later, the  (clean air agency) won't know it for a year," Denham said. " . . . This gives  us the opportunity to test the car once a day, once a week or once a month."  </P> <P> The cost of the current inspection program -- $23 million a year and rising --  could be halved, according to Denham's crude calculations. More important, it  could bring Illinois' air quality in compliance with EPA standards.  </P> <P> Although Illinois officials see promise in FEAT, not everyone is sold on its  value, including officials in California.  </P> <P> "Unless the test is done with some controlled circumstances, the results are  fallible," said William Sessa, spokesman for the California Air Resources  Board. He cited such variables as a cold car or a car accelerating or  decelerating as potentially skewing on-road test results. Last year, the  California Air Resources Board used Stedman's device to screen cars for carbon  monoxide research, but the test was done under fixed, not random, conditions.  </P> <P> Undaunted, Stedman suggests that his California critics might be motivated by  reasons other than science. "They made a political investment in the program  they set up. They said it works. I'm saying it doesn't," he said.  </P> <P> He does concede that smog and emission control programs like the one now in use  in California were considered state of the art when they were implemented a few  years ago. Even his own device could be "antiquated in five years," Stedman  acknowledged.  </P> <P> "I liken it to the development of the microscope," said Marc Pitchford, an  atmospheric physicist with the Environmental Protection Agency's Monitoring  Systems Laboratory in Las Vegas, who helped Stedman get federal funding three  years ago to build his pollution detector. "It doesn't cure the disease  directly, but it gives us a lot of information to help cure the disease."  </P> <P> If Stedman's research pans out, officials here say, cars zooming along ramps of  the Eisenhower or other expressways could be making recurring appearances on  the pollution watching "candid camera" in as little as five years.  </P></p>

Details in the following report: Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, the  information minister and minister of state for Prime Ministry  affairs, briefed the delegation on the developments in the peace  process since the announcement of the Declaration of Principles  between the PLO and Israel and the impact of this agreement on  Jordan as a result of its relations with the occupied Arab  territories.    He said that developments on the Palestinian-Israeli track  clearly affect the course of Jordanian negotiations and Jordan's  basic interests. He said: We are now coordinating with the  Palestinian brothers in order to unify stands and avoid any  contradictions or negative aspects between the two sides in the  future.    He said that Jordan believes that peace should be just and  comprehensive and that all parties should get their rights with  all due respect and appreciation, especially Jordanian and  Palestinian interests.    Following the meeting, BBC television held an interview with  Information Minister Dr. Jawad al-'Anani.    [Begin al-'Anani recording, in English] You know Jordan was  the only country which opened its borders with the Palestinians  and kept them open since the war of 1967. And, therefore, you  know, there have been cumulative rights over time, there have  been entangled business relations and so on. We don't want to  sound like we are engaging in a tug of war, you know, who should  win the West Bank. But it is not a question either of a zero  option. But we believe that the fact that the Israelis have  complete dominance over the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, by  virtue of occupation, if we can use the word virtue, but at the  same time Jordan seems to be on the paying end of the equation.  [sentence as heard] This development should really be reversed  because Jordan has put a great deal of sacrifice. [end  recording] [passage omitted]</p>

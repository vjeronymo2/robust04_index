			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yngve Hellestol report: "Norway Receives a Reminder Over </F> EEA Rules"]    [Text] EFTA's [European Free Trade Association] oversight  body, the ESA [EFTA Surveillance Authority], has sent reminders  to Norway and most of the other EFTA countries that are members  of the EEA [European Economic Area] that they have not complied  in full with the rules on information contained in the EEA  agreement.    According to the EEA agreement, all EFTA countries must see  to it that national legislation is in line with the EU [European  Union] directives which apply in the single internal market. In  total there are around 460 EU directives that have to be fitted  into national legislation in the individual EFTA countries. It  is EFTA's oversight body (ESA) in Brussels which has the task of  checking that countries actually adjust their legislation.    Each individual EFTA country has an obligation to send  information to the ESA about new legislation enacted and to  enclose the text of new legislation. When the deadline for  sending in this information ran out on 7 March, only Sweden of  the EFTA countries had complied in full with its obligation to  provide information. Norway, together with the other EFTA  countries, was still lagging behind. These countries had  provided about 90 percent of the information they are obliged to  provide. The ESA, therefore, has set a new deadline for 30  April.    ESA president Knut Almestad told AFTENPOSTEN that in formal  terms there has been a breach of the EEA agreement, since the  countries have not sent in the information they are obliged to  send. If the missing information has still not been sent in by  30 April, the ESA will have to give thought as to how to proceed  with the matter -- and consider whether or not there has been a  violation of the EEA agreement.    "A possible step thereafter would be to bring the matter  before the EEA court," he said.    Almestad also stressed that the EFTA countries have done an  impressive job in introducing a large number of EU directives in  a very short time -- directives the EU countries themselves have  adopted over the course of many years.    He said that the ESA will now go through all the material it  has received to see whether the adjustments to legislation that  have been made in the EFTA countries bring national legislation  into line with the EU directives.    The EFTA oversight body (ESA) was set up as a result of the  EEA agreement. The task of the ESA is to check that the EFTA  countries meet the demands and follow the rules contained in the  EEA agreement. Just under 100 people work at the ESA in  Brussels, and the body is headed by Norway's Knut Almestad.</p>

			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORD ON 'TALK RADIO';  </P> <P> ERIC BOGOSIAN FINDS STORY IN THE 'FRINGE ELEMENT' OF THE MEDIA  </P> <P> Once upon a time, "Talk Radio" was a small play that writer-performer Eric  Bogosian and Portland, Ore., artist Tad Savinar developed at the Portland  Center for the Visual Arts, and then moved to Joe Papp's Public Theatre in New  York in 1987.  </P> <P> It gathered attention to itself, but it was benign fame, scaled to the  intimate, often insular theater world.  </P> <P> The attention -- centered on Bogosian, whose reputation was reaching a zenith  after cultivating the New York borderland between performance art and the stage  for 10 years -- was enough to get producer Ed Pressman interested in making a  movie out of what was basically a monologue by a guy behind a mike.  </P> <P> And now, just as Oliver Stone's film version (co-scripted with Bogosian) has  changed the play, so the reaction has changed. "Talk Radio," the movie, is  controversial stuff -- especially on the airwaves.  </P> <P> In the film's opening weeks, it's been difficult to turn on a talk show and not  hear on-air exchanges about it. And it's often the talk show hosts themselves  who issue the most cutting attacks on "Talk Radio" (see Judith Michaelson's  accompanying article).  </P> <P> For Bogosian, a lot of it is hot air.  </P> <P> "To slam a movie about hate radio for fostering hate is like saying that a  movie about the Ku Klux Klan will foster the Klan," he says, adding that the  death threats against Barry Champlain, "Talk Radio's" shock jock, are not the  imaginings of a feverish, Hollywood-inspired imagination.  </P> <P> "A radio host in Pittsburgh showed me written threats he received." Yet to be  completely authentic to all facets of a radio show, Bogosian notes, "would turn  the movie into a stiff. Most radio stations are pretty uneventful."  </P> <P> What about complaints that a Champlain-type host would never get a three-day  notice, as happens in the movie, before getting launched on a national network?  </P> <P> "OK, they got me there," he admits. "We also didn't use the seven-second  delay."  </P> <P> What really raises Bogosian's temperature, though, is the perception that "Talk  Radio" is meant as a representation of all radio.  </P> <P> "Look, part of the media -- TV and radio -- is dominated by self-centered  big-mouths. The Morton Downeys, the Howard Sterns. Those were the guys who  inspired Barry Champlain. But they're a fringe element. We're not talking about  the strait-laced hosts like Michael Jackson or Toni Grant."  </P> <P> Bogosian couldn't resist getting on the "Talk Radio" thumbs-up-or-down survey  trend, and based on what he in half-jest called his "poll," a minority of radio  people are critical of the movie.  </P> <P> "If you poll guys like Barry," he says, "they hate it. Besides, the movie's not  just about radio. It's a portrait of the lost, soulless show business  personality."  </P> <P> Eric Bogosian is in a Beverly Hills hotel suite, and he's trying very hard to  get comfortable. New York-based, he likes to get the material for his  performance works ("FunHouse," "Drinking in America") by, among other things,  dropping in on transvestite bars and Bowery coffee shops filled with hookers  and pimps. His life, he'll tell you, has had its wild passages.  </P> <P> That's the past. He's 35 and married and has a young child. Home is no longer  Little Italy, but the New Jersey countryside. No more the hustle of performance  art gigs in downtown lairs. Now he picks his movies and prepares pieces for HBO  broadcast (such as his upcoming "Sex, Drugs and Rock 'n' Roll").  </P> <P> He roams the suite, pointing his guest to a sofa chair ("You want to sit  here?"), unsure where he wants to sit, circling around the room ("Or how about  here?"). With curly hair, tight jeans and pointed shoes, Bogosian looks like  he's in alien territory, wondering how he got here.  </P> <P> "It's important for my life to run on a few separate tracks," he says, "and one  of them has to be dangerous." He was referring to his visits to deepest Gotham,  an adventure where theater and anthropology meet. "Too many of these hotel  suites, and I'll go soft and run out of things to write about."  </P> <P> Such a crisis seems inconceivable at this point. Bogosian says he has felt such  a "charge" from doing the "Talk Radio" publicity tour that he's finding himself  writing every day -- "something I've never experienced before" -- and sure  enough, there's an electric typewriter next to the room phone.  </P> <P> He has reason to write. As well as "Sex, Drugs and Rock 'n' Roll," he's working  on "Blue Smoke," a screenplay for Universal about New York's jazz underground  in the '50s. He's also looking ahead to an ensemble play based on his youthful  years in middle-class Woburn, Mass.  </P> <P> Bogosian, then, can't be counted among those amazed at Oliver Stone's work pace  -- editing "Talk Radio" while preparing his next film, "Born on the Fourth of  July," for instance.  </P> <P> "He does push it harder than me, though," he adds. "And I found that the  element Oliver and I share is answering the question, 'What do I want to do?'  The work is the important thing."  </P> <P> Stone and he also veer apart in a classically generational way.  </P> <P> "While Oliver was entrenched in the '60s, I came up in the '70s. I'm suspicious  of the Establishment and the anti-Establishment. I'm also not of a school with  a message to send, but of a smaller school which has something on its mind to  talk about for an hour or two."  </P> <P> Bogosian follows up on this, perhaps thinking like the exposed performer on  stage: "My view is to look at yourself, the individual. Oliver's is to look at  society. And there's that conflict in the film."  </P> <P> Stone agrees with this assessment. However, Stone, talking by phone from  Dallas, where "Talk Radio" was filmed and where he is editing "Born on the  Fourth of July," remarked: "I've never worked with anyone who was more intense  than I am. Eric seems to know no limits."  </P> <P> "Talk Radio's" Barry Champlain uses the airwaves as a kind of blunt weapon and  a shield to ward off what really is on his mind. Like shockmeister Howard  Stern, he uses callers as cannon fodder for listeners' entertainment.  </P> <P> The late Alan Berg's biography, "Talked to Death," written by Steven Singular,  was used by Bogosian and Stone as narrative ballast in "Talk Radio's"  stage-to-screen transfer.  </P> <P> Like Berg, Champlain antagonizes the white supremacist group The Order. In real  life, two Order members were given 50-year sentences in December, 1987, for  Berg's 1984 murder in Denver.  </P> <P> That was after Bogosian and Savinar molded "Talk Radio" for the theater. Even  after Pressman became involved and bought the rights to Singular's book for  expanding the screenplay beyond the stage script, Bogosian says that it was  voices such as Stern's and Bob Grant's that remained the key sources for  Champlain's character.  </P> <P> He'll also reveal that Champlain's real father was an outrageous punk-like  persona, named Ricky Paul, whom Bogosian adopted during his days in the '70s  playing tough New York clubs as well as the alternative art haven, The Kitchen.  </P> <P> "I did a verbal assault on the audience, like the punk groups did, only with  words and action rather than guitars."  </P> <P> Bogosian credits, as well, certain artist-friends of his, such as painters  Robert Longo and David Salle, for their various techniques of juxtaposing  seemingly incongruous images. They taught him, he says, "all sorts of secrets  for writing."  </P> <P> Another source was movies -- particularly Elia Kazan and Budd Schulberg's  masterfully caustic tale of TV's early days "A Face in the Crowd." The "Face"  was Lonesome Rhodes, played by then-newcomer Andy Griffith, who turned from a  humble country bumpkin into a monstrous video megastar.  </P> <P> "What disturbed me more, though," Bogosian says, "was Kazan. He wrote,  directed, liked to do it all. I sometimes see myself -- the dark side -- in  him. He ruined his and other's lives more than once. I wonder about the  ambitious artist, devouring everything."  </P> <P> This awareness, he suggests, has come about through a combination of two  factors that ultimately made "Talk Radio": his growing ability to discipline  himself and get down to work, and looking at mass media.  </P> <P> "Our society thinks by way of mass media," he observes, sounding a little like  Oliver Stone. "It isolates us. Yet the good thing about talk radio is that it  brings companionship. I know when I was out alone on the road, that voice  coming over the air was a comfort. Then is mass media destroying relationships?  I don't know. And I don't want to analyze it too much, because my creative  needs come out of emotions, not theories."  </P> <P> On disciplining himself, he digs deeper: "My wife, Jo Anne, used to say about  me that she never knew anyone who did less in a day than I did. I'd get up at  noon because I'd been up all night. And, of course, before writing, it was  essential to hang out with my pals sipping coffee. By the time all this was  done, there was no time to write.  </P> <P> "I hit the saturation point when I married Jo Anne (in 1980). We married right  after we met, and I went right out on a European tour. I had to get it  together."  </P> <P> The next saturation point was when he was performing "Drinking in America" at  Lincoln Center eight times a week. "I thought I could slide like before. No  way. I had to be on. It was like having to perform terrific sex every night at  8. You have to develop an area of calm around that. Now I'm able to write at  will -- almost."  </P> <P> Bogosian admits to enjoying the small storm kicked up by "Talk Radio," and he  isn't shy about acknowledging that he would like to wield some creative power  in Hollywood.  </P> <P> Then he catches himself: "It's not that fame and attention can be temporal.  They are temporal."  </P></p>

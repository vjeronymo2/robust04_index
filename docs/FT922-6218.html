			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Survey of Korea (2): A tale of two Kims - The presidential battle is warming up IT IS fairly easy to predict who will be South Korea's next leader. He will be called President Kim, a former dissident leader and a perennial aspirant for the post. He stood in the 1987 election and lost, but saw his determination rewarded in the 1992 polls. The only question that prediction fails to address is which President Kim it will be: Mr Kim Young Sam, the presidential candidate of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP), or Mr Kim Dae Jung, the nominee of the main opposition Democratic Party. The answer is likely to be determined by the performance of a third candidate in the presidential race at the end of the year. He is Mr Chung Ju Yung, the billionaire founder of the Hyundai business group who recently established the Unification National Party (UNP). Conventional wisdom suggests that Mr Kim Young Sam still has the best chance to gain entry into the presidential Blue House. One factor favouring him is the 38.5 per cent vote share the DLP received in the National Assembly election in March, the largest of any political party. The parliamentary results indicated that support for the government may be even wider. Most of the elected independents, who received 11.5 per cent of the vote, were pro-government conservatives who had lost the DLP nomination in their constituencies. Mr Kim could receive half of the votes if the parliamentary voting patterns are repeated in the presidential election. A plurality of votes is needed to be elected president. President Roh Tae Woo, who is constitutionally barred from standing again, won with 36 per cent in 1987 against the two Kims. The irony with this analysis is that the DLP suffered a humiliating setback in the National Assembly ballot, as their dominant parliamentary position was reduced to a bare majority in the 299-seat legislature. This reflected public dissatisfaction with the faltering economy. The loss could have cost Mr Kim, who managed the parliamentary campaign, the DLP presidential nomination. But he threatened to defect with his 25-member legislative faction from the DLP, which would have deprived the government of its parliamentary control, if he was denied the nomination. His only challenger, Mr Lee Jong Chan withdrew from the race after alleging that pressure was being exerted on delegates by the party's leadership to support Mr Kim. Mr Lee, a popular MP from Seoul, is considering an independent bid that could erode Mr Kim's support and could split the DLP. Mr Kim's great strength is that he represents stability and continuity, which still appeals strongly to Korean voters in spite of their growing disenchantment with the political establishment. His political base is the port city of Pusan in the south-eastern Kyongsang region, the area that has produced all of South Korea's political leaders. Regionalism is highly influential in Korean politics. It appears certain that a President Kim, due to his political weakness within the DLP, would keep in power the senior bureaucrats recruited by President Roh from his native Kyongsang city of Taegu. Mr Kim's handicap is that he has become unpopular due to his political machinations in the last few years. The one-time opposition leader merged his Reunification Democratic Party with President Roh's party to form the DLP in 1990. This helped give the government a parliamentary majority, a position it had lost two years previously. The apparent incentive for Mr Kim's action was a promise that he would be the DLP presidential nominee in 1992. But the public viewed Mr Kim's support of the government as a negation of their democratic will expressed in the 1988 National Assembly elections, a factor that contributed to the DLP's setback in March. Mr Kim could become a victim of rising public cynicism about the country's political leadership. One recent poll revealed that more than half the public was dissatisfied with the two established political parties. It is the main reason why Mr Chung's UNP has attracted considerable support in the few months since its creation. DLP officials fear that Mr Chung's candidacy will split the conservative vote, delivering the election to Mr Kim Dae Jung. Mr Chung is an unlikely candidate to attract protest votes. He is the 76-year-old autocratic founder of Hyundai, South Korea's second largest conglomerate or chaebol. The chaebol are regarded by the public with suspicion because of their close links with the country's earlier authoritarian governments. For example, Mr Chung asked the government to use the police to suppress strikes at Hyundai plants in the 1980s. Mr Chung has still proved adept in tapping the public discontentment about the political establishment. He has adopted an unashamedly populist approach in his well-financed parliamentary and presidential campaigns. He promises to reduce housing rents and reverse South Korea's trade deficit with Japan, the country's former disliked colonial master. He pledges to reform the financial system that has benefited his family. Although government efforts to curb the chaebol are one reason for Mr Chung's new political role, he has recently spoken in favour of limiting their economic power. That sentiment sits uneasily with the UNP's avowed goal of reducing the state's economic controls. 'It isn't business that should be regulated, but government,' said Mr Chung Mong Joon, a son of Mr Chung senior and one of the 32 UNP members in the National Assembly. Mr Chung's appeal reflects national pride. His rags to riches story personifies South Korea's phenomenal growth in the post-war period. He has successfully contrasted the rapid rise of Hyundai into the country's biggest exporter with the government's patchy record on inflation and the trade deficit. 'Many Koreans want to elect a strong leader who will give the country a sense of purpose like President Park Chung Hee did with his industrialisation programme 30 years ago. They see that figure in Chung Ju Yung, who had good relation with Park,' said one Western diplomat. The government's recent attempts to punish the Hyundai companies and the Chung family for alleged financial violations has increased Mr Chung's popularity since it casts him in the role of underdog vis-a-vis the political establishment. The purpose of the government's harassment campaign was to prevent Mr Chung from using Hyundai's considerable financial and personnel resources in his campaign. Some DLP members concede that action was a strategic error. 'We should have tried to accommodate him instead of alienating him,' said one party official. That mistake may come back to haunt the DLP if Mr Chung siphons off enough votes from the ruling party to deprive it of another term in the Blue House. The UNP's voting strength in the National Assembly should make the DLP worry. The UNP transcended political regionalism by doing well in all sections of the country except for the south-western Cholla region, the stronghold of the Democrats. Mr Chung's fortunes could still dim if Koreans decide that they don't want to see big business replace the military as their rulers. It is likely that the other chaebol, fearful of the political influence that Hyundai could have, will persuade their large workforces that it is not in their best interests to vote for the UNP. However, there is little doubt that Mr Kim Dae Jung would be pleased to see Mr Chung continue to chip away at the DLP's strength. The Democrats also benefited from discontent with the government in the National Assembly elections. The party gained 29.2 per cent of the vote, with a strong showing in Seoul in addition to its Cholla base, and increased its parliamentary representation to 97 seats. Mr Kim is doing his best to correct the erroneous impression, the result of the former military government's propaganda, that he is a leftist. His position papers are moderate in tone and he is unlikely to introduce radical reforms if elected president. The prospect of sitting in the Blue House is even encouraging him to mend relations with the military, who kidnapped and nearly executed him in the 1970s. Although the prospect of a military coup if Mr Kim is elected has probably diminished for good in the new democratic South Korea, he is taking no chances by recruiting former generals into the Democratic Party. Mr Kim Dae Jung faces the same problem as the other Mr Kim of being an old face on the political stage. His wisest course would be sit back and hope that the DLP and the UNP tear each other apart, leaving him to pick up the spoils on election day. Mr Kim should not rest too easily given the notorious fluidity of Korean politics. Some analysts expect that Mr Chung, concerned about the possible election of Mr Kim, may eventually withdraw from the race and give his support to Mr Kim Young Sam in return for political favours.</p>

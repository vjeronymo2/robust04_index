			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Technology: Athletes who are dying for glory - Scientists compete with sportsmen to see who can detect and who can hide banned substances WITH millions of dollars of sponsorship at stake, greed will have driven some competitors at this summer's Olympic Games to cheat by using banned substances. Given that the side-effects of such medicines can be fatal, some athletes may be literally dying to win. After the Ben Johnson scandal at Seoul four years ago, when the Canadian sprinter was stripped of his 100m gold medal after testing positive for drugs, the International Olympic Committee's medical commission planned the largest programme ever to catch such cheats. During the Olympics fortnight about 2,000 urine samples will be taken. Athletes will be tested randomly, as well as the first four finishers in each event. Each sample will then be analysed by a new laboratory specially built in Barcelona, with 75 staff working 24 hours a day. The drugs for which the scientists will be looking fall into five classes. They are: Anabolic steroids. These are synthetic derivatives of the male hormone testosterone. They work by boosting ribonucleic acid and protein production, which in turn is converted into muscle. The additional muscle allows for faster recuperation between training, permitting longer and harder training. Stimulants used to invigorate the central nervous system, allowing the body to tolerate higher levels of pain-causing lactic acid created during exercise. Beta-blockers which have a calming effect on heart rate and blood pressure by obstructing the receptors that absorb adrenalin, so reducing its impact. Competitors involved in archery and shooting are most likely to take them. Narcotics and analgesics which act as pain killers, allowing athletes to compete with injuries and reduce the risk of cramps. Diuretics. These remove water from the body and can be used by boxers to lose weight before a fight, or by all competitors to dilute urine in an effort to hide other prohibited drugs. In addition, the laboratory will be looking for masking agents which hide the presence of other drugs. Since the introduction of random sampling in 1986, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) believes it has had some success in reducing abuse. In 1990, more than 71,000 samples were tested worldwide by the 21 laboratories accredited by the committee. Only 932 (1.31 per cent) proved positive compared with more than 2 per cent between 1987 and 1989. Over the same period, athletics achievements have fallen. The results of the top 100 competitors in some events, particularly those involving women, have been disappointing. In women's athletics, for example, performances in throwing competitions such as the discus, javelin and shot, as well as track events such as the 800m and 1,500m, have all fallen by as much as 5 per cent. It is difficult not to conclude that a whole generation of athletics records is corrupt. But while such figures suggest increasingly stringent testing is beginning to have some effect, the potential rewards for successful athletes are so huge that there remains a constant battle between competitors, desperate to improve their performance artificially, and the scientists anxious to catch them. In spite of the technology available, the authorities admit there remains a huge discrepancy between usage and detection. A recent World Health Organisation survey concluded that as many as 20 per cent of athletes have used drugs to boost performance. The survey, which questioned athletes in Australia, Canada, Italy, the UK and US, showed that about six per cent had used stimulants, steroids or diuretics over the previous 12 months. Detection has been complicated by the arrival of a new generation of molecules available to sportsmen and women who want to cheat. There is now little need for athletes to use easily detectable synthetic substances which are becoming obsolete. Instead they can use natural molecules already found in the body. So, if few athletes are tested positive over the next two weeks, it may not be a sign that the scientists are winning, but merely that athletes are becoming more sophisticated in their drug taking. One of the natural substances is erythropoietin, known as EPO, which is a natural hormone essential in the production of red blood cells. It is normally produced by the kidney but is also manufactured artificially by Amgen of California. By taking EPO, athletes boost the number of red blood cells that carry oxygen and so boost stamina. Tests in Sweden by Bjorn Ekblom, professor of physiology at the Karolinska Institute, show that performance in endurance events can be improved by 10 per cent when using EPO. Another substance increasingly being used is natural testosterone which is found naturally in both men and women. Detecting both testosterone and EPO poses problems for scientists. Old-style tests, which used to produce a simple response of either negative or positive, are no longer sufficient. The problem is not testing for them, since they are naturally present, but rather working out what the normal level should be. Test results are now the subject of acrimonious debate as scientists and lawyers dispute what represents a normal hormone balance. When examining testosterone levels, the International Olympic Committee and International Amateur Athletics Federation have both decided to compare them with those of epitestosterone, another naturally occuring hormone related to testosterone production. If testosterone levels are six times those of epitestosterone, the competitor has probably been taking the hormone. One potential way of by-passing many present problems is to introduce tests on blood rather than urine. In theory blood should be easier to analyse. Sports administrators are investigating the possibility, but there are religious and cultural problems in implementation. However, Michele Verroken, head of the doping control unit at the UK's Sports Council, warns that blood testing is no panacea. At present, scientists are used to dealing with waste products. With blood testing, they would have to look at a far greater number of intermediate products. She argues the results would be far from straight-forward. The efforts of scientists are hampered not only by new drugs but also by the failure of the relevant authorities to deal with the drugs problem adequately. Most experts believe testing during competitions is a waste of time because athletes are aware that they will tested. This gives them time to stop taking the drugs and clean out their bodies. The sports authorities are only beginning to come to grips with out-of-competition testing. However, not even this is always effective. Tests are often announced in advance, giving time for sportsmen to use a catheter to clean their bladder or for a woman to conceal a condom with clean urine. At times there also appears to be a lack of political will from the sports federations. Germany's Katrin Krabbe, the world champion for 100m and 200m, and Butch Reynolds, the American 400m world record holder, were banned by the International Amateur Athletic Federation, only for them to be reinstated by their national authorities. Michele Verroken says one of the main priorities is to close the loopholes in drug-testing procedures. Such loopholes have allowed competitors, such as Krabbe, to escape a four-year ban on a technicality. Admittedly, testing is expensive. In the UK alone, the doping control programme cost more than Pounds 700,000 last year, a 60 per cent increase on the amount in 1988, the last Olympic year. But doping costs more than money. The athletes who use drugs risk more than ban. They risk their lives. The West German heptathlete, Birgit Dressel, received more than 400 injections as she moved from 33rd to sixth in the world rankings. It took three days for her to die from toxic poisoning from the cocktail of drugs inside her body. Drugs hurt not only competitors but sport, too. Drug abuse is only likely to disappear when society and sponsors place less emphasis on winning. And that is only likely to occur when the public kicks its own addiction to sport.</p>

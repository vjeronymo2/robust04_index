			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Dalgety sells US business for Dollars 138m Dalgety, the UK food and agribusiness group which is focusing on its pet food and food ingredients divisions, yesterday sold part of its US food distribution business for Dollars 138m (Pounds 86m) cash. The buyer is ProSource, a distribution subsidiary of Onex Corporation, an Ontario-based investment company. ProSource, which already serves 5,000 restaurants, is acquiring the National Accounts division of Martin-Brower, one of the biggest food distribution companies in North America. Dalgety will realise Dollars 47m after discharging liabilities of Dollars 91m. It will use the money to reduce its borrowings, which rose sharply to Pounds 127m at the end of June. Mr Richard Clothier, chief executive, said the group was retaining the McDonald's side of Martin-Brower, which accounts for 60 per cent of the business. 'This is very much a specialised service for McDonald's', he said, adding that each year it delivered 120m cases of goods, including food, packaging and cleaning materials, to more than 4,000 restaurants. National Accounts carries out much the same service, but to 10 smaller restaurant chains. In the year to June, National, which has net assets of Dollars 32m, made profits of Dollars 6.3m on sales of just over Dollars 2bn. Mr David Parker, ProSource chairman, said that the acquisition would strengthen joint capabilities in the Dollars 124bn-a-year US food distribution industry. Last September Dalgety reported that operating profits from US food distribution were 15 per cent up at Pounds 16.4m, benefiting from higher sales to McDonald's and other customers. Mr Clothier said the disposal would be only marginally dilutive of earnings. Since the financial year end Dalgety has sold its Dutch savoury snack business to United Biscuits for Pounds 21m and bought two Spanish pet food companies for Pounds 17m. It was interested in buying DCA, Allied Domecq's food ingredients subsidiary which was sold on Monday to Kerry, the Irish food group, for Pounds 265m. Mr Clothier said Dalgety was unwilling to match Kerry's offer. If there are no further deals, Dalgety expects gearing at the end of the current financial year to be below 20 per cent, down from 33 per cent at the end of June. At the annual meeting yesterday, Dalgety reduced the employment contracts of the executive directors from three year to two year rolling notice periods. Mr Clothier said: 'We as directors were willing to acknowledge that three years did seem unnecessarily long. We have respected the viewsof a number of shareholders.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Galkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 3 TASS -- Russian deputies have  recommended the soonest ratification of the Treaty on  Commonwealth Economic Union at today's parliamentary hearings in  the Federation Council, the upper parliament chamber.    Russia is the only Commonwealth state that has not ratified  the document. The hearings confirmed that the document  corresponds to the Russian interests and aims to form common  economic space in the Commonwealth to be based on market economy  principles.    The Russian government is offered to work for the creation  of  a free trade zone, customs and payment unions proceeding from  the need to settle credit, monetary, currency and financial  relations with the Commonwealth republics.    Russian vice-premier Aleksandr Shokhin told correspondents  that hundreds of Commonwealth agreements are inefficient. A new  working body of the economic union should help to elaborate and  implement cooperation documents, he said. Organizational  economic structures of the Commonwealth are too weak, and Russia  supports the initiative to create an inter-state economic  committee, added Shokhin.</p>

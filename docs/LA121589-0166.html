			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MEN, TOO, ARE GOING FOR AN OLD SMOOTHIE  </P> <P> Even before Little Lord Fauntleroy flounced through 19th-Century storybooks in  a black velvet suit with lace collar -- a get-up which quickly became a symbol  of the quintessential sissy -- many men have shared a certain sentiment about  velvet, the lush, plush stuff that's the current word in women's holiday dress.  </P> <P> "Ugh," groans John Abajian, 41, a Costa Mesa jeweler, for example. "Never in my  entire life would I wear velvet. And my wife wouldn't let me either. People  would think I have a problem."  </P> <P> Elena Martinez, 25, a Brea telephone operator, clarifies the "problem."  </P> <P> "Velvet's beautiful, but too feminine," she says, adding that neither she nor  any of her friends would "ever in a million years" go out with a man clothed in  the sensuous fabric of ultimate luxe. "It's not for a man man image, you know?"  </P> <P> Nobles of generations past -- and fashion arbiters today -- may beg to differ.  </P> <P> With sexy vests, crested slippers, host coats, bow ties and suspenders that go  partying at night, this season stylish men all over are going soft on velvet.  </P> <P>  Far from Scarlett O'Hara's dress of drapes, and South of the Border Day-Glo  paintings, the velvet creations in which these samples of suave can relax or  entertain are some of the smoothest, most elegant ever.  </P> <P> But then, velvet has always meant savoir-faire.  </P> <P> Romeo wooed Juliet in tights and a velvet jerkin. Henry VIII ruled while  gussying his girth in a gold-embroidered gown with fur collar and lining -- a  gown of the most sumptuous velvet available. That old French roue, Louis XIV,  wasn't appropriately clothed unless his ensemble -- lace cravat, fur muff and  beribboned cane -- included velvet coat and breeches tied at the knee.  </P> <P> And then no self-respecting 19th-Century English gentleman, said by a fashion  observer of the day to be "the noted elegant of the world, imperturbable,  ironic, a graceful model for aristocratic bearing and behavior," would feel up  to snuff without a velvet-collared Chesterfield coat.  </P> <P> Even the most macho of men, the Spanish bullfighter, historically wouldn't  dream of ceremoniously entering the ring naked of his capa de paseo, or velvet  bullfighter's cloak.  </P> <P> Men of power, pride and, not incidentally, pampering knew what velvet was  about: luxury.  </P> <P> And whether it's Ralph Lauren's double-breasted host coat and Church's  hard-soled slippers -- for the most conservative and elegant of men -- or  Kathrine Hemnett's skintight vest and stretch leggings -- for hipsters of a  trendy bent -- today's velvet clothes and accessories continue the tradition of  styling party-goers and stay-at-homers in unabashed extravagance.  </P> <P> "Velvet on men, especially during the holidays, is always so elegant, so  sophisticated," says Carol Horowitz, vice president and general manager of  Neiman Marcus at Newport Center Fashion Island. "There is nothing more fabulous  than a man in a velvet smoking jacket."  </P> <P> Still, there are men unimpressed by velvet's pedigree.  </P> <P> "I wear cowboy boots and Wranglers every day and if I wore a velvet anything I  wouldn't feel right," says Manual Garcia, 42, a Santa Ana messenger. About the  only man I know who could pull it off is the guy in (Gainsborough's) painting,  "The Blue Boy."  </P> <P> Dan Woods, 33, a Laguna Beach psychiatric nurse, wouldn't feel himself in the  traditionally formal fabric either. "Unless it was a Halloween costume," he  jokes, finding velvet fairly gross and "old." "It reminds me of something  tacky, from the '50s, and if I wore it my friends would call me an old man."  </P> <P> Sure, the material's bad rap may result from associations with lizard-friendly  lounge booths, unctuous crushed tuxedos and singer Mel Torme, dubbed "The  Velvet Fog."  </P> <P>  Or, as it strikes Huntington Beach veterinary assistant Lori Struck, 18:  "Velvet, you think of drapes -- old, old drapes." Asked if there would be  nothing more fabulous than her boyfriend in a velvet smoking jacket, Jeremy  Runyan, 19, of Orange, is fairly repelled.  </P> <P>  "No way! He'd die. Velvet's so disco," she says. "When you think of it you  think greasy John Travolta in 'Saturday Night Fever' or (one-time teeny-bopper  heartthrob) Shaun Cassidy in a jacket that kind of, like, shines. Yuck!"  </P> <P> Of course, there are those of rather different opinions, shoppers snapping up  the velvet jackets, slippers, vests, suspenders, bow ties and other items that  fill stores during the holidays.  </P> <P> "Many of these are special items that sell out very fast," Horowitz says. After  all, during these festive days when dressy occasions reign, "velvet has always  been a classic, for men as well as women," says Wilmer Weiss, a senior vice  president and fashion insider at I. Magnin/Bullocks Wilshire.  </P> <P> Velvet is special, indeed. And whether a man steps out suave in a sumptuous  smoking jacket, shows up smooth in regally crested shoes or shimmies into hip,  sexy leggings, he will be following a tradition established early in the  evolutionary chain of chic: when nobles, kings and cavaliers -- veritable  peacocks of power and persuasion -- draped their frames in the most extravagant  fabrics of the day.  </P> <P> "Guys should really enjoy wearing velvet around the holidays because it's  simply a lot of fun," says John Slater, in his mid-40s and manager of the  Polo-Ralph Lauren Shop at South Coast Plaza.  </P> <P>  Of course, he adds, "It takes a guy very self-confident to wear it. The type  who knows he looks good in clothes, knows he's a fashion statement, perhaps. A  leader."  </P> <P> But, hey, Rodney Rivers, 27, a Newport Beach milliner, will be progressive this  holiday season.  </P> <P>  "Yeah! I'll wear velvet," he says. "You don't see it too much, but when you  do, you say, 'Yes sir, there's man of the world who knows how to dress. Who  understands fine quality.' Velvet's not that common, but then, good taste isn't  that common either."  </P> <P>  And anyway, notes Bernadette Arellano, 20, a Laguna Beach sales assistant at  the Nature Company store in Costa Mesa -- and a woman of obvious taste, "Velvet  on a guy looks so cool!"  </P> <P> Colette O'Connor is a regular contributor to Orange County Life.  </P></p>

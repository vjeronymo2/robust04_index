			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Business Law: A case of good timing over VAT THERE ARE few opportunities more welcome than that of using someone else's money, free of charge. When that opportunity is offered by the government to exporters of goods in the form of a cash refund of tax not yet paid, it would be madness not to take advantage of it. This has certainly been the view of a number of manufacturing exporters in relation to value added tax and, until Customs and Excise attacked the Philips Electrical group of companies, at the end of 1989 the arrangement apparently worked well. How that arrangement operated demonstrates a principle of VAT which is of interest and potential benefit not just to exporters but to all those who pay it. The events which followed the attack on Philips reveal a good deal of confusion in VAT administration policy. The scheme, if it can be called that, used the simple mechanics of VAT to achieve a substantial cash flow benefit. It works as follows. A business which sells goods only to UK customers taxes those sales at the standard rate of 17.5 per cent. It will pay over to Customs the tax which it charges and collects (output tax) having first deducted from that payment the amount of VAT paid to its own suppliers on purchases and other expenditure (input tax). A business which sells goods for export does not charge VAT on those sales (they are zero-rated) but can claim back its input tax from Customs, ie, it receives repayments of VAT. The difference between the two types of businesses is that an export business can claim its VAT repayments monthly, whereas most businesses which have to charge their customers VAT make returns and account for VAT quarterly. A company which makes both standard-rated sales in the UK and zero-rated export sales would normally make three-monthly VAT returns. Such a company can improve substantially its cash flow by selling the exports through a subsidiary, registered separately for VAT. The export company then makes monthly returns, claiming repayments of the tax charged to it on sales by the parent, up to 10 weeks before that same tax has to be paid by the parent to Customs and Excise. The advantage to be gained by doing this was recognised by a number of companies as long ago as the early 1970s when VAT was first introduced in the UK. They have operated the system successfully since then, and with at least tacit approval from Customs and Excise evidenced by their discretionary agreement to the use of monthly returns. However, for reasons that have never been made clear, Customs took exception to the scheme operated by Philips. Philips' appeal went first to the VAT Tribunal where Philips lost; then to the High Court in May last year where Customs conceded defeat having agreed the tribunal's decision was wrong. At the same time, Customs asked the judge, Mr Justice Roch, to give his view on the critical point of the tribunal decision - whether or not Philips had made a 'supply' to the export company. Originally, Customs had informed Philips that there was in its view no supply of the goods to the export company and the supply for export was in fact made direct from the manufacturer. Thus there was no tax to be charged between the companies and no claim to input tax to be made by the export company. The tribunal supported Customs, saying that if the export company did take ownership of the goods at all, it was for so fleeting a moment as to be compared with an inter-city express train passing through a station. There could therefore be no supply made under those conditions. In the High Court the matter was settled by consent, leaving Philips to continue with the scheme subject to agreed conditions. In the judge's opinion there was no requirement in the VAT legislation as to the length of time for which a transferee should have ownership of the goods to establish that a supply had been made to him. He went on to make the incisive comment that any other interpretation would create considerable difficulties in the levying and recovery of VAT, particularly in chains of transactions where title might pass instantaneously through a number of persons. There is much to be read between the lines in this case. It is clear from their conduct of the case that, having argued the point successfully at the VAT Tribunal, Customs suddenly realised that the decision would cause enormous administrative difficulties. This shows an unexpected lack of foresight in a department responsible for an important part of government policy. In any event, there was a clean and simple alternative for Customs. Monthly returns are allowed at the discretion of the commissioners and, if they wished to make Philips an exception to the generally permissive treatment accorded to exporters, the commissioners could have directed Philips Exports Ltd to make quarterly returns. This would have largely erased the cash flow benefit of the scheme to the company. To reverse that direction, Philips would have had to show that the commissioners were behaving unreasonably in denying them the monthly facility. What then prompted Customs to take the action they did? To understand their position, it must be appreciated that the VAT timing point used in the export scheme is a general feature of the UK VAT system and can provide a benefit even without intentional arrangement. As the quarterly tax periods allocated to businesses for VAT accounting are not all coincidental (Customs could not cope with 1.4m returns at one time) there are three different quarterly return groups, the maximum variation in period ends being two months. In large commercial transactions, particularly property transfers, this can be important because the VAT charge on a sale can be a cash flow cost or a benefit, depending upon whether the vendor must account to Customs for the output tax before or after the purchaser obtains the benefit of his claim to the input tax. There have been wholly contrived cases, which have demonstrated the timing point only too well and have rightly been stopped. There was, for instance, the enterprising individual who registered two businesses with conveniently overlapping VAT periods. He then 'sold' an article of jewellery at a grossly inflated price from one business to the other, thereby creating a charge of VAT which could be claimed as input tax and banked for the remaining time before it was to be paid over as output tax by the 'vendor'. Nevertheless, it must be said that, in general, Customs have never been too happy when the timing works against them, despite the rigidity of the tax point regime which they insist must be observed by taxpayers. When VAT was introduced on land and buildings in 1989, it was pointed out to the department that businesses might suffer if they had to wait for three months to claim the substantial input tax on the purchase of new premises. At that time, Customs said that they would consider making early repayments of tax in such cases, before the normal quarterly period end. In reality, the position is quite different. Businesses which make unusual claims to repayment of tax must undergo time-consuming credibility checks even where the claim is made at the normal time. These will frequently involve visits from the local VAT office before their claims are approved for payment. Some of those checks are to ensure that the vendor has properly accounted for the tax which includes a check on the due date for payment. This attitude is an unnecessary source of annoyance, as well as cost, to the trading community. On the whole, the VAT system works to the advantage of the Revenue. However, the system which provides for easily administered, self-assessed tax collection at each stage of the journey from production to final consumer inevitably contains in its structure benefits for some taxpayers. This should be accepted by Customs. Further, the civil penalty system, progressively introduced since 1985, allows for little or no mitigation when errors or defaults are made by taxpayers. It is tempered only by a concession that in cases where Customs are extremely late in making repayments Customs will pay a compensation supplement. Because these sanctions against underpayment of VAT are heavily biased in favour of the Revenue it is hard to see the justification for tilting the administrative balance of the collection system any further in favour of the department. If a realisation of that fact was at least part of the reason for Customs withdrawing from the Philips case, it would be an encouraging sign of as yet unseen maturity in the administration of VAT.

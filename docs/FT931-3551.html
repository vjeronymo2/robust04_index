			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / More heavy job cuts expected soon at Daf A FURTHER round of job cuts at Leyland Daf is expected in coming weeks as the receivers cut excess stocks and bring vehicle output into line with forecast demand. Several hundred jobs are thought to be on the line. The administrative receivers of Leyland Daf, the UK subsidiary of Daf, the Dutch commercial vehicle maker which collapsed into receivership six weeks ago, last month cut 1,715 of the company's 5,500 strong UK workforce. Mr Murdoch McKillop, joint administrative receiver, said yesterday the company was 'likely to be trading in receivership for months rather than weeks; we must make sure that the balance between sales and production is correct.' The company had 'twice as much free stock as we should have' he added. 'Our stocks must be much leaner and we must make sure that things are in balance.' All three Leyland Daf plants were back in production, and the receivers are studying what level of output could be sustained in the present market. The truck assembly plant at Leyland, Lancashire, was producing 100 to 125 trucks a week of which around a third would be accounted for by Leyland Daf's two military truck contracts from the UK Ministry of Defence. Van output is running at 230 to 250 a week. Mr McKillop warned it was unlikely that there would any funds available for payment to unsecured trade and other creditors of Leyland Daf 'The question is what will be the shortfall to the syndicate of banks,' he said. The most advanced plan for rescuing the constituent parts of the Leyland Daf operations concerns the proposed management buy-out of the van business based in Birmingham. 'I think there is a good chance that something will happen,' said Mr McKillop. 'They have had encouraging discussions with institutions. I would hope to be able to formalise plans in the next few weeks. 'Now that we have stabilised production, we are looking at keeping the operations running for as long as it takes, for months if necessary.' Mr McKillop has held talks with Paccar, the North American truckmaker, to explore its interest in the Leyland truck plant, but and a management buy-out is being explored. The future of the UK truck operations is complicated by the continuing confusion over its future relations with Daf Trucks, the new Dutch/Belgian company formed to take over the core medium and heavy truck operations of the old Daf group. The success of a management buy-out or outside acquisition of the Leyland plant appears to hinge on its ability to gain access to Daf Trucks' Continental dealer network for sales of its UK-built 45 series light truck range.</p>

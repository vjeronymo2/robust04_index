			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Dividend deficit If the actuaries are right, UK pension funds' heavy exposure to equities is starting to look excessive. Dividends are not growing fast enough to keep pace with liabilities. At best, contribution holidays will end sooner than anticipated. If the worst comes to the worst - which may be only a couple of years of low dividend growth away - some companies will have to make up pension fund deficiencies out of profits. Little wonder that the great and the good of the profession are sounding warnings. Most immediately at risk are companies with 'mature' pension schemes - paying more to pensioners than is covered by contributions from employees. The engineering and metals industries are the obvious sectors here. Redundancies and early retirements in the service sector, though, will spread the problem. Simple arithmetic dictates that making up pension fund deficits will take a big slice out of some companies' profits. And the practice of valuing pension schemes every three years points to some nasty surprises to come. One answer may be for mature pension funds to switch some cash from equities into bonds, which are a better match for their liabilities. Yet fund managers will be wary of an investment strategy which leaves them exposed to surprise bouts of inflation. Index-linked gilts may be a more palatable solution since they provide guaranteed cash flow and protection against inflation. Little surprise, then, that the government has found ready buyers for index-linked since Black Wednesday. The risk for the stock market is that pension fund managers might all jump at once. Since pension funds own about Pounds 200bn of UK equities, even a 10 per cent shift into bonds would act as a serious drag on prices.</p>

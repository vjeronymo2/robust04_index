			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Personal insurers close to settlement INSURERS who underwrote a Pounds 20m personal accident policy for Mr Robert Maxwell could reach a settlement within the next few days. Representatives of Lloyd's syndicate 782 and the Continental insurance company - representing insurers who underwrote the policy - met with Willis Wrightson, the brokers acting on behalf of the Maxwell companies named on the policy last week. The insurers stand to pay out the full Pounds 20m only if it can be proved that the publisher's death was due to an accident. 'I believe they have not been able to do so positively at this date,' Mr John Fisher, claims manager of syndicate 782, told Reuters yesterday. A report, prepared by Dr Iain West, an independent pathologist, and commissioned by the insurers, has not determined conclusively how the media magnate died when he went overboard from his yacht last November. If the beneficiaries fail to prove their case the insurers are likely to seek a negotiated settlement for a smaller sum. 'Although it would be wrong to prejudge what will happen it is not necessarily pay or don't pay,' Mr Roger Rich, of Rich Wheeler, the loss adjusters, which is acting on behalf of the insurers, said yesterday.</p>

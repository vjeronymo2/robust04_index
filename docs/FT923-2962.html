			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Why mortgage rates and pasta might be cheaper: Peter Martin answers questions about the impact on the UK of Italy's devaluation and Germany's interest rate cut Q. What does this mean for my mortgage? A. UK interest rates are now less likely to go up than they were before the weekend. But only a little bit less likely; sterling still remains weak and interest rates have to be kept up to protect it. The chances of a UK interest-rate cut in the immediate future do not look high - but the next move in mortgage rates is now more likely to be down rather than up, and there's an outside chance that they'll be lower before Christmas. Does Italy's devaluation make it more or less likely that Britain will follow suit? By itself, Italy's devaluation would have made it more likely that sterling would eventually have followed the lira down within the ERM. Once the markets scent blood, they are merciless. Germany's interest rate cut, though, more than offsets that psychological impact. The direct effect of lower German rates is to make holding sterling marginally more attractive than it was before. The indirect effect is more powerful; by signalling that German interest rates are now past their peak, it breaks a vicious cycle of expectations. Why was the Bundesbank rate cut so small? It was a grudging gesture by a group of men under pressure. The Bundesbank had made it clear that it wanted to wait until German inflation was really beaten, some time next year, before cutting interest rates. Mounting political pressures - from Bonn, from Brussels, and from the other 11 capitals of the community - would probably not have been enough to make Buba budge. But by Friday, with the Bank of Italy running out of reserves and the onus increasingly shifting to Germany to prop up the lira, the Bundesbank was running out of options. It could have pressed for a lira devaluation without an accompanying cut in D-Mark interest rates, but that would have given fresh ammunition to the No camp in the French referendum debate. It would also have left the lira (and sterling) exposed to further selling pressure by speculators who thought the Italian gesture wasn't enough, and that would have left the Bundesbank back where it started. What is the outlook for sterling? It closed yesterday at just about DM2.81, two pfennigs lower than it was before people learned how small the German interest-rate cut was, two pfennigs higher than it was on Friday. It's now three pfennigs above its ERM floor. That's a comfortable margin, but another bout of bad news about the UK economy, or any indication that the Bundesbank is having second thoughts about lower interest rates, could nail it to the floor once more. Norman Lamont, UK chancellor of the exchequer, is likely to want a period of stability at or above the pound's current levels before cutting interest rates - and he may let other countries, such as France, take the plunge first. France has indicated that a cut is likely after the Maastricht referendum. Is this going to help the recession end? The UK recession will end when consumers start buying again, when companies recover their nerve about investing, and when world demand picks up. All those need lower interest rates. Germany's cut yesterday morning helps - but much bigger cuts, closer to home, may be necessary to kindle a real recovery. If Italy can devalue, why can't we? For two reasons: John Major is now publicly committed to zero inflation, which devaluation would make harder to achieve; and the Treasury doesn't think devaluing would make it easier to cut interest rates, which is its immediate objective. Should I hope for a Yes or No vote in France on Sunday? Politics aside, that depends whether you think Britain would be better off outside the ERM. A No vote would make it much harder for the UK to maintain its current ERM exchange rates, and perhaps for the system to survive in its current form. A Yes vote would make the ERM more robust, and increase the likelihood of eventual European monetary union. It might also ease short-term pressure on the pound. In the end, though, politics are what count. If you want a closer, Maastricht-style European union, hope France says Yes; if you want to go slower, and are prepared to take the risk of a breakdown of the EC, hope for a No vote. If the French vote No, will any of the weekend's events matter? Even if the French vote Yes, will we be back in the same situation in a few weeks? If France votes No, this weekend's excitement won't help much. The lira will again come under pressure, and so will other weaker currencies such as sterling. Ministers and central bankers will find themselves back in the same weekend crises. If France votes Yes, the underlying problems won't go away. Italy will still have to cope with its budget deficit; the UK will still have to find a way out of recession; the tension between the dollar and the D-Mark will still spill over into the ERM. And everyone will be waiting for the next German interest rate move. Who has made money out of recent events? Anyone who had a short position in the lira will have made a profit. That includes anyone who's been delaying paying a bill in lira to an Italian company, and it includes Italian companies that had shifted any spare funds into D-Marks or Swiss francs. Of course, it also includes the big players in the currency markets, the banks. Other winners include investors whose portfolios of shares or bonds are worth a bit more after yesterday's lukewarm rally. In the UK, that mostly means the funds in which our pension money is invested, and the insurance companies that invest our endowment policy premiums. Should I take a winter break in Italy? Will pasta be cheaper in the supermarket, Fiats cheaper at the garage? Because Italy's inflation rate has been higher than that of its neighbours, it's been a very expensive place for holidays. It's now a bit less costly - but economists reckon a 15 per cent devaluation would have been needed to bring Italy's costs in line with those of other European countries. That means it's half as over-expensive as it was. The cost of Italian goods in British shops will depend on the pricing policies adopted by the people who make and import them. Over time, they'll probably be less expensive than they might otherwise have been. Do events mean that the Dollars 2 pound was with us as fleetingly as the English summer? The pound/dollar exchange rate is now the result of two calculations: the pound/D-Mark rate and the D-Mark/dollar rate. In the first of those, the pound has strengthened very slightly. In the second, the D-Mark has weakened noticeably, and will drop a lot more once the markets think German interest rates are really moving down a long way. Given the Bundesbank's view of the world, that will not happen for some time. The Dollars 2 pound may have gone for the moment; but the bargain-basement dollar is with us for some time to come. Was this a success for the ERM or a failure? It was a success for the way the ERM was originally supposed to operate  - a relatively smooth downward adjustment of a currency under pressure. It was a failure for the recent view of the ERM as a sort of dress rehearsal for monetary union, in which parity changes were to be avoided at all costs.</p>

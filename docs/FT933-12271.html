			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / How To Spend It: At last, the perfect shirt - Lucia van der Post finally tracks down an elusive fashion classic ANYBODY WHO has ever searched for the perfect white shirt will know what an elusive little number it is. If the cotton is perfect then the collar is wrong. If the collar is right then, nine times out of 10, the cuffs are too mean or the sleeves too narrow. And if everything is perfect then chances are the price is too high. When I last went hunting for the perfect white cotton shirt (in February last year), looking for one where every single detail, from the placing of the seams, the choice of buttons, the quality of the cut and the stitching had been scrupulously attended to, it took quite a trawl but I did eventually find one. It cost Pounds 100 - a sum that in my view verges on the improper for something as simple, as basic, as everyday as a plain white shirt. Anybody who is still on the trail might like to know about Workshop. Workshop sells nothing but shirts - overshirts, tie-shirts, collarless shirts, striped shirts, pirate shirts, what it calls 'the ultimate big shirt' - you name it, Workshop sells it. And in there among the more colourful numbers is what I think is the perfect white shirt. Although in our photograph, as in the catalogue, it is lime green, it also comes in plain white as well as khaki, flame, fuchsia, lilac and navy. Crisp, beautifully cut with good generous double-cuffs, it costs just Pounds 45. Mostly Workshop sells by mail order - its full-colour, beautifully illustrated brochure is available by calling 071-498 5878. Each shirt arrives beautifully boxed and Workshop promises to despatch all orders within 72 hours of getting the order. Other shirts to look out for are the 'ultimate big shirt' - in linen as well as cotton, it comes in a brilliant blue as well as green, rose, purple, yellow, white and khaki and sells for Pounds 69.95 in linen and Pounds 39.95 in cotton. There is also a collarless overshirt made from a herringbone weave linen/cotton mixture of beige and grey with a matching shorter waistcoat that is perfect summer city wear - cool, chic and could be teamed with trousers or skirt. Pounds 145 for the pair (they are only sold together). For those who want to see the shirts before they buy there are now two shops  -20 Regent Street, Cheltenham GL50 1HL and, the latest addition, Workshop at 52 Bow Lane, London EC4M 9ET. Both stock all the shirts in the catalogue and also a few extra designs, too.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hamdan al-Hajj] </F>   [Text] Sources at the French Embassy in Amman reiterated  France's position, which supports and understands the Jordanian  proposals on stopping naval inspections off the Port of  al-'Aqabah and moving the inspections into the port while  maintaining the effectiveness of trade sanctions imposed on Iraq.    In an exclusive statement to AL-DUSTUR, these sources said  France supports in principle inspections on land, saying this  will ease the economic burden on Jordan caused by ship  inspections in the Red Sea.    These sources called for expediting measures to end the  restrictions imposed on free navigation into the Port of  al-'Aqabah, and pointed out His Majesty King Husayn's position  on this subject, which calls for lifting and easing these  measures before Jordan returns to the negotiations table.    The sources emphasized that France has held several contacts  with Jordan on this issue in its capacity as a country directly  concerned in this subject, in addition to contacts France has  conducted with European countries and the United States in order  to reach an agreement on the ideal way to carry out inspections  and ease the burden on Jordan.</p>

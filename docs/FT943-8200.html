			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: Glencar placing and offer to raise IPounds 2.9m Glencar Explorations, the Dublin-based mineral exploration company, is making a IPounds 2.94m (Pounds 2.9m) share placing and open offer. The move is being carried out to fund an increase in Glencar's equity interest in the Wassa project in Ghana and its other exploration activities. Glencar is placing 6.36m new ordinary shares at 33p each, of which, subject to certain conditions, 5m will be placed with Bermuda-based Emerging Markets Gold Fund. The 1-for-10 open offer, if fully subscribed, would result in the issue of 2.55m shares. Assuming the offer is fully subscribed, EMGF will hold about 14.5 per cent of Glencar's enlarged equity and will be entitled to appoint a board representative.</p>

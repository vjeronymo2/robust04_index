			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / People: Sir William Ryrie to join Barings Sir William Ryrie has chosen the central role for what looks like being an active life back in London following his retirement as chief executive of the International Finance Corporation, the private sector finance arm of the World Bank. Sir William, a former second permanent secretary to the Treasury who devised the 'Ryrie rules' which govern investments by nationalised industries, is to spend three days a week helping to develop Barings' international businesses. The appointment will include a seat on Barings' main board. Sir William will devote most of his time to encouraging Barings' ventures in emerging markets such as the Asia Pacific and Latin America. Sir William, who is 64 and took over as IFC chief executive in 1984, has developed IFC lending to an expected Dollars 2.4bn this year despite some overlap with the relatively new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Sir William said yesterday that flows of investment from Europe and the US had grown continuously over the past decade and there was 'no doubt barring some extraordinary catastrophe that they will be the strongest markets in coming decades. 'It will be nice to come home,' said Sir William, who expects to be appointed to 'one or two other boards' in addition to his role at Barings. He hopes for a 'little less vigorous life' than at the IFC, despite the appointments. Andrew Tuckey, Barings' deputy chairman, said the bank hoped that Sir William would provide particular impetus to securities distribution in emerging markets as well as helping to develop primary issue and corporate finance activity. 'To some degree he will have an ambassadorial role, but we also want him to contribute to hard decisions about what markets we should be in or issues such as whether we should develop business by taking on local partners,' he said.</p>

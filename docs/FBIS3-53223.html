The French prime minister, who has been in Saudi Arabia for  the past few days at the head of a military-economic team,  hopes, by offering easy payments terms and bilateral oil deals  in future, to encourage the authorities in Riyadh to sign three  trading and military agreements with France. [passage omitted]    Yet, the Saudi defense minister has so far told the French  that their easy terms were not sufficient and that his country,  because of the falling oil prices, had to think long before  signing any new agreement.    Meanwhile, the British defense minister, who is currently in  Saudi Arabia, is trying to clarify the outcome of the agreement  for the sale of 48 Tornado planes signed two years ago. [passage  omitted]    The British officials fear that because of its shrinking  budget, which mainly affects military expenditures, Saudi Arabia  may cancel its military contracts and in return the British  military industries may face a serious crisis.    Political pundits believe that though the fall in oil prices  can help Western countries out of their economic recession, it  may, as a by-product, confront the Western military industries  with a crisis. [passage omitted]    So long as the West uses various levers to keep oil prices  at  a low level, oil producing countries will be forced to slow down  their purchases from the international market. Such a  consequence is a major tragedy for the Western arms industries.    Thus, the fall in oil prices is a two-edged sword in the  hands of the Western countries; they will have to clarify their  position with regard to that sword.</p>

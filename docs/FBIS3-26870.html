We are especially happy that Vice  Premier Zhu Rongji and some state ministry and commission  leaders also are present at this tea party and have joined the  Sichuan people in celebrating the Lunar New Year Festival. This  has demonstrated that the CPC Central Committee and the State  Council have been greatly concerned with Sichuan. On behalf of  the Sichuan Provincial CPC Committee and the Sichuan Provincial  People's Government, I would like to take this opportunity to  extend warmest New Year greetings to Vice Premier Zhu Rongji and  to all the state ministry and commission leaders here present,  and to wish them a happy Lunar New Year, good health, and good  work. I also would like to extend Lunar New Year greetings to  the Sichuan people and the Sichuan-based PLA units.    In his speech, Governor Xiao Yang recalled some major steps  taken and some important achievements scored by the people of  all nationalities in Sichuan under the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and of the party's basic line over the past  year, saying that the Sichuan people have successfully seized  each and every excellent opportunity to deepen reform and expand  opening up, pushed forward economic and social growth in an  expeditious manner; and successfully built a socialist market  economic structure. After expounding on a series of major tasks  and goals set for the year 1994, Governor Xiao Yang concluded  his speech by saying: The new year 1994 is one full of  opportunities, challenges, and hopes. Let us unite more closely  and join the people of all nationalities in Sichuan in carrying  out down-to-earth work, bravely making explorations and forging  ahead, making more progress, and striving for a brighter future  under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade  Jiang Zemin as the core!    Lieutenant General Zhang Zhijian, political commissar of the  Chengdu Military Region, also spoke at the tea party, extending  Lunar New Year greetings to the party and government leaders of  Sichuan Province and the city of Chengdu, to people of all  nationalities who have been diligently working on various fronts  in Sichuan, to the families of glorious revolutionary martyrs,  and to both soldiers and demobilized soldiers who have been  transferred to civilian work.    Comrade Zhu Rongji, member of the CPC Central Committee  Political Bureau Standing Committee and vice premier of the  State Council, delivered a speech at the tea party. He said:  Comrades, Happy Lunar New Year! I am very pleased today to  attend the 1994 Sichuan Provincial Lunar New Year Tea Party. I  would like to take this opportunity to extend -- on behalf of  the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the leaders of  State Council departments who have come with me to Sichuan --  festival greetings to the Sichuan Provincial CPC Committee and  People's Government; to the leaders of all party, government,  military, and mass organizations who are present at the tea  party; to veteran comrades who have made enormous contributions  in different historical periods; and to all PLA officers and  soldiers, as well as the Sichuan people! I wish all of you  happy Lunar New Year! I also wish all of you good health, good  work, and happy family!    Vice Premier Zhu Rongji went on: In 1993, guided by Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, Sichuan forged ahead energetically and scored  phenomenal achievements on all fronts. Last year, Sichuan not  only witnessed fast-paced national economic growth, but also  handled properly the relations between reform, development, and  stability to a certain extent, thus conforming with both the  work principles formulated by the CPC Central Committee and the  overall national interests. The CPC Central Committee has  called for seizing each and every excellent opportunity to  deepen reform, expand opening up, push ahead with development,  and maintain stability. Sichuan's enormous achievements have  been fully affirmed by all the State Council department leaders  who have come with me to Sichuan this time. After going back to  Beijing, we will study conscientiously the demands you have  raised this time, and will take practical steps to help you  resolve problems. I believe that led by the CPC Central  Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core and by the  Sichuan Provincial CPC Committee and People's Government as  well, the Sichuan people surely will be able to score greater  achievements in the year 1994! I wish all the comrades present  at this tea party good health! Thank you!    A number of excellent entertainment performances were staged  at the Lunar New Year tea party.</p>

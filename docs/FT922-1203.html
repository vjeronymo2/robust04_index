			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Arts: Today's Television Yet more new series start tonight. In Fighting Back Lynn Redgrave, who seems to have made something of a profession of fighting her own flab, interviews 'a celebrity' (the BBC's word) about a serious illness they have suffered. She begins (7.30 BBC1) with Mike Nolan, singer with Bucks Fizz, whose head injury in an accident resulted in epilepsy. Esmonde and Larbey, authors of 'The Good Life', have written a second series of Hope It Rains (8.00 ITV) in which Tom Bell plays the manager of a waxworks museum in a seaside town whose life has been turned upside down by the arrival of his god-daughter. Immediately following is another new half-hour sitcom: Land Of Hope And Gloria (8.30 ITV). Gerald, 16th Viscount Debleigh, a widower, lives in the family stately home under the thumb of his old nanny. Along comes Gloria Hepburn, a thrusting American Ms, as business manager. Culture clash. It is a good night for secret agent freaks. Timewatch is devoted again to a European terrorist network called Gladio (8.10 BBC2) and BBC1 begins a six-part series, CIA, about America's Central Intelligence Agency.</p>

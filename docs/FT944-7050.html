			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Increased production fails to prevent motor trade deficit doubling The motor industry's balance of trade deficit nearly doubled last year to Pounds 5.1bn from Pounds 2.8bn in 1992, John Griffiths writes. The deterioration came in spite of UK vehicle production reaching its highest level for 20 years. It was caused mainly by vehicle markets in continental Europe suffering one of the steepest falls since the second world war. This restricted UK exports, while simultaneously focusing Continental manufacturers' attention on the UK vehicle market, the only significant one in Europe to experience growth last year. Car exports by value increased 10 per cent to Pounds 4.5bn, including a rise of 57 per cent in the value of exports to non-European Union destinations and a reduction of only 1 per cent to other EU states. This was more than offset by car imports, which rose 21 per cent in value to Pounds 7.9bn. The total value of exports, including commercial vehicles and parts and accessories, fell 1 per cent to Pounds 11bn, with exports outside the EU rising 36 per cent to Pounds 3.6bn. However, total imports rose 16 per cent, to Pounds 16.1bn. The deficit is expected to have fallen during this year, mainly as a result of continuing recovery in continental Europe.</p>

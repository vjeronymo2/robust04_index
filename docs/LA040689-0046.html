			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> SENATE TO BEGIN MINIMUM WAGE DEBATE  </P> <P> Senate Democrats invited a showdown with President Bush over the minimum wage,  agreeing to take up a House-passed measure the President has repeatedly said he  will veto. The Senate debate begins today, and the Democratic leaders hope by  week's end to send to Bush legislation that would raise the minimum wage 30  cents an hour higher than the President has said he will accept. The Democrats'  version also includes a sub-minimum wage for newly hired people that falls far  short of a six-month sub-minimum Bush has insisted must be part of the bill.  The Senate bill actually due for debate today is one sponsored by Sen. Edward  M. Kennedy (D-Mass.). His measure would raise the hourly minimum wage from  $3.35 to $4.65 by January, 1992, and there would be no provision allowing a  lower wage to be paid to new hires. But Kennedy aides said he has decided to  offer an amendment making his measure identical to the House bill passed two  weeks ago, which has a final target of $4.55 and would allow employers to pay  new entrants in the job market a sub-minimum wage for two months.  </P></p>

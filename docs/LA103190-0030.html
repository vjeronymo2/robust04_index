			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECRETARY OF STATE;  </P> <P> FLORES SAYS EU WAIVED CAMPAIGN FINES INVOLVING POWERFUL FIGURES  </P> <P> Secretary of State March Fong Eu has waived more than $4 million in fines  against political candidates and special interest groups over the past six  years, including politically connected Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, Drexel  Burnham Lambert and Griffin Homes, according to records and statistics compiled  by Republican challenger Joan Milke Flores.  </P> <P> Flores, who obtained the information under the California Public Records Act,  charged Tuesday at press conferences in Sacramento and Los Angeles that the  four-term incumbent has gone easy on "some major players in the political  process." She also accused Eu of attempting to conceal the records until the  final weeks of the campaign.  </P> <P> "After being stonewalled and misled by the secretary of state's office since  the beginning of August and finally having to threaten the secretary of state  with legal action, we were allowed to review the central waiver file late last  week," Flores said.  </P> <P> Anthony L. Miller, Eu's chief deputy who oversees the waiver of fines, said  Tuesday that until recently he had been unaware that the staff kept a central  file, which consists of handwritten index cards on each fine and waiver dating  back several years. He said Eu has treated all violators the same, waiving or  reducing fines for offenses that were deemed inadvertent, regardless of the  offender's political connections or influence.  </P> <P> Among other duties, the secretary of state enforces filing deadlines for  financial disclosure statements required from candidates, political action  committees, major contributors and lobbyists. The official also has the  authority to reduce or waive the fees for "non-willful" violations.  </P> <P> On Monday, Eu demanded that the attorney general file criminal or civil charges  against Flores for missing a filing deadline for financial disclosure  statements. Eu's campaign accused Flores of filing several days late "in a ploy  obviously calculated to conceal for as long as possible" the $418,000 in  contributions she collected in October.  </P> <P> Eu, who has reduced fines against her own campaign committees, has argued in  the past that she cuts fines because most violations involve innocent mistakes  by campaign volunteers who are new to the political process. By releasing  information from the central waiver file Tuesday, however, Flores moved to  dispel the notion that all beneficiaries of Eu's policy have been political  newcomers.  </P> <P> "There always will be some people who will take advantage of the system, and  for those people we need to have fines, and they need to be enforced," Flores  said.  </P> <P> Records released by Flores show that Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, the insolvent  thrift headed by Charles Keating, was fined $2,380 in 1986 for failing to  disclose on time $26,500 in contributions made in 1985 to the California  Republican Party, Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale) and the California League  of Savings Institutions.  </P> <P> Eu's office reduced the fine to $50 after receiving a waiver request from James  Grogan, identified as the thrift's corporate counsel, according to the records.  </P> <P> The records also show that Drexel Burnham Lambert was fined a total of $21,260  between 1986 and 1988 for missing various deadlines, including failure to  report on time more than $18,000 in contributions in early 1987 to Los Angeles  County Supervisor Deane Dana, Alameda County Supervisor Ed Campbell and others.  Eu's office reduced those fines to $350, according to a tally of the violations  compiled by Flores.  </P> <P> Griffin Homes, one of Southern California's largest developers, was fined  $35,348 over the last three years, according to Flores' research, but the fines  were reduced by Eu's office to $380. Last year, the Fair Political Practices  Commission imposed a record fine of $47,000 against the developer for making  campaign contributions through its employees and failing to disclose itself as  the source of the money.  </P> <P> Miller acknowledged that Flores had found a potentially explosive issue by  linking the waivers with such individuals as Charles Keating and "junk bond  king" Michael Milken of Drexel Burnham Lambert. Keating faces charges in  connection with the failure of Lincoln and Milken pleaded guilty to six felony  counts involving insider trading and conspiracy to defraud investors.  </P> <P> "This has become sort of a 'Willie Horton' to us because people can point to  Charles Keating and others who have gotten off pretty leniently," said Miller,  referring to the celebrated case of Horton, a convicted murderer, which helped  derail the presidential bid of Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.  </P> <P> "This whole flap . . . is going to cause us to re-evaluate our procedures,"  Miller said. "The (FPPC) has never said we are not doing the right thing, but  clearly maybe we should have been more diligent on some of these folks."  </P></p>

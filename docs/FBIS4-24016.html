			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town June 20 SAPA -- The National Party's [NP]  priority was to play a constructive role in the government of  national unity and make it succeed, NP leader F W de Klerk said  on Monday [20 June]. Facing questions from the media on his and  his party's new role at a NP briefing, he said he was impressed  by the commitment of all the new cabinet members to ensure that  the government of national unity was a success.    He refused to evaluate the performance of individual members  of the cabinet, but said he had sympathy with any new member.  "It takes some adaptation--even a change of portfolios makes  heavy demands in getting to know your officials and to get on  top of issues."    The NP's newly constituted 60-member Federal Council had  just  held its first meeting where the party's goals as South Africa's  second largest party were set out. The NP was still committed  to the present electoral principle of proportional  representation but had charged a commission to look into  possible changes in the electoral system. He hoped the next  election would be held on the basis of electoral lists compiled  through proper registration procedures.    Asked about charges that he had snubbed invitations to  attend  certain functions, Mr de Klerk repeated that he had had prior  engagements and that he did not believe in cancelling one  engagement in order to accept another, later, invitation.    "But there is an element within the ANC -- and it is their  right -- who see me as the enemy and will do anything to harm  me. My co-operation is fully constructive but I am also leader  of the NP and not invited into the government. I am there  because I was voted there by four million people and because the  constitution says I have a right to be there."    He was not there as part of president Nelson Mandela's team.  "I do not think I should attend functions of a party political  nature of other parties as a regular exercise."    He was comfortable with his new role. He had prepared  himself for it psychologically before the election, "and besides  it was our party's policy that there should be powersharing".    Mr de Klerk gave oblique approval to the removal of the  Verwoerd name and bust from Cape Town's ministerial headquarter  buildings. He would personally not like to have his ministerial  office in a building named after the leader of a political party  about which he had very negative feelings. Name-changes in  general should however not develop into a rampage of pulling  down statues. "Name changes are in general a very emotional  issue, one cannot write or decide history out of existence."</p>

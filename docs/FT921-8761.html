			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Reports - the undercover story / Diary of a Private Investor I bought the shares. In October last year, while browsing through the FT's share price pages, I noticed that Treatt had a capitalisation of Pounds 7.34m with a share price of 78p. But what did the company do? I reached for my copy of The Corporate Register (published by Hemmington Scott every six months for Pounds 135 per annum - but many public reference libraries have a copy). It said that Treatt's main business was supplying and lending essential oils and aromatic chemicals used as flavourings and fragrances. It also provided the names of the company's directors - plus the company's address. I wrote to Treatt's company secretary requesting a copy of Treatt's latest published annual report to shareholders. The secretary sent the report by return of post. It had a lovely colour photo on the inside front cover. Two men and a woman - each in white coats - were standing on top of a giant orange, from which was spurting a fine spray of orange juice. The photo had formed part of Treatt's trade advertising campaign. That was the only photo in the report - no boring pictures of directors sitting behind desks. The report was clear, concise and provided the sort of information I like to see - such as the market value of freehold property being 'considerably in excess' of the value given in the balance sheets. The directors had a large shareholding in the company. Therefore, they had a vested interest in seeing that the company's share price performed well. None of the directors received a grossly inflated salary and staff costs and staff numbers seemed to be under control. The company was not overloaded with debt. Treatt also had considerable export sales and more than half its turnover was achieved outside the UK. Profits seemed reasonable and the chairman's statement was encouraging. The company 'continued to invest' in 'sophisticated production' equipment. A new company, Florida Treatt, had been established in the UK - its products being 'used to improve the aroma of concentrated orange juice which loses some important flavour components during production.' I thought of all the other products that could do with aroma enhancement. The market is vast. Why does mass-produced bread not only taste like cardboard but sometimes smell more like vinegar than bread? Grapefruit juice in cartons rarely has the tangy smell of grapefruit. Strawberries seldom smell like strawberries. Treatt was in an ideal niche industry for growth. The company's shares have now risen to 110p and its capitalisation to Pounds 10.4m. Thinking about Treatt made me look back over the past 12 months at all the companies I had written to asking for a copy of their latest published annual report. I was rather amazed to discover that I had contacted 207 companies. In each case, wherever possible, I had written to the company secretary by name, having gained this information from the Corporate Register. Most companies responded within a week - some by return of post. Whereas Treatt's report had cost 41p for them to post, the average postage cost had been 49p. Among the lowest postage charges had been Radiant Metal (18p) while Electra Investment Trust's report cost Pounds 1.35 second-class. Not every company responded immediately. For example, I wrote to JS Pathology's secretary on July 15, but received no reply. I wrote again on October 24, mentioning my earlier letter and again requesting a copy of the annual report. Instead, on December 11, I was sent a copy of the company's interim statement which revealed profits after tax down from Pounds 1.137m to Pounds 488,000. I was not surprised. I have not invested in JS Pathology. While most companies accompanied their reports with a compliments slip some, such as Hartstone Group, and United Biscuits, sent a personal letter, accompanied by additional information. The style of the reports varied considerably. A sentence such as: 'A solution to the Zakharov equations describes the electric field intensity in the ionosphere due to electro-magnetic driving by the Arecibo antenna' (in Logica's report) is hardly as enticing as 'When a customer speaks, Safeway listens' (Argyll's report), but allowances have to be made for the differences in products - computer systems and consultancy and supermarkets  -and the type of investor the reports seemed to be aimed at. It is also interesting, having piled up all 207 reports and skimmed through them again, to see how they have changed. Some companies which used to highlight increased profits over the previous year now highlight increased turnover instead, or a five-year track record, or pointedly state that 'gearing is controlled.' The message has got home that many investors are concerned about company indebtedness. Why had I requested 207 company reports? Partly out of curiosity and partly for possible investment purposes - although the actual number of companies I will invest in is very small. Sometimes I was just checking to see if certain big shareholders had increased their stake in the company. There are some institutional investors who are worth following if they have acquired 3 per cent or more of the company, while others indicate that the company is best avoided. Here are some of the reports I will put in my 'further consideration if the market drops' file: the companies are soundly managed, have good assets, acceptable debt levels and reasonable prospects - but present political and general economic uncertainties make me reluctant to invest too much in equities. One activity that ought to be a growth area is automatic postage franking machines, where letters are weighed and franked with the correct postage. A number of the reports arrived franked with too high a postage rate for their weight. In these difficult economic times, perhaps more companies should consider using lighter paper for their reports. One report of only 42 pages cost 75p to post, simply because of heavy paper. Some longer reports cost far less. My wife has devised a new game with the reports. We look at the photos of company chairmen and directors and try to guess their ages. It is startling how many look much older than their years - is this what corporate life in Britain does to them?</p>

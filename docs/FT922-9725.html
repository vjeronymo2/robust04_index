			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Two more charged with corruption in Milan TWO LEADING figures in the Italian construction industry were yesterday added to the lengthening list of those charged in connection with the two-month-old Milan corruption scandal. Magistrates ordered the arrest on corruption charges of Mr Mario Lodigiani, vice-president of the construction company of the same name, one of the country's best known, and Mr Roberto Schellino, formerly technical manager of Cogefar Impresit and chief executive of Iacorossi, a Milan general contractor. Six prominent people involved with the Milan construction business have already been charged on various counts of corruption. The latest arrests confirm that Milan magistrates are beginning to allege a direct link between the large number of public works contracts awarded in the city over the past decade and an elaborate system of pay-offs also involving the funnelling of funds to political parties. Italy's overall balance of payments deteriorated sharply in the first quarter, according to official figures. The L737bn (Pounds 333m) deficit compares with a L7,778bn surplus during the same period last year. The deficit has been blamed on a big rise in capital outflows and a decline in the level of inflows, especially in March, the month before the general election.</p>

			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Judgment reserved in Bank notes case Judgment was reserved yesterday in the Bank of England's High Court action to recover up to Pounds 600,000 allegedly stolen from its note destruction depot. The Bank is bringing the action against three former employees and their spouses. Mrs Christine Gibson is alleged to have smuggled thousands of notes out of the Essex depot in her clothing. All insist that the money, allegedly taken between 1988 and 1992, came from legitimate sources. Judgment will be given on Tuesday.</p>

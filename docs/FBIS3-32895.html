His duties will involve the promotion and  protection of human rights, including the right to development  and the conception of suggestions to improve its implementation.    Upon expressing gratitude for the appointment, Ayala Lasso  requested the support of all governments and invited them to a  sincere dialogue. He also pledged to be objective and impartial  in all situations and with all states.    The new high commissioner reaffirmed the universality,  indivisibility, and interdependence of human rights, although he  pledged to pay attention to national and regional  characteristics and to historic, cultural, and religious  traditions. Ayala Lasso also issued a warning to his own  country, Ecuador.    [Begin Ayala Lasso recording] In the performance of my  duties, I will be objective and impartial in all situations and  with all states, but as an irrepressible expression of love for  my people, which I will soon cease to represent at the United  Nations, I will be particularly harsh in the execution of my  duties, to ensure that Ecuador's conduct with regard to respect  for human rights will be flawless. [end recording]    The Ecuadoran diplomat will have the rank of UN assistant  secretary general. His mandate will last four years as of 28  February, and he will be based in Geneva.</p>

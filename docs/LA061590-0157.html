			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RADIO RANCH WINS 3 CLIO AWARDS FOR ADS  </P> <P> There may be one thing funnier than the name Dick Orkin's Radio Ranch: its  radio spots.  </P> <P> That, at least, was the opinion Thursday night of those judging one of the most  coveted awards in advertising -- the Clio Awards. The Los Angeles production  company walked off with three Clios. That led all other West Coast competitors,  although the New York office of the Venice agency Chiat/Day/Mojo also won  three.  </P> <P> Two other Los Angeles firms won two Clios each for their radio spots -- Cashman  &amp; Associates and Hill, Holliday, Wakeman, DeForrest. The campaign that won  honors for Hill Holliday is for PacTel Cellular. In the ad, a fast-talking guy  without a car phone wonders out loud why another guy with an MBA -- and a  PacTel car phone -- gets more respect than he does.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most familiar radio spot that won for Dick Orkin's Radio Ranch is  one that features a man who takes his grandmother to Disneyland. In the spot,  the man keeps trying to persuade his gung-ho grandma that she is too old to hop  on the park's Splash Mountain ride.  </P> <P> Why does humor seem to always win the most Clios in the radio category?  </P> <P> "There isn't much else you can do if you're going to deal with peoples'  emotions," said Orkin. "People respond to humor. It touches something very  human in them."  </P> <P> This marks the second consecutive year that Orkin's 20-year-old production  company has won the most radio Clios in the industry.  </P> <P> "Clients like it when you win awards," said the 54-year-old Orkin, "but if  their sales don't improve, we know they won't come back to us."  </P> <P> But plenty of clients are coming back. Recently, the production company  expanded into consulting and radio production services. "We're just beginning  to grow," said Orkin.  </P> <P> The Clio Awards have grown too. But some advertising executives say the highly  profitable competition has lost some stature in recent years since it has added  so many new award categories. But Clio officials point out that the number of  entries increases annually too. That includes a combined 25,000 entries  submitted in the print, radio and package design categories. The Clios for the  best TV ads of the year will be handed out Monday evening.  </P></p>

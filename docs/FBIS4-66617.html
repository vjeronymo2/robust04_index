			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mouloud Benmohamed: "The Lambese Prison: The </F> Scenario for the Breakout"]    [Text] About fifty prisoners freed! A day of reprieve.  Lambese experiences an extraordinary morning. Or rather, it  would be an extraordinary day.    An extraordinary morning for those who will be with their  loved ones on the day of Aid El-Fitr. They are pleased even if  they are not happy.    An extraordinary day for the others. For the prison guards.  For the director of the Lambese prison. For the people of the  "village" of Tazoult. For everyone. Except the dead: one guard  dead, three wounded, another about whom there is no word.  Regarding the attackers, no one can come up with a figure for  dead and wounded.    Extraordinary too because the main gate of the most famous  and feared prison in Algeria will once again close behind behind  the approximately 50 pardoned prisoners only to be reopened with  fire and blood a few hours later thanks to the help from  accomplices.  <H5>  Five Accomplices? </H5>   Presumably the escape plan was based--at a minimum--on five  prison guard accomplices.    Who are they?    They were guards who had recently been transferred.    Three came from Barika. Two of them were reported to be  closely linked to the main organizer of the breakout from the  Barika prison. They were reported to have asked to be  transferred before it happened.    At the time of the attack, according to testimony given and  statements made, the five accomplices were situated as follows.    The first--who was not on duty at the time of the events and  was supposed to be in the dining hall to break the fast--went to  main gate No. 1 to kill his colleague in order to take the keys  away from him and open the gate.    Two others--on duty--were several meters above, i.e., at  main  gate No. 2, which provides access to the detention areas. One  was beside this gate, the other on the enclosure wall was  talking and perhaps waiting for the signal.    Last, two others were on duty in the corridor leading  directly to the cells of prisoners sentenced to die, the cell  blocks, and the common rooms.    The possibility cannot be excluded that there were even more  accomplices because certain guards--who were on leave or on  duty--have not returned to their posts.    A sixth--who was at the observation post to the right of the  main gate-- was kidnapped or taken hostage. He put up courageous  resistance until he had no more ammunition.    What was the attackers' main objective?    It would seem that the objective was--mainly--freeing the  death row inmates who were transported by truck and vehicle.  Next the other prisoners who had been sentenced by the special  courts and those common criminals were sent in the direction of  the moutains--a road different from the one taken by the death  row inmates. Some of the escapees did not even see these  vehicles. That is to say that special treatment had been  anticipated for the death row inmates.    Tracer bullets were fired at the time of the attack and at  the end of the breakout to allow the armed groups that had taken  over Tazoult's streets to regroup. There were also tracer  bullets, several local residents emphasized, at the time the  police arrived and at whom one group of attackers fired several  kilometers away from the prison.    Let us remind our readers that security forces were  prevented  from intervening by vehicles (with their tires blown out) placed  in two different locations located on two arteries leading to  the prison. These were private passenger cars, one bulldozer,  and triangular nails.    One reeducation guard stated: "One member of my family was  accompanying me to the prison where I was supposed to go on  duty. I was dressed in civilian clothes. As we were driving  there, we were stopped by a false roadblock. Some armed men made  us get out. They put the car in the middle of the road after  blowing out its tires. I do not know if I would be alive if they  had asked to see my identification papers. They sent us away...  I was supposed to go to work. I took a path through the fields.  As I was walking, I saw about 50 armed men talking... This was  before the call to prayer. They were at the valley. They didn't  say anything to me... Yes, the vehicle was recovered by the  member of my family."    On the side of Tazoult that local residents reached in  vehicles, it was the same story except that the vehicles were  used to transport the prison escapees in the direction of the  edge of the forest. Drivers did not hand them over willingly.  "There was a gun to my head," one of them said. Some are  reported to have found a thank-you note at the end of the  operation for "assistance rendered" to the attackers!    How was the most spectacular attack and breakout in our  country organized? Was there passivity? Negligence? The  commission of inquiry will certainly reveal this. But "when you  smell a rat," as the popular saying goes, nothing is impossible.    How did the prison guards react? Let us say only that the  law  prohibits them from taking action outside the prison.    Let us also say that inside the prison, they are really and  truly...unarmed. Some time ago certain foreign voices thought  that Algerian prisons were places of torture and extortion. And  to think that the guards are not even armed!    What is more: the guards who have to ensure security on the  enclosure wall and warn of any revolt had...10 bullets each. Was  this negligence? Sloppiness? Complicity? Not at all. "A quantity  of munitions only to maintain order," we were told. "Events"  that have taken place in the prisons of other countries have  left hundreds of fatalities. Even though they are not attacks!  At Lambese, there were no reports of wounded or dead among the  prisoners. There is no end of questions. It is hard to answer.  Except if you opt for suppositions. Still, a trustworthy source  from outside the prison who asked to remain anonymous stated the  following, among other things: "Information circulated that the  strike would happen a year ago. Fortunately the prison  administration changed certain members of the staff who were  suspect. District police and the gendarmerie brigade were looked  at. The prison, too. We learned that the movement began in the  cells and ended outside, contrary to what has been said, namely  that the gate was opened. That is not true. It might be that  there was a signal from the prison, you can see the  mountains.... There are signs...some very serious negligence.  There was passivity involved, not to mention complicity..."    What was happening outside before, during, and after the  breakout?    Armed men had encircled Tazoult, which was completely under  their control. One prison guard reported as follows:    "These were strangers. With guns in their hands, they  ordered  us not to move. People everywhere were taken by surprise. They  told us: `Stop,' 'Hands up,' `What's your profession?,' `On the  ground,' `Crouch,' `Lie down flat, stomach down.' We stayed that  way about two hours. None of us could say a single word. `We're  brothers, Mujahadeen,' `Pray for us' they said to old women who  were going to the mosque. People didn't understand a thing. It  was a surprise. There were rounds of shots a bit further away.  Everywhere there was something odd. We hadn't understood  anything about what they wanted."    After a moment the guard went on as follows: "It was  terrible. I cannot sleep any more... If one of them had searched  me, he would have found my professional card, then shot. No one  could say a word. We were crouched down, we had our hands up or  we were lying on the ground... Ever since we have not eaten, we  cannot sleep any more, we are anxious. The colonial enemy did  not do this."    During this time, "most of the troop" was in the vicinity of  the prison. At exactly the same time the prison guards broke  their fast.   <FIG ID=JPRS-NEA-022-05A>      The door to the place where the </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-NEA-022-05B>      Management entrance.

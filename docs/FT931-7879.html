			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Conferences and Exhibitions (4): Making the most of a stand / A look at the role of the organiser MANUFACTURERS always face a challenge in selling their products, and in a recession the challenge becomes even harder. One popular marketing method is to exhibit at trade fairs and public showcases - but exhibiting is only half the battle. 'At a trade fair every single one of those visitors is there for a purpose - because it is his, or her, line of business. The visitor is already demonstrating an interest by being at the exhibition,' says a leading exhibitions organiser. But there is more to exhibiting than watching visitors collect leaflets and the business of turning visitors into sales contacts is itself big business. There is a lively market in offering back-up services to exhibitors, from advice on how to present a stand to following up contacts after the show is over and helping them to achieve maximum publicity. The biggest of these service providers is Blenheim which, in spite of the recession, saw pre-tax profits rise 31.8 per cent to Pounds 37.3m in the 12 months to the end of August 1992. Blenheim organises exhibitions in the UK, US, France, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands and south-east Asia; the sectors it covers range from clothing and textiles to information technology. Organisers say their business has been resilient - exhibitions accounted for an estimated 9.3 per cent of UK media spend in 1991, up from 4.7 per cent in 1981 according to the Exhibition Marketing Group, and some trade press publications complain that the industry is draining their advertising revenue. 'In a recession, exhibitions are one of the most cost-effective ways of reaching customers', says one organiser. The challenge for an exhibitor is turning visitors into customers. Organisers say that making the visitor feel special is important - they suggest that exhibitors give important potential customers VIP status. At Confex, the exhibition industry's annual showcase, some visitors are given VIP passes to the exhibition which entitles them to use a special business lounge with refreshments. 'Exhibitions are value for money,' stresses Blenheim. 'It's the only medium where you can have three-dimen- sional advertising - where clients can not only see, but touch and feel the product.' The appearance of the stand is also important, say organisers. 'It's no good taking a huge stand if you've only got a few samples of a small product to display,' Blenheim adds. It offers exhibitors at its shows the choice of either taking the space only or of making use of its team of contractors and designers to make the best of their stand. To get the most out of the space, organisers suggest running raffles and competitions on the stand, as well as giving away free samples of the product and demonstrations. Blenheim produces an exhibitors' guide with advice on everything from where to get plants to how to arrange plumbing and lights. It runs an exhibitors' day for most shows before the event itself, which are mostly workshop-type sessions on the basics of exhibiting. For Confex, this includes sessions on setting objectives for the show, building image, focusing on stand design, choice and construction, and the importance of forward planning. But not only the design and products are important. The professionalism of the people staffing the stand can have a big impact on visitors. Blenheim's guidance to exhibitors emphasises that eating and drinking on the stand should be avoided, as should smoking and chatting with friends. Instead, it recommends, set a goal of a certain number of sales contacts every hour; keep an eye on the competition and make sure anything that requires attention is dealt with immediately. Organisers also stress the obvious: one should approach potential customers with a friendly smile. 'To this end, it's often better to have marketing people on a stand rather than sales people as you might expect,' says Blenheim. As well as potential customers, exhibitors will also be dealing with the press, an important source of extra publicity. Blenheim produces a guide for exhibitors on looking after the press, ranging from tips on how to write a press release - alerting publications to news which may end up as editorial in a publication and thus attract more visitors - to briefing someone on the stand to deal specifically with press inquiries. A press office is also provided at the venue, the first stop for journalists covering the show. The media is also important before the show, organisers stress. Blenheim says: 'It's important to come to us as soon as possible when you decide to take a stand. Then you can tie in with things like production schedules for magazines so as to get maximum publicity.' To help exhibitors, Blenheim also holds a series of one-day seminars on getting the most out of exhibitions. Such a day includes sessions on promotion and publicity, aimed at helping exhibitors getting the maximum exposure for their companies; as well as sessions on making the most of the exhibition, including pre-show planning and tips for successful exhibiting. It also may include sessions on capitalising on the event and following up contacts made. When the show is over, it is not just a case of packing up and going home - organisers can also help with post-show management. And the next event should always be on the exhibitor's mind. Blenheim runs a database of 6m names worldwide, helping to maintain contacts with clients and following up sales leads. 'At some exhibitions we give each stand a light-pen, and visitors wear bar-coded badges so that when the pen reads the code, the name and details go straight onto the database.' After the show the organiser can put together an analysis of the event, detailing what attracted visitors to it - for example whether they attended because they saw an advertisement or from free tickets - helping to plan advertising for the next show.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Change, Change, Change"] </F>   [Text] Last week, President Itamar Franco made the 40th  change in his cabinet. It features shifts like that of the  acting minister of a ministry that was going to be abolished who  became the permanent minister of a ministry that will be  maintained--the case of Leonor Franco, of Social Welfare. A  reserve minister became head of a ministry in his own  right--Colonel Djalma Morais, of Communications. A former  minister with a questionable background was called to hold a  portfolio that was to become extinct--Deputy Aluizio Alves of  the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], summoned to  Regional Integration. The military reinforced the olive-green  cordon of Itamar's team by adding General Rubens Bayma Denis,  the new transportation minister, and the tucanos  gained another ministry--the Ministry of Planning--now held by  Ceara Senator Beni Veras. In the commotion, former Minister of  Transportation Margarida Coimbra even sought support from her  mother, in Rio de Janeiro. After phoning her mother Monday  night, the former minister wept. "I don't know what is going on  out there, I haven't the least idea. Now I am unemployed and  have no place to go," a desperate Margarida told Marcelo Auler,  VEJA assistant editor in Rio.    The administration did not announce any new plan or new  goals  as part of the reform, only changes in names. In less than two  years, Itamar has made more appointments than former President  Jose Sarney did in five years of government (see box). The game  of musical chairs brings to a close a reform that has been  dragging on for five months. It has accomplished almost nothing,  except to reaffirm Itamar's taste for uniformed ministers. The  addition of Bayma Denis brings to five the number of top-ranking  military officers holding civilian posts at the first and second  echelons of the government, The minister of the Strategic  Affairs Secretariat is from the Navy--Admiral Mario Cesar  Flores. The president of Telebras [Brazilian Telecommunications,  Inc.] is from the Air Force--Brigadier General Adyr da Silva.  General Romildo Canhim is minister of Administration. Another  general, Nilton Moreira Rodrigues, is the head honcho at Sudene  [Northeast Development Superintendency]. There are so many  top-rank military men in civilian posts that Itamar has  surpassed former President Joao Figueiredo, a military man who  had only four generals on his team. Itamar also has two high  officials who bear the rank of colonel: Djalma Morais, confirmed  last week as head of Communications, and Wilson Romao, director  of the Federal Police.  <H5>  [Box p 42] </H5> <H5>  Numbers from the Tumult </H5>    -  Itamar replaces an average of two ministers a month.    -  In  less than two years in office, the president made more  appointments than Sarney did in five years--69, compared with 62  for the former president.    -  Itamar took office with 15 ministries,  created 12, and now has 27. He had 12 acting ministers and one  extraordinary one.    -  Alexis Stepanenko, now minister of mines and  energy, has held three posts in this administration.    -  The one who  warmed his chair for the shortest time was Wilson Romao. His  stay at Agriculture lasted one day.   <H5>    "I Want a General" </H5>   President Itamar decided to appoint Bayma Denis on Tuesday,  during a phone conversation with Minister of the Army Zenildo  Lucena. "I want a general," Itamar said. "I am not going to  allow the cabinet to be the target of birds of prey." By "birds  of prey" he meant opportunistic politicians, the technicians  connected to economic groups, and the construction contractors.  Minister Lucena suggested Denis, who was head of the Military  Command of the East from which, two months ago, he dispatched  troops to forestall demonstrations at the Rio-Niteroi Bridge. A  Rio native, age 64, the general is respected within the Army. He  was minister of the Military Household in the Sarney  administration.    "Our administration makes no distinction between civilians  and military personnel," President Itamar said in Caracas,  Venezuela, on Friday. "There are civilians who should hold  civilian posts. But there are also military men who can occupy  civilian posts, with civilian objectives." As Fernando Henrique  Cardoso said during a conversation about the reform with Raul  Jungmann, executive secretary of the Ministry of Planning, this  is a putt-putt administration. "Putt-putt?" Jungmann wondered.  "Yes. It takes two or three months for something to happen. When  it does happen, everything changes: the economy, the currency,  the ministers...." Minister Alexis Stepanenko, who was shifted  from Planning to Mines and Energy--his fourth move within the  cabinet--is tired. "I hope they don't move me again," he  grumbled. He found out he would be reassigned on Wednesday  morning when he got a phone call from Itamar. "You're going to  Mines and Energy, O.K.?" [preceding word in English] the  president said. "But why? Don't you and Fernando Henrique like  my work?" Stepanenko wanted to know. "Best wishes, minister.  Best wishes. Ciao," said President Itamar, ending the phone call.    Senator Beni Veras, of the Ceara PSDB [Brazilian Social  Democracy Party], went to Planning thanks to his party colleague  Fernando Henrique. A former traveling salesman and the son of a  tailor, Veras had to struggle to earn his degree in business  administration. As an executive in the Guararapes apparel  factory, he never took a vacation or missed a day of work. When  fired, he sued the company and used the money he received to set  up his own clothing factory, Confex. Soon he became a business  leader and participated in the movement that launched Tasso  Jereissati as candidate for governor of Ceara in 1986.  <H5>  Gutsy </H5>   For the Ministry of Regional Integration, Itamar went  looking  for a name in the PMDB. The post had been vacant since the  budget scandal broke out and implicated then-Minister Alexandre  Costa. The party chose Deputy Aluizio Alves, who was minister of  administration under Sarney and once served as governor of Rio  Grande do Norte. Aluizio Alves is a choice that comes with a lot  of baggage. Along with his son and office manager Aluizio, Alves  is accused of igniting a bonfire of improprieties in the  ministry, ranging from payments to contractors for projects  never built, to disappearance of equipment. The father was  indicted in four Federal Police investigations. He was  eventually acquitted in three of them. In the remaining one, he  is accused of crimes against the public administration. The son  has four cases pending against him in the federal courts.  "Appointing Aluizio Alves is just another gutsy move by the  Itamar government," was the sarcastic comment by Deputy Augusto  Carvalho of the PPS [Socialist People's Party] of the Federal  District, who plans to requisition information on the minister  from the Federal Police, the National Accounting Office, and the  Federal Supreme Court.    As minister, Aluizio Alves hired 620 employees in irregular  fashion, including six relatives. He was responsible for  managing 213 apartment buildings that are occupied by federal  civil servants. He took care to hand over the best units to his  relatives--one of them measuring 242 square meters and featuring  four bedrooms, all renovated with marble. Minister Aluizio Alves  is a wealthy man, the owner of a newspaper, a TV station, and  five radio stations in Rio Grande do Norte. When he left the  Sarney government in 1989, he tried to get himself elected to  the Superior Military Court. He won the election, but was never  sworn in. The vote in the Senate was annulled when evidence of  fraud came to light. Starting Monday, Aluizio Alves will have a  budget of 23 billion real cruzeiros to administer.</p>

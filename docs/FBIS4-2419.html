			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wu Weizhong (0702 5588 0022)] </F>   [Text] Tonglu, 7 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- It was  drizzling this afternoon. The relatives of the Taiwan  compatriots who died in the "31 March Hairui pleasure boat fire"  came to the funeral parlor in Tonglu [a county southeast of  Hangzhou], Zhejiang Province to pay their last respects to the  remains of the deceased.    At 0755, the cremation of the first body began.    Earlier, at 0630, reporters arrived at the Tonglu funeral  parlor to find themselves in a spacious mourning hall permeated  with an atmosphere of solemnity. The coffins of the 24  Taiwanese victims were shrouded in green silk covers and laid  neatly in a line.    Both sides of the mourning hall were lined with wreaths from  relevant departments and individuals from the mainland and  Taiwan.    Under a banner which read, "Mourning with deep grief the  death of our compatriots," stood the portraits and name tablets  of the deceased.    At 0645, relatives of the Taiwanese victims came to the  mourning hall. Facing portraits of their loved ones, they  burned incense, paid their respects on bended knee, and went  through mourning procedures according to Taiwan customs.  Afterward, the relatives chose cinerary caskets for the  victims. Some of them had brought cylindrical caskets with them  from Taiwan.    Ma Shiyong [7456 2514 7167], vice mayor of Hangzhou,  attended  the mourning ceremony with his office personnel. He said: We  are here today with deep grief and would like to express our  heartfelt condolences over the deaths of the victims and  sympathy for their families on behalf of the provincial, city,  and county governments. We hope you will restrain your grief and  take care of yourselves.    Afterward, Ma Shiyong and his office personnel bowed three  times to the portraits of the Taiwanese victims as a gesture of  condolence, to which the victims' relatives responded.    It is learned that today's mourning ceremony and cremation  had been arranged according to the wishes of the victims'  families.    The cremation of the Taiwanese victims' bodies will continue  until the morning of 8 April.    Information from another source said that by yesterday  afternoon [6 April], the bodies of eight mainland victims had  been cremated or buried. (Because Chunan is a mountainous area  and lacks a crematorium, crew members from Chunan who died in  the accident were buried there.)</p>

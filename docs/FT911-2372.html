			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Waldegrave seeks to calm uproar over health reform THE government sought to calm the uproar over its health service reforms yesterday with Mr William Waldegrave, health secretary, accusing the Labour party of stirring up a 'bogus pre-election row' ahead of Thursday's local government polls. There were clashes in the Commons after Labour produced a leaked document which, it said, showed that managers at Guy's Hospital, London, knew they faced serious financial problems two months before the hospital became a self-governing trust. Some 57 hospitals and other services became self-governing trusts when the health reforms came into effect on April 1. Last week, Guy's announced 600 redundancies and the Bradford Hospitals Trust, West Yorkshire, announced 300 job losses. In angry exchanges in the Commons, Mr Robin Cook, shadow health secretary, called on Mr Waldegrave not to approve any further applications until after a general election. 'He cannot press ahead with the second wave of opt-outs while hospitals are already foundering in the first wave,' he said. The leaked document indicated that managers of the Guy's and Lewisham Trust, governing Guy's, its sister hospital at Lewisham and related services, realised they faced 'very serious financial problems in relation to maintaining the volume and present range of services provided'. It went on to say that the management had been trying to establish the most equitable distribution of cuts necessary to 'minimise the inevitable reductions in direct patient care services'. Mr Waldegrave defended the reforms, saying the government should not interfere in management of hospitals. He denied that the trusts had 'secret' business plans. Mr Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat MP whose constituency includes Guy's, met Mr Peter Griffiths, the hospital's chief executive, yesterday. Mr Hughes said afterwards he was far from satisfied that cuts could be made without serious consequences for patient care. He said he had been told during the meeting that it was likely there would be fewer than 150 redundancies at Guy's, with the remaining job cuts being achieved by unfilled vacancies. When hospital managers announced their plans to staff last week they said that they would 'attempt to avoid compulsory redundancies.' 'It was known that there was going to be a deficit at the end of the last financial year when the plans were put up to the secretary of state, although the amount was not specified,' said Mr Hughes.</p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Arts: A 'Loose Ends' for eggheads - Radio Something should be done about Melvyn Bragg, if not to him. The rumour is that a producer's diktat went out to the effect that he must be more abrasive: if it was the producer who supports Arsenal, as revealed on Monday's Start the Week, it merely confirms one's opinion of her judgment. From a civilised arbiter of argument, coaxing the best from his guests, Bragg has become a bully, slapping down those he disagrees with and giving short shrift to those he considers, not always rightly, to be fools. It is a little like Brian Hayes in his old LBC days, but without the sense of craggy integrity. There is something innately plush about Melv. He is too comfortable with himself, which makes the discomfort he inflicts on others unacceptable; less a rigorous crusade for truth than mandarin contempt for inferiors. And while Hayes' victims rang in, choosing confrontation, the guests on STW have presumably been invited because they have something to say. I would hate to think they were being set up. On Monday, initial boredom at the prospect of a newspaper journalist telling us why she had given her television away was replaced by outraged sympathy as she was verbally jostled by the assembled company of the media-wise, seldom permitted to make her points in full, and assailed by such intellectual attacks as Melv's dismissive assertion that all the people he knows who say they hate television are very stupid people. So there. Melv is of course a TV magnate, a well-known screen personality and rich with it. No one could call him stupid. Far from dispelling the air of self-congratulation that is turning STW into a Loose Ends for eggheads, Melv's acerbity accentuates it in some of his guests. PJ O'Rourke was a disappointment after his writing, the breezy bonhomme that one dreads getting cornered by at parties, rolling along on autopilot chuckling facetiousness and woolly generalisations. But it has been a depressing week for the communicating classes. Mediumwave chatted to the British brat-pack of directors who, despite the death of our native film industry, are doing well in Hollywood. Little Action Men, every one, saying things like 'I want to be very, very rich', not wanting to make films appealing to a minority and boasting of being the first video (ie not lettered) generation - well, why not if that's where the future lies? But what became of art? At least Melv is keen on that. Struggles to communicate have recurred in the Radio 3 programmes on the distaff and the stave, Pride and Prejudice - a Celebration of Women Composers. They almost qualify, as a class, for Radio 4's Scapegoats. Tuesday's programme featured music and words from Judith Weir, restrained, ironic and articulate on the double handicap of being a serious composer and a woman. Some fascinating sounds, many new to me, from composers mitteleuropaisch and points north. But arguing about whether women's music is intrinsically different from men's strikes me as on a par with extracting sunbeams from cucumbers. We all know that the sexes both bang the big drum these post-Glennie days. It would be interesting to compare the sexes' percussion styles, a thought prompted by Radio 3's artist of the week. James Blades started in cinemas and circuses and ended as a favourite of Benjamin Britten. Besides showpieces, the week's well-chosen snippets included that ominous passage in The Turn of the Screw where the governess muses about her new job and a frantic throbbing underlines her nervousness, tightening the suspense unbearably.</p>

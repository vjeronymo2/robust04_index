			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Warning on cost of steel job losses THE COSTS of social compensation for the tens of thousands of European steelworkers likely to lose their jobs when the industry is restructured over the next few years could be much higher than expected, according to Mr Martin Bangemann, EC industry commissioner. He was speaking after an informal meeting of EC industry ministers in Nyborg, Denmark at the weekend. Neither he nor other participants were prepared to quote figures, but the implication of Mr Bangemann's statement appears to be that redundancies will be in the upper range of estimates made at the ministers' meeting in Brussels on February 25. It was said then that 50,000-100,000 jobs might have to go as crude steel producers and rolling mills were closed. Social compensation will be paid out of special funds which it is planned to set up. The Commission and the industry itself will contribute to the funds, said Mr Bangemann. Final decisions on the steel industry restructuring programme will not be made until October, by which time the ministers will have received proposals for capacity reductions from the industry, according to the commission's present schedule.</p>

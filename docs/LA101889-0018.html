			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A GAP THAT, SADLY, MUST BE FILLED  </P> <P> It has been 25 years since construction of Interstate 710, the Long Beach  Freeway, was halted due to opposition in South Pasadena. The result is a  six-mile gap in a heavily-traveled corridor that other cities in the San  Gabriel Valley want eliminated. Completing the freeway will have a sadly  disruptive effect on South Pasadena, but it must be finished.  </P> <P> The California Department of Transporation is currently preparing the latest  version of an environmental impact report that it must provide to the Federal  Highway Administration in order to get money to complete the freeway. Currently  the freeway ends at the San Bernardino Freeway and Valley Boulevard, on the Los  Angeles-Alhambra border. If completed, it will reach the interchange of  Interstate 210 and State Highway 134 in Pasadena. The cost of closing this  freeway gap is estimated at between $500 million and $1 billion, depending on  whether one talks to its proponents or critics.  </P> <P> This is the fourth environmental report that Caltrans has prepared on the  freeway gap. Among other issues, it deals with the objections of  preservationists who oppose the freeway because it will eliminate historic  districts. The original route would have destroyed more than 100 historic  homes. Caltrans has realigned the freeway to eliminate only 52 such homes, a  more manageable number should their owners decide to move them.  </P> <P> One benefit to the long delay in completing the freeway is that engineers have  learned more about how to mitigate the effects of highway projects in the  meantime. In planning to complete the freeway, Caltrans has tried to take into  account the fears of South Pasadena residents, who worry about losing the  small-town ambience of their city. So the roadway will be submerged below  ground-level, and a tunnel will be bored at one point to avoid disrupting  activities at South Pasadena High School. Automobiles will be alloted only  three lanes in each direction, with one of the three reserved for vans and  carpools. The remainder of the roadway will be devoted to mass transit,  including a busway to link up with the existing busway on the San Bernardino  Freeway.  </P> <P> Opponents claim that closing the freeway gap may actually exacerbate traffic  problems by generating new traffic, but they are not persuasive. New highways  may generate more traffic in still-developing areas, but there is not much room  for new growth around the freeway gap. In fact, an analysis by the Southern  California Assn. of Governments suggests that closing the gap will simply  relieve congestion that already exists, primarily on the surface streets where  traffic from the unfinished freeway currently winds up. And cars moving along a  highway generate less air pollution than they do in stop-and-go traffic.  Closing the freeway gap could also reduce some truck traffic on Interstate 5,  and relieve congestion on freeways as far away as Glendale and Whittier.  </P> <P> Clearly the heady era of unhindered freeway construction is over, and this  region must look to other solutions for its transportation problems,  particularly mass transit. But even mass transit must follow the configuration  of existing highways, because they determine where people live and work. The  inclusion of mass transit in plans for the Long Beach Freeway gap is evidence  that the highway's final leg is not just a convenience for a few drivers, but  part of a regional transportation system that extends far beyond South  Pasadena. If that system is to operate at peak efficiency, the gap must be  closed.  </P></p>

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Monetary union panel rules out 'big bang' An overnight 'big bang' switch to a single currency in Europe has been ruled out by the panel of experts examining EU ambitions to introduce a common currency before the end of the century. Its recommendation will be welcomed by governments, companies, and organisations who feared that a sudden change could result in administrative chaos and a bemused populace. But while stressing the need to tread carefully, the panel, appointed by the commission, says the switch must happen as swiftly as possible, with the Ecu and national currencies coexisting only for a limited period. Mr Cees Maas, chairman of the group, was in Brussels yesterday to present these and other suggestions to Mr Henning Christopherson, commissioner responsible for economic and financial affairs. 'The group is convinced that the Ecu will be introduced before the end of the century and Mr Christophersen was very happy to hear that,' said Mr Maas, also a director of ING, the Dutch financial services company. Mr Maas warned the British government that the City of London, Europe's biggest and most important financial centre, would suffer from the government's decision to remain outside a single European currency. 'I cannot imagine that the City will accept not taking part in this one single currency,' said Mr Maas. 'It seems that if it is not part of the Ecu bloc, it will lose out.' According to the committee, governments, banking systems and retailers must start now to prepare for the single currency. Banks should adapt payment systems and get ready to redenominate loans and deposits in Ecu; local authorities should adapt parking meters to accept electronic payment; retailers should similarly alter vending machines and reduce cash handling as much as possible by introducing modern payment techniques. Trade and industry should also make allowance for the imminent switch when making investments in new financial and administrative systems and when drafting long-term business agreements. 'People should not see such moves as an unnecessary expense,' said Mr Maas. 'It is a stimulus for more efficiency in all payment systems.' To make things easier, the European Monetary Institute, the precursor to a European central bank, should state the size of bank notes and coins as soon as possible. The design and production of Ecu notes and coins will be a lengthy process, according to the committee. It argues that they should be introduced within six months of stage three of European Monetary Union, which will irreversibly fix the exchange rates of participating currencies. 'If the introduction of actual Ecus is delayed for too long, the markets might start to test to see whether the currencies are really irrevocably fixed,' said Mr Maas. He also favours just one type of coin and note, rather than allowing different EU countries to put their own stamp on one side. 'This would increase the time it took to design notes and coins, increase the risk of fraud, increase costs, and prolong production of the new currency,' he said. However, the committee recognises the political and psychological importance of bank notes in spite of the widespread use of plastic cards to make payments electronically. 'Wide public support is essential to the Ecu's success. Therefore, the greatest possible attention should be paid to promoting public awareness,' says the committee's provisional recommendations. It believes that national currency notes and coins should be phased out gradually, but with markets being the driving force, rather than administrative decisions.</p>

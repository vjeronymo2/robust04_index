			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / A test for John Patten The secretary for education, Mr John Patten, faces a simple test this summer. He will be required to answer, preferably on one side of a sheet of paper, one of the following questions: 1. Why are teachers refusing to test schoolchildren? 2. A secretary for education must convince teachers that the tests required under the national curriculum are sensible. Discuss. 3. When everyone says you are mistaken, is it possible that you are wrong? Mr Patten appears not to know how to tackle these questions. If he fails he should be assessed as a dunce. The first task of any education secretary is to establish a rapport with teachers. Mr Patten has not done so. The evidence is before our eyes, in the current of discontent running through the staff common rooms of Britain's secondary schools. It is important to be clear about this. I am not talking about the teachers' trade unions, but teachers themselves. The absurdly posturing National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, the second largest of the six unions, proposes to boycott all the national tests due in June. The more focused National Union of Teachers, the largest union, threatens to sabotage the English test for 14-year-olds. It will ballot its members in May. The Secondary Heads Association decided last week that its members will not try to prevent disruption of the English tests. The SHA may, however, allow headteachers to snitch on their staff, by reporting them to the school governors or the local education authority. Either could discipline any recalcitrant. The larger National Association of Head Teachers has hummed and hawed. Thus do the associations of principals balance their principles. If the above was the whole story Mr Patten would deserve support. The correct attitude to teaching unions that call strikes or boycotts is to thump them hard, and bankrupt them when they break the law. What is different this time is that it is ordinary, non-loony teachers who are unsettled. We need to understand why. The explanation begins with the Education Reform Act, potentially the most beneficial legislation of the 1980s. It followed a decade of dithering about the low expectations of England's schoolteachers, many of them befuddled by 'child-centred' theories of pedagogy. The new law smashed the previously locked door to the 'secret garden' - the little acres of classroom in which teachers strutted like gods - and imposed a structure on the system. The foundations of a national curriculum were laid. The next step, national tests at various stages of a child's life, seemed to follow logically. Teachers resisted testing even more than the idea of a curriculum imposed by law. What they particularly disliked was testing designed to measure their own output, rather than the progress of the children. Conservatives of the fundamentalist-right persuasion on education wanted quick, simple written tests, not unlike those used in public schools. Progressives of the fundamentalist left wanted continuous assessment of children's progress, controlled by the teachers. At the education department the assembled civil servants rubbed their hands. They gave the left the semblance of what it wanted, disguised as a presentation to the right. Enter Lord Griffiths of Fforestfach. When he was plain Professor Brian Griffiths he was adviser to the prime minister, then plain Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Speaking for the right, he concurred with his then boss, whose instinct was that the 10-layered, multi-choice, paper-heavy system about to be approved by Mr Kenneth Baker, the education secretary of the time, would eventually collapse under its own bureaucratic weight. Mr Baker's several successors did their best to simplify the original plans. The chief inspector of schools reported yesterday that the slimmed-down (but still copious) tests at primary school level are working, and that the quality of teaching of and learning by seven-year-olds has improved. His report found fault with both teaching and assessment in secondary schools, which are at an earlier stage of introducing the new system. In due course Lord Griffiths became chairman of the school examinations and assessment council, SEAC. To the proponents of simple testing its draft English assessment schemes looked like prime examples of what they call the 'educational establishment's juggernaut'. It tested too much imagination and too little hard knowledge, too much free-flow of ideas and not enough basic skills. It took forever to get through. Lord Griffith tried to improve what he found. SEAC's 1993 90-minute and one-hour tests go the other way. Preparation requires brief reading from a slim anthology. The tests aim to assess whether the children have been taught to comprehend what they read. They take note of skills in grammar, the child's vocabulary, a short piece of writing, and evidence of some prior reading. No wonder English teachers hate them. Mr Patten has to regain control of the argument. Just the other day the education secretary attended a meeting at the Centre for Policy Studies (co-founder: M. Thatcher) at which Lord Skidelsky, a member of SEAC, tore into the system of tests, which he described as a fudge between the doctrine that testing should be diagnostic of individual educational strengths and weaknesses and the government's desire to measure the effectiveness of teaching and schools. Professor Griffiths was there, as were Mr David Pascall, chairman of the National Curriculum Council (NCC) and several other key players. I do not know if Mr Patten got the message. His civil servants assume absolute control over the curriculum and testing when, later this year, Sir Ron Dearing, ex the Post Office, merges the NCC and SEAC into a new acronym. What the thus even more powerful education department should do is plain. National tests should be simplified on Griffiths lines. That would give the government its measures of performance. It would save much classroom time. Teachers could use the spare hours for their preferred style of continuous diagnostic assessments. Such a Jack-and-Mrs-Sprat ending could only be brought about by a confident minister, blessed with the confidence of the teachers. If this paragon turns out to be John Patten I shall stay after class and write 100 lines.</p>

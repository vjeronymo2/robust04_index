			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with correspondent Boudewijn Van </F> Spilbeeck in Kigali by anchorman Nadine Desloovere in  Brussels--live]    [Text] [Desloovere] At this moment we have Boudewijn Van  Spilbeeck on the telephone directly from Kigali. Boudewijn, you  have moved into the city. What have you seen and what have you  been doing there?    [Van Spilbeeck] Well, Nadine, this morning we moved into the  city with a convoy of Belgian and French paratroopers to pick up  the last Western refugees from the French School. This means  that the evacuation for Kigali, from the capital, has been  completed. All the refugees came with us. We had all kinds of  vehicles at our disposal from various aid organizations as well  as from UNAMIR [UN Mission in Rwanda] and from the Belgians and  the French, and everybody has boarded these vehicles. It was a  difficult journey, a long journey, as a part of the city is off  limits because of the fighting there. So, quite a detour had to  made. During the trip, the convoy came under fire. Rwandan  troops on an Army truck driving behind us returned the fire. A  couple of French paratroopers also shot a few rounds. It was  quite a journey. But the evacuation is finished now.    This morning, and this may be good news for those people  that  have family in the Rwandan interior, a Belgian convoy with  armored personnel carriers has moved southward to pick up some  20 people. If this turns out to be successful, it may be  repeated toward the north in the coming days.    [Desloovere] Boudewijn, the situation apparently is  worsening. The rebels reportedly are involved in heavy fighting  with the Army. What actually is going on?    [Van Spilbeeck] Indeed. Yesterday, upon our arrival, there  was heavy artillery fire. I already told you that yesterday.  It calmed down during the night. But this morning there has  been extremely heavy shelling and machine gun fire in the  northeast of the city in the neighborhood of the Amaholo where  the UNAMIR peacekeeping forces have their headquarters, and the  neighborhood of the parliament, obviously, where those 600 or  possibly already 800 rebels have dug in. Those rebels  apparently are advancing. There is very heavy fighting and  everybody here is afraid that, once all the Westerners have  left, it really will deteriorate and may become kind of a  Somalia or Liberia.    [Desloovere] The government, the interim government,  reportedly has fled Kigali. Do you know anything about that?    [Van Spilbeeck] I have also heard that, but I could not  confirm this rumor. Indeed, those people should also be on the  run. That government did not represent many parties. It was  comprised mainly of people from the entourage of the dead  president, and it could be expected that they would not be able  to hold out.    [Desloovere] Thank you, Boudewijn.</p>

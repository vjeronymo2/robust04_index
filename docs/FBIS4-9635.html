			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tamas Mellar: "Success Propaganda or Political </F> Pouting; Even Accomplishments Can Cause Pain to the Opposition"]    [Text] The opposition press of the past several weeks  resounded with criticism of the government's so-called "success  propaganda." "While the economic situation of the country  is increasingly deteriorating, and it is becoming increasingly  clear that the present government is going to hand over the  governance of the country to the next government in a condition  worse than it was when it took power, certain government sources  do not shrink from rehashing some long-forgotten bolshevik  legacies, and from advertising the government's success. To  assert that things are better today than they were four years  ago, when facts and everyday experience indicate the opposite,  amounts to uninhibited insolence," so the opposition  argument goes.    Accordingly, let us find out who is correct: Should we  believe what the government says or what the opposition claims  to be true, or should we rely on our own experience? It is not  easy to give an unequivocal "yes" or "no" answer to this  question, because we are in the midst of a transitional process  of historic significance, the essence of which is change, the  dismantling of the old system, and the building of a new system.  Therefore, we do not have a fixed basis for comparison to permit  a clear evaluation of the changes. Similarly, one cannot draw  historical parallels, or rely on scientific grading systems,  because we are in the process of an unprecedented  transformation, simultaneously experienced by only a few former  socialist countries.    If, despite all these difficulties, we try to assess the  past  period, anything we say must be prefaced by a statement to the  effect that no summary judgment, clearly positive or clearly  negative, can be made. The overall picture shows both favorable  and unfavorable trends. The exact ratio in which these trends  are mixed to prove correct any given view depends on one's  temper and political outlook. Such assessments, however, do not  render the overall picture entirely black or entirely white: The  picture still shows the situation as it actually exists.  <H5>  Confronting the Legacy of the Past </H5>   It is not entirely futile to look behind the arguments  presented by the opposition, because we should be able to  present not only the negative, but also the positive aspects of  the situation. In the following paragraphs we will examine  arguments most frequently advanced by opposition politicians to  prove the worsening of the economic situation.    Opposition argument No. 1: The GDP, industrial  production, agricultural production, and real income have  significantly declined during the past four years, while  unemployment has greatly increased. All this goes to show that  the present government has not resolved the crisis inherited  from socialism, in fact it has made it worse.    Doubtless, it is true that production and income have  greatly  declined, but one should underscore the fact that a decline of  at least the same proportion has already potentially existed in  the system prior to 1990, except that it did not surface at the  time, because the governments of those days did not dare to  confront the situation, and used every means (e.g., foreign  indebtedness) to postpone the real solution. The eastern market  that accepted virtually limitless quantities of obsolete,  inferior quality products (but made increasingly fewer payments)  had not collapsed at the time. But even then it was clear that  most of our products could not withstand competition, that a  significant number of our enterprises constituted chronic loss  operations, that they operated on the basis of obsolete  technical and technological standards, and that 25-30 percent of  their employees were superfluous. At that time already, it was  obvious that thing could not go on the way they did before. The  relatively high growth rate of the 1970s came to a halt for the  first time in the early 1980's, and investments and  accumulations have continuously declined ever since. The failure  to renew production capacities has already predestined the  subsequent decline in production.    After the collapse of the eastern markets, and after the  introduction of import liberalization and principles of a market  economy (accounting law, financial institutions law, bankruptcy  law), one had to face the harsh realities of the inherited  economy, and to examine the actual state of production forces  that had been "developed according to a plan." Accordingly, the  great decline flows decisively from the consistent use of this  new yardstick, and not from flawed economic policies applied  during the past four years. A substantially smaller decline in  production and employment would have indicated that we had  chosen the wrong path, that we had supported the old  conservationist theory instead of renewal. In order to permit a  new, modern economic structure to evolve, one has to dismantle  the old system, and in the initial period, the emerging new  system is unable to compensate for the demise of the old system.    Opposition argument No. 2: The state's external and  internal indebtedness has greatly increased during the past four  years. The present government has failed to implement unpopular  stringency measures; like its communist predecessors, the  present government wants the next generation to resolve the  problems. For all these reasons, the present government leaves  behind for the next government empty state coffers and heavy  obligations.    Factual data indicate that although the gross foreign  indebtedness of the state has increased as compared to the 1990  indebtedness level, the total net volume of indebtedness has not  increased during the period examined. Between 1990 and 1992 the  current balance of payments was positive. In 1993, however, a  significant ($3.5 billion) deficit evolved, mainly as a result  of the significant decline in exports. The decline in exports  may be attributed to several factors, but in the final analysis,  the reason for the decline can be traced to our low level of  competitiveness. Increasing our competitiveness to appropriate  levels requires an extended period of time. In the meantime,  however, we must not pursue isolationist policies, because this  would result in losing our chance to become integrated with the  global economy. Quite naturally, one could suggest that a far  more effective policy to stimulate exports should have been  pursued by the government under the given conditions. This is  true, in essence. One must not, however, disregard the fact that  a strong policy to stimulate exports would have carried the  threat of softening standard trade regulations, which could have  caused very grave problems in a fledgling market economy.    The (internal) indebtedness of the state has, indeed,  increased significantly during the past four years. Its volume  has doubled during the period. But this large-scale growth  conceals a far smaller growth in actual indebtedness. This is so  because almost two-thirds of the state's indebtedness is  comprised of the forint value of the external indebtedness,  which has increased primarily as a result of several  devaluations of the forint. If we considered the budget deficit  only, the state's indebtedness would be substantially smaller.  <H5>  "Empty State Coffers"--A Rhetorical Trick </H5>   Not including the initial year 1990, the state budget had a  deficit in every year, and the amount of deficit has increased  each year. The large budget deficit, however, did not result  from an expanding state, from a growing redistribution of  income, but from the collapse of the old system. This is so  because the lack of balance is due to a drop in revenues, and  not to increased expenditures. Tax revenues naturally decline  when production and income decline (and this is true in  particular when a large number of factors in the economy evade  taxation), while demand for social welfare provisions increase.  During the past four years the volume of production and  consumption subsidies as part of the state budget has decreased  significantly, while the proportion of social welfare  expenditures in the budget has greatly increased. An odd  situation has evolved in the grip of constraints and  limitations: The budget was heavily restrained from the  standpoint of production, at the same time, however, it  developed a heavy deficit, thus causing a deterioration of the  overall balance, while it was incapable to finance social  welfare entitlement, and unable to appropriately compensate  social strata that were sliding down.    One can escape from this trap only by instituting a  comprehensive budget reform. The government has failed to  initiate such a reform, and it can be appropriately blamed for  that. At the same time, however, one should also stress that the  disintegration of the old production system has imposed a grave  burden of such proportion on society, that even the existence of  the middle strata has become threatened. Under these conditions  it is questionable whether society would also have tolerated a  radical reduction in the social welfare delivery systems. Beyond  all this, one also has to recognize that reforming the large  distribution systems of the budget would not have produced  tangible budget reductions in the short term, but would have  increased the burden on the populace. A fundamental budget  reform can only be introduced on a gradual basis, in parallel  with growing individual income.    The repeated mention of empty state coffers might be a  clever  rherotical trick, but it has no factual basis whatsoever. At the  end of 1993 our foreign exchange reserves amounted to $6.8  billion. As a matter of comparison, one should note that foreign  exchange reserves amounted to $800 million when governance was  transferred from the Nemeth government. The large volume of  foreign exchange reserves, as well as about $6 billion in  foreign investments over the past few years enable secure  operations, one that provides significant latitude even for the  next government.    Opposition argument No. 3: The government missed  opportunities, and did not (consistently) implement the  transition to a market economy; it began to build a modern  economic system slowly and selectively.    In light of the changes made thus far, the charge that holds  that the present coalition government does not want to establish  a market economy, but the Horthy system of between the two world  wars or some vaguely defined, fellow-traveler system based on  national considerations, is totally unfounded. The governmental  and legislative actions of the past four years indicate a clear  commitment to a market economy. Progress in privatization, the  establishment of market economy institutions, laws consistent  with western market economy standards, and the increasing role  of foreign capital all go to prove this.  <H5>  Mixed, Kadarist Reactions </H5>   In reality then, all that can be said is that the  development  of a market economy has progressed at a slow pace. This is  certainly true, especially if compared to heightened  expectations. The delays and the slowness resulted from delayed  actions by the government and the legislature on the one hand,  and from mistakes made by the professional staff, and the lack  of a social consensus, on the other. In 1990, voters authorized  the present government to accomplish a slow, gradual transition,  and not to apply shock therapy. (One should keep in mind the  major social tensions created by even a slow-paced transition.)    Lack of acceptance by society may also be blamed for the  slow  progress of transition to a market economy. The gravest legacy  of the past socialist system can be found not in distorted  material conditions, but in standards of conduct, aptitudes, and  attitudes instilled in people. After the political system  change, everyone expected to see a well-functioning, decent  market economy, as in Germany, Switzerland, or Japan. The  problem is that on a societal scale, Hungary did not have (and  still does not have) a high level of work ethics, a high degree  of enterprising spirit, and appropriate professional training.  Short of these, even a well functioning market economy develops  slowly, is filled with contradictions and many mistakes, and is  accompanied by negative phenomena.    The popular but mistaken belief or propaganda holds that the  above-mentioned positive attributes had already evolved and had  gained strength during Kadar's soft dictatorship, in the  socialist economy that had been the subject of several reforms.  This, however, is not true. What evolved there was a way to make  a living in the shadows of socialist large enterprises: to work  for these enterprises in executive positions, and, at the same  time, to maintain business relations with the same enterprises  in the form of a second job. Further: This situation taught  people how to conduct themselves wisely in an economy in which  consumers could enjoy all the advantages of a market economy,  but in which producers and employers were protected against all  negative effects of the market (this was the logic of the  "produce for the eastern markets--buy from the Western markets"  mechanism).    Real market economies, however, do not function on the basis  of this logic; they require some different aptitudes and forms  of conduct, and Hungarian society was not (and is still not)  appropriately prepared to acquire such aptitudes and to manifest  such conduct. Accordingly, when it comes to progress in the  development of a market economy, the slowness of the progress is  not necessarily due to mistakes made by the government, but also  to slow and mixed reactions by society. Let us not forget the  old wisdom: "You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make  him drink."</p>

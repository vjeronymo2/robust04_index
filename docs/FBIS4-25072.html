			<p>BFN     [Text] Suzhou, 30 May (XINHUA) -- Wang Daohan, chairman  ofthe Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits  [ARATS], and Tang Shubei, executive vice chairman of the ARATS,  inspected Taiwan-funded enterprises in Jiangsu Province from 24  to 30 May, and during the same period they also saw students  from Taiwan who are studying in Nanjing.    The development of Taiwan-funded enterprises in Jiangsu has  been very rapid. In addition to labor intensive industries,  Taiwanese businessmen have also made investments in high-tech  enterprises, infrastructure projects, and tertiary industry in  the province. Those Taiwan-funded enterprises which have been  put into operation have gained good results. Chairman Wang  Daohan and Vice Chairman Tang Shubei fully affirmed Jiangsu's  work in improving the investment climate and in providing good  services for Taiwan-funded enterprises. Chairman Wang Daohan  said: Under the leadership of party committees and governments  at various levels, Taiwan affairs offices at various levels in  the province have made outstanding achievements in absorbing  capital from Taiwan to serve Jiangsu's economic development. In  1992 and 1993, Jiangsu topped the whole country in absorbing  capital from Taiwan as compared with the total annual investment  by Taiwanese businessmen in other provinces, municipalities, and  autonomous regions. In particular, Jiangsu has utilized  Taiwan's capital to transform old enterprises and achieved very  good results.    Accompanied by responsible comrades of the Taiwan Affairs  Office of Jiangsu Province, the General Office of the Jiangsu  Provincial CPC Committee, and party committees and governments  of various prefectures and cities, Chairman Wang Daohan and Vice  Chairman Tang Shubei inspected Taiwan-funded enterprises and  economic and technological development zones in Nanjing,  Yangzhou, Wuxi, and Suzhou. They also held discussions with  Taiwanese businessmen in Nanjing and Suzhou. Chairman Wang  Daohan and Vice Chairman Tang Shubei attentively listened to  reports by chairmen of the board and general managers of various  Taiwan-funded enterprises. They expressed satisfaction with the  production and operation of Taiwan-funded enterprises; and  encouraged Taiwanese industrial and commercial people to closely  cooperate with entrepreneurs in Jiangsu on a mutually beneficial  basis, give full play to the advantages of both sides, and make  greater development together. Chairman Wang Daohan asked  authorities in Jiangsu to actively adopt measures to serious  implement the "Law on the Protection of Investment of Taiwan  Compatriots" promulgated by the National People's Congress and  make further efforts to protect the lawful rights and interests  of Taiwanese businessmen who have invested in Jiangsu. They  hoped the authorities in Jiangsu would continue to improve the  investment climate; strengthen consultative services for  investment by Taiwanese businessmen; and create good conditions  for the establishment, production, and operation of  Taiwan-funded enterprises.    Wang Daohan fully affirmed the preparations for the  establishment of associations for Taiwan-funded enterprises in  Yangzhou and Nanjing cities. He hoped that other locales with  large numbers of Taiwan-funded enterprises would also establish  associations for Taiwan-funded enterprises as quickly as  possible when conditions are ripe so they can act as bridges  between Taiwan-funded enterprises and governments at various  levels and serve Taiwanese businessmen in a better way.    During their stay in Nanjing, Chairman Wang and Vice  Chairman  Tang also met with a number of students from Taiwan who are  studying at schools of higher learning there, and held cordial  talks with them and listened to their opinions. Chairman Wang  expressed his welcome to those students who have parted from  their parents and come to study on the mainland. He warmly  encouraged those students from Taiwan to study hard, welcomed  more students from Taiwan to come and study on the mainland, and  hoped the younger generation on both sides of the straits would  strengthen exchanges. Chairman Wang asked concerned departments  in Jiangsu Province to show good concern for students from  Taiwan and help them solve their practical problems.    Wang Daohan, Tang Shubei, and their party arrived in Jiangsu  on 24 May. On the afternoon of the same day, Chen Huanyou,  secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial CPC Committee and governor  of Jiangsu, met with Chairman Wang Daohan and Vice Chairman Tang  Shubei. Chen Huanyou expressed his appreciation of the ARATS's  concern for and support to Jiangsu's Taiwan affairs work.</p>

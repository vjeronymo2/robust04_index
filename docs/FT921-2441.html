			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (22): Consultant's critique IN MOST companies, a database represents the records used to run one or more of its functions, such as accounting or sales information, but the product of the business itself is different. The database used by Guinness Publications is most unusual, because it is the product, containing a large part of the raw material for printing, including typesetting instructions. The database is not enormous, nor has it a complex structure. The search criteria are simple, based on on the position, (chapter, section and item number) of an entry within the book. However, it is radically different from many other commercial databases because it needs to store, and perform searches within large amounts of textual information. To find an entry whose textual data matches against certain criteria would be impossible with normal relational database query languages like SQL. For instance, to answer an enquiry about the oldest pilot, the software must find and return every record whose text portion contains the word 'pilot' anywhere in it. Promco, the consultant, wrote extensions to make such searches possible in Empress. A significant benefit of the product (see supplier profile, page 18) was that it allowed such alterations without compromising the product's basic functions. Empress was chosen because it also supports 'binary large objects' or 'blobs,' (see buzzwords, page 2). These are essential for holding the text of the book with the typesetting commands. In 1988, Empress was the only such product available. Now that pictorial database are becoming more common, many packages support blobs. However Empress still offers the advantage of allowing considerable scope for manipulation of its data by external programs. The relationship between Promco and Guinness has proved fruitful, and Simon Johnson is seen almost as an extension of Guinness Publications' own staff. This means Guinness can rely on a person who understands its business but who can also call on expertise from his own company which would not be available to in-house staff. The company's future automation plans are currently under review. It is aware that the capabilities of equipment and software are constantly improving: for instance, the pictures are not yet stored on the computer. Empress' blob technology is capable of handling this data, and typesetting equipment to deal with such pictures is becoming affordable. Promco as well as other consul tants have been asked to submit plans and proposals to obtain a balanced view of the possibilities. This is sensible. However well a consultant, internal or external, has done, you should see if there are other ways of working. The industry is changing fast. Your expert might easily have missed an important development which could make all the difference to your business. This case study holds an important lesson: once you have chosen to use an outside consultant who has proved his ability in a particular area, rely on him - he will understand your business, and will have a deeper knowledge of what is technically possible than will a typical in-house employee. However, ask the opinion of other consultants from time to time, to keep a finger on the pulse.</p>

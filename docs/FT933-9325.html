			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / International Company News: The Limited slides despite rise in sales THE WOES at The Limited, one of the biggest clothing retailers in the US, continued yesterday when it unveiled a 15 per cent fall in second-quarter profits, to Dollars 68.2m after tax. Sales increased by 13 per cent to Dollars 1.69bn, while earnings per share slipped to 19 cents from 22 cents. Mr Leslie Wexner, chairman, said he was 'very disappointed' with the results and did not 'accept external causes as an excuse for our sub-standard performance'. He admitted the company had 'been promotional' across all its businesses to ensure stocks were in line for the autumn season, but added that he believed this was the 'correct action'. Throughout the 1980s, The Limited - which takes in the likes of Express, Lane Bryant, Victoria's Secret and the Bath and Body Works chains - was hailed as one of the retailing industry's innovators, but it has struggled recently. Some analysts claim the group seemed to lose direction, and like all retailers it has faced acute price competition. At Dillard Department Stores, the Arkansas-based group, after-tax profits rose to Dollars 39.2m from Dollars 36.5m in the second quarter, with sales increasing to Dollars 1.10bn from Dollars 974.9m. The company said same-store sales over the second quarter rose by 4 per cent, and earnings per share rose to 35 cents from 33 cents.</p>

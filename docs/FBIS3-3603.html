The official from the region's Forestry Department said  that,  since 1986, the region has planted a total of 3.2 million ha  [hectare] of trees on farms, pastures, barren mountains and  deserts.    These trees are now protecting 65 percent of the 1.53  million  ha of farmland in the region's major cereal-producing area from  sandstorms.    The forest coverage of these areas has risen from 5.5  percent  to 20.8 percent.    More than 667,000 ha of pastures in the region are now also  under the protection of windbreaks.    Even in Horqin and Mu Us, the region's two largest deserts,  the forest coverage has gone up to 20 percent.    Since 1986, the regional government has invested 633.73  million yuan and 136.72 labor days in the greening campaign,  which forms part of a national program to build a shelterbelt in  northern China.    The region will go on greening mountains and deserts that  are  farther from human inhabitation.    Meanwhile, the region will plant more orchards, which  promise  greater short-term benefits and can help local farmers prosper  faster and in a more direct way.</p>

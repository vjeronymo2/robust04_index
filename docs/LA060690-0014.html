			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> SCHAEFER PRESSES FOR MORE STATE FUNDING  </P> <P> Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer's proposal that Ventura County notify the state  that it will cease to provide some essential services unless the state provides  money for them drew a mixed response from the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Schaefer wants the county to send its proposed 1990-91 budget to Gov. George  Deukmejian and the Legislature carrying a stamp of "NSF-insufficient funds,"  she said.  </P> <P> "We need to send a strong message that we just are not going to carry out these  programs," Schaefer said, referring to a variety of health, welfare, safety and  criminal justice services that the state requires but for which it provides  partial funding.  </P> <P> In response, veteran Supervisor James R. Dougherty told the board that Orange  County tried the same strategy several years ago, only to be directed by the  courts to provide the services.  </P> <P> Schaefer's proposal languished Tuesday, as did a suggestion by Supervisor Susan  K. Lacey that the board forward to both the Republican and Democratic  candidates for governor a statement of their concerns.  </P> <P> "We need to ask some very tough questions" of the candidates and force them to  take a stand, Lacey said.  </P></p>

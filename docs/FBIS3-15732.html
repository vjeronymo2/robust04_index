In his interview with Interfax Wednesday Movladiy  Udugov declared that Shakhray is directly responsible for the  destabilization of the situation in the North Caucuses and the  unsettledness of Russian- Chechen relations.    "We still hope that such politicians as Sergey Filatov or  Viktor Chernomyrdin (leader of presidential administration and  Russian premier -- INTERFAX) will take the negotiating process  under their control. In an adverse situation, if Russian  nationalities minister interferes into the negotiations they  will inevitably windup in a dead alley," said Udugov.    Udugov expressed the opinion that on the issue of Chechnya's  sovereignty (Chechnya insists on its official recognition) the  greatest disagreement will arise at the upcoming negotiations in  Moscow. In Udugov's opinion, it would be expedient to first  discuss those issues which are not so controversial and then to  start discussing the issue of Chechnya's independence.    "The Chechen party was always ready for negotiations with  Russia at any level and on any issue and we welcome the  statement of the head of the presidential administration Sergey  Filatov on the necessity to normalize relations with Chechnya,"  said Udugov.</p>

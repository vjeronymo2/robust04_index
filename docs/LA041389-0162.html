			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UCI, AFTER CRITICISM, TO OFFER LIBRARY POST TO LATINA  </P> <P> The UC Irvine Library, which has come under criticism for having no Latino  librarians and few other minority workers, will offer a post to a Latina  librarian this week, university officials confirmed Wednesday.  </P> <P> The candidate, who has indicated that she will accept the job if offered, could  begin work May 1, according to University Librarian Calvin Boyer. University  officials would say only that the librarian, whose name was not released, is  working at a university in the South.  </P> <P> William Parker, acting vice chancellor for research, said the candidate was  interviewed during a nationwide search and got the recommendation of the  Library Review Committee, which oversees hiring and promotions. He confirmed  that an offer will be extended to the woman this week.  </P> <P> The library currently has seven unfilled librarian positions and is  aggressively seeking qualified candidates from under-represented minority  groups, Boyer said. Library officials Tuesday interviewed three women,  including one black and one Asian, who are finalists for another pening.  </P> <P> The actions follow the recent departure of two black librarians and the  announcement that an Asian librarian plans to leave. All three are male.  </P> <P> In addition, women and minority employees have complained that they have been  unfairly denied raises and promotions and that the work environment is not  hospitable to minorities.  </P> <P> Of 50 librarians employed by UCI, five are Asians, one is black and none is  Latino. The support staff of 121, excluding student employees, includes 22  minority members.  </P> <P> Parker and Boyer have insisted that there is no pattern of discrimination in  the library, which promotes and issues raises following recommendations by a  peer review panel and approval by the office of academic affairs, headed by  Executive Vice Chancellor Chang-Lin Tien.  </P> <P> However, Parker confirmed that individual complaints are being reviewed and  that the library is examining ways to improve overall management.  </P> <P> "I would like to see rapid feedback on decisions, more frequent and candid  discussions between supervisors and librarians and more open discussions about  issues confronting librarians," said Parker, whose duties include the library.  "Those are the kinds of practices that will produce a more professional  environment; they are not in response to isolated cases."  </P> <P> Campus Ombudsman Ron Wilson, however, has charged that "institutional racism"  is perceived by some library employees and said that the library has not done  enough in the past to recruit and retain minority employees.  </P> <P> "The numbers speak for themselves," Wilson said. "If people don't feel welcome,  they are not going to come and stay. We can offer money, but what really  matters is freedom to do your work in a professional atmosphere, unencumbered  by ethnic insensitivity."  </P> <P> Wilson said that in an investigation this year, he substantiated complaints  that some library employees had mocked Asian and Middle Eastern library  patrons. A cultural-sensitivity workshop was subsequently scheduled for library  employees, but university officials said the session was planned before the  complaints arose.  </P> <P> The hiring of a Latino librarian was among the demands presented Monday by  student protesters who met with UCI Chancellor Jack W. Peltason, Executive Vice  Chancellor Chang-Lin Tien and other top administration officials. In addition,  the students called for increased recruitment of minority students and faculty,  establishment of an African studies department and increased funding for  minority programs.  </P> <P> Peltason told the students that almost 20% of new students admitted for the  fall semester are from under-represented minority groups, which at UCI are  blacks, Latinos, American Indians and Filipinos. In addition, Tien said that of  40 faculty positions for which offers have been made for the fall, 22 were  offered to minority or female candidates.  </P> <P> 'MULTI-CULTURAL'  </P> <P> UCI officials are considering such a course for all undergraduates.

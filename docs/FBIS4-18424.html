			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anita Krantz: "Environment Makes Minister </F> Hesitate"]    [Excerpt] It does not go without saying that Environmental  Affairs Minister Olof Johansson (Center Party) will vote in  favor of EU [European Union] membership for environmental  reasons, even though he was personally responsible for the  negotiations on environmental policy in Brussels.    "Many people say the EU is sufficient to solve our  environmental problems. They do not know what they are talking  about," Johansson said during a lunch break during a ministers'  meeting of the Nordic Council at the Riksdag building in  Stockholm.  <H5>  Center and Social Democrats Most Split </H5>   He has not yet taken an overall position on membership.    The Social Democrats and the Center Party are the two  parties  that are most divided over the EU issue. Unlike Social Democrat  Ingvar Carlsson, Johansson believes that a party leader cannot  push his personal views on the EU question. If the Center Party  Assembly wants the party to oppose the EU in the referendum,  then Johansson must support that position.    Thus, he finds it difficult to understand how Carlsson  believes he can stay on as party chairman and speak in favor of  EU membership if the party recommends that the people oppose it.    Carlsson has stated that it is the people who will  ultimately  decide in the referendum. Then all members of Riksdag will have  to accommodate themselves -- for example, Gudrun Schyman of the  Left Party may have to press the yes button.  <H5>  Wants To Be In Step With Party </H5>   Johansson believes it is his duty to "be in step with the  party." He also believes that Carlsson and others who have taken  a position have done so for ideological reasons.    "But then the negotiations are less important. They are  almost irrelevant. I believe this is an issue for party  platforms.    ``In the position Ingvar Carlsson has taken, I would not  stay  on as party leader if the party was of a different opinion.''  <H5>  Has Not Taken a Position </H5>   Johansson maintains that he has still not taken even a  personal position. A number of questions are still being  negotiated, such as how many votes Sweden will have in the  Council of Ministers.    "The Swedish debate is also ignoring what will happen on the  national scene. I am against any attempt to use the results of  the EU negotiations in regional and agriculture policy or in any  other area to reduce our national efforts."  <H5>  Responsibility for Important Areas </H5>   The Center Party was responsible for three of the most  important areas in the EU negotiations: agriculture, regional  policy, and the environment. Johansson believes they exceeded  expectations in the first two areas and, based on the results of  the negotiations, they make him "lean toward a yes vote."    On the other hand, Johansson believes that the EU is not  very  good at tackling the world's environmental problems.    He still remembers quite well that the EU countries could  not  agree to support a carbon dioxide tax at the world environmental  conference in Rio in 1992.    Environmental Affairs Minister Johansson has noted that EU  countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, and Denmark would  like very much to see Sweden, with its good reputation in  environmental policy, become a member and help push  environmental issues.  <H5>  Good Results of Negotiations </H5>   Despite everything, the results of the negotiations are  good,  according to Johansson, considering the strong interests of  industry, agriculture, and transport in the EC countries.    These interests saw Sweden's environmental demands as an  overriding threat to free competition, which seems to be more  important than a better environment and health protection in  some cases, according to Johansson's impressions of the  negotiations.    Sweden was given a transition period of four years and may  not have to lower its environmental standards after that period.  If the Swedes adapt to the tougher attitude around the  negotiating table in Brussels, then Sweden can be a driving  force in the future, as well, Johansson believes.    "It is a real battle. You have to be damn strong and  single-minded." [passage omitted]</p>

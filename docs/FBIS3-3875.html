In the past two years the practice of notarization of  technological contracts has caught on in Wuhan.    Last year there were a total of 862 science and technology  trade contracts handled by notaries public, nearly 40 times more  than in 1991.    The volume of trade notarized has reached over 12 million  yuan (about 1.3 million U.S. dollars)-worth in the city.    Wuhan boasts 35 universities and colleges, and nearly 500  scientific institutes which are active in research and  technological development.    In order to strengthen mutual trust in the course of  technology trade, notary offices first started experiments with  scientific and technological trade documents in 1991.    For example, in 1992 the Wuhan Jianmin Pharmaceuticals  Factory spent 350,000 yuan to buy the technology for making a  new medicine from an army hospital. Both sides were somewhat  worried about the result of the completion of the contract.    But the notarization of the contract put them at ease. The  new product helped the factory achieve an output value of 3.81  million yuan (about 400,000 U.S. dollars) last year. It has  already been exported to Southeast Asian countries.</p>

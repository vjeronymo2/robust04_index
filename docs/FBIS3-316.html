The  deadline for the registration of political parties to take part  in the elections is midnight tomorrow. Candidates' lists should  be in by 1600 on 9 March.

Obviously that is a matter for Parliament to decide if there is  to be any further postponements. But in terms of logistics, the  printing of ballot papers and various such matters, it would be  extremely difficult to effect further changes. [end recording]</p>

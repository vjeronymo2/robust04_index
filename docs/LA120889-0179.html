			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 816 THRIFTS REPORTED NOT UP TO STANDARDS  </P> <P> About 800 of the nation's 2,700 federally chartered thrifts failed to meet a  crucial test of their financial health and could face regulatory action, a  Florida research company said today.  </P> <P> Under new requirements imposed by the federal government Thursday, thrifts must  have a higher capital cushion in relation to the size of their total loans  outstanding. Those who failed the test will be given until Feb. 5 to come up  with additional reserves, but many thrifts will ultimately be closed.  </P> <P> The research company, Bauer Financial Reports Inc., estimated that 816 thrifts  would fail to meet the new capital guidelines. Bauer said its analysis was  based on quarterly data for thrifts, as reported to federal regulators for the  period ended June 30, the most recent figures available.  </P></p>

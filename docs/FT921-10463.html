			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Observer: Chuffed What is Wales coming to? First, the Bank of Scotland is allowed to gobble up the Bank of Wales, and now another member of the Edinburgh financial mafia - Bell Lawrie White &amp; Co - is appointed as joint stockbrokers to Welsh Water, the principality's biggest company. Bell Lawrie White is very diplomatic about its coup, stressing that it is its two-year-old Cardiff office, staffed by Welsh speakers, which won the job. Even so it is yet another sign that when it comes to financial business, Wales lives on a branch line. The Scots wouldn't put up with it.</p>

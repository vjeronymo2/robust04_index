			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Paris promises farm aid and firm stance THE French government yesterday promised its farmers FFr1.5bn (Pounds 180m) in extra national aid, but assured them that it should still firmly defend French agricultural interests in the Gatt talks on world trade. The aid was hailed as 'a significant first step' by Mr Luc Guyau, head of the two largest farm unions which met Prime Minister Edouard Balladur yesterday, but it was denounced as 'derisory tinkering' by several smaller, more militant organisations which were not invited to yesterday's meeting. The aid package consists chiefly of a cut in the farmland tax, bigger grants for young farmers, and an increased premium for farmers to graze livestock over a bigger acreage and therefore farm less intensively, which is also a goal of the EC agricultural reform. Spread over 1m farmers, the money is relatively insignificant, though it comes as Mr Balladur plans to raise taxes and cut some spending in his new budget on Monday. The prime minister's tactic is to try to appease the farmers while he seeks to direct Gatt negotiators' attention to other, non-agricultural sticking points in the world trade talks. 'I want to put an end to this idea of our partners that France has only one aim, which is to prevent a trade agreement simply because of French farmers  -this is false,' Mr Balladur said yesterday. He will put the finishing touches at next Wednesday's cabinet meeting to a memo to France's EC partners, detailing what Paris believes should be Europe's aims in all 15 areas of the Gatt negotiations.</p>

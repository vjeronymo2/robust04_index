			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The Serbian Assembly is to start its first  regular session today at which it is to elect the new Serbian  Government. Zoran Vaskovic reports from the Assembly building.    [Begin Vaskovic recording] Mirko Marjanovic, prime  minister-elect, is first expected to present his program and  propose the ministers for the new government. A debate is  expected to follow. The vote will be in a package, as the saying  goes, and secret, unless the deputies decide that the vote  should be public. The government will be elected if over half  the deputies in the Assembly, that is, at least 126 deputies,  decide to give it a vote of confidence. [passage omitted]    Radio Belgrade will broadcast in full the presentation of  Prime Minister-elect Marjanovic. At the moment there are still  some empty seats in the hall, but the deputies are arriving.  This is all for now from the Serbian Assembly building.</p>

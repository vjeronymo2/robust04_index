			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ciro Ortega from the "RPC Television News" </F> newscast]    [Text] President Guillermo Endara Galimany has filed a  lawsuit against Jaime Padilla Beliz, editor of the newspaper EL  SIGLO, alleging slander and libel.    The president has voiced his anger over a report published  today in EL SIGLO. The report refers to statements by  journalist and attorney Jaime Padilla Beliz who said it was  learned the very president of the Republic was threatening one  of the Electoral Tribunal magistrates with firing his wife from  a position to which she was recently appointed if he rules in  favor of Mayin Correa, Panama City mayoral candidate, in a case  at the Electoral Tribunal.    [Begin recording] [Endara] I am suing him for slander,  because it is absolutely false I threatened an Electoral  Tribunal official with dismissals or any other measure. The  meetings and conversations I have held with Electoral Tribunal  officials have dealt with what the president can do to benefit  the elections.    The conversations with Electoral Tribunal officials have  been  limited to budgetary concerns, special credits, and making their  job easier. That is the only relationship I have maintained  with the Electoral Tribunal magistrates.    [Unidentified reporter] Mr. President, the fact your wife is  also running for mayor of Panama City may create a conflict of  interest; what is your opinion?    [Endara] I definitely have an interest. I am not going to  lie and say I have no interest. I have an interest, but as  president of the Republic I will not do anything in favor of  that candidacy. [end recording]    Meanwhile, Jaime Padilla Beliz, EL SIGLO editor, is out of  the country and is unavailable for comment on the president's  lawsuit.    On the other hand, Endara Galimany said he met with labor  leaders of the ports and tourism taxi association as well as  employees of the duty-free shops to analyze the crisis generated  by the closing of the so-called duty-free shops.    [Begin recording] [Endara] The solution is for them to sell  items that interest tourists. As is known, here in Panama there  are a series of items, electronics, calculators, radios, tape  recorders, etc., in which tourists are especially interested.  The import duty on these items is nearly zero, precisely to  attract tourists. Those shops must sell items for tourists.  [end recording]    The president expressed his optimism over the results of  this  meeting, but he did not specify when he will define the status  of the duty-free shops.</p>

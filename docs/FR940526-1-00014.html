Description of the Proposed Amendment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By letter dated May 17, 1994 (Administrative Record No. OH&hyph;2017), the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Reclamation (Ohio), submitted proposed Program Amendment Number 67. In this amendment, Ohio proposes to revise one rule at Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) section 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;17 to make the Ohio program as effective as the corresponding Federal regulations concerning postmining land uses. The specific rule revisions proposed by Ohio in this amendment are briefly described below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Postmining land use categories: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Ohio is revising paragraphs (C)(1) through (C)(11) to clarify the titles of the eleven approved postmining land use categories. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mining prior to April 10, 1972: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Ohio is revising paragraph (B)(1) to clarify that the postmining land use for land that was mined pursuant to a license issued prior to April 10, 1972, shall be judged on the basis of the highest and best use that can be achieved which is compatible with surrounding areas and does not require the disturbance of areas previously unaffected by mining. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comparison of postmining and premining land uses: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Ohio is deleting the existing requirement in paragraph (B)(2) that, if the premining land use was changed within five years of the beginning of mining, the postmining land use shall be compared to the historic use of the land as well as its use immediately before mining. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Undeveloped land use: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Ohio is adding a new requirement in paragraph (B)(2) that land may be returned to the undeveloped postmining land use category only if the land was categorized as undeveloped prior to mining. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ohio is revising paragraph (C) to require that all proposed changes of land use, including changes from undeveloped land to forestland or fish and wildlife habitat, shall be considered an alternative land use change subject to approval by the Chief of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Reclamation (the Chief). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ohio is deleting the existing requirement in paragraph (D)(8) that plans to change the postmining land use to undeveloped land from some other land use category must treat the land as if the postmining land use were in the forestland/fish and wildlife habitat category. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Forestland and Fish and Wildlife Habitat: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Ohio is revising paragraphs (C)(9) and (C)(10) to clarify that ``forestland'' and ``fish and wildlife habitat'' are distinct postmining land uses. The ``forest'' category includes land used for commercial or noncommercial production of wood or wood products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Agency review of postmining land uses: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Ohio is deleting the existing requirement in paragraph (D)(1) that requests for alternative postmining land use must contain a written statement of views from the authorities having statutory responsibilities for land use policies and plans. Ohio is also deleting the requirement in paragraph (D)(1) that the operator must obtain any required approval of the final land use from local, State, or Federal land management agencies, including any necessary zoning or other required changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ohio is revising paragraph (D)(6) to clarify that, for approval by the Chief, proposed alternative postmining land uses must identify measures to prevent or mitigate adverse effects on fish and wildlife and on threatened or endangered plants or animals or their critical habitats and must demonstrate that an opportunity to comment has been provided in accordance with OAC section 1501:13&hyph;9&hyph;11 to appropriate State and Federal fish and wildlife management agencies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ohio is deleting the existing requirement in paragraph (D)(9) that alternative postmining land use plans must demonstrate that the operator has provided written notice of the proposed land use to appropriate State and Federal agencies with instructions for those agencies to provide any comments on the proposed land use to the Chief. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Design of postmining land use plans by an engineer: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Ohio is deleting the existing requirement at paragraph (D)(2) that postmining land use plans must be designed under the general supervision of a registered engineer or other appropriate professional. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III.

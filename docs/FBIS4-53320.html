			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- The main opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) ran aground in its bid to take over a key  parliamentary committee Tuesday [17 May] when the second largest  opposition Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] kept  its distance, opposition sources said.    SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said, "the party should  distance itself from both the ruling coalition and the LDP."    Murayama told a party meeting, "we cannot allow this issue  to  undermine the unity of our party."    Murayama referred to an objection from the largest SDPJ  intraparty group, the democrats, to an LDP-sponsored motion to  dismiss the chairman of the House of Representatives steering  committee who is a senior member of the coalition's core party  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party].    Following the SDPJ's decision, the lower house will shelve  the motion aimed at relieving Keiwa Okuda from duties as  chairman of the steering committee, a key body which sets  schedules for Diet business.    The LDP, which is poised to table a no-confidence motion  against the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata after the  passage of the fiscal 1994 budget, submitted the motion against  Okuda last week.    As the largest single party in parliament and also as the  No.  1 opposition party, the LDP submitted the anti-Okuda motion in a  bid to reestablish its leading role in setting the course of  parliamentary business.    The democrats, an SDPJ intraparty bloc of 23 members in the  lower house, decided Sunday not to support the anti-Okuda motion.    Meanwhile, the SDPJ's Diet Affairs Committee Chairman, Koken  Nosaka, asked the LDP on Tuesday to allow the Diet to defer a  ballot on the motion despite the earlier SDPJ-LDP accord to take  concerted action on the motion, SDPJ officials said.    Nosaka also contacted Shinseito, asking for its consent to  replace Okuda shortly after the parliamentary passage of the  long-overdue fiscal 1994 budget, which is expected to be passed  in late June, they said.    Shinseito rejected the request, saying it will not comply  with the plea at least until the current regular Diet session  adjourns. The session is to expire June 29, but its term could  be extended.</p>

			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Japanese guru starts pressure group MR Kenichi Ohmae, Japan's most famous management guru, plans an attempt to break the mould of Japanese politics by launching a pressure group to champion the cause of radical political reform. Mr Ohmae, chairman of the Japanese operations of McKinsey and Co, management consultants, is a household name in Japanese business after publishing more than 30 books on management. He describes his group, dubbed The Reform of Heisei, as a grass-roots organisation which will offer a third choice between the ruling Liberal Democratic party and the Socialist parties. The grouping will promote the reform of Japan's political institutions by offering to support politicians who endorse its goals. A reform of the electoral system widely blamed for encouraging politicians to seek illegal corporate donations is likely to be a central issue for the group. Mr Ohmae was named the nation's most influential leader of public opinion by a recent survey of more than 700 prominent Japanese. Mr Ohmae's group is unlikely to stage a significant challenge but it could provide a focal point for the public outcry of the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin scandal which has exposed links between LDP leaders, allegedly corrupt businessmen and organised crime syndicates. The initiative is likely to put pressure on the LDP to offer more far-reaching proposals for political reform. The scandal has led to a vicious power struggle within the LDP. A two-week stalemate between the LDP and the opposition parties over which LDP leaders should testify to the parliament over their involvement in the affair has delayed passage of the supplementary budget needed to implement the Y10,700bn (Pounds 57bn) emergency spending package announced in August. There were signs last night that the parties were edging towards a compromise on the testimony issue to allow debate on the budget to proceed.</p>

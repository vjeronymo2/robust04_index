			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Levashev: "March Bankruptcy"] </F>   [Text] Regardless of what the final percentage of the  citizens who turned out for the elections may have been, one  thing is now clear: The elections failed. The St. Petersburg  voter expressed his attitude toward the unprecedented farce and  direct insult to elementary moral sensibilities which bore the  name "Elections-94."    Not one of the possible deputies to the City Assembly could  work normally. The ballot boxes, which in many precincts were  left for the night unsealed and without protection, raise doubts  about the legitimacy of any of them and make inevitable the  litigation they will be involved in with their rivals who were  undeservedly defeated.    The only way official authority, which is bankrupt in the  eyes of the people themselves, can be saved would be to  immediately cancel all the results of the voting on 20 March as  not expressing the position of the voters. That is if you  consider it in terms of jurisprudence. And as for real life...    Let this endless reading on the radio of endless lists of  names of candidates remain only as a nightmare in our memories.    Let us have nothing but a memory of the 15 (!) electoral  blocs made up of such mutually exclusive individuals that you  automatically grab your head and ask outloud: "When were we  deceived? Throughout the four years before these elections or  just during the past two months of the election campaign?"    How can a bloc which bears the proud name of "Democratic  Unity of St. Petersburg" and claims to represent democracy "on  behalf of and on instructions from" all St. Petersburg, appeal  to the mayor and request, beg from him, two or three more hours  of voting, another 2-3 percent of the vote?    Has our voter really been denied his rights once again and  been unable to see anyone but people who think about only one  thing--about power--and aspire to only one thing--to power? How  was it possible to conduct such an election campaign--without  once appearing before the voter, without communicating with him  even once? Which psychologists and other specialists in waging  election campaigns advised the candidates to do this?    It is up to us to make sure that such a thing never happens  again. We must make sure that the billions of rubles and  hundreds of thousands of dollars thrown at this phantasmagoric  spectacle will find a better use. For now we must live with the  powers we have. "Do not count your chickens before they  hatch"--even we will not manage to put the cart before the horse.    And another useful thing to remember. All discussion to the  effect that some local authority we have elected in St.  Petersburg will independently solve all of our problems is a  fiction. As long as the present topsy-turvyness continues in  Russia, local authorities will be needed for only one thing--to  come another step or half step closer to the big Moscow trough  that feeds all the cities, villages, and field camps of the  boundless Rus with the ruble as it loses its value.    Perhaps our voter has understood this as well.</p>

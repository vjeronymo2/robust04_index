			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Solchaga blames Germans''perverse' policy mix SPAIN'S finance minister, Mr Carlos Solchaga, yesterday criticised Germany for exacerbating difficulties in the European monetary system (EMS). Mr Solchaga said German interest rates, having suffered the consequences of German unification, currently reflected 'a policy mix that has traditionally been considered perverse'. He compared German spending to that by the US in the 1960s 'which led to the irreversible collapse of the Bretton Woods agreements'. At a Financial Times conference on Spain and Europe, Mr Solchaga said a redirection of the German policy mix was a 'herculean task' that the German monetary authorities were addressing and which all parties concerned realised would take time. He argued however that 'the maintenance of a strong D-Mark and a co-ordinated, and possibly not homogenous, reduction of European interest rates' should not be mutually exclusive. Mr Solchaga said Spain was 'willing to back any Community agreement aimed at solving the EMS crisis that began in September'. The UK and Italy withdrew from the system in the midst of the currency turmoil two months ago, and Spain, together with other Community partners, introduced currency exchange restrictions in order to maintain their currencies within the EMS. Mr Solchaga said that even if a realignment were politically possible, little would be gained unless all the EC members were 'simultaneously able to end the current anomalous situation of the EMS'. Mr Solchaga said that Spain was determined to meet the criteria for economic and monetary union and would pursue convergence policies.</p>

			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VICTIM IN MANDELA SCANDAL BURIED;  </P> <P> SEIPEI, 14, EULOGIZED AS FREEDOM FIGHTER IN S. AFRICA RITES  </P> <P> A thousand singing and chanting mourners turned out in this rural black  township Saturday to bury favored son Stompie Mokhetsi Seipei, the 14-year-old  militant anti-apartheid leader whose murder has been blamed on Winnie Mandela's  band of young bodyguards.  </P> <P> "Stompie, your terribly violent death was an unspeakable crime," Methodist  Bishop Peter Storey said as he gazed at the small, gray and white wooden  casket. "But your childhood was already dead. South Africa took away your  innocence."  </P> <P> The white-haired clergyman then voiced a plea for the country's black majority  to heal the wounds created by allegations against Mandela and her live-in  bodyguards, the so-called Mandela United soccer club.  </P> <P> "Retaliation cannot bring this child back to life," Storey said. "Do not injure  Stompie further by using this funeral as a platform for revenge."  </P> <P> Mourners stood atop the wooden pews in St. John the Baptist Church, singing  freedom songs, clapping their hands and chanting support for the guerrilla war  being waged against Pretoria by the exiled African National Congress.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Young Lion'  </P> <P> Stompie was eulogized as a courageous freedom fighter, "a young lion" of the  liberation movement who, at the age of 11, was the youngest person ever  detained by the South African authorities and who later commanded a  1,000-strong army of children under 14 in this township.  </P> <P> But the funeral and burial here, 75 miles south of Johannesburg, was subdued  compared to other political funerals in South Africa in recent years. No one  mentioned the special circumstances of Stompie's death. And neither Mandela nor  any members of her bodyguard force were present -- or mentioned by name.  </P> <P> Stompie and three men in their 20s were abducted Dec. 29 from the Methodist  church home of the Rev. Paul Verryn, a white pastor, in the sprawling Soweto  township near Johannesburg. Police and civic leaders say the kidnapers were  members of Mandela United, the controversial soccer club whose members serve as  live-in bodyguards for Mandela, wife of jailed nationalist leader Nelson R.  Mandela.  </P> <P> The four were taken to Mandela's red-brick Soweto home, where they were beaten,  according to police and sources in the township. The body of Stompie, whom  Mandela United members had accused of being a police informer, was found eight  days later. He had been beaten beyond recognition and stabbed in the throat,  the coroner said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Two Charged  </P> <P> One of the three survivors escaped and the other two were released after  anti-apartheid leaders intervened with Mandela. So far, the soccer team coach  and a team member have been charged with murder in the case. The team bus  driver has been arrested but not charged.  </P> <P> Mandela, who has denied involvement in Stompie's death, claims her bodyguards  were trying to protect the four men, whom she asserted were being sexually  molested by Verryn, the pastor. Verryn and the Methodist church deny the  assertions.  </P> <P> Resentment over the team's activities has been growing for months in Soweto,  and anti-apartheid activists fear that community anger with the Mandela soccer  club already has spilled over into a bloody factional war.  </P> <P> A Mandela United team member was killed last month, for example, and on  Wednesday a 13-year-old was shot to death when a gang of unidentified men  opened fire on the home of activists accused in the team member's murder.  </P> <P> The ANC, the primary guerrilla group fighting white-minority rule, issued a  statement Saturday from its exile headquarters in Zambia calling on blacks to  avoid "fratricidal" attacks in the townships.  </P> <P> The message here also was conciliatory.  </P> <P> "We shouldn't point fingers at other people," said McLean Skhosane, a Tumahole  political activist who conducted the funeral. "Stompo was interested in unity.  Let his death not divide us."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mandela Criticized  </P> <P> Leading anti-apartheid activists, angered by the soccer team's activities and  Mandela's unwillingness to disband the group, recently called on South African  blacks to distance themselves from Mandela.  </P> <P> Saturday's funeral was the first for a political activist not restricted by  authorities since the current state of emergency was declared in 1986. Some  political analysts say that Mandela's troubles, and the rivalries among  anti-apartheid groups, help bolster government assertions that a South Africa  under black rule would be characterized by violent disagreements.  </P> <P> "The government likes to say this was just another case of blacks killing  blacks," the Rev. Lewis Balink, the church pastor, said before the services  began. "But the people know better. They know it was the system (apartheid)  that killed him."  </P> <P> "We confess with shame the way it (Stompie's life) was ended," Storey said in  his funeral prayer. "(But) this land's violence can insinuate itself into all  our souls."  </P> <P> Verryn spoke for the first time publicly since the four men were abducted from  his church hostel, which has provided shelter in Soweto to hundreds of young  activists such as Stompie.  </P> <P> "I have lost a friend. I have lost someone who has challenged me. I have lost a  freedom fighter," Verryn said of Stompie. "May his soul rest in peace."  </P></p>

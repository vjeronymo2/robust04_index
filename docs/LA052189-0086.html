			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN UNCHANGED HEART  </P> <P> This is one fan who has not had a "change of heart" over the casting of Michael  Keaton as Batman in the upcoming movie (Pat H. Broeske's "Man Behind the Mask,"  May 14).  </P> <P> Keaton, as talented as he is, lacks the physical presence to make you believe  he could intimidate criminals. Keaton isn't a wimp; he just doesn't project the  toughness of a Sean Connery or Clint Eastwood.  </P> <P> Jack Nicholson as the Joker, . . . well, maybe 15 years ago. The Joker is  supposed to be very thin, something 'ole Jack hasn't been in a while. Also,  let's face facts: Jack has been playing a caricature of himself for his last  six or more films. (Think of James Woods or Willem Dafoe going all out with  this character!)  </P> <P> SAM F. PARK  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Clarke cracks down on tax avoidance - Taxation loopholes THE MEASURE A number of tax loopholes are being closed in order to tighten up on tax avoidance. These include payment of employees in what Mr Clarke described as 'gold bars, coffee beans, cowrie shells or other exotic payments in kind' to avoid National Insurance; the abuse of tax relief for profit-related pay; an end to the use of shell companies to avoid payment of tax; an end to the use of indexation to create or increase capital gains tax losses; and an end to the abuse of funded unapproved retirement benefit schemes (FURBS). IN DETAIL Employers will have to pay National Insurance on payments in kind of the type described by Mr Clarke, or vouchers representing them, from midnight last night. The advantage to employees was that they could delay payment of income tax on pay in this form, but this will also be stopped after the finance bill becomes law. Two loopholes have been closed on profit-related pay for schemes registered from today. The percentage of salary paid to an employee under an artificial scheme to increase the amount of PRP received by a small group of employees can no longer be greater than for the rest of the workforce. Also, where profits are artificially increased by salary sacrifices the company will no longer be able to place an artificial limit on the amount of PRP. Shell companies have been used to avoid tax by stripping a company of its assets and leaving its tax liabilities intact through a change of ownership. Anyone who sells a company from today where a number of conditions are fulfilled, including a significant reduction in trade in the three years prior to the sale, will have to pay the tax if the company does not do so. An employee receiving benefit from today from an offshore FURBS will pay tax at his marginal rate on the difference between what he receives and contributions made by the employer or employee. The change to capital gains tax indexation relief is substantial. The value of this relief has been reduced with the announcement that CGT indexation will be limited to reducing gains only and will no longer be able to used to turn a gain into a loss or to create a loss if one had not been made. However, a new loophole seems to have been opened. Investors can roll over gains, for tax purposes, by buying shares in an unquoted trading company. THE BACKGROUND Payment of employees in exotica has often been used by employers to avoid paying national insurance contributions usually for large employee bonuses. CGT indexation has been used to mitigate tax on gains. 'The change in the rules is not merely stopping a loophole,' said David Rothenberg of Blick Rothenberg, chartered accountants. 'It represents a fundamental change for a large number of individuals who, for example, might have lost money on the sale of a second home. It has reduced the value of almost all CGT losses.' FURBS are top-up pension schemes for higher earners. Although the employees are taxed when the employer makes contributions, they can take out the benefits free of tax. By establishing a FURBS offshore, the fund can avoid paying UK tax on both income and capital gains. The chancellor's measure prevents the employee enjoying the benefit of this tax-free roll-up. On PRP, David Cohen of Paisner &amp; Co said: 'The ethos of a PRP scheme is that there should be a direct link between the profits made by a business and the extra salary paid. The chancellor has closed two loopholes which have enabled employers to sever that link, but many companies will still be able to use PRP to achieve significant savings.'</p>

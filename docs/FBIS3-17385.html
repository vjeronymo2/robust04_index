By the document, the Crimean Army Commander Aleksandr Volkov  is instructed to carry out the drafting this spring of young men  born in 1976. He has reportedly been trying to get in touch  with Meshkov to discuss the matter.    "I do not obey the Crimean President Meshkov and will comply  with instructions from the Ukrainian president," he stressed  and added that the spring draft would tally with earlier planned  targets.</p>

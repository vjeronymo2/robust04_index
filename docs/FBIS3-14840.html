By this decision, the court satisfied the suit  against the regional election commission filed by a former  candidate of the same constituency, head of the Moscow  anti-trust committee, Doctor of Economics, Professor Oleg  Novikov.    In an interview with Interfax, Novikov said his action was  caused by "numerous gross violations" of the regulations for the  election of deputies to the State Duma approved by the Russian  president.    In particular, the candidate withdrawn by the election bloc  "Yabloko" in favor of Novikov was not crossed out of the ballot  paper.    In its materials handed over to the mass media, the election  commission described Novikov, who was nominated as an  independent candidate and canvassed about 6,000 signatures in  his support, as a candidate of "Russia's Choice."    In addition, the commission failed to provide all candidates  with equal access to television so that they could lay down  their programs. According to Novikov, he was not even given a  10-minute televised statement envisioned by the election  regulations.    According to Russia's legislation, the court decision may be  appealed against within a period of 10 days. Otherwise, it will  be automatically enforced.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman Gyula </F> Horn by Mihaly Bak; place and date not given: "Politics and  Coalition Are Not Pure Mathematics"]    [Text] The Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] does not  consider the issue of the accident closed, Gyula Horn has said.  They wish to form a coalition with the Alliance of Free  Democrats [SZDSZ], and this will have to be decided by the  programs. Personal issues cannot be of major importance.    [Bak] The interior minister expressed his indignation  because you had cast doubt over the police's unbiased  investigation and had not excluded the possibility of  premeditated attack. This phase of the investigation was closed  last week. Are you more relaxed now?    [Horn] The television program "A Het" has adhered to its  former practice and again failed to ask me. I would have told  them that the police had not supported its claim with anything.  This is the reason we do not consider the investigation closed.  The statements made by the car's passengers were not taken into  consideration.    [Bak] According to the police, apart from personal guard  Jeno Zsidey, no one else mentioned any phenomena that might cast  doubt on the accident verdict. According to our information,  others have mentioned similar things.    [Horn] I am not familiar with the statements by the others,  but I also saw the flash. I told this to the policeman in  Miskolc. I am sorry the police issued a statement the day after  the accident and it did not want to change this later.    [Bak] In fact, statements that were contradictory in certain  details have been published.    [Horn] This is true. Make no mistake, we are not seeking  anything in the background. We would have preferred the police  to make an official statement when all details were known. This  is one of the reasons the MSZP is not leaving events at that.    [Bak] According to a recent view, it is a conscious goal of  the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] for the MSZP to gain as big  a majority as possible because then the SZDSZ would not join it  in a coalition.    [Horn] I cannot see much change in the MDF's style. It  continues to see the MSZP as its main opponent, although the MDF  is unlikely to be in competition in the second round. It is  useless to frighten the citizens with our "too much of a  victory." We will find out after the elections who can work  together with whom. Regardless of our results, we still want a  coalition.    [Bak] Many members of the SZDSZ are worried that the MSZP  will achieve a parliamentary majority on its own and then the  SZDSZ will have very little say in the decisions.    [Horn] Politics is not pure mathematics. Those who are  afraid of our "too much of a victory" -- for example the MDF --  take themselves as an example. In our view, a political style  that is different from the current one is the basis of the  coalition.    [Bak] In multiparty parliamentary systems, the decisive  majority of a single party is undesirable.    [Horn] Very clear rules of cooperation are needed between  the partners. What the Christian Democratic People's Party  [KDNP] says, namely that it only bears responsibility for the  government's decisions in proportion to its weight in the  coalition, cannot be repeated. Without the KDNP, many harmful  laws could not have been made. Anyway, what should we do?  Shall we say to the voters that you have voted for us but do  not do it again?    [Bak] On which points do you see much difference in the  programs?    [Horn] It is important what we do with the distribution  systems, namely the health service and social security. There  is a difference in the programs on creating workplaces. In our  view, it is not enough to stimulate the enterprises to create  workplaces. We see this as an overall government program. In  my view, there is a good chance of achieving agreement on this  issue.    [Bak] In your view, how united is the SZDSZ in the desire to  form a coalition?    [Horn] They have a big debate. I have spoken to many of  their leaders in recent days. In my experience, some of them  definitely want to participate in the coalition. However, it is  impossible without compromises.    [Bak] The MSZP also has debates. To what extent will these  influence the future talks?    [Horn] A small part of the membership and the politically  influential people dispute the views of the majority. This  equally applies to the so-called liberal and the  popular-national wings. Both of these are a negligible minority  compared with the center but their voice is always louder.    [Bak] Do you agree that your accident was useful to a number  of people in the party? To a certain extent, you have been  pushed into the background compared to others.    [Horn] This would be true if I was mentally less able than  before. I would not like to upset anyone but I am on the same  level as before.    [Bak] Nevertheless, you are restricted from participating in  daily politics.    [Horn] The doctors asked me to take it easy in the interest  of rehabilitation. However, the injury did not influence the  big issue, namely the elections that were decided a few days  after the accident. I am to participate in a number of campaign  debates in the coming days. I know that viewers will have some  aesthetic hardship looking at my "spaceship gear." Perhaps some  will believe that I get inspiration through this. As a matter  of fact, in my view, it would not alter the results if the  parties did not campaign between the two rounds. It is unlikely  that people who have decided whom to vote for can be influenced  now. The general public is not much interested in the messages  sent by the political elite to each other.</p>

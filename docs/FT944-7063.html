			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Jobcentre staff asked to cut hours Staff in the government's employment service in London and the south-east are being urged to take unpaid leave over Christmas or cut their working hours because of overspending in the service's budget and the drop in the volume of work because of falling unemployment. Mr David Lifton, the service's deputy regional director, says in a letter to 11,500 Jobcentre staff that the situation has arisen 'because the numbers of unemployed in the region have fallen much faster than anticipated'. Mr Lifton tells staff that the service will have to shed staff because of the continuing fall in unemployment. He adds that the service has laid off 750 casual staff as a cost-cutting measure but is replacing them with staff from offices outside London who are staying at hotels and given travel allowances and Pounds 20 per day expenses. The abolition of casual worker contracts is aimed to contain spending and match staff levels more closely with workloads. Paid overtime has also been ended. The London and south-east region is offering a number of options for staff who might be considering work breaks or a reduction in their working hours. This can involve unpaid leave from December 5 to January 5, unpaid leave during January to March, or a cut in hours and/or the possibility of a job share. A spokesman from the Department of Employment said no other region was suffering from the same problem as London and the south-east. Mr Ian McCartney, Labour's shadow employment minister, accused Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, of being 'unable to manage the spending of his own department'. He said: 'It seems to be a complete shambles. There must be a full, frank and public explanation about how this farce has been allowed to come about.'</p>

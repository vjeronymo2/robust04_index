			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Virgin in stores deal with US video chain MR RICHARD Branson's Virgin Group yesterday announced a joint venture with Blockbuster Entertainment, the Florida-based video rental company, with the aim of building music mega-stores in every large US city and throughout much of Europe. The joint venture will own Virgin's retail outlets in the US, continental Europe and Australia. It will not affect Virgin's retail outlets in the UK, where it has a joint venture with retailer WH Smith, or in Japan, where it is linked with the Marui retail chain. Virgin and Blockbuster will have equal shares in Virgin's 14 stores in continental Europe and Australia. They will also equally own Virgin's store in Los Angeles, which is due to open next month. Virgin said it hoped to double its European presence, with the two joint venture partners funding expansion equally. Blockbuster's acquisition of the European and Australian stakes will result in a large payment to Virgin, although no amount was disclosed yesterday. With the exception of the Los Angeles store, Blockbuster will own 75 per cent of the US venture, with Virgin retaining the remaining 25 per cent. The joint venture hopes to open stores throughout the US, with Blockbuster providing most of the funding. The stores will be managed by Virgin. Blockbuster and Virgin will have equal representation on the board of the US joint venture. Virgin will have the option to increase its stake to 35 per cent over the next three years. Blockbuster last month announced an agreement to buy 236 Music Plus and Sound Warehouse music stores in the US from companies controlled by Shamrock Holdings of California, an investment group controlled by Mr Roy Disney, Walt Disney's nephew. Virgin said the link with Blockbuster would enable it to offer video rentals in its new US music stores. Competing US music outlets already offered such a service. Blockbuster last January bought Cityvision of the UK, owner of the Ritz chain, making it the biggest video rental operation in the US and Britain. Virgin is also looking at opportunities for expansion in south-east Asia.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Nadir says tapes of ministers 'prove' conspiracy MR ASIL NADIR, the fugitive businessman, yesterday made his most extraordinary assertion since jumping bail by claiming that he has tapes of government ministers and officials which 'prove' there was a conspiracy to bring down his former company, Polly Peck International. The latest allegation in his war of words with the British authorities came as Lord McAlpine, former treasurer of the Conservative party, said he had made a misjudgment in accepting donations to the party from Mr Nadir. Separately, accountants acting on behalf of the creditors of Mr Nadir and his companies said they were considering action to recover the donations made by companies associated with Mr Nadir, which amounted to Pounds 440,000 in the five years to 1990. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Nadir refused to reveal the names of ministers he says are on the tapes or how he came by the alleged recordings. He also declined to say if the ministers were recorded in conversation with him or with another party. Downing Street said last night it was not aware of Mr Nadir's claims to be in possession of tape recordings of cabinet ministers. Lord McAlpine, speaking to ITN, said: 'I was wrong in the matter of Mr Nadir. There's no two ways about it. I misjudged. The truth of the matter about Mr Nadir is I didn't make a judgment at all. It was done at third hand.' Lord McAlpine recalled two meetings with Mr Nadir. He had lunch with him around the end of 1988, although he has been 'unable to locate' the exact date, and he was invited to Mr Nadir's office in September 1991. It was possible he could have met him incidentally at other social gatherings. As a prominent donor to charities at the time, Mr Nadir would have attended many charity functions. Earlier in the day, Mr Nadir, who fled to northern Cyprus six weeks ago, claimed that Lord McAlpine would be made to 'eat his words', referring to recent statements by Lord McAlpine that he had had little contact with Mr Nadir. 'Our links were a lot more than that,' Mr Nadir said. Asked for detail about the alleged tapes, Mr Nadir seemed irritable and said: 'Would I dare to mention a tape which was not backed up by verifiable proof? This is not some mishmash.' Mr Nadir said that the tapes of a number of cabinet ministers would make 'Watergate look like a minor bugging offence'. He said he had a recording of one minister saying: 'We know there is a conspiracy by the intelligence services but there is nothing we can do.' Mr Neil Cooper of accountants Robson Rhodes, Mr Nadir's trustee in bankruptcy, said he had written to the Conservative party this week asking for details of the payments with a view to possible repayment. The administrators to PPI may have an even stronger claim on behalf of creditors on the money, which was written on cheques from companies in the group. The Conservative party maintained its stance that it would return the money if it was proved to have been stolen. It said the Polly Peck companies had also made a large number of donations to charities and they had not indicated they would pay the money back. It also emerged last night that the Conservative party had drawn up a scheme to enable companies to give financial help to the party without declaring it in their accounts. The party said the scheme, which had been withdrawn 11 days after it was first circulated, was only seen by a handful of party officials. No company had followed the advice set out in the memorandum, the party said.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Ford dealers plan service chain FORD dealers are to set up a 400-strong chain of 'fast-fit' car service outlets by the end of this year. The chain, to be called Rapid Fit, is likely to be expanded later to include more of Ford's 1,000-plus dealers. It will seek to recapture some of the large amount of business lost by Ford dealers to independent specialist chains.</p>

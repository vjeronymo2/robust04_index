			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> 1. Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In 1990 the U.K. Companies Act was amended to permit issuers listed on the London Stock Exchange to provide holders of their ordinary shares with an option to receive either a full annual report or a summary annual report. The U.K. Companies Act sets forth the specific financial and management information that must be contained in the summary reports, and requires that shareholders who receive only the summary report be given the opportunity, at any time, to obtain the full annual report from the company and that companies must notify shareholders annually of this right and how the report might be obtained. When the amendments first became effective, shareholders received both reports and notice of the available option with respect to future reports. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the amendments was to provide: (1) Potential cost savings to issuers, and (2) a more easily read document to retail holders. A majority of U.K. shareholders now receive the summary reports, and the amendments are viewed as successful. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certain U.K. issuers would now like to provide U.S. holders of listed ADRs with summary reports in place of full annual reports if the holders do not object. The Commission recently approved a New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') rule change which allows non-U.S. issuers which are NYSE-listed to mail summary annual reports to U.S. share/ADR holders in lieu of the full annual report, if permitted by home country practice. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33661, International Series Release No. 637 (February 23, 1994), 59 FR 10028 (March 2, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange is proposing to similarly amend Section 110 of the Exchange's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Company Guide, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  which is comparable to the NYSE provision described above. Section 110 currently allows the Exchange to consider the laws, customs and practices of the country where a non-U.S. issuer is domiciled in evaluating the listing eligibility of a company whose corporate structure or practices are inconsistent with specified rules which apply to domestic companies, but requires that a full annual report be provided to all U.S. share/ADR holders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed amendment, a U.S. holder would initially receive both reports and then be provided with an ongoing option to receive either report. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  The summary report would set forth such financial and other information as is required by home country law and would be required to include a U.S. GAAP reconciliation to the same extent as would be required in the full annual report. The change would have no impact on the issuer's existing annual and semi-annual SEC reporting obligations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission notes that, although the U.K. Companies Act requires that shareholders initially receive both reports, the language of the proposed Amex rule permits non-U.S. issuers to follow home country practices, which may not contain this requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Indian workers strike An estimated 15m workers went on strike in India yesterday in response to a one-day nationwide general strike called by left-wing unions to protest against the government's economic policies, especially the proposed closure of some public sector operations and the unemployment this would cause, writes K K Sharma in New Delhi. The response to the strike was partial in most parts of the country but well observed in West Bengal and Kerala. The stoppage was the second such protest since the government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao took office a year ago. Rail and air services were particularly badly hit and banking operations, even in foreign branches, were paralysed.</p>

			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY STUDIES HOSPITAL FUNDING;  </P> <P> TRAUMA CARE PLAN LIFTS HOPES FOR BUDGET-STRICKEN OLIVE VIEW  </P> <P> Los Angeles County health officials, rushing to fill gaps that have opened in  the regional emergency medical network, are considering installing a trauma  center at Olive View Medical Center, which until recently was slated for  drastic spending cuts.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Emergency Medical Services Commission on Wednesday  endorsed a proposal to upgrade the Sylmar hospital's emergency room to  trauma-center standards to provide care for the San Fernando Valley's seriously  injured or ill.  </P> <P> The final decision will rest with county supervisors.  </P> <P> "It's been quite a month around here," Olive View administrator Douglas Bagley  said Thursday. "One week they're going to convert you to a nursing home, and  the next week they're going to make you into a trauma center."  </P> <P> In May, the county's chief administrative officer recommended deep slashes in  the budgets of all county hospitals. In Olive View's case, $17 million would  have been cut. But the subsequent discovery of surplus state funds in  Sacramento has relieved budget pressures on the county.  </P> <P> The county supervisors, who are deliberating this week on next year's budget,  are expected to give Olive View most of its $52-million request, which does not  include trauma center funds.  </P> <P> Almost all hospitals maintain emergency rooms, but to meet county standards as  trauma-care centers they must have a wide range of equipment, keep a surgeon on  duty 24 hours a day and have specialized surgeons on call.  </P> <P> Because trauma centers offer a higher level of emergency service, paramedics  usually bring the most serious cases to the centers.  </P> <P> In June, St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank withdrew from the trauma network,  citing heavy financial losses caused by large numbers of uninsured patients  using the trauma center. St. Joseph's withdrawal left the San Fernando Valley  with two trauma centers -- Northridge Hospital Medical Center and Holy Cross  Hospital in Mission Hills.  </P> <P> Virginia Hastings, head of trauma-care services for the county Department of  Health Services, said she saw no reason not to convert Olive View's emergency  room to trauma care as soon as possible.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cost in Millions  </P> <P> Bagley declined to estimate the cost of the conversion but said it would amount  to millions of dollars a year -- "not a one-time cost."  </P> <P> Because Olive View, destroyed in the 1971 Sylmar earthquake, was rebuilt and  reopened 20 months ago, most of its equipment is new "so we probably would not  have to buy much to become a trauma center," Bagley said.  </P> <P> However, an undetermined number of beds would have to be added to treat trauma  patients after they leave the emergency room, he said. The hospital's 270 beds  are " constantly filled, leaving us no slack," Bagley said.  </P> <P> If funds are available, Bagley estimated the hospital could be operating as a  trauma center in one year.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 13 (XINHUA) -- Disruption in  U.S.-China trade relations would cost American consumers more  than 10 billion dollars annually and deal a serious financial  blow to several key U.S. industries, a study by the  Congressional Research Service warns.    The study, requested by the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural  Resources Committee and released by Senator Mark Hatfield here  Wednesday [11 May], also concludes that possible retaliation by  China would have profound economic and employment consequences  for those states which now rank among the highest in exports to  China, including Washington, California, Texas, Florida and  Louisiana.    The report takes no position on the renewal of MFN  [most-favored nation] status for China, but Hatfield, a ranking  member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said the  document "offers an authoritative appraisal of the economic  implications of that question."    "China will experience phenomenal economic growth in the  coming years and that will be true regardless of its trading  status with the United States. This fact cannot be ignored  during the upcoming debate on MFN renewal.    "The findings of this report only heighten my doubt that  most  favored nation status is the right tool to use to promote  democracy in China," Hatfield said.    The study, entitled "China-U.S. Economic Relations: The  Costs to the U.S. of Withdrawing Most Favored Nation Tariff  Treatment and Other Questions", is the first to provide a  comprehensive analysis, by economic sector and by state, of the  potential impact of disruption in U.S.-China trade relations.  It also contains these findings:    -- Termination of China's MFN status would not only mean a  loss of that market for certain U.S. industries, but would have  a domino effect by reducing the competitiveness of those  industries in other global markets.    -- Annual review of China's MFN status has posed a  continuing  risk for U.S. companies doing business in China not faced by  other foreign firms in China.    -- From 1990 to 1993 U.S. exports to China increased by over  82 percent while exports to Japan and the European Union fell.  China went from being the 12th largest purchaser of U.S.  transportation equipment to the 3rd, an increase of nearly 200  percent compared with only a 3 percent increase from the rest of  the world.    -- China is the United States' number one market for  fertilizer and a top market for road vehicles,  telecommunications equipment and various types of specialized  machinery.    The release of the study, three weeks before U.S. President  Bill Clinton has to decide whether or not to renew China's MFN,  is seen as an increase of pressure on the White House to handle  the matter in a way that best serves the interests of American  consumers and businesses.</p>

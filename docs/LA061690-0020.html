			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VONS REOPENS DAIRY AFTER 2ND MILK RECALL IN  MONTH  </P> <P> Vons Cos. reopened its South Los Angeles dairy Thursday, two weeks after  shutting it down to determine why it was producing milk with an odd flavor and  odor.  </P> <P> The company, which makes Jerseymaid and Westwood brands of milk, will speed up  its pasteurization process to avoid the problem that led to a voluntary milk  recall from Vons' 328 stores.  </P> <P> The recall was the second in a month.  </P> <P> Jan Wessell, spokeswoman for the state Department of Food and Agriculture, said  Friday that the milk didn't pose a health hazard. Wessell said state inspectors  have instructed Vons to shorten the time the milk sits before being  pasteurized.  </P> <P> A previous, unrelated batch of bad milk had caused about 100 people to become  ill with diarrhea and nausea. State officials blamed a malfunctioning cleaning  system at the same plant, but Vons officials said they haven't determined a  cause.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PRESS AND 'GROUP-THINK'  </P> <P> It is ironic that David Shaw's articles on the narrowness of the press (Aug.  24, 26) illustrated and reaffirmed exactly such narrowness. Dan Rather, David  Broder, Robert Novak and so on hardly span a range of views. Shaw centers on  the personalities and group-think psychology which characterize the media in  this country, avoiding far more important issues of media bias and  concentration of media ownership.  </P> <P> The recent mergers between corporate giants such as Time and Warner  Communications, and General Electric's purchase of NBC, evidence the more  fundamental problem with the media in this country. The same conservative  corporate interests which marble the rest of our political and economic life  own and operate the major television, radio, and newspaper organizations in  this country. Given this effectively monolithic corporate ownership, the issues  raised by Shaw become inconsequential.  </P> <P> The individuals who work in the media, for any number of apparently disparate  reasons (not just the factors Shaw focused on), will ultimately report and  discuss only a narrow range of issues; issues thought appropriate to a small  group of corporate people, mostly male, white and middle-aged. Shaw only  focused on the pawns in the game, leaving the major players in the background.  </P> <P> ROBERT LIPTON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

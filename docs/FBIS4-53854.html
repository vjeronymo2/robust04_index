			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan-U.S.-Europe Policy Coordination Is </F> Limited to Treatment of Symptoms"]    [Excerpt] Japan-U.S.-Europe policy coordination in the area  of financial matters is visible for the first time in a number  of years. As a minimum, the actions being taken give that  appearance. And, those actions continue beyond the initial  coordinated interventions in foreign exchange markets that were  initiated on 4 May. However, a look at the realities indicates  that it would be difficult to conclude that the policy of  multilateral coordination among principal nations has been  restored. Mention must also be made that the policy we speak of  now is limited to treatment of the symptoms.    When the German Federal Bank implemented its third interest  rate reduction this year on 11 May, U.S. Treasury Secretary  Lloyd Bentsen said, "The move is welcome as a measure which will  be useful in stimulating the economies of Germany and Europe as  a whole," and displayed confidence that the cooperative posture  of Japan, the United States, and the European nations was  functioning effectively.    The question is, to what extent is this genuine policy  coordination? And to what degree is it effective? If we were to  start with the conclusion, mention should be made that the  actions being taken do not represent a full-scale restoration of  policy coordination at the G-7 level of principal nations which  comprise the summit members.    As an example, Minister of Finance Hirohisa Fujii comments  on  policy coordination among Japan, the United States, and Germany  by saying, "Coordination on interest rates was not mentioned at  the G-7 meeting of finance ministers and central bank presidents  on 24 April." Even Bank of Japan [BOJ] President Yasushi Mieno  responded to the question of whether an agreement had been  reached at the G-7 level on interest policy other than market  intervention to prevent a fall in the dollar, by saying,  "Monetary policy is not of a nature that you would restrict  actions to the foreign exchange markets or of a nature that  management would be based solely on foreign exchange values. It  appears that the mass media find much appeal in coordinated  interest drops or hikes, but the monetary policies of the  respective nations should be responsive to conditions in each  country and are not conducive to calls for massive, uniform  change."    The United States is a nation that is conspicuous in its  reluctance to respond to external pressure. The United States  did not take the initiative in coordinated action to prevent a  decline in the dollar only for fear of a weak dollar. Moreover,  the reason did not rest with the desire to prevent an  excessively strong yen.    The United States took the coordinated actions out of fear  of  a vicious cycle reflecting an overheated U.S. economy leading to  concerns for inflation, a decline in the dollar despite rising  interest rates and accelerating inflation. The United States  will not take action solely in response to the value of the  dollar, in contrast to Japan, which is excessively sensitive to  the value of the yen.    Basically, when long-term U.S. interest rates rise, the  United States treats the matter as a domestic issue. The reason  is that higher interest rates can lead directly to lower stock  prices.    However, we cannot neglect the fact that the situation in  the  U.S. economy is susceptible to a rise in interest rates because  of a drastic fall in the dollar. The primary reason for that  susceptibility is the inadequate savings rate in the United  States.    The recent favorable economic conditions in the United  States  are attributable largely to an expansion of consumption based on  credit. Individual savings are at an unusually low level.    The U.S. economy's fundamental problem rests on this point.  Domestic savings are not sufficient to cover needs arising from  the fiscal deficit and demand for capital to handle capital  investments. There is no choice but to rely on foreign capital  inflows to cover the shortages. The U.S. Government asserts that  the fiscal deficit has begun to shrink, but if savings rates  fall further, the imbalances in the economy will remain  unchanged.    Policies that neglect to act on such structural issues can  represent no more than treatment of symptoms. That being the  case, Japan had better not place excessive hope on recent  "coordinated" actions. [passage omitted]</p>

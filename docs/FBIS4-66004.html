			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, May 25 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU]  released ECU1 million (1.5 million dollars) for emergency aid to  victims of Rwanda's bloodbath on Wednesday [25 May], the EU  announced in a statement.    The funds went to the International Committee of the Red  Cross (ICRC) to enable it to pursue its medical and sanitation  activities in the capital Kigali and in the towns of Butare and  Kibungu in the south and southeast.    Two Rwandan Red Cross workers were killed and five others  badly wounded on Wednesday in Kigali when a shell landed on  their compound in the city as rebels fought fierce artillery  battles with the army.    But the ICRC said it had no plans to cut down on its staff  or  activities there.    Wednesday's contribution brings to ECU2.63 million the total  amount of humanitarian aid given to Rwandans since the start of  the latest ethnic clashes at the beginning of April.    By some estimates, the wholesale slaughter has claimed half  a  million lives in the Central African nation, while another  500,000 have fled abroad and many others are displaced inside  the country.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Vaclav Havel by Milan Slezak; </F> place and date not given: "Apropos Gateways, Freedom, and  Tolerance"]    [Text] [Slezak] Mr. President, you and Minister Zieleniec  referred in Bangkok to our republic's endeavor to become the  gateway to a unified Central European market for Thailand. Do  you think that we have done enough to ensure that the door  hanging in this gateway does not have squeaky hinges? And, do  you think that our neighbors will willingly entrust us with the  mandate of chief doorkeeper?    [Havel] The idea of a gateway was expressed during our  meeting with the Thai prime minister. It was put forward by our  side, and the prime minister and the finance minister welcomed  it very much.    In my opinion, at the international level, it means nothing  more than creating mutually favorable conditions for the  economic presence of various companies and banks in Prague.  And, as soon as the Thai companies become established in our  country, they will then -- understandably -- be able to  infiltrate the market around us, in this case, CEFTA (Central  European Free Trade Zone -- LIDOVE NOVINY note). It will then  depend not so much on the governments, but on contacts between  individual economic entities.    For example, when a bank wants to establish a branch in  Central Europe, it hesitates and wonders whether it should do so  in Vienna, Prague, Warsaw, or elsewhere. If we create a  favorable climate by means of beneficial political and  legislative conditions, it will locate its new branch in our  country and we will become its base for the whole of the  surrounding region.    The same applies vice versa for our potential presence in  Thailand, a country that is, for various reasons, most  propitious for this purpose. This could mean a starting point  for activity in other countries or -- as the case may be -- a  starting point for triangular operations in which the Czech  Republic and Thailand conduct business together in third  countries.    It is definitely not perceived as a contractual system  involving several countries where this or that country will  represent other countries.    [Slezak] You are returning from Asia. Journalists and  political scientists who deal with Asia from India to Japan are  now arguing about whether the economic boom will necessarily  lead the countries of this region to a point where they will  have to adopt a Western-type political model. That is: Not  just a parliamentary democracy, often characterized by local  customs and foibles, but also emphasis on human rights. Some  experts maintain that the attempts to graft something  considerably different onto a cultural environment which has  been evolving for a thousand years cannot succeed, and if it  does, then only for a short time. It seems that the Thai  example has confirmed the opposite theory....    [Havel] That is a subject that is indeed being much  discussed -- not only among European or U.S. observers, but also  among the politicians of that region. The Thai prime minister,  for example, is of the opinion that the development of human  rights and the development of the economy should -- and must --  go hand-in-hand. He was the inspiration behind the Bangkok  Conference, which was devoted to this very idea. Other leaders  allude to their specific traditions and say that first it is  necessary to achieve a certain standard of living, a certain  economic development, and only then is it possible -- as the  case may be -- to intensify democracy and enhance respect for  human rights.    I will not presume to judge the issue. But, something in me  -- most likely instinctively -- tells me that it is perhaps  impossible for a flourishing economy to endure and enjoy good  prospects without political freedoms. The market, which is  based on the free activity of free economic entities, has its  own particular freedom. Under conditions that curb political  freedom, this freedom will begin to seem restricted. On the  other hand, the market and the free game of market forces can  only exist if there are rules that are respected by everyone.  This means, respect for rights.    It is hard to say, but I am more inclined toward the view  that, although democracy has taken hold in these countries with  greater difficulty than it did throughout the Euro-American  world, it must and will -- despite this -- accompany the  economic development of these countries. It is true that, in  its early stages, economic development progressed here under the  conditions of an authoritarian system. However, that does not  seem to me to be possible forever.    I think that the integrative efforts being made here, as in  Europe, will also move in this direction. That is, apart from  rules for a freer exchange of goods and similar economic  measures, a kind of political requirement has always been set:  The more advanced countries in this sphere may exert a little  pressure on those who, within the framework of the integrative  grouping, are less advanced.    [Slezak] Mr. President, in Varanasi, which you visited last  week, there once lived a poet and a mystic called Kabir, who  merged elements of Hinduism and Islam in his work and who  advocated love and tolerance toward God and people. There are  many such examples in Indian history. Nevertheless, the brutal  religious pogroms in India present a sharp contrast to the  remarkable tolerance in the philosophical sphere. These pogroms  return again and again. A tiny spark is enough and years-long  coexistence in peace and harmony is forgotten in an instant.    When you were awarded the Indira Ghandi Prize, you spoke  about the prospects for coexistence among various cultures. It  seems to me that it will be a very long time yet before the  individual cultural spheres come together and that more than one  tiny "Indian- type" spark will be ignited. It also seems to me  that you are a far greater optimist in this respect.    [Havel] In India and Thailand I made two speeches in which  I outlined my views on the outlook for today's world and also on  what I consider to be a better alternative, an alternative  providing the only guarantee that the world will be able to  confront the terrible dangers facing it. The fact that I  outlined the better alternative did not mean that I ruled out  the possibility that the worse one could occur. Of course, this  may happen. But it would have catastrophic consequences for the  whole world.    It is true that this ambiguous tradition belongs to Indian  culture. On the one hand, an ecumenical ideal -- to put it  simply -- manifests itself there again and again, an ideal of  conciliation and peaceful coexistence. The most celebrated  exponent of this ideal in the modern era was Ghandi, who  reconciled Hindus with Moslems....    [Slezak] ....and carried in his pack both the Bhagavadgita  and the Koran....    [Havel] Yes, yes.    On the other hand, religious conflicts are manifesting  themselves there again and again. The disintegration of British  India into Pakistan, Bangladesh, and India was caused by the  inability to coexist. We still see the disastrous consequences  of this division today -- in Kashmir, the Punjab, and elsewhere.  We also saw it in Calcutta.    There are two currents contending with each other in this  region -- and also in another form in Europe. After all, there  is again a kind of race between the integrative efforts based on  the ideal of civic coexistence and the newly awakening  nationalism. This is not only happening in the postcommunist  world, but also in the Western world.    The fact is -- and I also said this in my speech in Bangkok  -- that there is some universalist idea in the very foundations  of all religions; no hostility is enshrined there against anyone  who believes in another god. I spoke about this once in Egypt  with President Mubarak who said quite sternly that Islamic  fundamentalism is a betrayal of Islam and that it is at variance  with all of its original ideals.    When all is said and done, we can also see it in  Christianity. Fortunately, many centuries have passed since that  time -- but terrible genocides were once also perpetrated under  the banner of Christianity.    [Slezak] I am thinking about other such strange  associations: The brutal medieval Japanese samurai took delight  in Buddhism and it did not bother them in the least that this  benign doctrine forbids the killing of all live beings,  including -- naturally -- people....    Since we have moved onto Buddhism: A man -- and especially a  very busy man -- often desires the peace and quiet of cloistered  seclusion. Do you feel this way? If the answer is yes, would  you choose any of the Buddhist monasteries we visited recently  for your contemplation?    [Havel] My respect for various cultures and their specific  traditions and environments does not stretch so far that I would  feel the need to adapt to them and turn into someone else. When  I want to be alone and think, I am happiest at Hradecek [his  country cottage in East Bohemia].    [Slezak] Do you remember what in India and Thailand most  surprised you? What most amused you and most disappointed you?    [Havel] What surprised me? I was surprised, for example, by  the immense interest, warmth, and kindness with which I and our  entire delegation were received both in India and Thailand. Let  us try to picture this the other way round. Let us imagine that  the representative of a small, 10-million strong South Asian  state -- a state about which half of our citizens know nothing  or even where it is -- comes to our country. I really find it  hard to imagine that he would be received with such respect and  such interest, not only by the politicians, but also by the  public. I knew that these are people who respect their guests.  But the level of hospitality really surprised me.    I cannot say what amused me, because I could cause a  political incident.    And what....?    [Slezak] Disappointed you.    [Havel] What disappointed me... (a 10-second pause; the  president is deep in thought) Nothing!    [Slezak] Mr. President, thank you for the interview.  (The interview was recorded on board the flight from Thailand  to Prague. The president looked tired, but he made no reference  at all to his rib injury during the 25-minute interview.)</p>

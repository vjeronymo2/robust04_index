			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: City Site net assets 16% ahead at Pounds 26.6m City Site Estates, property investment and development group, announced a 16 per cent increase in net assets to Pounds 26.6m at the interim stage. Pre-tax profits for the six months to March 31 were marginally improved at Pounds 312,000 against Pounds 170,000. The company was almost dragged down by the property slump but has been trading actively in an improving market. Rental income declined from Pounds 5.63m to Pounds 4.85m, reflecting property sales. The company sold Pounds 2.3m of properties during the period, but purchased a total of Pounds 7.4m. Property trading contributed Pounds 137,000. The portfolio currently has voids representing 6.5 per cent of the total. The company is confident this will be reduced through active management and improving tenant demand. It is also marketing a number of other properties for sale, which are expected to result in a substantial increase in profits for the full year. The company is applying to the courts to eliminate a deficit on its profit and loss account, which would enable it to renew dividend payments. City Site accrued a further Pounds 564,000 of preference share dividends during the period, resulting in losses per share of 1.64p (2.56p).</p>

			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE HIGH SCHOOLS;  </P> <P> ATHLETE OF THE WEEK;  </P> <P> PECK SHAKES OFF ILLNESS AND PLAGUES OPPONENTS  </P> <P> Chrissy Peck of El Camino Real High set some lofty goals for herself before the  season.  </P> <P> The first was to help the Conquistadores (18-2) win their second consecutive  City Section title and sixth in the past seven years. The second was to throw a  no-hitter and the third was to pitch a perfect game.  </P> <P> While Peck considered all three goals attainable, she never expected to  accomplish the second one -- a no-hitter -- two days after returning to school  from a two-week bout with chicken pox.  </P> <P> "I wasn't even sure if I'd be able to pitch the entire game," said Peck (17-2),  who struck out nine and walked two in beating Canoga Park, 15-0, last Tuesday.  "I'm really out of shape right now. I didn't have much velocity on the ball and  I really got tired in the later innings."  </P> <P> Two days after blanking Canoga Park, Peck pitched 6 1/3 innings of no-hit ball  against Taft before finishing with a two-hitter and a 26-1 victory.  </P> <P> Although she lost to Newbury Park, 5-0, in the Thousand Oaks tournament  Saturday morning, Peck pitched a one-hitter and struck out 14 in an 11-1  victory over Redlands that afternoon.  </P> <P> "She actually pitched stronger in the tournament than during the no-hitter," El  Camino Real Coach Neils Ludlow said. "Her velocity was better and she had more  endurance as the week went on."  </P> <P> Peck transferred from El Camino Real to Bel-Air Prep as a freshman to  concentrate on her studies but returned to the Woodland Hills campus for this,  her junior season.  </P> <P> But Ludlow, in his fifth year at El Camino Real, reckons that the  Conquistadores' storied past might have influenced Peck's decision to return.  </P> <P> "A lot more people are going to know about Chrissy if she's pitching here than  if she's pitching at Bel-Air Prep," Ludlow said.  </P> <P> Beth Silverman, who graduated last June, might be the best-known player in El  Camino Real softball history. She pitched the Conquistadores to City titles in  1985 (over Banning), '86 (Canoga Park) and '88 (San Pedro).  </P> <P> Ludlow said that Peck, with 182 strikeouts in 125 innings and an 0.50  earned-run average, is like Silverman in many respects.  </P> <P> "Beth and Chrissy both have very good velocity on their fastballs," Ludlow  said. "They both throw the rise, the drop, the changeup and the curveball with  equal efficiency."  </P></p>

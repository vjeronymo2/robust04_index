It is expected that former head of the Islamic Republic of  Iran Broadcasting will takeover the second most important and  sensitive post today.    Hashemi was replaced on Sunday by former Minister of Islamic  Culture and Guidance Dr. 'Ali Larijani.    The post is qa'em-maqam, as it is called in Persian, since  the first deputy traditionally has no specific or defined duties.    'Ali Mohammad Besharati held the post before being appointed  interior minister by President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani  last August.    Besharati, a member of the Islamic Consultative Assembly,  the  Majles, during its First Term, was appointed first deputy at the  Foreign Ministry in 1983. During his term of office, he was  assigned Persian Gulf affairs by Dr. Velayati.    It is popularly believed that Besharati was more than  successful in his mission despite transparent Western schemes to  keep a rift between Iran and the Arab countries on the other  side of the Persian Gulf.    It will be interesting to see what particular assignment is  given to Hashemi. The former student of the University of  California, Berkeley, could be a big help to Dr. Velayati  because of his awareness of the West and America in particular.</p>

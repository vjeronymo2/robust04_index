			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EXPANDED SMOKING BAN PROPOSED FOR SCHOOLS  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Board of Education next week will vote on a proposal to ban  smoking and other tobacco use on all district property -- including cars.  </P> <P> The all-encompassing ban, proposed by board President Jackie Goldberg, would  apply to people at everything from sporting events to faculty lounges to  meetings of non-school groups at district facilities.  </P> <P> "Allowing adults, but not students, to smoke gives students the message that  smoking is for adults, providing a powerful incentive for children to smoke,"  Goldberg said in introducing the proposal.  </P></p>

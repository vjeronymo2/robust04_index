			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris lower on 5 per cent fall in Lyonnaise-Dumez BOURSES saw mixed performances yesterday. PARIS featured Lyonnaise-Dumez which was suspended after the shares had fallen more than 5 per cent, down FFr25.30 at FFr435.50, before forecasting disappointing 1992 earnings. The group, which was meeting analysts last night, also said that it would be setting aside large provisions. The CAC-40 index closed 18.90 lower at 1,818.82 in good turnover of FFr3.1bn. Sanofi and YSL, which both resumed trading having been suspended since Monday, reacted to the announcement that Sanofi was to absorb the latter in a share exchange of four of its shares to every five of YSL. Sanofi lost FFr117 or 10.7 per cent to FFr970 while YSL rose FFr133 or 21 per cent to FFr763. Saint-Gobain declined FFr12 to FFr489 ahead of its 1992 earnings today. FRANKFURT pondered the Bonn government's tax proposals, including the resumption and doubling of the solidarity tax surcharge, as well as a DM10bn increase in the forecast German budget deficit for 1993. It was a measure of the recent strength in equities, said dealers, that the DAX index fell only 3.95 to 1,574.88. Turnover eased from DM6.3bn to DM6.2bn. Waning hopes of an interest rate cut from the Bundesbank today had little effect on equities, as the rumours came from the UK and were not accompanied by significant buying orders. Individual shares were mixed. Deutsche Bank closed down DM6.80 at DM645, under pressure from a large sell order; but Hoechst extended its relative strength against BASF and Bayer with a DM3.70 gain to DM255.90. MADRID was boosted by a cut in yields on three-month and six-month Treasury bills and the general index closed 4.50, or 2 per cent higher at 234.07 in heavy turnover of around Pta28bn. The cuts encouraged expectations of an imminent easing in Spanish interest rates and fuelled buying in interest rate-sensitive stocks: in utilities, Iberdrola II led with a gain of Pta33 to Pta625; and in banks, BBV up Pta80 to Pta2,815. However, there were also strong gains elsewhere, across the board in construction where Uralita put on Pta83 to Pta756; and selectively, but spectacularly, in chemicals where Argonesas rose Pta95 to Pta900. AMSTERDAM featured Wessanen and Bols after they announced merger plans, with the former losing Fl 5.00 to Fl 98.50 and the latter gaining Fl 4.20 to Fl 47.00. The CBS Tendency index closed 0.6 higher at 98.9. Elsewhere, publishers were mixed with Wolters Kluwer slipping 10 cents to Fl 87.30 and Elsevier losing 80 cents to Fl 122.90. VNU gained Fl 1.20 to Fl 122.90. Philips added 20 cents to Fl 22.80. MILAN pulled up from early lows in steady trade. The burst of activity by small investors early in the week after a package of bourse-boosting measures was unveiled had mostly died down. The Comit index dipped 2.62 to 485.34. Fiat had a mixed performance, closing down L111 at L4,378 but turning up in after-hours trading to L4,500. Other leading shares echoed Fiat. Agro-industrial and chemical group Montedison fell L20 to L1,277 but moved up to L1,313 in late trading and insurer Generali fell L730 to L32,430 but picked up to L33,200 in the after market. Fondiaria advanced by L855 to L28,885 and continued up to L28,964 after hours following a report, denied by the company, that it planned to sell subsidiaries to cut debt and that GAIC, the majority shareholder jointly run by Ferruzzi and Camillo De Benedetti, the Italian financier, wanted to cede control. ZURICH ended little changed with the SMI index easing 1.2 to 2,062.7. Roche certificates picked up SFr10 to SFr4,130 in active trade after Tuesday's SFr110 fall which followed a report that minute particles of asbestos had been found during analysis of two of the company's drugs. Watchmaker SMH's registered shares fell SFr25 to SFr1,545 after Tuesday's SFr20 advance as investors gave further consideration to Volkswagen's decision to pull out of a joint venture to produce an environment-friendly city car. Oerlikon-Buehrle's bearers fell SFr5 to SFr410 as its announcement that it will make a small group consolidated profit for 1992 after the previous year's loss came as little surprise. BRUSSELS saw gains in blue chips lift the Bel-20 index 5.07 to 1,150.74 as Tractebel moved ahead for the second straight day with a rise of BFr120 to BFr8,130. STOCKHOLM was disappointed that the central bank had not cut interest rates and the Affarsvarlden index lost 1.7 to 933.1 in turnover of some SKr576m. Among the banks Handelsbanken dropped SKr1.50 to SKr40.50 while, elsewhere, Ericsson fell SKr1 to SKr185. COPENHAGEN shares continued higher helped by a strong bond market and the prospect of political stability when a new Social Democrat-led administration is formed later in the week. The KFX index closed 0.61 higher at 81.77. VIENNA featured a Sch35 rise in Austrian Airlines to Sch1,490 adding to its gains on Tuesday while the ATX index rose 0.46 to 731.1.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- January 20  THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                          Open    10.30     11.00    12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1094.08  1094.12   1093.99  1091.97 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1155.18  1156.77   1155.28  1153.75                         13.00    14.00     15.00    Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1092.35  1091.89   1092.66  1091.84 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1154.31  1153.58   1153.52  1153.29  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Jan 19    Jan 18    Jan 15    Jan 14    Jan 13 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1090.81   1097.15   1089.58   1076.93   1063.02 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1155.89   1166.50   1160.32   1154.08   1144.79  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1094.33; 200 - 1157.07 Low/day: 100 - 1091.08  200 - 1151.91.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

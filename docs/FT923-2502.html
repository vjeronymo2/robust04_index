			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Further press restrictions opposed THE Newspaper Society yesterday backed the Press Complaints Commission and said it would oppose any new laws to restrict freedom of the press further in the UK. The society, which represents about 260 publishers of local and regional newspapers, was publishing its evidence to Sir David Calcutt QC, who is conducting a review of of the workings of the press. Mr Dugal Nisbet-Smith, director of the society, said he was perturbed about the view of many MPs that the methods used by some journalists to obtain stories were so unacceptable that they should be banned by law. Any attempt to introduce special restrictions on journalists might lead to registration of journalists and a state system of licences for publications. 'In the end it would surely not be acceptable to restrict the freedom of expression of an author of an article in a newspaper to a greater extent than an author of a book, or than a politician in an election pamphlet or on a soapbox, or than an academic in a learned journal,' the society argued. Mr David Newall, deputy director of the society, said that if there were any suggestion of specific laws against journalists, there should be a wide review of the whole business of bugging and covert surveillance whether involving government officials, private investigators or industrial espionage. The society also appealed yesterday to Sir David to pay greater attention to the views of its members than they were apparently receiving. The regional newspaper industry on a per-issue basis had a total circulation of 53.4m, compared with only 30.5m for the national press, it said. It was not the conduct of either regional or local newspapers that was responsible for calls for stronger controls.</p>

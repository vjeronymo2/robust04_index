			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 2 MORE JAILBREAK FUGITIVES ARE CAUGHT BY POLICE;  </P> <P> ESCAPE: COUNTY OFFICIALS SEEK FUNDING TO TIGHTEN SECURITY AS NINE INMATES FROM  CHULA VISTA JAIL REMAIN AT LARGE.  </P> <P> Two more of the 13 inmates who fled the County Jail in Chula Vista in the  county's biggest jailbreak were recaptured Friday. Meanwhile, county and  Sheriff's Department officials took steps to patch security leaks in  problem-plagued county jails.  </P> <P> The arrests of Carlos Renteria, 27, and Michael Walker, 29, along with the  capture of two inmates shortly after their escape Wednesday, leaves nine  inmates at large, according to Deputy Robbie Hill, a Sheriff's Department  spokeswoman.  </P> <P> The escapees considered to be the most dangerous -- three of whom are suspected  of murder -- are still being sought, Hill added.  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department has taken several steps to recapture the inmates,  including notifying Mexican authorities, assigning special officers, and  informing law enforcement agencies nationwide.  </P> <P> Also Friday, Supervisor Brian Bilbray drafted a proposal asking the county  Board of Supervisors to immediately allocate funds to secure the windows at the  South Bay jail. The proposal, which is expected to be addressed by the board  Tuesday, also asks the Sheriff's Department to identify and evaluate other  security deficiencies at the facility.  </P> <P> In addition, Board Chairman Leon Williams drafted a proposal asking county and  Sheriff's Department officials to conduct a comprehensive security review of  all county jails.  </P> <P> On Wednesday evening, the 13 inmates escaped from the jail by sawing through  steel bars with hacksaws smuggled in through an open window, authorities said.  </P> <P> The men escaped about 8:45 p.m. by sawing through two bars -- each about 5  inches deep, 1.5 inches wide and 2 feet tall -- and then using the bars to  smash through a window. Sheriff's Capt. Chuck Wood, who runs the South Bay  jail, said alarms installed on the windows when the jail was built in 1982 are  no longer operative.  </P> <P> Walker, 29 -- accused of possessing stolen property -- was recaptured by San  Diego police officers shortly before 3 a.m. Friday, when an anonymous caller  informed authorities that Walker was driving a gray Ford Mustang with a missing  left taillight. Police found Walker at 4th Avenue and Juniper Street and  arrested him without incident, authorities said.  </P> <P> Carlos Renteria, 27 -- jailed on suspicion of robbery -- was recaptured by San  Diego police in Encanto about 11 a.m. Friday, when officers responded to a call  about a burglary in progress in the 6100 block of Brooklyn Avenue. Two police  officers suffered minor injuries while trying to apprehend Renteria, who  resisted arrest.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Department officials said that Christopher Bell, 21, is considered  the most dangerous of the nine men still at large. Bell is charged with robbery  and assault and is considered the key suspect in the October slaying of a La  Mesa man who was kidnaped at a bank automatic teller machine and slain  execution style. Bell was being held without bail.  </P> <P> At a press conference after the jailbreak, an angry Wood blamed the incident on  overcrowded conditions and the failure of the county government to respond to  requests for improvements in the facility's security system.  </P> <P> Although disturbed that his requests for expensive detection cameras and  sophisticated alarms had been shunned because of the county's fiscal woes, Wood  seemed particularly distressed about the county General Services Department's  failure to put grating or wire mesh on the outside of the jail's windows.  </P> <P> In hindsight, officials agree, that simple preventive measure could have foiled  the jailbreak. An investigation by authorities has determined that somebody  lowered the hacksaws by rope to the inmates from a public walkway 15 feet above  one of the jail's unattended windows.  </P> <P> Unlike the poorly constructed County Jail in El Cajon that is riddled with  problems -- inmates have been able to escape from that facility by kicking  holes through the walls -- authorities say the South Bay facility is well built  and fairly secure. Therefore, without the hacksaws, authorities say, the  inmates could not have escaped.  </P> <P> But Robert Griego, who, as the county's deputy chief administrative officer,  oversees the general services department, denied that his department was to  blame. He said the department simply lacked the funds to carry out jail  improvements.  </P> <P> More important, Griego said, the lack of wire mesh was never described to his  department as a security problem.  </P> <P> "I took a tour of the facility and when I talked to Captain Wood the main thing  he was disturbed about was the pigeon droppings that were accumulating outside  the windows," Griego said. "Apparently that was a health risk, so he asked me  to put (wire mesh) up to keep the pigeons out. He never told me it was needed  to tighten up security."  </P> <P> In December, a financially strapped general services department forwarded  Wood's request for window mesh, alarms and security cameras to a special county  committee with the authority to distribute money earmarked for justice facility  improvements, Griego said.  </P> <P> "Stopping pigeon pooping wasn't considered a high priority, so the request was  rejected," Griego said. "If it was identified as a needed security measure, if  it was really dramatized, maybe we could have tried harder to get the money."  </P> <P> But David Janssen, the county's deputy chief administrative officer, said the  request still would have been denied.  </P> <P> "It wouldn't have mattered because we didn't have any money left anyway," said  Janssen referring to a $3.9-million fund of local fines and forfeitures that  state law requires be set aside for improvement of justice facilities.  </P> <P> On Friday, Wood declined to say whether he told general services staff that the  lack of wire mesh posed a security risk.  </P> <P> "There's no point debating this in the press," Wood said. "I am not going to  engage in any finger-pointing. That's not important. My intent is to address  these security issues with a spirit of cooperation.  </P> <P> "And I'm getting a very, very satisfactory response (from county officials),"  Wood said. "We're looking at everything from fences to television cameras to  motion sensors. . . . We are looking at everything that can help alleviate this  from ever happening again." Wood said the windows will be made inaccessible to  the inmates immediately.  </P> <P> "I had 14 people escape. . . . I was very sensitive to that. . . . I was very  upset," said Wood about comments he made at the press conference implying that  the county had ignored his requests. "Sometimes I put in work orders, and  sometimes I talk with people in high places (to get things accomplished). You  wait for a response but you realize these people can't promise you anything."  </P> <P> Sheriff's Department officials initially reported that 14 inmates had escaped,  but that count was revised to 13 after jail officials determined that  Christopher Brown, charged with violating probation, had never left the jail.  </P> <P> County and Sheriff's Department officials -- who, in the past, have often  blamed each other for the jail woes -- curbed criticism and instead expressed  frustration over the lack of solutions to solve the county's jail problems.  </P> <P> "Our jails are at 183% capacity," said Asst. Sheriff Ken Wigginton, who  oversees the county's detention facilities. "We have 1,900 inmates more than we  have rated beds for. The county has a real serious money problem. I don't know  how we're going to solve this."  </P> <P> Bilbray added: "We just don't have the money to take comprehensive preventive  measures. Right now, we're looking at each weak link in the system as it  appears and are trying to make sure that no weak link is exploited twice by a  prisoner.  </P> <P> "Keep in mind that (South Bay) is one of our better facilities," Bilbray added.  "But they found the Achilles heel and they got outside help."  </P> <P> The escapees used bed sheets to lower themselves 40 feet to the ground. Jail  officials were not aware of the escape until a passer-by called 911 after  seeing inmates getting in a car outside the jail. Two of the inmates were  quickly recaptured.  </P> <P> The jail has a staff of 53 deputies, but no more than a dozen are on duty at  night. Understaffing prevents deputies from standing guard outside the jail  around the clock, Wigginton said. But he added that deputies patrol the jail  grounds about four times per 12-hour shift. The Chula Vista jail is built to  house 192 inmates but contains more than 750.  </P></p>

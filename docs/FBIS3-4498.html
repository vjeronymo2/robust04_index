Provincial CPC Secretary Yan Haiwang,  Construction Minister Hou Jie, and Vice Provincial Governor Guo  Kun attended the meeting and spoke.    The meeting stressed: This year, our province will continue  to implement the system of inviting and submitting tenders, will  fully carry out construction according to the construction  projects law, and will speed up the development of the  construction industry. It is necessary to concentrate funds on  the completion of 26 key construction projects so that they can  display their investment efficiency as soon as possible. In  view of the fact that urban capital construction facilities in  our province are generally backward, it is imperative to arouse  the enthusiasm of the localities to raise funds through various  channels to speed up the pace of urban capital construction  projects. It is necessary to vigorously promote housing  construction projects to speed up the pace of solving housing  difficulties in towns and cities. It is necessary to formulate  rational plans to properly implement experimental construction  projects in villages and towns, so that village and town  construction can scale new heights.</p>

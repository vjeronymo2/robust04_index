			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 25 (CNA) -- The Taoyuan District Court  in northern Taiwan on Friday [24 June] convicted and sentenced  30 Taoyuan County councilors to up to two years in prison on  charges of vote-buying and corruption and acquitted two others.    Hsu Chen-yun, the speaker of the Taoyuan County Council,  received a two-year jail term and had his civil rights stripped  for three years. According to the verdict, Hsu gave money and  offered sightseeing trips to councilors in exchange for their  votes in the March 1 county council election.    Hsu, a Kuomintang member, had pleaded not guilty to the  charges. He will appeal. Twenty-nine other councilors who along  with Hsu were found guilty by the court were given prison terms  ranging from 10 months to 22 months and all had their civil  rights suspended for two years. Each had pleaded not guilty.    Fourteen of the 29 councilors are KMT members, six are  affiliated with the Democratic Progressive Party, Taiwan's  largest opposition party, and nine others are independents.    Twenty-nine people in Keelung city as well as Miaoli,  Kaohsiung and Hualien counties, including a speaker and three  deputy speakers, had previously been sentenced for either paying  or accepting bribes.    Separately, prosecutors in 10 other cities and counties  across Taiwan have charged over 350 on similar charges in  Taiwan's worst election scandal. The Kuomintang won all 23 city  and council speaker posts in the polls.</p>

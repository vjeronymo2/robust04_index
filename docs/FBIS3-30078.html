NODONG SINMUN in an editorial headlined "30 Hears of Victory  and Change Along the Road Indicated by Great Rural Theses" says  that the publication of the socialist rural theses 30 years ago  was a historical event which is of weighty significance in the  revolutionary struggle of our people for a victory of the  socialist cause of chuche.    Noting that a national agricultural conference was grandly  opened in Pyongyang on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of  the publication of the rural theses, the paper says:    The conference will be a rally of victors powerfully  demonstrating the greatness and invincible vitality of our  party's programme of socialist rural construction and a new  milestone in developing our socialist rural economy onto a  higher stage.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song sent a historical  letter  "For the Ultimate Solution of the Rural Question Under the  Banner of the Socialist Rural Theses" to the national  agricultural conference.    The great leader in his letter proudly reviewed the victory  of our party and people in the struggle to implement the rural  theses and put forward the militant tasks to effect a new  upswing in the rural construction. The letter is a fighting  banner to win a historical victory in finally solving the rural  question, the most difficult one in the socialist construction.    The period since the publication of the theses was 30 years  of victory in which a most brilliant example was set in the  solution of the socialist rural question, the paper notes. It  refers in detail to the achievements in the final solution of  the rural question.    It stresses that the great victory and achievements in the  struggle to implement the rural theses in the past were entirely  a brilliant fruition of the wise guidance of the respected  leader Comrade Kim Il-song.    Noting that we are now faced with the honorable tasks to  further consolidate and develop the socialist rural economic  system in our country and effect a new upswing in the  agricultural production on the basis of the great victory  achieved in the socialist rural construction, the paper outlines  these tasks.    An editorial of MINJU CHOSON stresses that our socialist  countryside which is advancing along the road indicated by the  rural theses, holding the illustrious leader in high esteem,  will boundlessly prosper and the socialist cause of chuche will  make a long drive forever.</p>

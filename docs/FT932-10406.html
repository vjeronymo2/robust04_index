			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Letting property brings problems I HAVE ALWAYS managed my own tax affairs without using an accountant. But this tax year I have started to let property and things are getting complicated] Can you recommend a good guide or book that covers the tax treatment of property? The solicitor who prepared the letting agreements for you is, of course, best placed to guide you through the consequent tax labyrinth. But you might ask your tax office for the following free pamphlets: IR87 - Rooms to let: income from letting property; CGT4 - Owner-occupied houses; CGT14 - Capital gains tax: an introduction; and CGT16 - Indexation allowance: disposals after 5 April 1988. You could also write to the Inland Revenue Public Enquiry Room, Somerset House, Strand, London WC2R 1LB, and ask for a copy of Statement of Practice D24 (Capital gains tax: initial repairs to property). We take it that the property is all within the UK and that it is being let unfurnished, so that the rents are assessable entirely under Schedule A. If either of those assumptions is wrong, the position will be a little more complex. It could be worth spending half-an-hour or so in a local reference library looking at the relevant parts of any of the standard works on income tax and capital gains tax. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / People: Pointon York picks non-executives Geoffrey Pointon, chairman of financial services group Pointon York and an enthusiastic proponent of investor protection, has overcome his distaste for non-executive directors and appointed two to his board. 'I don't fancy non-executive directors that arrive once a month for a big lunch and don't understand what is going on,' says Pointon, who adds that with a banking subsidiary as part of the group, he has to find people acceptable to the Bank of England, something he says has got increasingly difficult recently. 'What with their views and my views, it hasn't been easy.' Now two longstanding acquaintances have agreed to come aboard; Ian Martin (below left), 40, group director of Barings in charge of worldwide finance operations and administration and a director of the Securities and Futures Authority; and Hugh Armstrong (below right), 58, a venture capital specialist who was a founder-director of one of the first venture capital companies, the Small Business Capital Fund which, as Development Capital, was eventually sold to form Lazard Ventures. Martin also goes on the board of the bank. 'It reflects the progress the group has been making. Ten years ago we were a very small outfit indeed,' says Pointon. PYV, the Lloyd's broking subsidiary of the group which specialises in professional indemnity cover, is suing Fimbra after the self-regulatory body dropped at the 11th hour a compulsory indemnity scheme for its members to which PYV was to have been the exclusive broker.</p>

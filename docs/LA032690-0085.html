			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES : OVER-AMPED ZEVON CAN'T MAKE UP THE DISTANCE  </P> <P> Warren Zevon's strongest asset is his overtly clever, often incisive narrative  quality -- an attention for detail that moves like a street-sweeper through the  California dream. Rarely does he give the impression that he's reaching into  his own depths for his material, so there's an emotional distance to much of  his work.  </P> <P> Zevon's performance at the Coach House on Saturday made that distance even  greater.  </P> <P> Nearly every song was obscured by an over-amped, hard-rocking arrangement that  sounded like Jo Jo Gunne on a bad night. Even Zevon's more reflective recent  songs such as "Splendid Isolation" and 1987's "Detox Mansion" took on an  arena-rock sheen, with perhaps only the bleak, science-fiction themed  "Transverse City" being aided by a dissonant band arrangement.  </P> <P> Openers the Raindogs were a far more persuasive outfit, working Celtic and  American folk influences into a roots-rock context that compares favorably with  John Mellencamp's recent material.

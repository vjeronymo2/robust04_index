			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Net assets drop at Glasgow Income Tst Glasgow Income Trust had a net asset value of 36.05p per share at September 30 - down 26 per cent on the 47.32p of 12 months earlier. Net revenue amounted to Pounds 994,000 against a restated Pounds 964,000, equivalent to earnings of 3.38p (3.3p) per share. The proposed final dividend is held at 1.4p for a maintained total of 3.2p. The directors said, however, that given a difficult investment background it was unlikely that the final distribution for the current year would be fully maintained.</p>

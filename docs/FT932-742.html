			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: My uncle's Italian debt MY MOTHER was incapacitated and in a home for the elderly. She set up a joint account with my uncle so that he could administer her money for her. I discovered that my uncle helped himself to some of my mother's money. Both are now dead. Did my uncle incur a debt in respect of my mother, and as my mother's sole heir do I have a claim on his estate? (I am a co-heir with my cousins, and we are all nephews and nieces as my uncle had no children). All this was in Italy, is the law likely to be different there? Before I describe how English Law would treat the problem you describe, I must emphasise that any remedy which you may have is a matter solely for Italian Law. Italian Law is based on Roman Law; English Law is not, and so the latter is an inadequate guide to the Italian Law treatment of your problem. In English Law, the creation of the joint bank account created a trust. If your uncle misappropriated funds from the account, then he is probably in breach of trust. That breach has caused a loss to the trust fund and he is therefore liable to reimburse the fund with the amount taken. Although your uncle ceased to be a trustee on his death, the liability of a trustee for a breach of trust survives against his executors and estate. Compensation can therefore be sought by you and the other beneficiaries against the estate of your late uncle. A trust is a concept peculiar to Anglo-Saxon Law and there is no such concept in Roman or Italian Law. However, I would find it odd if Italian Law did not afford you some remedy in such a situation.

			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ NOTES : JAZZ MOBILE WEST TO KICK OFF NEW SERIES; AKIYOSHI TRIO OPENS AT  VINE ST. BAR &amp; GRILL  </P> <P> Jazz Mobile West, a series of 15 free jazz concerts to be held at locations in  the greater Los Angeles area, kicks off with a noon bash on May 19, at the  Rotunda of Los Angeles City Hall. Modeled after the original Jazz Mobile,  formed in New York in 1965, Jazz Mobile West is presented by the Los Angeles  Jazz Society, with help from grants from the City of Los Angeles and the Music  Performance Trust Fund, Local 47.  </P> <P> Jazz Mobile West will feature performances by trumpeter Al Aarons, saxman  Herman Riley, pianist Gildo Mahones, bassist Allan Jackson, and drummer Kenny  Dennis. The band will play both public venues and schools -- including Point  Fermin Park in San Pedro, the ABC Entertainment Center in Century City and the  Canoga Park Elementary School. "We scheduled many of the concerts at schools  because they need all the help they can get with arts enrichment programs,"  said Teri Aarons, LAJS president.  </P> <P> Several people's efforts brought the project to fruition, Aarons added,  including Chuck Niles, who will emcee all the events, and drummer Earl Palmer.  Aarons was particularly pleased that Mayor Tom Bradley supported the program  with a recommendation for a grant.  </P> <P> Information: (213) 469-6800.  </P> <P> PIANIST'S VISIT: Though pianist-composer Toshiko Akiyoshi's Jazz Orchestra --  which the current Manhattan resident formed while living in the Southland with  her husband, reedman Lew Tabackin, from 1972-1982 -- played only 30 dates in  1988 ("It was miserable," she said), both Akiyoshi and Tabackin were able to  work regularly as instrumentalists, making the year a financial success.  </P> <P> Among the spots where Akiyoshi, the be-bop-based pianist -- who opens a  four-night engagement with her trio at the Vine St. Bar &amp; Grill in  Hollywood tonight -- played last year were Rio de Janeiro and Zurich. In  Zurich, she worked with bassist Jimmy Woode, a former Ellington band member,  and drummer Ed Thigpen, formerly with Oscar Peterson and Bud Powell. "We had a  really good time because they swing so hard," said Akiyoshi, whose latest LP is  "Interlude" (Concord Jazz).  </P> <P> In July, Akiyoshi and Tabackin travel with the Jazz Orchestra to Japan. Of  particular interest will be her concert in Fukuoka, on the island of Kyushu,  where she'll debut a commissioned work. "Fukuoka was important in my life," she  said. "I lived there from 1947 to '48 and it was the first time I played with  big bands."  </P> <P> COMPLETELY DIFFERENT: If Akiyoshi plays in a sometimes intense, somewhat  complicated manner, pianist-composer Peter Kater, who appears with saxophonist  Bob Redholz at At My Place Saturday, takes another tack. The pieces on his  latest "Homage" (Gaia) LP are soft and soothing without the snap-crackle  associated with modern jazz.  </P> <P> Many people would call his stuff New Age, but not Kater. "I play contemporary  piano music, although it follows such chart categories as New Acoustic or New  Adult Contemporary," Kater said.  </P> <P> Kater, currently touring the Southwest and West Coast with Redholz, enjoys the  sparse blend of saxophone and piano. "A duo retains all the intimacy of a solo  piano concert," said Kater, "plus you have another instrument that allows much  more diversity."  </P> <P> **** "Monstrosity" (CSULA 888, available from (213) 343-4060) finds the  first-rate Cal State Los Angeles Jazz Ensemble tearing through a handful of  vital originals -- Jose Arellano's title track and director David Caffey's  "Samba de Linda" among them -- and a couple of Woody Shaw cookers. Solid solos  from the likes of saxophonists Sharon Hirata and Randall Willis and trombonists  Luis Bonilla and Gary Smith abound. . . .  </P></p>

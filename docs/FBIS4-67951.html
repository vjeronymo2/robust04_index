			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 29 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) informed North Korea on 27 April that it  would send inspectors to Pyongyang to witness the change of fuel  bars at a 5-megawatt atomic reactor in Yongbyon on the condition  that the two sides discuss the issue of taking sample materials  on used fuel later, a diplomatic source here in Seoul said on  Friday.    The source said that IAEA plans to send five inspectors to  North Korea and asked Pyongyang to issue visas to three  inspectors in addition to the two who had already obtained visas.    If things go on smoothly, the five IAEA inspectors would  leave Vienna where the IAEA Secretariat is located on April 30  and fly into Pyongyang via Beijing on May 2 or 3.    ``IAEA's position is that sample of after-use fuel should be  taken without fail at the time of the change of fuel bars,'' the  source said.    ``I understand that IAEA chose to send inspectors on the  condition of the later discussion of sample taking inasmuch as  the deadline for fuel rod change is imminent.''    The five IAEA inspectors will not only witness the change of  fuel bars but will also conduct routine checks such as the  change of films and battery of surveillance camera, the source  said.    A North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman said on April 27  they would accept seven items out of the eight-point inspection  demanded by IAEA with the sole exception of sample taking.    Besides, North Korea expressed the willingness to place  after-use fuel rods under IAEA surveillance until sample is  taken under an agreement they would reach with IAEA.</p>

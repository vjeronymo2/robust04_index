			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Travel: Exertion by day and indulgence by night - Eschew Watneys beer and gala nights for a remarkable beauty-filled landscape 'MAJORCA? Ma-jor-ca?' People pronounce the name quizzically, then narrow their eyes and curl their lips a little as you explain to them why you have been there twice in the last year and can't wait to return when the next off-peak season arrives. We all know that Majorca is the single most popular holiday destination for the British - upwards of 1.6m of them go there. So it seems like a dereliction of duty to join the massed hordes in search of sun and sangria in the Balearics instead of heading towards a newly-discovered retreat in Bulgaria or Guinea-Bissau. Yet the vast majority of British tourists are content to huddle together in one small part of what is still, paradoxically, a secret island. They clutter a 50-mile south-western stretch of Majorca's 200-mile coastline in high summer, and do not seem aware that even a short walk inland would reveal another island entirely. No Watneys beer on tap, no hotels that look like Sing-Sing and offer gala nights. Instead, there is a remarkable landscape filled with orange and lemon groves, mountain ranges, bays and inlets, orchids, almond blossom, pine forests, rare birds and superb walks. The ground-rules for enjoying this other Majorca are simple: ignore July and August, avoid the concrete jungles around the Bay of Palma, alternate the beach life with adventurous walks and pack a copy of Landscapes of Mallorca by Valerie Crespi-Green. The island, shaped like a conch shell, owes its remarkably pleasant climate to two ranges of craggy mountains, the Tramuntana along the north coast and the Llevante on the east coast. These protect the inland areas against cold winds and offer shade for the plains full of orange and lemon orchards and olive trees. To enjoy the contrasts of Majorca I split my stay between a small hotel, the Mar y Vent, in the secluded fishing village of Banalbufar on the west coast, and a larger hotel, the Bon Sol, in Illetas, just 8km outside Palma. These hotels are family-run, now a rarity in Majorca as in many other places. Banalbufar is so small that most tourists drive right through it, which is good news for those who stay at the Mar y Vent. The Vives family has been running the hotel since 1932 and its superb location makes it ideal for those who want to explore the area on foot. Banalbufar teeters on cliff edges and the hotel is perched on a hillside overlooking the sea. The village has the best example of Majorca's remarkable stone-stepped terraces which cover the hills in many parts. These terraces originated with the Moorish occupation and are an ingenious aid to growing fruit and tomatoes. A comfortable hotel and access to good walking routes are the two essential ingredients for a successful break in Majorca. Exertion by day and self-indulgence by night make an ideal combination. The Bon Sol in Illetas caters for this kind of balanced regime. It looks like a well-preserved Spanish country house with traditional architecture, objets d'art rescued from monasteries, antique furniture and flourishing gardens dotted with cacti and palm trees. It feels like a large private house because that is what it was before it became a hotel in 1953. The ebullient owner, Martin Xamena, and his English wife tell the story of how Martin's father built the Bon Sol on a deserted site overlooking the sea, surrounded by pine woods, years before the Palma area became a tourist centre. Despite its 100 rooms, it still feels more like a friendly country mansion than a hotel. The Bon Sol is an ideal base for walkers. If you have a hired car you can drive to the starting-point of nearby walks or (as I did) use a combination of the excellent local bus services and cheap taxis. Valerie Crespi-Green, an Englishwoman who has lived on the island for many years, is adding some new walks for a new edition of her Landscapes of Mallorca, so we took up the challenge to road-test one of the new routes with her. We met in Deya, high in the mountains, where the rugged landscape and superb sea views have attracted writers and artists for years. Robert Graves lived here from the 1930s until his death and is buried in the village cemetery. Valerie Crespi-Green grades all her walks, ranging from easy to strenuous. Our route, Deya to Soller, was over five miles but I was relieved to learn that it was rated as ideal for beginners (my own grade) because of the absence of steep climbs. Much of the walk was over ancient cobblestones, using the old path that used to be the only trail for locals to ride from Deya to Soller. We followed the author's written directions and found them clear and accurate. During the two-hour walk we did not see another soul. With only the occasional sheep-bell to break the silence and the sight of an odd goat munching away outside a deserted 13th-century chapel, it was strange to realise that we were not so far from the saturated tower blocks of Magaluf and Arenal. Wild orchids, euphorbia, Balearic crocuses, clematis and violets lined the route, which has dramatic views of the coastline and mountains, including the highest peak on the island, Puig Major. According to a keen walker there are 650 muscles in the human body and every time you go on a decent walk you use 50 per cent of them: his words came back to me as we walked down to Soller, with its small fishing harbour and clattering wooden train that runs to Palma. We took the narrow-gauge railway that hugs the orange groves so tightly that you can almost pick the fruit as you judder along. Back at the Bon Sol we had the chance to sample authentic local cooking with Martin and Lorraine Xamena as our guides. They took us along hairpin bends and up a corkscrew road to a village called Genova where the Na Burguesa restaurant has a spectacular view over the Bay of Palma. Majorcan food is ideal for trenchermen - or anyone who works up an appetite after a healthy walk. Pa omb oli is the classic local starter: country bread covered with ham, olive oil and tomatoes. The robust wines go well with the house special, cordero al homo, leg of lamb. When they say leg, they mean leg. A complete leg or shoulder was served to everyone. For my last walk I was content to pack a rucksack with some freshly-baked bread and cold meats, oranges and a bottle of local white. We took the bus from Palma to Puerto Pollensa in the north of the island, a quiet resort with wide beaches that has managed to hold off the greediest developers. The walk from Puerto Pollensa through the Boquer valley is one of the most popular in Valerie Crespi-Green's book: six kilometres of rugged landscapes, pines, jagged cliffs and a windy valley that is popular with keen bird-watchers ('twitchers') because of the many rare birds that can be seen. Twitchers from all over Europe regularly take this walk because of the chance to glimpse black-eared wheat-eaters, rock-thrushes, kestrels, peregrines, even the scops owl. One twitcher told me that the biggest thrill of his fortnight in Majorca was catching sight of Eleonora's falcon and a Marmora's warbler. I can hardly tell a robin from a raven but we did spot a vulture swooping along the mountainside. The walk ends in an isolated cove with the enormous rock of Es Colomer jutting out from the Formentor coastline. As we sat on rocks at the cove and let the waves cool our feet, I laid my bottle of white wine in a rock pool. Within a few minutes it was chilled enough to drink and ready us for the return journey.

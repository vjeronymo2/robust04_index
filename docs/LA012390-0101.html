			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GILLESPIE VOWS TO DISALLOW SOME INSURANCE FIRM COSTS  </P> <P> Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie said Monday she will try to prevent  insurance companies' costs for political contributions, bad-faith judgments,  institutional advertising, fines and penalties from being passed on to  consumers in higher rates.  </P> <P> Gillespie added that she will also place caps on what companies can charge  customers for what she deems in rate hearings to be "excessive executive  compensation."  </P> <P> In short, Gillespie vowed that, in calculating what rates should be, she will  try to disallow the expenses she listed. That policy would follow suggestions  made to her in recent months by a number of consumer groups seeking to hold  down rates.  </P> <P> Gillespie's latest expressions of intent also include a suggestion that she  "press" in ongoing hearings for the 11.2% "fair rate of return" standard for  companies that she originally advanced last summer but later wavered on.  </P> <P> "The (Insurance) Department has developed a record in the proceedings which  supports its original figure," she stated.  </P> <P> Such a rate of return, lower than most companies contend they should get, could  eventually mean lower rates and more customer rebates under Proposition  103-mandated rollbacks. However, as in many past instances, following through  on her pronouncements will almost certainly lead to industry lawsuits seeking  to invalidate them.  </P> <P> Gillespie also responded to what she termed "unfounded, inaccurate and truly  tasteless" charges last week from Harvey Rosenfield, chairman of the Voter  Revolt organization that sponsored Proposition 103, that she is intentionally  aborting enforcement of the measure in a kind of conspiracy with the industry.  </P> <P> "Rosenfield's accusations are absolutely and demonstrably false," Gillespie  said. "Harvey and his Proposition 103 proponents are busier than sandbox cats  trying to cover up a flawed law based on empty promises."  </P> <P> Instead of Proposition 103's promised rate rollbacks, Gillespie said, she  believes that "millions of Californians will actually see rate increases as a  result of the proposition's passage." She did not elaborate.  </P> <P> Rosenfield responded by reiterating his charge that many of Gillespie's  statements of intent are deliberate attempts to "make it look like she's  enforcing 103, when, in fact, she's crippling it." He accused her of  incorporating legal defects in her actions that allow the companies to  successfully sue her.  </P></p>

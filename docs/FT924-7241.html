			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (14): Lighter vehicles may be the key - Car population growth is outstripping gains in fuel economy and cleanliness THE world motor industry is driving hard for greater energy efficiency and lower environmental impact, but it is still going backwards. The relentless desire of the world's population to acquire or retain personal mobility - still only just starting to be assuaged among many populous Third World countries - means that vehicle population growth continues to outpace gains in fuel efficiency. On the environmental front the notable victory which, since the early 1970s, the catalytic converter has scored against some exhaust pollutants - notably acid rain-causing oxides of nitrogen - is now viewed as, if not pyrrhic, then far from total. The 'cat' may eliminate 90 per cent of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. But it can do little about carbon dioxide, an inescapable product of combustion and which has leaped up the list of perceived culprits in relation to global warming. Indicative of the problem is that for every gallon of oil consumed by a car in the form of fuel, about 19 pounds of carbon dioxide are released into the atmosphere. The measure of both the energy consumption and environmental problem becomes even clearer when it is realised that in 1953 there were 53m cars on the world's roads. Now there are 430m and the car population is being added to at a rate of about 9.5m a year. The world's truck and bus fleet is growing at a rate of about 3.6m units a year and currently stands at around 140m. Add around 100m motorycles, the population of which is growing at around 4m a year, and it is likely that by as early as 2010 the total vehicle population will be approaching 1.1bn. Engine design has been improving consistently, with precisely-metered fuel injection systems, multi-valve cylinder heads, and variable ignition and camshaft systems all contributing to improved fuel consumption per cubic centimetre of engine capacity. However, that is to consider the engine in isolation. Data from organisations such as the US Environmental Protection Agency and Japan's Ministry of Transport indicate that in the past few years fuel efficiency in terms of overall miles per gallon has started to go backwards. This is a consequence of consumers, their memories of oil crises fading throughout the 1980s, demanding faster, more powerful cars fitted with many more convenience systems such as central locking and electric sunroofs. Cars have thus become heavier, and require comparatively more fuel to propel them. From next year, as increased concern about the environment and fuel efficiency starts to work its way through the industry's vehicle design processes, car and light truck mileage per gallon should start to increase again. However, this can do no more than slow the rate of growth in demand for vehicle fuels. Greater energy efficiency in the transport sector in the broader sense requires government policy actions on a wider front, stresses US motor industry and energy consultant Michael Walsh. The propensity of the developing world to follow industrial nations down the road to private motorisation can be affected significantly by public policy towards land use, housing and all forms of transport infrastructure, Mr Walsh pointed out to a recent Institute of Mechanical Engineering conference in London. At the heart of such policies ought to lie housing planning to minimise the incentive to use private motorised transport, between home and workplace for example. But the prognosis for the sprawling 'mega-cities' which have sprung up haphazardly around some developing world capitals is hardly good. With little strategically-planned housing, commercial or transport infrastructure to cater to such populations, traffic congestion and high energy wastage appear likely to eclipse that of developed world cities as income rises sufficiently to make vehicles affordable to the majority. The developed world, at least, is now committing, albeit belatedly, substantial resources to addressing the problems. At the vehicle technology level, added impetus has been given to research and development by the recognition that, in increasing fuel efficiency through reducing consumption, there are knock-on environmental benefits through a pro rata reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. Complementary to this is the encouragement being given in many countries to greater use of public transport and of more intensive use of individual cars. In North America, for example, residents of cities from Seattle to Washington are now well acclimatised to urban freeway lanes usable only by cars with more than one occupant. In Europe, through collaborative EC research projects such as the Prometheus programme involving all indigenous European vehicle manufacturers, the technology is being advanced which, by the end of the decade, should provide European car and truck drivers with route guidance and congestion avoidance advice systems expected significantly to lower fuel consumption through avoiding wasted mileage and fuel-wasteful 'stop-start' motoring. Cities like Munich, meanwhile, are experimenting with traffic advisory systems aimed at eliminating much of the fuel wastage associated with drivers simply cruising around seeking somewhere to park. During one peak hour monitoring exercise in a corner of the city, some 70 per cent of cars on the move were found to be looking for somewhere to park. The intention is to have permanent monitoring of all parking spaces available in the city centre, with drivers being able to ascertain whether space is available before setting out on a journey (and, city authorities hope, opting to take public transport instead). Synchronising traffic lights and reducing other obstacles to free traffic flow are also seen as contributors to increased energy efficiency of road transport. While the primary objective of the 'red routes' - severely restricting roadside parking - being introduced in London is to speed commuting traffic flows, they, too, are playing a role in reducing fuel consumption by reducing 'stop-start' and thus allowing engines to operate more efficiently. Complementary to this approach is the planned reintroduction by Volkswagen of 'eco' cars - in which the engine cuts out completely whenever the car is motionless in traffic and restarted automatically when a gear is engaged and the accelerator pressed. It is an approach first tried by VW in the mid-1980s but which foundered because of consumer reluctance to trust the engine to keep restarting. Greater trust in car technology, however, is leading VW to try again. The pursuit of greater energy efficiency through weight-saving in vehicles is now firmly back on the agenda. Within the next three years Audi will launch its first car incorporating an aluminium body - much lighter than steel. Other manufacturers are expected to follow the same route, to the extent that aluminium is now expected to outpace composite plastics as the 'growth' material of the 1990s. lt will go some way to offset the additional weight of cars dictated by more complex on-board systems and ever more rigorous safety standards. In terms of whole-life energy efficiency, the old argument against aluminium  -that it involves a far greater energy input to make than steel - is being increasingly offset by its ability to be repeatedly recycled at low cost. Downsizing of cars is also seen as a promising route to greater fuel efficiency, with industry forecasts suggesting average per-vehicle fuel consumption improvements of up to 35 per cent can be achieved by the year 2005 through a combination of smaller cars, new materials and engine technology improvement, including a more widespread switch to economical diesels.</p>

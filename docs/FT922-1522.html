			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Khmer Rouge joins Cambodia talks AN international conference on aid to war-ravaged Cambodia began a full session in Tokyo early today, with Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan reluctantly taking part alongside leaders of the country's other factions. He had threatened to boycott the meeting, which aims to raise about Dollars 600m (Pounds 325m) to rebuild Cambodia after more than a decade of civil war. But he changed his mind yesterday, apparently under pressure from China, the host country, Japan, and the other Cambodian factions. The conference is being attended by representatives of over 30 countries, 12 international organisations and the European Commission. There had earlier been conflicting reports about the Khmer Rouge's participation. A boycott of the meeting by Mr Khieu would have left the Khmer Rouge even more isolated, as its refusal to participate in the disarmament phase of a UN-brokered peace settlement has already cast doubt on the future of the country. The Khmer Rouge has refused to lay down arms until Vietnamese troops have left the country. Vietnam says its troops have all done so. Today's conference is a centrepiece of Japan's efforts to play a larger role in seeking a solution to the Cambodian conflict. Tokyo is expected to pledge Dollars 150m to the effort and the government is looking at whether it should send troops from its self-defence forces to Cambodia. Prince Norodom Sihanouk, president of the SNC, said he would like troops from Japan to construct roads and bridges in his country under the control of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia.</p>

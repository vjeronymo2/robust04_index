			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Leading Article: Better late than never RUSSIA's reformers have been understandably frustrated by the slow response of the west to their pleas for help; but yesterday's package was worth waiting for. Western money alone cannot solve the economic problems that the ex-Soviet states are facing. But they have little chance of solving these problems without it. What the Russian government has wanted most in recent weeks has been a positive signal of support from the west. The proposed Dollars 18bn package of aid and trade credits and a further Dollars 6bn stabilisation fund together provide an unexpectedly generous show of support. They will prove an invaluable weapon for Mr Boris Yeltsin and his allies in their efforts to prevent their reforms being derailed by the growing internal opposition. But Mr Yeltsin needs more than promises. While the western governments, and particularly the US, have been agonising over how to respond to cries for support, the economic situation in Russia has been deteriorating rapidly. In the weeks following the January price liberalisation, it appeared that inflation had been brought under control. But monetary policy has been relaxed in recent weeks and inflation is rising. Maintaining the momentum of reform is essential. The next phase of liberalisation, planned for the end of April, will free almost all prices, including energy prices. The impact on living standards will be severe. But the pain will be even greater if the current, grossly-undervalued exchange rate, continues to depress real wages. To attempt this next phase of liberalisation without first putting the stabilisation fund in place would be foolhardy. Unless the rouble is first stabilised at a more realistic rate, the likely outcome of raising prices will be an offseting rise in wages and a wage-price spiral. The group of seven industrialised countries must deliver on its stabilisation fund pledge by the begining of May, if not earlier. In short, the G7 cannot afford to wait for Russia's full IMF membership to be approved. The G7 is quite right to require IMF approval for the Russian stabilisation plan. Moreover, IMF officials must be in place to monitor its implementation from the outset. But to delay stabilisation support until June or even later would be both damaging and unnecessary. A well monitored macroeconomic stabilisation programme is only part of the solution to Russia's economic mess. Aid should be conditional on a rapid and radical reform of the tax system and a greater effort to speed the privatisation programme. Even then, the collapse of the Russian economy will not be checked until intra-republican trade is revived. Autarky is not economically viable, for Russia or any of the other republics; but the lack of co-operation among the republics remains a formidable obstacle to reform.</p>

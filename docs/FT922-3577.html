			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / International Company News: US wholesale food distributors in Dollars 1.1bn merger TWO of the largest wholesale food distributors in the US - Super Valu and Wetterau - yesterday announced plans to merge their operations, in a deal said to be worth around Dollars 1.1bn. Assuming the transaction goes ahead and does not fall foul of the competition authorities, the combined company would outstrip Oklahoma-based Fleming Companies as the nation's largest wholesale food distributor. Under the outline merger agreement, Super Valu would make a cash offer of Dollars 30.20 for each Wetterau share, valuing the common stock at Dollars 643.3m. It would also take on Dollars 440m of outstanding Wetterau debt, creating the overall Dollars 1.1bn price tag. Ahead of this transaction, Missouri-based Wetterau would also 'demerge' its Shop 'n Save subsidiary, distributing 70 per cent of retailer's shares to existing Wetterau shareholders and retaining the remaining 30 per cent. Shop 'n Save currently comprises a chain of 28 'superwarehouse' food retail outlets, based in eastern Missori and Illinois. Its annual sales are about Dollars 500m and operating profits about Dollars 10m. plies around 2,650 supermarkets and food retail outlets in 31 states, mostly operated by independent retailers. It also has around 105 retail outlets of its own. Total sales last year were Dollars 10.6bn. Wetterau, meanwhile, distributes food and non-food products to about 2,850 retailers and over 1,200 institutional customers in 29 states. Both companies said yesterday that the rationale behind the deal was potential operating efficiencies and greater geographical reach. However, Moody's, the Wall Street rating agency, said that it was placing debt ratings of both companies on review for a possible downgrade. Moody's acknowledged that there could be operating cost benefits from the merger, but noted that the food distribution industry has been hit food price deflation, weak consumer spending and increased competition. Shares in Wetterau, quoted on the NASDAQ over-the-counter market and currently ranking as the nation's third-largest grocery wholesaler, jumped Dollars 6 3/8 to Dollars 30 3/8 yesterday, while Super Valu, the second-largest food distributor, lost Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 25 1/4 .</p>

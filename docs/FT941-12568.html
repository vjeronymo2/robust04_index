			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Man in the News: Cut and blow-dry is not enough - John Meyer / John Major's new press secretary has a tough task to revamp his master's image Mr Christopher Meyer has walked into the most difficult job in Whitehall. This week the 49-year-old official swapped the careful diplomacy of the Foreign Office for the post of press secretary in No 10 Downing Street. His task: to restore lustre to Mr John Major's government. You can understand why he might feel daunted. The Conservative party and the government it is supposed to sustain in office are gripped by yet another crisis of confidence. The common thread has been a failure to demonstrate purpose and grip. From the furore over ministers' extramarital activities through the fiasco over the back-to-basics policy to the row over taxes, the government has appeared paralysed in the headlights of a succession of oncoming trucks. As one minister sighed wearily: 'For a government so accident-prone it's extraordinary that we have yet to discover how to mount a decent damage-limitation operation.' It will be Mr Meyer's role to minimise the accidents and clear up the mess when they happen. He comes confidently and willingly to the job. A fluent Russian speaker with a French wife and three children, he is every inch the Foreign Office high flyer. Formerly number two in the Washington embassy his next job is likely to be ambassador in one of Britain's largest overseas posts, probably Moscow, where he served in the early 1980s. He likes journalists. He learnt the briefing trade from the abrasive Mr Bernard Ingham who served for a decade as Lady (then Mrs Margaret) Thatcher's press secretary. For five years during the same period, Mr Meyer served Sir Geoffrey Howe, the then foreign secretary, in the same role. The two were a formidable double-act on overseas trips. Mr Meyer enjoys the combat involved in selling policy to sceptical journalists. He is sufficiently self-assured to believe that more often than not he will come out on top in such encounters. In preliminary sparring this week with members of that arcane Westminster club, the parliamentary lobby, his demeanour carried a simple message: don't try to push me around. But the journalists will do just that. Among the myriad of problems facing the prime minister is a near-complete breakdown in relations between No 10 Downing Street and large sections of the press. The conventions which once made for a civilised, if occasionally explosive, relationship with the lobby's hard-nosed political reporters have all but broken down. Conservative newspapers such as The Sun and the Daily Mail have made it clear they have all but given up on Mr Major. Other editors echo privately the view that the prime minister is incapable of rebuilding his authority. In Mr Meyer's twice-daily briefings for two dozen or so lobby correspondents  -all his comments are unattributable and thinly disguised in such phrases as 'Downing Street said' - he will be at the sharp end of the disenchantment. Several recent episodes show what he is up against. In unguarded moments, Mr Major has been heard describing right-wing cabinet colleagues as 'bastards' and backbench opponents as 'barmies'. More recently he was said to have used rather stronger language against his party's right wing. This latest row probably owed more to journalistic hyperbole than to reality. But that is not the point. In different circumstances all such remarks would have gone unreported: a strong prime minister could threaten to slam the door on a newspaper's future access. But Mr Major's position is anything but strong. Journalists do not fear him. So the self-discipline which would normally hold in check those who earn a living from mixing with politicians has disappeared. The prime minister is too nice, too trusting until recently of the journalists he befriended during an uninterrupted rise to prominence during the 1980s. Mr Meyer will be expected to provide a hard edge to his image. There is another challenge. Mr Meyer's political master eschews ideology. He prefers, instead, political pragmatism and problem-solving. But the lesson of his premiership has been that the government must display a sense of strategic purpose. It has also to learn to replace abrupt U-turns with gentle swerves when the going gets rough. The press secretary will have to find words in his briefings to fill the philosophical vacuum. Governments can prosper without a grand design or big idea, but not without a rhetorical framework for policy. Mr Meyer faces other constraints. Mr Major's leadership is the focus of the present storm. If the Conservatives suffer disastrous, as opposed to just heavy, losses in this summer's local and European elections, he will find it hard to remain in office. But his party - and his ministerial colleagues - must bear much of the blame. After 15 years in power and two years of civil war, the Conservatives may have reached the stage where they are unwilling or unable to sustain any leader in office. The party has lost the habit of discipline. It has replaced self-control with a propensity to panic at the slightest excuse. The latest row over the impending tax increases provides a classic example. Backbench Tory MPs have been behaving this week as if no one had told them that taxes were going up. No matter that it was spelled out in no uncertain terms in two Budgets last year, the second of which they applauded vigorously only two months ago. As one senior Whitehall official commented with more than an edge of contempt: 'The Tories don't appear to understand that when you put taxes up people have to pay more.' The indiscipline has not been confined to the backbenches. Cabinet ministers and some of their more junior colleagues have engaged in the sort of public jostling which has fuelled speculation that Mr Major is under threat. Mr Michael Portillo's decision to raise his public profile has given the impression that the youthful chief secretary to the Treasury wants to reinforce his credentials as the favourite of the Tory right. Friends of friends of Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary, are reminding colleagues that he is now fully fit after his heart attack. Those who would like to see Mr Douglas Hurd fill No 10 are whispering that we should not take too seriously his (genuine) protestations that he sees his stewardship of the Foreign Office as a last job in politics. The prospective candidacy of aggressively self-confident Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor and clear favourite in any race for the succession, tends to speak for itself. Much of the feverish speculation is simply the product of the Westminster hothouse, of backbench Tory MPs with too little to do and no future under the present leadership. But rushing from radio to television studios, cabinet colleagues are not always fulsome in their praise for the prime minister. In the words of one, rather more circumspect, member of the prime minister's inner circle: 'Too many people are setting out their stalls. We need a bit more loyalty and a lot less self-promotion.' Mr Meyer understands the problems. He will attempt to influence policy as well as presentation. In a revealing paper he wrote during a year's sabbatical at Harvard University, he summed up the role of the press secretary as 'always to take and hold the initiative in public debate'. To do that, he or she had to be at the centre of policy-making. Friends from his Washington days say that he was both street-wise and carefully attuned to the internal politics of the US Administration. They confirm the impression that he was thinking personally when he stressed in the same paper that press secretaries should 'see the job not as an exercise in defensive play and damage-limitation (though these are often needed) but as a series of daily opportunities to score points and to shape the agenda'. No one doubts that he will be good at doing just that. What Mr Meyer cannot be sure of is whether it will be enough. From his office in Downing Street, he has no standing in or influence on the dark manoeuvrings of the Tory party. He is a civil servant, pledged to keep out of politics. But it is the process of politics - and specifically the slow disintegration of the Conservative party - with which Mr Major cannot get to grips. Perhaps no leader could. There are many in the party's senior ranks who believe that the Tories will not solve their own or the country's problems by getting rid of the present leader. Mr Meyer must help ensure that view prevails.</p>

			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong tumbles by 4.1 per cent The Nikkei average lost ground in spite of buying by overseas investors, as dealers adjusted their positions and companies took profits ahead of the long weekend, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The lead index fell 122.71 to 20,469.45 after a high of 20,655.67 and a low of 20,440.14, a week's gain of 1.7 per cent. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 1.29 to 1,647.24 and the Nikkei 300 lost 0.43 to 302.69. Volume fell to 450m shares from 571m, the moderation of the market's enthusiasm reflecting Monday's national holiday. Losers led gainers by 561 to 471 with 154 unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 1.94 to 1,360.72. Participants awaited the outcome of the branch managers' meetings at the Big Four brokers - Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi - and their strategies for the next business year starting next month. The brokers themselves were lower on the spate of downward earnings revisions for the year ending March 31, announced on Thursday. Sanyo Securities, which said that it would post a pre-tax loss of Y8bn, fell Y4 to Y675. Nomura Securities, which also revised down its earning projection due to lower-than-expected equity commissions, lost Y10 to Y2,380. Steel companies, which have been higher on active foreign buying recently, met profit-taking by corporations. Nippon Steel lost Y6 to Y354 and Kawasaki Steel declined Y3 to Y375. In contrast, speculative issues were higher on buying by individuals. Honshu Paper shot up Y55 to Y825 and Nippon Carbon rose Y37 to Y486. Foreign investors sought shipbuilders, with Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries up Y8 to Y468 and Kawasaki Heavy Industries rising Y16 to Y419. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 0.88 to 22,546.04 in volume of 110.2m shares. Roundup A sharp fall in Hong Kong depressed much of the remainder of the region. HONG KONG tumbled 4.1 per cent as institutions continued to sell blue chips and small investors joined in, taking the week's fall to 7.8 per cent. The Hang Seng index fell 380.82 to 9,132.31, having pulled up from a day's low of 8,996. One London analyst described the week's decline as the continued 'flip-side' to the euphoria which saw the market surge during November and December last year, as reality continues to return to the market. Many UK funds had managed to make their exit near the top of the market, but US investors were still selling as worries grew over the outlook for the Chinese economy. The analyst added that many investors were awaiting more realistic valuations as a trigger to start buying in the region again and that at current lower levels, Hong Kong was beginning to look more attractive. All sectors have been hit by the bear-run with finance and property among the heaviest losers. HSBC Holdings slid HKDollars 4 to HKDollars 92.50, while its Hang Seng Bank unit fell HKDollars 3 to HKDollars 52.50. Cheung Kong lost HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 37.50 and its associate, Hutchison Whampoa, lost 75 cents to HKDollars 30.25. SINGAPORE encountered widespread foreign and local selling, sparked by the fall in Hong Kong, but a little bargain-hunting helped the market recoup some losses at the close. The Straits Times Industrials index fell 49.63 or 2.3 per cent to 2,104.02, for a 3.9 per cent fall over the week. TAIWAN sustained a 2.3 per cent fall in the weighted index as pressure told on the financial sector in particular. The index fell 122.25 to 5,274.81, a decline across the week of 1 per cent, with turnover at TDollars 45.6bn, up from Thursday's TDollars 39bn, but still moderate. The financial sector dipped 2.9 per cent with Chinatrust, the day's most active issue, falling TDollars 1.50 to TDollars 63. SEOUL closed easier in moderate trading after brief gains were wiped out by late selling pressure, brokers said. The suspension of trading in Namhan Paper, after the company sought court protection from creditors, dampened sentiment and the composite index fell 5.49 to 893.07, for a 1.2 per cent fall on the week. KUALA LUMPUR ended weaker but off the day's lows as a spate of bargain-hunting boosted prices late in the day. The composite index finished 20.14 lower at 1,007.60, for a 3.7 per cent fall on the week. MANILA also felt the shock waves from Hong Kong and the composite index lost 55.33 to 2,657.98, but remained up 4 per cent on the week. Philippine Long Distance Telephone weighed on sentiment following an overnight fall in New York, closing off 25 pesos at 1,875 pesos. Turnover rose to 1.23bn pesos with some 3.3bn shares changing hands. AUSTRALIA was only slightly affected by events elsewhere, the All Ordinaries index shedding just 0.9 to 2,163.5, barely changed on the week. Turnover was ADollars 444.3m. Lend Lease gained 2 cents to ADollars 17.92 after announcing that it was to develop a joint venture with Indonesia's second largest company and its subsidiary, Bank International Indonesia. BANGKOK came off 1.6 per cent with pressure seen in blue chips overall, although there was some bargain-hunting evident in several sectors. The SET index fell 19.80 to 1,246.84, off 5.5 per cent on the week. Turnover was thin at Bt4bn.</p>

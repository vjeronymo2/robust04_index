			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prosecutor General Alush Dragoshi by Reis </F> Cico in Tirana; date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Cico] Mr. Prosecutor, the Greek mass media and  government officials have declared that more than 30 minority  members have been arrested in the south of Albania. What is  your comment on these statements?    [Dragoshi] As is made known to the entire public through the  Albanian mass media, some time ago the Tirana District  Prosecutor's Office initiated criminal proceedings against five  [as heard] minority members in the districts of Delvine,  Sarande, and Gjirokaster, who are charged with ordinary and  political crimes, such as the illegal keeping of arms and  anti-constitutional activities. As the social danger of these  criminal acts is very accentuated, we have arrested them.    The investigators charged to inquire into these cases have  been sent to the respective districts to carry out the  investigation of criminal cases and interrogate witnesses. More  specifically, these investigators have summoned 30 or more  witnesses to clarify these cases. That is, the fact of  summoning these witnesses does not mean that they were  apprehended or arrested by the Prosecutor's Office. They are  summoned only to be interrogated as witnesses and to clarify  charges against the persons arrested. The announcement on the  arrest of these persons, broadcast by various mass media and the  Greek Government officials, is not at all true. I, once again,  declare publicly that this fact is not true. [as heard]    [Cico] How many arrested persons are there?    [Dragoshi] The number of the arrested persons, as I  mentioned previously, is only six. They are now being  investigated while under arrest. To inquire into their case, we  will question witnesses, consider documentary evidence, and  compile expert reports, as defined in the Code of Criminal  Procedure.</p>

			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Upton chief defends tripled salary level Mr Jeffrey Gould, chief executive of the lossmaking Upton &amp; Southern retail group, earned Pounds 153,000 in the 18 months to July 31 - three times what his predecessor in the post was earning on an annualised basis. According to Upton's annual report, Mr Alan Watts, chief executive before new management was brought in in January 1993, earned Pounds 34,000 in his final 12 months. Mr Gould defended the increase, saying that Upton, which ran into difficulties after acquiring the Reject Shop in March, was now 'a much larger company and a turnaround situation'.</p>

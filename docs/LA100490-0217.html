			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FEW REMAIN AS LAST ELDRESS OF SHAKER SECT DIES  </P> <P> Bertha Lindsay, the last eldress of the Shakers, a celibate religious sect that  promoted communal living and pacifism for more than 200 years, has died. She  was 93.  </P> <P> Lindsay, who died Wednesday, was one of the last members of the religion that  once boasted 6,000 members in 24 communities. One woman in her 90s remains in  Canterbury, once home to 400 Shaker residents. Fewer than 10 live in Maine.  </P> <P> Able to add to their ranks only by taking in orphans or converts, Shaker  spiritual leaders decided to halt new membership in 1965, but Lindsay often  said the movement's beliefs would not die with the last Shakers.  </P> <P> "Mother" Ann Lee, who brought the religion to the United States in 1774,  prophesied that ultimately Shakers "would diminish to as many as a child could  count on one hand, and then there would be a revival of the spirit," Lindsay  once said.  </P> <P> Lindsay, born July 28, 1897, in Braintree, Mass., died nearly 2 1/2 years after  Eldress Gertrude Soule, who also lived at Shaker Village in Canterbury.  </P> <P> Only 94-year-old Sister Ethel Hudson remains in the New Hampshire village. A  small community in Sabbathday Lake, Me., includes five pre-1965 members and at  least three admitted afterward despite the decision by Canterbury leaders.  </P> <P> The Shakers, formally the United Society of Believers in Christ's Second  Appearing, gained their nickname from trembling brought on by religious fervor.  They advocated living apart from society at large in communal villages.  </P> <P> Everyone was considered equal and Shaker government offered women leadership  roles little known in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Two eldresses and two  elders formed the ministry that made decisions for the society.  </P> <P> Lindsay came to Canterbury in 1905 as an orphan. Orphans taken in by the  Shakers had to decide at age 21 whether to take a vow of celibacy and remain in  the community or leave. The day after Lindsay's 21st birthday she signed the  Shaker covenant and donned the white starched bonnet that would identify her as  a Shaker sister for the rest of her life.  </P> <P> When she turned 90, Lindsay lost her sight and put her energies into recording  her life story and memories of Shaker life.  </P></p>

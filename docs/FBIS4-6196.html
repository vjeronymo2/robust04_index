			<p>BFN     [Text] The North Korean side sent a telephone message to  our side on 19 April demanding the repatriation of Kim In-so and  Ham Se-hwan, who have not converted from communism over a long  period of time.    Yi Song-ho, acting chairman of the Central Committee of the  North Korean Red Cross Society, North Korea sent a telephone  message to Kang Yong-hun, chairman of the ROK National Red  Cross, on 19 April, pointing out that for the South side to  reject the North side's demand to repatriate the two men, which  has happened on two occasions, runs counter to the humanitarian  ideology of the Red Cross.    Today's message by North Korea is being interpreted as a  countermeasure to the fact that the South side has started to  show interest in the North Korean humanitarian issue, such as  the South Korean Government's decision to allow North Korean  loggers who escaped from logging camps in Russia to defect to  South Korea.</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: Reebok flat as shoe sales in US tumble Reebok International, the US sports-shoe maker, reported net income of Dollars 50.7m from continuing operations, little changed from Dollars 49.8m last time, writes Richard Tomkins. Poor sales of its athletic shoes were largely to blame: Reebok footwear sales in the US were nearly 23 per cent lower than in the previous year's fourth quarter. For the year, Reebok appeared to show a sharp improvement in net income to Dollars 223.4m from Dollars 114.4m. However, profits from continuing operations were virtually flat at Dollars 230.4m, compared with Dollars 232.3m last time. Mr Paul Fireman, chairman and chief executive, said the company was disappointed by the decline in US footwear sales in the second half, but the year ended with orders up 14.4 per cent overall. There had been good performances from the US apparel business, Reebok's international business, and Rockport's international outdoor and women's footwear businesses.</p>

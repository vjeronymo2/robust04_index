			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Survey of Israel (10): Easier in principle - Privatisation proceeds slowly ISRAEL'S privatisation programme appears to be gaining some momentum after a painfully slow start. In February, the government sold off 20 per cent of its shares in Israel Chemicals, the largest state-owned industrial concern, for Dollars 235m, in the biggest share offering ever made on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE). Early next year, it plans to issue an international tender to sell off a controlling stake in the national telecommunications company, Bezek, which has already been partly privatised on the TASE. It is difficult to find anyone in Israel these days who disputes the benefits of privatisation. What remains an issue of heated controversy, however, is the method of going about it. Specifically, should the government sell its companies on the local stock exchange - a process which generally takes longer but also allows the public to benefit - or should it sell control immediately to private investors and thereby turn in a quick profit? Since taking power last July, Israel's new Labour-led government has taken great pains to show that it wholeheartedly supports privatisation. In spite of its Socialist roots, it has no intention of abandoning free-market reforms begun by the previous Likud government. To prove its point, the first decision taken by the newly formed cabinet last summer was to re-establish a special interministerial committee, charged with overseeing the privatisation programme. On the committee, headed by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, sit the finance minister and the justice minister. The decision was taken a day before the former US Secretary of State, James Baker, arrived in Jerusalem for his first meeting with the prime minister and was interpreted as a clear message to the Americans that the new government views privatisation as one of its top economic priorities. The government of Israel is currently a shareholder in 170 companies, which last year employed 24 per cent of the country's total labour force and accounted for just under 24 per cent of its total exports. The privatisation programme is directed at about 25 of these companies, active mainly in utilities, chemicals, transport and construction. On the whole, these companies have tended to be profitable. The government formally adopted a policy of privatisation in the mid-1980s, when it commissioned First Boston, the New York investment bank, to draw up a master plan for selling off state-owned companies. Owing to opposition by the various ministers responsible for the companies, their management and workers, First Boston's recommendations were never implemented. The only major government company sale to take place in recent years has been that of Paz, Israel's largest oil company, to Australian businessman Jack Liberman. Realising that its programme was going virtually nowhere, the government last year set up the special three-man interministerial committee in the hope that it would facilitate more rapid decisions. Still, Mr Joseph Nitzani, head of the Goverment Corporations Authority - the body responsible for carrying out these decisions - believes there remain major obstacles which stand in the way of privatisation. 'The way things are going today, I can't say I'm very optimistic,' he says. 'There is still a lot of bureaucracy in the decision-making process, and when a company decides it does not want to be privatised, it can put many obstacles in my path.' Mr Nitzani has already submitted a proposal to the interministerial committee which would significantly enhance his authorities and limit the number of parties involved in the decision-making process concerning each company. Within the framework of its privatisation programme for the coming year, the government plans to further reduce its holdings in Israel Chemicals and Bezek, sell off control in El Al, the national airline, and divest itself of its remaining shares in the Zim shipping company. In addition, it intends to draw up a proposal for privatising Israel Aircraft Industries - as well as prepare the groundwork for a share offering in the Israel Electric Corporation. The government has set as a target the sale of Dollars 3bn in state-owned assets by 1994. 'The main goals of our privatisation policy are to develop and stabilise the capital market, attract foreign investment, improve the efficiency of natural monopolies and relieve the burden on the state budget cause by unprofitable government companies,' says Mr Nitzani. Through its emphasis on privatisation, it appears the new government is trying to show its genuine commitment to the principles of reducing state intervention in the economy, freeing the capital markets and furthering competition by breaking down monopolies and cartels and admitting imports. Indeed, despite mounting pressure from industrialists, the government has so far held fast to a trade liberalisation programme introduced last year. As part of this programme, Israel abolished all existing administrative restrictions on imports from third countries, such as quotas and licensing requirements, and replaced them with tariffs, which are to be gradually reduced over a period of five to seven years.</p>

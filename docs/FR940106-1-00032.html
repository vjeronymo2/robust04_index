			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> III.C.10. (formerly C.12.) is proposed to be amended by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removing the requirement that, when leaks are detected, the meter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> setting shall be determined and recorded ``as found,'' and ``as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> left'' after the meter is calibrated. This part of the existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement is duplicated by the linearity test in requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III.D.3. of the proposed Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III.C.13. in the existing Order would be removed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed Order because it is duplicated by the linearity test in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement III.D.3. of the proposed Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III.C.11. (formerly C.21.) would be amended by revising the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrective action to provide for the submittal of a report to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BLM. The form called for in existing requirement C.21. is now  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted to the Minerals Management Service, not to the BLM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed rule, the operator would be required to submit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a report to the BLM showing what corrections were made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III.D.1. (formerly C.7.) would be amended by removing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision allowing consideration of a variance for sales or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocation meters measuring between 200 and 500 Mcf per day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This provision duplicates the general provision for a variance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under Article IV. of the Order. The requirement for the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an indicating thermometer would be removed because when using an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicating thermometer the temperature is not a true average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flowing temperature. All meters measuring more than 100 Mcf per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> day are required to have a temperature recorder. Meters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measuring 100 Mcf per day or less are required to use either a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature recorder or an average flowing temperature.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III.D.2. (new) would ensure that the accuracy of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature recording device is maintained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III.D.3. (formerly C.15.) would be amended for clarification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and to require the recording of readings before and after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustments are made. The words ``of the element range'' would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> added to make it clear what the 0 and 100 percent refer to.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III.D.4. (new) would be added to require calibration equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be more accurate than the equipment being calibrated. If the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing equipment is not more accurate than the equipment being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calibrated, the inherent uncertainty in the metering equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III.D.5. (new) would be added to require documentation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification or recertification of calibration equipment to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to the authorized officer at the time of calibration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III.D.6. (formerly C.17.) would be amended to allow meters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that measure 100 Mcf or less per day to be inspected and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calibrated semiannually rather than quarterly. Experience has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shown that quarterly inspections and calibrations of meters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measuring such low volumes are neither cost effective nor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to assure an acceptable degree of accuracy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III.D.7. (formerly C.18.) would be amended to require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operators to notify the authorized officer of the BLM well in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advance of calibrations to enable the planning of inspections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III.D.8. (formerly C.19.) would be amended by changing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference to ``measuring equipment'' to ``recording device'' to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conform with changes in other requirements. The current Order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires that an adjustment be made whenever a volume error of 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent or greater occurs. It is proposed to change this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard to ``more than 1 percent'' because volume errors of less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 2 percent on higher volume wells are very significant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, in most instances, it will be the policy of the BLM not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to pursue volume errors of less than 200 Mcf per month, because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the cost of doing so would exceed the value of any additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> royalty that might result. The requirement that the meter be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjusted to zero error would be removed because this is part of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the linearity test requirement in Section III.D.3. For the sake  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of simplicity, the abatement period would be stated as 60 days  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only rather than also stating the alternative ``prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completion of calibration.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III.D.10. would be added combining several requirements from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the existing Order, as explained below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III.D.10.a. (formerly C.4.) would be revised to clarify what  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is meant by the outer 2/3 of the chart range. Also, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference to sizing the orifice would be removed because doing so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not the only alternative available to the operator to maintain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the differential pen in the outer 2/3 of the chart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / SSC Radisson Diamond arrives in London THE SSC Radisson Diamond, the world's first twin-hulled cruise ship, arrived in London yesterday on its maiden voyage from the Rauma shipyard in Finland. The vessel, the biggest of its kind, docked at Tilbury where it dwarfed tugs and pleasure cruisers on the Thames. It is to make five week-long cruises in the Baltic and Mediterranean before returning to its Scandinavian home port. Operated by Diamond Cruises of Helsinki, the Dollars 125m (Pounds 70m) ship relies on a revolutionary design which the designers claim is more efficient than the technology used on the Australian-designed Seacat catamaran operated on cross-Channel routes.</p>

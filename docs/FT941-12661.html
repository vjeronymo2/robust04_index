			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (2): Safer than it used to be - Investing offshore, introduction / The Budget made one helpful tax change, but most Britons do not see the point of going offshore. On this page and the next three, we consider some of the possibilities The UK is still perceived as a reluctant member of the European Union, and the field of offshore investment is no exception. European efforts to encourage funds to be sold across national borders, via the Ucits (undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities) are making only slow progress. According to Robert Fleming, while 4,500 Ucits funds have been authorised, fewer than 250 are registered in more than one country. Whereas, there are some signs of cross-border shifts - the amount of German money managed by mutual funds in Luxembourg is now larger than that in Germany itself - the UK has been particularly recalcitrant. According to Steen Steincke, managing director (retail) for Robert Fleming Europe: 'Very few foreign groups have tried to cross-sell into the UK from European bases, and those that have tried have had limited success. Why is this? Perhaps because the UK is a relatively mature, very competitive market-place with high levels of compliance supervision. These factors make entry costs very high.' Nor, given their peculiar structure (involving three sets of published prices), is there much sign of UK funds being sold overseas. 'Although most UK unit trusts have actually registered as Ucits funds, they remain as virtually domestic market products' says Steincke. Perhaps the most important factor dissuading Britons from investing offshore is that, for most people, the advantages are far from clear. If it is tax efficiency you want, you can invest Pounds 9,000 in personal equity plans each year (Pounds 18,000 for a married couple), and receive all income and capital gains tax-free. Only a limited number of people have sums greater than that to throw around. But Kenneth Clarke's Budget did make one tax change that could give offshore funds an advantage. The Inland Revenue decided to close a loophole which would have allowed cash unit trusts to deduct tax at 20 per cent, giving them an advantage over building societies, which take off tax at 25 per cent. However, the Revenue decided that all unit trusts would henceforth pay tax at 25 per cent. According to the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds (Autif), these proposals would mean that 'foreign dividends received by UK trusts will be taxed at 25 per cent, while the credit for the tax paid will be restricted to 20 per cent. If basic-rate taxpayers invest direct in overseas equities, or though an offshore fund, they will only pay tax at 20 per cent.' Thus, there will be a 5 per cent tax saving for basic-rate taxpayers investing offshore. It seems likely that this loophole will be exploited most by non-Pep qualifying funds, such as those investing in the US. Another recent initiative might also change matters. Charles Schwab, the US discount broker, has launched a version of its 'no-load' service. Investors can buy a range of funds without any initial charge, a saving of up to 5-6 per cent. For the moment, the service is limited to just three fund management groups: Guinness Flight, Wright Investor Services and Rothschild Asset Management. Furthermore, the only Rothschild funds available are its currency funds, which bear no initial charge in any case. However, if the Schwab service expanded to include a large number of funds, it might represent an attractive alternative to onshore funds for cost-conscious investors. The tax advantages of investing offshore have traditionally applied more to bond and deposit funds. Offshore bond funds, unlike their onshore counterparts, can pay income gross. This can make them attractive to non-taxpayers, who otherwise would have to wait to reclaim the tax on an onshore fund from the Inland Revenue. However, taxpayers should note that they are obliged to declare the income received from an offshore fund to the Revenue. Deposit funds offer the chance to 'roll-up' interest gross. While this does not avoid tax, this system has two tax advantages. The first is simple: money compounded gross grows faster than money compounded net. The second advantage is that the investor does not have to pay the tax bill until the money is withdrawn; if, for example, he or she is about to retire and move into a lower tax bracket, this may have advantages. However, there is one important caveat: with taxes rising, there is a chance investors may end up paying an even higher tax bill. The Budget will have reinforced the offshore advantages of these funds. According to Autif: 'Dividends received from cash or bond funds situated in Luxembourg or Dublin will be taxed at only 20 per cent in the hands of UK basic-rate investors, who will (therefore) be encouraged to invest in interest-invested offshore funds.' A more simple advantage of investing offshore is that building societies sometimes offer higher rates to offshore customers, because their costs are lower overseas. What about safety? One name that instantly springs to mind when the word offshore is mentioned is Barlow Clowes. The memories of such scandals may prevent some from investing overseas. However, the cautious offshore investor should be able to sleep at night. There are a number of well-respected names operating offshore, such as GT and Fidelity, and many funds are also SIB-recognised, which means that the UK's chief financial services regulator has accepted that regulation in the offshore centre is equivalent to that in the UK, and that the funds are run in a proper manner. Despite the relatively slow progress it has made, the offshore market will continue to expand. The greatest beneficiaries of offshore investment are expatriates, who find it advantageous to keep their investment out of the tax net of both their home and adopted countries. As multinational corporations increasingly switch their executives from country to country, and as more people decide to retire to sunnier climes such as France and Spain, the demand from expatriates seems bound to increase.</p>

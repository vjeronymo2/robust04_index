			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent] </F>   [Text] Wuensdorf, 23 May -- Although the present alarming  events in Crimea are a domestic affair for Ukraine, it is  obvious that the situation on the peninsula is very complex and  passions are rising, first and foremost in the political sphere,  Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev believes. At the same  time, he expresses the hope that "the problem there will not  develop into a serious, major conflict."    The Russian defense minister said this to correspondents  today when he arrived in Wuensdorf, the headquarters of the  Western Group of Forces [WGF], which is being withdrawn from  Germany.    He will have a meeting here with the WGF command, and in  Berlin he will hold talks with Deutsche Bank representatives  about financing the withdrawal of the Russian forces. Pavel  Grachev described his upcoming meeting with the Deutsche Bank  management as "very important," since this credit finance  institution has been cooperating very successfully with Russia  over the question of finance for the troop withdrawal. He said  that no problems have arisen in this respect.    Furthermore, he will also discuss the final stage of the  withdrawal with the German bankers, and map out prospects for  cooperation, including the training of specialists from Russia,  who will work on banking matters within the armed forces.</p>

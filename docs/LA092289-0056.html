			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> POLITICS IN ESCONDIDO;  </P> <P> D.A. DISMISSES CLAIMS OF ELECTION VIOLATIONS  </P> <P> Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller, saying his office will not become embroiled in  political battles, Thursday dismissed accusations that three members of the  Escondido City Council violated their city's election financing laws -- charges  that opponents believed would have removed them from office.  </P> <P> In a three-page letter to the Escondido Common Sense Committee, Miller wrote  that, although "technically, there may have been misreporting as alleged,"  there was "insufficient evidence to prove willful intent to violate the law.  Likewise, the alleged misreporting is not so egregious to justify criminal  prosecution."  </P> <P> After explaining his office's investigation into the charges, Miller closed:  </P> <P> "Although regrettable, inadvertent errors are to be expected and will not give  rise to criminal prosecution by this office. Under no circumstances will we  permit (minor errors) made in good faith attempts to comply with highly  technical reporting requirements to be transformed from the field of a purely  political battle to the foundation of a serious criminal inquiry."  </P> <P> The committee, which serves as a City Hall watchdog group, had charged, among  other things, that veteran Councilman Jerry Harmon last year loaned two fellow  council members amounts of more than the $250 allowed under city statutes, and  that council members Kris Murphy and Carla DeDominicis, who received the loans  in advance of their election, failed to pay back the money to Harmon within the  60-day period specified in city election statutes. Violation of that code  section called for removal from office.  </P> <P> Committee secretary Patricia (P.K.) Walker, herself an unsuccessful council  candidate last year, said Thursday she faulted Miller's findings and feared  that his attitude toward the charges gives notice to candidates for public  office that they don't have to follow the letter of the law.  </P> <P> "There's a city code that says they can't do the things they did. But he  (Miller) is saying, OK, anything goes because people are incapable of  understanding the codes," Walker said.  </P> <P> The committee will not pursue the matter further, Walker said, "although I hope  someone else will pursue it. Why do we have election codes if they're not going  to be enforced?"  </P> <P> For his part, Harmon said he was not only satisfied by Miller's findings but  thought it was "great that the message (by Miller) is more strongly worded than  I had hoped for."  </P> <P> At issue was the manner in which Harmon bought a newspaper advertisement on  behalf of himself and council candidates DeDominicis and Murphy in advance of  last year's municipal election when they won office. DeDominicis and Murphy  later repaid Harmon $1,424 and $1,739, respectively, and those transactions  were shown on their finance reports.  </P> <P> But Walker's group contends that Harmon essentially loaned the two candidates  the money, in a sum greater than allowed by city code, and that he was repaid  after the deadline had passed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Insufficient Evidence  </P> <P> Miller found that, although there may have been a technical violation, "since  the amounts, sources and recipients of the monies were in fact reported on the  candidates' disclosure statements, there is insufficient evidence to prove  willful intent to violate the law."  </P> <P> Miller noted that the state's Fair Political Practices Commission is  investigating the same charges. The FPPC has yet to conclude its review, a  spokesman said.  </P> <P> Miller also dismissed accusations that Murphy and Harmon improperly reported  in-kind donations in the form of campaign office space, as well as other,  unspecified charges. "Generally, these allegations are broad in scope and  supported only by rumor and speculation," Miller wrote Walker. "Moreover, such  allegations that may be supported in fact are (minor) in character and do not  justify criminal action."  </P> <P> Finally, Miller said he found no evidence to support the charge that the City  Council violated the state's open meeting law, the Brown Act.  </P></p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: IBM performance in UK again worse than parent IBM's performance in the UK was significantly worse than that of its parent for the third year in succession, reflecting the length and depth of the British recession. IBM UK recorded losses in 1992 of Pounds 616m (Dollars 936.32m), equal to 16.4 per cent of revenues, while losses for the worldwide group amounted to 7.7 per cent of revenues. Exports, traditionally a strong feature of the UK subsidiary, fell for the first time, underlining IBM's concern that the European market has turned down precipitously. Sir Anthony Cleaver, IBM UK chairman, said there had been no recovery in the UK because of weak demand, especially for hardware, competitive pressures on margins and currency fluctuations. He said: 'We had the unusual situation where reductions in product costs were unable to keep pace with price trends in the market. Our export market was affected by similar factors.' The group turned over Pounds 3.75bn, 6 per cent down on last year's Pounds 3.98bn. Home revenue fell by 6 per cent to Pounds 1.6bn, compared to Pounds 1.7bn, while exports of goods and services fell from Pounds 2.28bn to Pounds 2.14bn. The operating loss was Pounds 398m. Taking restructuring charges of Pounds 218m into account, the group loss before taxes totalled Pounds 616m, almost five times the Pounds 124m loss in the previous year. Mr Nick Temple, chief executive, who has been masterminding a far-reaching plan to return the company to profitability, said the company was being transformed from a general computing company to a consultancy and services-led business. But he warned that 1993 would be another tough year. 'Our overall manpower has been reduced by 21 per cent since 1990. This has been accompanied by a reduction in the number of UK sites. 'These actions have helped us to achieve a further overall expense reduction of 10 per cent in 1992 and will help us continue to achieve substantial reductions in 1993.' Salaries have been frozen and a further 1,000 jobs are expected to go at IBM UK this year. All the job losses will be made by voluntary redundancy or by attrition, Mr Temple confirmed. IBM UK now employs 13,934 people, compared with 14,909 at the end of 1991. See Lex, Editorial Comment</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rainer Nahrendorf: "Campaign Help of a Very </F> Special Kind--Elder Statesman Helmut Schmidt Plunges the SPD  Into an Awkward Situation With His Recommendations"]    [Text] With his latest book, Das Jahr der  Entscheidung (published by Rowohlt, Berlin), Helmut Schmidt  entered the arena of the campaign. He is endorsing a power  change in Germany and recommends Rudolf Scharping as an unspent  force. But the support given by the elder statesman has caused  no real joy among the Social Democrats. With his 19  recommendations for the future Federal Government, Helmut  Schmidt at the same time provided the Union parties [CDU  (Christian Democratic Union)/CSU (Christian Social Union)] with  ammunition for its campaign guns.    Helmut Schmidt, who is disturbed by the dangerous desire to  get fed up with political parties in Germany, reminds us that  "all of us together must curb our disappointments and our  bitterness." But he has difficulties suppressing his own  bitterness. It is directed above all at Helmut Kohl. To be sure,  Schmidt does not deny the contributions that his successor as  chancellor made toward German unity, but he does give him bad  marks for catastrophic mistakes made during the unification  process, and he warns in vivid terms against an extension of  Helmut Kohl's tenure as chancellor.  <H5>  Key Personnel Are the Most Important </H5>   In getting even with Kohl and the "exhausted CDU/CSU,"  Schmidt's political passion flares up, but his support for  Scharping remains typically cool. "What we need today at the  head of our government is an unspent force. We have it in Rudolf  Scharping. This is a man who learned to govern as chief of state  of the Rhineland-Palatinate, and who demonstrated there what he  is capable of. He is surrounded by capable women and men. They  will approach the task together with fresh energy." In a year of  decision, many Social Democrats would have wished the praise for  the candidate to have been somewhat stronger.    This all the more since Helmut Schmidt realizes that  programs  are for the most part not worth very much later on in the  reality of government. What is more important are the actual  economic and social conditions for which the politicians have to  take responsibility and with which they would see themselves  confronted if they take over the government. Most important,  however, are the key personnel, especially in the German  television industry.    Helmut Schmidt's opinion of the second man in the Social  Democratic campaign team is cool and objective: "Oskar  Lafontaine did not study economics; instead, he is basically a  natural scientist; his powers of comprehension, eloquence, and  ability to assert himself, are similar to those of Franz Josef  Strauss, who likewise had not studied economics but was  nevertheless also a good finance minister. One could conceive of  Lafontaine's filling this same office in similar fashion."    There is a reason for the acceptance of Oskar Lafontaine as  a  possible finance minister: Lafontaine is the highest political  figure in the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] who, for  the most, part shares Helmut Schmidt's economic views and is  trying to implement these within the party. And yet there will  never again be a normal relationship between Lafontaine and  Schmidt. Helmut Schmidt did not support SPD chancellor candidate  Lafontaine during the campaign in 1990. Instead, in an  unauthorized, but at the same time not denied, interview with  the Rotterdam newspaper ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD, he even went so far as  to say that Lafontaine would lose the Bundestag election and  also deserved to lose. He did not forgive Lafontaine his  publicized reflections, with Schmidt in mind, about secondary  virtues, virtues with which one could also run a concentration  camp.    The unspent political forces that Helmut Schmidt praises  have  a difficult time with his 19 recommendations for a future  Federal Government. On balance, the recommendations, most of  which might have been taken from the report of experts or from  the expertise of the economics institutes, are anything but a  convincing appeal for change. Helmut Schmidt cautions strongly  against further tax burdens, e.g. an increase of indirect taxes  such as the value-added tax or the tax on petroleum products, or  of the income tax "for higher income groups." Schmidt: "Anyone  who aims his sights only at high incomes and assets must ask  himself if he wants to trigger still more shifts [of assets] to  Monaco, Luxemburg, and other tax refuge countries."  <H5>  For Less Welfare Services </H5>   He warns: "An ecologically oriented change of our taxation  system must take place in stages. It cannot be a positive factor  in overcoming the serious acute affliction of our economy." And  he also points to the contradiction: If an ecological tax does  its job and does, in fact, bring about an environmentally  friendly conduct on the part of manufacturers and consumers, it  will generate no additional revenues. But if the ecological tax  does not result in any additional tax revenues, it will not be  possible to lower any other taxes.    He calls on the state not only to take more drastic action  against [unreported] moonlighting, but also to insure that there  is an adequate difference between social welfare services, on  the one hand, and the regular lower incomes, on the other--and  by no means to do this through raising the lower income groups.  He supports a more rigorous interpretation of the reasonableness  of a job [offer] and gives his opinion on the second labor  market as follows: "For the long haul, the employment societies  created by the state in Germany's eastern part and the whole  so-called second labor market are not a suitable instrument."    In addition, his appeal for a greater spread in earnings  will  no doubt be opposed by the labor unions and by many Social  Democrats: "Especially in commerce, in the crafts, and in  services and office jobs of all types, in the large sector in  which more than two-thirds of all gainfully employed persons  work, in other words, many jobs have been lost as a result of  excessively elevating the lower earnings groups. Also the  simpler jobs will be needed again in the future."    In the closing chapter of his book, Helmut Schmidt, a  proponent of a majority-vote system patterned on the British  example, discusses the party-political structure of a "fresh  government." Helmut Schmidt does not endorse another grand  coalition of SPD and the Union--although he credits the grand  coalition which governed from 1966 to 1969 with a remarkably  good practical performance during the first two years of its  existence. Such a grand coalition could come to pass, however,  if the voting is highly fragmented. Whoever wants to avoid a  grand coalition, thus his election credo, must vote for one of  the two populist parties, the SPD or CDU/CSU. His personal wish  is for a majority formed by one populist party together with one  smaller coalition partner.  <H5>  Aloof Vis-a-vis the FDP </H5>   Vis-a-vis the FDP [Free Democratic Party], which he wanted  to  "rake away" in the 1982 election in Hessen, he maintains a  position of detachment. He does, however, unlike the Greens,  credit it sight unseen with a capability to govern at the  federal level. However, contrary to his estimate, the FDP has  already firmly committed itself to a coalition with the CDU/CSU.    Unless it breaks its word, it can therefore no longer be  viewed as a partner for Scharping. Taking the Schmidt formula  (one populist party and only one coalition partner) as the  basis, this would leave the Greens as a partner.    Helmut Schmidt has no serious misgivings about realo-Greens  such as Joschka Fischer, but he adds: "The critical factor is  whether the Greens will be able to struggle through to a  realistic overall political concept, including domestic and  foreign policy, and above all including the economic questions."    Helmut Schmidt's coalition recommendations leave a feeling  of  perplexity within a party leadership which has thus far turned a  deaf ear to the passionate courtship of the Greens. Thus far,  Rudolf Scharping has not discovered a realistic overall  political concept among the Greens. Helmut Schmidt may have  meant well with his campaign help, but whether it will do the  SPD any good will be decided by the voters on 16 October.</p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): British Steel forges on - The week ahead MONDAY: British Steel's interim pre-tax profits are thought to have leapt to between Pounds 130m and Pounds 150m, compared with Pounds 27m a year ago. The company, which dominates the UK steel market, is benefiting from price increases, supply shortages and better demand as the UK manufacturing sector recovers from recession. TUESDAY: Full-year pre-tax profits from industrial gases company BOC are estimated at about Pounds 260m, down sharply on last year thanks to an Pounds 85m restructuring provision. Interest will centre on underlying growth in the health-care business, which has been hit by the US expiry of the patent on the anaesthetic gas Forane, and on how much BOC has benefited from the wider upturn in chemicals sales and prices. TUESDAY: Results for the first nine months of 1994 from General Accident, the composite insurer, are expected to show pre-tax profits of about Pounds 330m, against Pounds 206m last time, highlighting the buoyancy of the UK insurance sector. Attention could focus on the group's assessment of likely trends in premium rates, which will influence future profitability. TUESDAY: Insurance broker Sedgwick is expected to report an increase in pre-tax profits to about Pounds 75m from Pounds 64m in the first nine months of 1993. TUESDAY/THURSDAY: The stock market will be anxious for signals that rents are rising and occupiers are taking additional space when Great Portland Estates and Land Securities - which together make up almost one-third of quoted property sector, report interim results. Neither company revalues its property portfolio at the half-year stage but, for property values to increase in the long term, it is necessary for rents to rise. Unless investors see signs of stronger demand for business space, property shares will remain in the doldrums. Great Portland, which cut its dividend in June for the first time in its 35-year history, is expected to show a marked improvement over last year's Pounds 40m rental income when it announces interim figures on Tuesday. Analysts expect pre-tax profit of around Pounds 17.6m, against Pounds 16m. As the UK's largest quoted property company, Land Securities' figures on Thursday will be especially important for sentiment. In the first half of last year, the company reported rental income of Pounds 192m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 118.9m, including a contribution from sales of investment property. Analysts are looking for pre-tax profits of about Pounds 118m this time. TUESDAY/THURSDAY: The two main electricity generators in England and Wales report next week amid expectations that they will provide generous dividend increases to shareholders. Analysts believe that both PowerGen, which reports on Tuesday, and National Power, which reports on Thursday, are capable of lifting pay-outs by at least 16 per cent. Some have pencilled in more than 20 per cent. The results are the last before the government sells off its remaining 40 per cent stakes in the companies in February. WEDNESDAY: British Gas's third-quarter results usually show a loss for the quarter, which covers the months of lowest demand. Analysts expect losses in the range of Pounds 200m-240m. The results coincide with the Queen's Speech, in which the government is expected to announce new legislation to break up  -in 1998 - British Gas's monopoly over 18m residential customers. WEDNESDAY: Vosper Thornycroft, the Southampton-based shipbuilding and engineering group, is expected to report interim pre-tax profits of just over Pounds 10m, compared with Pounds 9.08m last time. Analysts will seek news of a possible Kuwaiti contract to build up to eight fast patrol boats. The order was reported recently to have gone to CMN of France, but the UK group is not giving up until the deal has been signed definitely. WEDNESDAY: Unigate, the food and distribution group, is expected to report flat interim profits of around Pounds 50m following tough trading in the grocery sector and deregulation of the milk market. This month, the group, which delivers milk to 1.6m households in south and south-west England, raised its prices by 2p a pint to 40p. THURSDAY: Whitbread opens the brewers' reporting season with interims that should benefit from good summer weather, particularly in the south of England where it is strongest. But pressure remains on beer margins and it will also be affected by the lack of dividends from the Whitbread Investment Company, which has been wound up. Pre-tax profits of around Pounds 138m, against Pounds 132.3, are forecast. THURSDAY: FKI, the electrical engineering group, is expected to report interims of about Pounds 30m, compared with Pounds 22m last time. Having abandoned a Pounds 400m US purchase in May because of the fall in London share prices, the Halifax-based company will be quizzed about its acquisition intentions. THURSDAY: Willis Corroon, the insurance broker, is expected to show a fall in pre-tax profits for the first nine months to about Pounds 55m, down from Pounds 70m last time, largely because of problems in the US.</p>

			<p>Narcotics   Control Strategy Report  <H4>  Bolivian Government `Not on Its Knees' Before U.S. </H4>  <F P=102> PY1404151794 La Paz PRESENCIA in Spanish 5 Apr 94 p 1 </F> <F P=103> PY1404151794 </F> <F P=104>  La Paz PRESENCIA </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] Categorically rejecting U.S. questioning over the  extent of the antidrug struggle in Bolivia, the government  yesterday reasserted the international principle of ``upholding  the sovereignty and independence of nations'' by stating that  Bolivia ``is not on its knees'' before the United States.    Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar and Minister of Government  German Quiroga reported that political and electoral reasons  prevented the country from fulfilling its goals on the  eradication of coca leaves in 1993, but they explained that  ``this is far from not having the intention to harshly combat  drug trafficking.''    Quiroga said: ``We have categorically not been brought to  our knees over anything, and are adopting decisions with  absolute sovereignty.''    He stated that Bolivia is considered a country that still  needs economic aid, ``but such an attitude is a warning against  it.''    Quiroga added that the government intends to continue to  implement a harsh drug interdiction program, to reconcile  criteria with coca producers so as to jointly take action  against drug trafficking, and fundamentally, to exert control  over precursors, so as to prevent them from entering the country.    For his part, Aranibar stated that the Clinton report ``was  what was expected.'' He explained that for electoral reasons,  the Bolivian Government was unable to fulfill its commitments  ``because the previous government did not want to assume a major  commitment regarding coca eradication policy.''    He said: ``President Sanchez de Lozada has clearly made a  commitment to combat drug trafficking. This commitment does not  only encompass the reduction of the area where coca is farmed,  but other important goals.''    After stating that the discussions and negotiations of an  extradition treaty will necessarily encompass international  juridical cooperation, Aranibar said: ``There is a commitment  with the U.S. Government to negotiate an extradition treaty, and  that is what we are doing. Any negotiation will obviously take  into consideration the interests of the two parties.''    Moreover, the EFE news agency reports from Washington that  the U.S. Government has issued a not very optimistic report  stating that the international community continues to lose the  battle against drug trafficking.    Robert Gelbard, current assistant secretary of state for  international narcotics matters and former U.S. ambassador to  Bolivia, said during a news conference that those countries that  do not cooperate in the international effort to combat drug  trafficking will be subjected to more pressure in the future.    One of the ``important victories'' cited in the report is  that well-known drug kingpin Carmelo ``Meco'' Dominguez was  arrested in Bolivia, but it adds that corruption is an important  problem in the country, and for the third consecutive year it  criticizes the fact that Bolivia has failed in its objective to  eradicate coca farms.</p>

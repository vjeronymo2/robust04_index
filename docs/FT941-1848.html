			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Turkey's foreign debt rating lowered by S&amp;P Standard &amp; Poor's has lowered Turkey's foreign currency debt rating from triple-B minus to double-B, taking the country's credit below investment grade. Turkey was also placed on CreditWatch suggesting that its rating may be lowered further. S&amp;P cited delays in implementing an austerity plan to tackle Turkey's economic crisis. Earlier this week, the Treasury came close to defaulting on some Dollars 415m-worth of lira-denominated government bonds issued by the state-owned Public Participation Administration. Banks involved say the PPA settled the amount in full, but only after a seven-hour delay. This was too late for many banks to transfer the funds electronically, so they incurred the cost of overnight borrowing to cover their positions. Government finances are facing a growing liquidity shortage. However this is the first time Turkey has appeared close to a default. The crisis came after the Treasury refused to provide finance, forcing the PPA into the interbank markets for an estimated Dollars 200m. This resulted in a scramble for funds pushing up interbank rates, which yesterday touched 450 per cent. The PPA has an estimated Dollars 1bn of outstanding revenue sharing bonds. The two-year bonds are lira-based, dollar-indexed and redeemable at the central bank fixing rate. Bankers say it is moot point whether they are considered foreign or domestic liabilities but the incident renewed bankers' concerns about Turkey's ability to service its foreign debt, which was about Dollars 64bn at end-1993.</p>

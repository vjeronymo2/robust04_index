			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Accounts package that remembers every transaction - Computing / David Carter on a program which puts the facts at your fingertips AGEING pugilists dream of finding a good young 'un to take under their wing and guide to glory and a crack at the title. Software reviewers feel the same way. As they work their way through piles of new packages sent in by young hopefuls, there is always the excitement of perhaps discovering an unknown who is going to knock the big boys for six. The UK accounting software industry needs some new blood. Recently there has been an invasion of heavyweight accounting packages from other countries: Platinum from the US, Scala from Sweden, Exact from the Netherlands, SAP from Germany. So note the name of a British accounts package which you will being hearing much more of in the years to come - Exchequer. Exchequer is designed and sold by a company of the same name in Bournemouth, Dorset. It also sells indirectly through a small number of dealers. At the top level Exchequer Professional costs around Pounds 3,500 for a networked, multicurrency version. For this you get sales, purchase and nominal ledgers, cashbook, costing, invoicing and stock control, bill of materials, and basic sales and purchase order processing. This version competes with products such as Pegasus Senior, Sage Sovereign, Tetra 2000, Multisoft Prestige. For Pounds 495 you get single currency ledgers, invoicing and stock control and Pounds 695 will buy you stock control and order processing. This list of modules is no different from any other package, so what is so special about Exchequer? Basically, most accounts packages were designed in early and mid-80s, when memory and disk space, were limited they aimed at efficient processing of transactions. For example, sales invoices are entered on to the sales ledger and analysed to the nominal ledger. At the end of the day the details of the invoices are printed out in a report (the 'audit trail') and then wiped off the system. The nominal balances are summarised at the end of the month and posted from the sales ledger into the nominal ledger. Packages differ in what they do but the basic idea is that individual transactions are entered into the computer at the lowest level, then passed on in summary form at a higher level until data from all modules is brought together in the nominal ledger. The resulting small data files may be fine from a processing point of view, but are poor at providing management information. Managers want to look at a total balance, then work their way back (in the jargon, 'drill down') to the original transactions. Traditional accounts packages only store these original transactions in summary form. To find out the precise details you have to rummage around in dusty old boxes full of printouts. What is the point of having a computer if it does not store all the data you have keyed in? Exchequer is one of a tiny group of packages I have seen recently which does the job properly. All transactions are retained in full detail and can be accessed at any time. If you are in the nominal ledger and are looking at, say, the balance on the advertising account, you can immediately call up all the individual purchase invoices which make up the balance and see them in full, exactly as they were originally posted on to the computer. From this basic design a wealth of benefits flow. Pressing an F key in Exchequer brings you instant access to any customer, purchase, nominal or stock account. In both nominal and stock you can 'drill down' from the highest level (eg 'sales - computer hardware') to all your individual sales invoices for computer hardware in just three or four keystrokes. All invoices on a supplier's or customer's account are maintained on the account ledger and can be viewed in detail at any time. To generate a credit note, simply retrieve the offending invoice and reverse it automatically. To see how a past invoice was paid, just press M for match and the payment details are displayed. There are many more features. Exchequer is an astonishing package. Because it operates under a new set of rules you will have to put some effort in to learn it. The ability to jump around all over the place can mean you lose your bearings. When I first worked on Exchequer I was totally confused trying to work out what was going on, but after a week or two I was able to hot-key my way around the system with the best of them. Exchequer is a young product. It does not offer as wide a set of modules as the majors. Order processing, for example, is limited. Countrywide support is not yet available. But this is one of those rare packages that takes accounting software into a new era. Exchequer Software: telephone 0202-298008.</p>

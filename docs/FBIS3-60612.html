			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Francois Falempin of the "Hypersonic Vehicles" </F> Unit, chief of the PREPHA program of the National Office for  Aerospace Studies and Research (ONERA): "Toward a Super-Ramjet:  Cooperation With the Moscow Central Institute of Aircraft  Engines"]    [Text] Since the spring of 1992, the ONERA [National Office  for Aerospace Studies and Research] and its industrial partners  Aerospatiale, Dassault Aviation, SEP [European Propulsion  Company], and SNECMA [National Company for the Study and  Construction of Aircraft Engines] have been involved in a series  of cooperation activities with several research and study  centers in the CIS [Commonwealth of Independent States] on the  subject of the super-ramjet and associated technologies. This  strategy is part of the wider national PREPHA (Research and  Technology Program for Advanced Hypersonic Propulsion) program.    This means that close relations are being maintained with  such prestigious institutes as the MAI [Moscow Aviation  Institute] or the institutes of the Siberian branch of the  Novosibirsk Academy of Sciences (Institute of Theoretical and  Applied Mechanics, Thermophysics Institute, and others). In  this context and with the support of the DRET [Research,  Studies, and Technologies Directorate of the Ministry of  Defense], the ONERA has been able to develop a particularly  fruitful cooperation with the CIAM [Central Institute of  Aircraft Engines Moscow], whose activities are located on two  sites: In Moscow, where most of the theoretical and laboratory  work is done, and in Turayevo (50 kms from Moscow), where the  institute has an impressive complex of industrial testing  facilities.    Under the leadership of its present director Donat  Ogorodnikov, the CIAM, which is specializing in the study and  development of aeronautical engines, devotes a substantial  amount of its activity to the study of the super-ramjet, and in  particular the hydrogen- propulsed super-ramjet. Existing  cooperation focuses on two main areas:    -- the development of computation codes in aerothermics and  in aerothermochemistry;    -- the in-flight experimentation of an axisymmetrical super-  ramjet.    High-Performance Digital Diagrams [subhead]    Concerning the development of computation codes, the CIAM is  suggesting digital diagrams derived from that of Godunov and  which are particularly economical in terms of computation time.  Areas of joint activity include a comparative evaluation, based  on the computation of a series of test cases, of the CIAM  diagrams and those used at the ONERA. When this evaluation is  finished, Russian specialists will come to France to help their  French colleagues embed CIAM digital diagrams in some of their  codes, notably those dealing with supersonic aerothermochemistry.    Other than the initial work of selecting and embedding the  most appropriate digital diagrams, ongoing research will be  continued within the scope of the PREPHA program aimed at  defining and validating the models which best represent the  physical phenomena governing aerothermics and  aerothermochemistry of the super-ramjet. The CIAM and certain  Novosibirsk-based institutes will be able to contribute their  experiences and their databases in this field, but ways of  cooperation on this issue remain to be decided.    Although the development of computation codes is a very  promising area of cooperation in the medium and long term,  in-flight testing of a super-ramjet is, in the short time, the  most beneficial.  <H5>  First Test Inconclusive </H5>   In November 1991, the CIAM conducted an initial in-flight  test of a hydrogen axisymmetrical super-ramjet. A stabilized  supersonic combustion phase could not be reached during this  test because the carrier rocket's trajectory control was  insufficient and the hydrogen flow control was set too close to  the limits for unpriming [desamorcage]. As a result, the engine  operated only a few, very short moments in supersonic mode.    During the summer of 1992, ONERA's financial contribution,  thanks to support by DRET, enabled the CIAM to start up  preparations again for a second experiment, which had been  interrupted for lack of funding.    A second in-flight test was carried out on 17 November 1992  from a military base located between Priozersk and Baykonur in  Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan government officials and scientists  attended the testing alongside French and Russian scientists.  <H5>  Second Joint French-Russian Test </H5>   The design of the axisymmetric super-ramjet tested by the  CIAM resembles that of the ESOPE engine tested on the ground by  the ONERA at the beginning of the seventies in the S4MA wind  tunnel at its Modane Avrieux center in the French Savoy region.  The hydrogen combustion, which ignites as soon as the engine  reaches Mach 3.5, takes place initially in subsonic mode because  of an injection of hydrogen in the zone upstream of the  combustion chamber. When the Mach number goes beyond five, the  injection is distributed between the upstream and downstream  zones of the combustion chamber to stabilize combustion in  supersonic mode.    This engine and its control system were developed by the  CIAM  on a special small-sized test bench in its Turayevo center. The  mechanical design and manufacture were subsequently handed over  to the Soyuz development division located near this center.    The engine does not fly autonomously. The combined  engine/control system/tank module is tandem-mounted on a rocket,  derived from a ground-to-air missile, which ensures its  acceleration to up to Mach 5.5. This rocket was modified by the  Fakel engineering and design office which perfected the control  system in such a way as to ensure a trajectory which is  sufficiently close to the nominal trajectory enabling the  super-ramjet to perform well.    The rules controlling the hydrogen flow injected into the  upstream and downstream zones of the combustion chamber are  based on controlling the priming of the combustion throat [veine  de combustion] (supersonic flow in the whole chamber). These  rules were modified for the second flight test to improve the  available unpriming margin and to enable the engine withstand a  possible incidence intake during the supersonic combustion phase.  <H5>  Encouraging Results </H5>   The trajectory executed by the rocket during the second  experiment was much nearer to the nominal trajectory than in  1991. A tank pressurization problem limited the flow of hydrogen  injected, independently of any regulation, as soon as the  engine's regenerative cooling system started working at full  capacity. However, supersonic combustion could be stabilized for  about 15 seconds.    Because the engine remains connected to the carrier rocket,  it is impossible to obtain a direct measure of the thrust.  However, the wide use of pressure and temperature gauges along  the length of the engine should enable the fluid dynamics into  the engine to be understood better and therefore to facilitate  the comprehension of physical phenomena governing the  performance of the super-ramjet. In addition, this will also  lead to establishing test cases in real, well-documented flight  conditions for the development and validation of computation  codes.  <H5>  An Operation To Be Continued... </H5>   Although this second experiment was relatively successful  with the stabilization of combustion in supersonic mode during a  significant length of time, it should be noted that because of  the lack of hydrogen flow this operation was far from nearing  the unpriming limits, therefore at a weak thrust. They were  also unable to check the efficiency of the hydrogen flow control  system, whose technology is somewhat old-fashioned, in  regulating the hydrogen flow to avoid unpriming of the  combustion throat.    Continuing the operation should initially allow the tank  pressurization problem to be solved, thus avoiding the engine's  operation at nominal capacity and allowing its in-flight  control. Next, the engine should be equipped with more  finely-tuned instruments, possibly based on Western technology,  and the carrier rocket should be developed to enable a maximum  Mach flight number to be reached. This should allow us to  improve our knowledge of the super-ramjet and the quality of the  validation of computation codes.  <H5>  Not Just a First Step </H5>   It is clear that the super-ramjet of the axisymmetrical type  is not the best propulsion technology for a hypersonic vehicle.  Indeed, the expanse of wet surfaces, and therefore losses  through friction and heat exchange, slightly limits the maximum  thrust level. In addition, it is difficult to combine the  highly integrated propulsion system needed on hypersonic  vehicles with the circular section of each engine module. The  current operation, which benefits from the advances being made  at the CIAM, should therefore be considered as an initial phase  making it possible to:    -- acquire expertise in the development and experimentation  of a super-ramjet;    -- set up a database for the validation of computation  codes.    The PREPHA program, although it involves the study of large  two- dimensional super-ramjets (chamber entrance section: 1  square meter under study, 5 square decimeters in ground testing,  to be compared with 1 square decimeter for the CIAM engine) will  be the first to benefit from this cooperation.    It is above all in the longer term that the evaluation of  the  working methods and skills of the CIAM in the field of design  and testing the super-ramjet will optimize conditions for a  cooperation program which aims to experiment the autonomous  flight of a super- ramjet whose design is closer to future needs  and future applications of hypersonic air-breathing propulsion.  <H5>  The Super-Ramjet </H5>   The ramjet benefits from natural recompression linked to a  slowing down in air intake flow rate. For Mach numbers under 6,  it can be interesting to slow the flow down to subsonic level to  ensure the best combustion rate without thrust levels being  strained by too weak pressure recuperation levels in the air  intake. Beyond this limit (about Mach 6), recompression to  subsonic flow causes precombustion pressure and temperature  losses which do not allow enough energy to be added to the flow  and to transform it into thrust through a sonic nozzle. It is  therefore preferable to limit recompression to a moderately  supersonic Mach number (2 to 4) on condition that the techniques  to stablize supersonic combustion flow are functioning. This is  super-ramjet mode.    Studies carried out over the past few years on the subject  of  partially air-breathing propulsion systems for space launchers  have led French teams to estimate that limiting the  air-breathing phase to the Mach-O to Mach-6 level will not  improve the overall performance in terms of net mass in orbit in  relation to full rocket propulsion: "Air-breating technology,  which is heavier, does not pay its way." To develop this field,  a super-ramjet is required capable of reaching Mach numbers over  10 and, which is more likely, close to 12. Although subsonic  combustion ramjet technology is relatively well mastered in  France thanks to a number of exploratory developments and to the  development of the ASMP and the (incomplete) ANS [expansions  unknown], some research into super-ramjets has been conducted  during the sixties and seventies (ESOPE: tests at Mach 6 under  forced control [conduite forcee]). This is why PREPHA's main  objective is to improve our knowledge and our tools for the  design of the super-ramjet, a potential solution for entirely  recoverable and reusable launchers in the future.</p>

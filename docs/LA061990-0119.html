			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE AND MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> EREVAN CHORAL SOCIETY IN PASADENA PROGRAM  </P> <P> The local Armenian community is one of the most cohesive and culturally active  of the Southland's ethnic groups. That was evident Sunday at Pasadena City  College, where the Erevan Choral Society and Symphony Orchestra of Greater  Boston presented a program that was reportedly sold out two months ago.  </P> <P> Listeners remained enthusiastic throughout the program, and few seemed to tire  from the long evening. Although most audience members were seated by 7 p.m.  (the announced starting time), the proceedings did not get under way until 35  minutes later. And with speeches before, after and during the program, with two  encores and a 30-minute intermission, it was 11 before the musicians finally  left the stage.  </P> <P> The program consisted of 30 songs, at best count, about half of them  nationalistic songs, half of them Armenian popular songs. The Choral Society  delivered most of the former; these they sang with vibrancy, rhythmic precision  and clear enunciation.  </P> <P> Founder/director Father Oshagan Minassian and Melik Mavisakalian (from Armenia)  alternated the conducting duties; both elicited expressive, energized singing.  </P> <P> During the pre-intermission segment, contralto Raissa Megerdichian brought  style and passion to a number of popular selections (usually the choruses  backed her up with wordless syllables), that sounded like an amalgam of  American pop and traditional Armenian music.  </P> <P> After intermission, tenor Rouben Matevossian delivered several more such songs  with resonance, power and considerable feeling, although his hand gestures  looked artificial.  </P> <P> The orchestral arrangements were slick but undeniably effective and the  orchestra, which traveled from Boston with the choristers (a few local  free-lancers thrown in), proved first-rate.

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / French prepare financial reshuffle THE top echelons of France's financial administration are preparing for a round of musical chairs following Mr Jacques de Larosiere's appointment as head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The most important move will be a replacement for Mr de Larosiere as governor of the Bank of France. The central bank is in the process of being granted autonomy in the formulation of monetary policy and the new governor will take control at a particularly difficult time following the European currency crisis which has resulted in the effective flotation of the French franc. The favourite for the post is Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, currently director of the French Treasury, the most powerful civil service post in France's financial administration. His selection as head of the central bank would trigger a further reshuffle within the Treasury. The decision on the next central bank governor will be taken by the cabinet and President Francois Mitterrand meeting as the council of ministers on August 25. But bankers and diplomats in Paris say that Mr Trichet faces little opposition for the post. 'He would seem to be the natural choice,' says one French banker. 'He has the right background and the right views.' Mr Trichet served as senior aide to Mr Edouard Balladur, the current prime minister, when he was economics minister in 1986 and 1987. The implementation of laws granting the central bank independence in monetary policy is expected by the end of the year. The French government has promoted the reform in order to strengthen the financial authorities' anti-inflationary credentials. But the task of maintaining a tight monetary policy will be complicated by pressures for more expansionary policies to help stimulate the economy and by the increased instability of the franc resulting from the ERM reforms. Should Mr Trichet become the governor of the Bank of France, there is no clear candidate to replace him as head of the Treasury. One name mentioned in French financial circles is that of Mr Christian Noyer, the chief of staff of Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister.</p>

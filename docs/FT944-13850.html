			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Consumer bad debt problems reduced Bad debt problems among consumers are receding, says a survey by credit information group Equifax Europe, Philip Coggan writes. The survey found that 7.1 per cent of instalment credit accounts were in arrears in the third quarter, down from 9 per cent in the same period last year. There was a smaller fall in accounts significantly in arrears - defined as those three or more months behind in payments - to 3.5 per cent in the third quarter from 3.7 per cent in the same period last year. Equifax's figures cover instalment credit, including credit cards, from finance houses, banks, building societies and other businesses such as the motor trade. According to the survey Northern Ireland is the region with the lowest level of bad debt, with only 5.6 per cent of consumers in arrears. Scotland has the highest bad-debt level, with 8.4 per cent of consumers behind with payments.</p>

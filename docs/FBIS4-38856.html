			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ivan Zhagel report: "Foreign Banks Will Have Wider Access </F> to Russian Financial Market"]    [Text] Viktor Gerashchenko, chairman of the Central Bank  of Russia, has stated that decisions will be adopted by 8 June  to extend the opportunities for foreign banks to penetrate  Russia.    It is well known that last November such opportunities were  substantially restricted by a presidential edict. A kind of  veto was imposed not only on the registration of new branches of  foreign credit institutions, but also on certain transactions by  banks already existing in Russia. It is no secret that this  decision was adopted in response to demands by our own bankers,  who were afraid of an unequal competitive struggle. But for  every action, as is well known, there is a reaction.    According to V. Gerashchenko, foreign states promptly made  access to their own financial markets tougher. For Russian  banks it became an insoluble problem not only to open branches  abroad, but even offices. In addition, the prohibitive measures  on our side were assessed negatively by international financial  organizations, and at the moment, in view of our need not only  for new credits but also for the deferral of debt repayments, it  is quite inappropriate to quarrel with them.    However, the forthcoming simplification of access to our  financial market does not mean that the registration of foreign  banks will now take place more or less automatically. Last year  the Central Bank imposed a so-called "limit on participation by  foreign capital in the country's banking system," namely 12  percent. This means that the total capital of branches of  foreign banks as a proportion of the gross capital of all banks  on Russia's territory must not be more than that level.    As of today this quota is virtually exhausted, so the  registration of new branches of foreign banks is highly  problematical. But this restrictive measure appears more  intelligent than a simple ban, and it is not causing a negative  response among international organizations. V. Gerashchenko  confirmed that the "limit on participation by foreign capital in  the country's banking system" will be maintained, although the  level could be adjusted. That is, the process of foreign banks'  penetration will be controlled.    Incidentally, V. Gerashchenko, making all these statements  at  a specially arranged press conference, did not omit to reproach  "certain journalists" for trying recently to represent him as in  some way opposed to the president's much-publicized edicts in  the sphere of economic policy. According to him, the documents  were prepared with the Central Bank's participation, and he  simply could not be opposed to them.    V. Gerashchenko not only confirmed his commitment to the  radical economic edicts, but make equally radical subsequent  statements. For instance, he noted that this very week the  Central Bank board of directors may adopt a decision on a future  lowering of the interest rate on centralized credits, which will  certainly have a beneficial effect on investment processes. On  the other hand, he came out categorically against using coercion  on commercial banks in the setting of their interest rates,  since "nothing useful can come of that" -- cheap credits are  simply squandered.    Finally, V. Gerashchenko promised that the practice of  auction sales of centralized credit resources will be extended  and in the near future such auctions will be held every two  weeks. Regular, open dealings in credit resources will help  people to form a clearer idea of how much money costs in our  country.    And aother important question was raised at the press  conference. Many people wanted to know how to interpret the  section of the president's edict on the normalization of  accounts which states that "legal entities may obtain monetary  resources from the bank for pressing needs to the tune of...up  to five times the minimum monthly wage, depending on the total  average listed number of workers." V. Gerashchenko explained  that enterprises can reserve this sum even before the payment of  funds into the budget, so as to offer at least some support to  their workers. And those who fulfill their commitments to the  state can take out money for wages in the necessary quantities.</p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / US plans controls for foreign banks THE US Federal Reserve and federal regulators would have new wide-ranging controls over the entry and operations of foreign banks, under legislation prepared in response to the scandals involving Banca Nationale del Lavoro's Atlanta branch and Bank of Credit and Commerce International's American operations. The bill, drafted by the Fed's governors and introduced yesterday by leaders of the Senate banking committee, would allow the Fed to screen the entry of foreign banks into the US, to examine all foreign bank operations, to revoke a foreign bank's licence to operate a US branch and prevent hidden ownership interests by requiring the reporting of loans secured by the stock of a US bank. At present, foreign banks can choose state supervisors as the primary regulators of their US branches. Supervisory weaknesses have allowed a few banks to use the absence of federal oversight to engage in illegal activities. BCCI secretly took ownership interests in US banks and last year a US subsidiary was found guilty of running a money-laundering operation. BNL's Atlanta branch made Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.7bn) of loan commitments to Iraq between 1987 and 1989 which were partly used for buying weapons equipment, leading to the start of criminal proceeedings earlier this year. At present 81 per cent of foreign banks choose state supervisors for their US branches and the legislation would require foreign banks to obtain federal approval. Most other countries, including Britain, require approval by the central bank for operations by overseas-owned banks. In detail, the legislation would require prior federal approval before a foreign bank can begin operating in the US, and set clear standards for permitting and denying foreign banks to enter the US, including access to information about the foreign bank to enforce compliance with US laws and requiring that the foreign bank be subject to consolidated regulation and supervision in its home country.</p>

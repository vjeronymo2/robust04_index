			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Business Law: Down a well-travelled road on insider dealing reform The Company Law Committee of the Law Society last week called for public consultation on the proposed law on insider dealing. The problems with the legislation are an example of what happens when technical legislation is brought to parliament without public consultation on the draft clauses. There is a convention that primary legislation should not be the subject of public consultation before it is introduced to parliament. There is consultation on the principles involved, but not on the legislation itself. The Company Law Committee believes that this convention has not served us well and has contributed to the enactment of legislation which does not achieve its aims. Parts of the Companies Act 1989 provide a good example. With the legislation on insider dealing we appear to be headed down the same road. The committee has commented extensively on the draft clauses. There are two kinds of problems - a basic problem which arises because we are trying to implement a European Community directive which has no clear principle behind it; and technical problems which mean that we are in danger of making a bad position worse. At the moment, an individual is not an 'insider' unless he or she is connected with the issuer of the securities, or connected with some other body which is involved in a transaction with the issuer, or unless the individual is a 'tippee' - a person who receives the inside information from someone who has such a connection. The directive does away with this connection, and an individual will now be an insider if he or she 'has access to such information by virtue of the exercise of his employment, profession or duties'. The principle behind this is very hard to pin down. Added to this, both the directive and the draft legislation alter the kinds of information which will in future be regarded as 'inside' information. The effect is to make it much more uncertain whether particular facts - or rumours - are caught. The combination of the removal of the connection requirement and the new wide class of inside information leads to difficult and often uncertain results. If, for example, a diligent analyst discovers information about a company with the aid of the resources of his firm, does this amount to information which he has obtained 'by virtue of the exercise of his employment'? Arguably it is not - the fact that he is paid to do this sort of work does not mean that he obtains access to the information by virtue of his employment if it could have been discovered by anyone. On the other hand, suppose the analyst tells other people in his organisation. Those individuals then do obtain access to the information by virtue of their employment. Are they forbidden to deal, and more important, forbidden to encourage others to do so? Similar problems arise with journalists who discover unpublished facts about companies. If we are to extend the class of insider in this way then it is very important that we set out the principle behind what we are doing and define clearly whom we are trying to catch. Then there are the technical problems. Under our present law there is an exception which, in some circumstances, allows an insider to deal where the inside information relates to a transaction and the dealing is to facilitate that transaction. This is the exception which allows, for example, a bidder to buy shares in the target in advance of a bid. The directive contemplates such an exception and the committee believes that there is to be a clause along these lines in the legislation. But the committee has not seen it yet and it is likely to raise difficult technical problems (as does the present law). The committee believes firmly that there is no substitute for public consultation on a point such as this. At present, the law only applies to deals on the Stock Exchange or through an off-market dealer who is making a market in the securities. The new law will apparently also apply to deals through or by a professional intermediary. The result of this can be anomalous. It will mean that a private individual can deal with another, face to face, on the basis of inside information, and not commit an offence. However, if he sells to a professional in exactly the same circumstances, he will be committing an offence. This is irrespective of the size of the dealing and whether or not it affects the market. Taken to its logical conclusion this seems to mean that a private investor can safely take advantage of another private investor when dealing face to face but can not take advantage of a hardened City professional. This is a very odd result. This may also cause problems in relation to underwriting where a professional intermediary will agree, by signing an underwriting agreement, to acquire securities at a time when the information relating to the issue has not been made public. At the moment there is no offence because the dealing does not take place on market, but it is clear that if this definition is going to change then underwriting will have to be catered for. There are many other problems and none of them is simple. The solution depends on clearly establishing the principles behind the draft legislation and then discussing its ramifications thoroughly with those who are familiar with the workings of the securities market. Only if this is done can the UK hope to achieve legislation which is clear enough to catch the insider, but does not impede legitimate business transactions or interfere with the capital raising function of the market. London already has a reputation as a heavily regulated market. It is very important that UK rules are clear, well understood and well known and that legitimate transactions are not affected by quirks in the law. It is only if the government is prepared to consult publicly on the draft legislation that it can hope to get it right and to present parliament with a bill which does not cause more problems than it solves.

He said: I do not have the slightest doubt that this visit  will be a new beginning in the relations between our countries,  the relations for which we have made great efforts together and  worked hard; especially great in this respect is Eduard  Shevardnadze's role. He is respected and loved throughout the  world as well as in the United States. The American  administration, the American people supported and will support  Georgia's independence, the country's territorial integrity and  its inviolability.    Several kinds of aid have been mapped out during Eduard  Shevardnadze's visit both in trade and economy as well as the  political aspect. I am very sorry that the conflict in Abkhazia  has considerably hampered the good goals which have not yet been  fully achieved. I hope that in the not too distant future we  will see international peacekeeping forces deployed in Abkhazia,  but before this happens many problems must be overcome and  Shevardnadze's visit to the United States is very important in  resolving these issues.    We are living in an age when it is impossible to stay  indifferent to the problems of one particular region or country.  These problems influence the fate of others. Today's  integration is very deep and from that point of view the  Caucasus is the region of danger; it must be in the center of  our attention, and it will be. I am sure that the meetings in  Washington and New York will be beneficial to Georgia, the U.S.  ambassador concluded.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The removal of party representatives whose parties  have fewer than six deputies from the activities of municipal  war presidencies is an undemocratic act and constitutes the  first tangible proof of the totalitarianization of the political  space in Bosnia-Herzegovina, said Rasim Kadic, president of the  Liberal Party of Bosnia-Herzegovina, at today's news conference.  The decision was passed by the country's Presidency on the  proposal of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government and, in my  opinion, it is politically conflicting.    Rasim Kadic warned that this means that parliamentary  parties  that had a smaller number of voters will be thrown out of war  presidencies, while representatives that had not even  participated in the elections would remain in these executive  bodies. This is a paradox. Moreover, a part of the text of the  draft constitution for the federal organization of  Bosnia-Herzegovina is also considered undemocratic. The part in  question foresees a limit of 5 percent for entering the  parliament. According to Kadic, this is the introduction of a  single-party system. He also said that in the majority of  European countries this limit was set at 2 percent, and that the  Liberal Party would demand at the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly  that this provision is changed, because it limits the  development of democracy in these areas.</p>

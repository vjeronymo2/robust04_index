			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / International Company News: Rescue may be on the way for Uni Storebrand NORWEGIAN authorities are considering a two-step intervention plan to rescue Uni Storebrand, the troubled insurer, from plunging into deep financial crisis, Aftenposten, Norway's leading daily, reports today. According to the report, central finance authorities are considering options which include state guarantees, a direct cash injection or a state acquisition of some of Uni's long-term assets. Once a decision is made, Uni could be split up with its life insurance business being acquired by Den norske Bank, Norway's biggest bank, in which the state is a majority owner with a 55.5 per cent stake. State intervention is being considered because authorities believe that a NKr1.5bn-NKr2bn (Dollars 263.1m-Dollars 350m) capital expansion being planned by Uni for the autumn will fail due to the uncertainty surrounding the company after it acquired a non-voting NKr4.7bn, 28.3 per cent, stake in Skandia Forsakrings, Sweden's biggest insurer. Uni's shares plunged yesterday to a record low of NKr15.95 on the Oslo bourse. The capital expansion puts Uni's nominal share value at NKr20, which means a capital expansion would have to be undertaken with Uni's shares written down below nominal value. Jyske Bank, Denmark's fourth biggest banking group, expects a pre-tax loss for 1992 after posting a DKr479m (Dollars 85m) deficit for the first half of 1992. The bank gave no estimate for the expected full-year result but forecast a positive performance for the rest of 1992. The bank last year reported a DKr178m pre-tax profit. It attributed its disappointing first-half result to difficult trading conditions in the Danish finance sector, coupled with high interest rates and a slump in domestic private demand and business activity.</p>

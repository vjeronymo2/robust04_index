			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Vauxhall to close Luton upholstery unit Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US, plans to close a component operation at its car assembly plant at Luton, Bedfordshire. It said that the unit's 300-strong workforce would have had to accept a 50 per cent cut in wages to make it competitive with outside suppliers. Vauxhall has warned trade unions that any industrial action over the closure of the soft-trim unit could jeopardise its Pounds 12.5m plan to increase car assembly capacity by 25 per cent at the Luton plant. The company said there would be no compulsory redundancies among the workers in the unit, which cuts and sews seat covers. It said most European volume carmakers had already given up in-house 'cut and sew' soft-trim operations because of the lower costs of specialist producers. The company plans to transfer most of the workforce to other production areas. An early retirement or voluntary redundancy scheme will be offered to a limited number. About 90 per cent of workers in the seat-cover unit are women, who make up only 15 per cent of the car assembly workforce at Luton. The TGWU general union said employees in the soft-trim unit were to be balloted about opposing the closure. A second ballot would be necessary before industrial action could be taken. Vauxhall said it planned to close the operation from July next year, when production of the next generation Vauxhall Cavalier/Opel Vectra would start at the Luton plant. GM is investing about Pounds 130m to modernise and automate the plant in preparation for the model change, and plans to increase capacity by about 25 per cent to 60 cars an hour by the end of next year from about 48. Vauxhall has been the most profitable carmaker in the UK during the recession and the Luton plant is GM's lowest-cost assembly facility in Europe for production of the Vectra/Cavalier.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Information Minister Dr. Muhammad Salman by </F> Sana' al-Sa'id in Damascus; date not given]    [Text] [Al-Sa'id] It appears to many that the U.S. stands  are inconsistent with peace and are inconsistent with what was  agreed on at the Geneva summit between Presidents Clinton and  al-Asad. Is Syria happy with the current U.S. stand?    [Salman] The peace process started following former  President  George Bush's March 1991 initiative, which regarded the  implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 as  the basis for achieving a just and comprehensive peace in the  region. As one of the two cosponsors of the peace conference  that was held toward the end of that year and of the subsequent  Washington talks, the United States played a major role in  preparing for the Madrid conference through the clarifications  and guarantees it gave and its promises to play the role of an  honest partner in the peace process. The U.S. Administration  remained committed to the Bush initiative when President Clinton  came to power. It has made many statements that it will  continue its efforts to achieve peace on all tracks, especially  after the Washington talks were halted when Israel struck out on  its own with the PLO and concluded the Oslo agreement with it,  completely ignoring the bases on which the Madrid conference was  held. The Geneva summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and  Bill Clinton reiterated the Madrid conference's terms of  reference and the U.S. commitment to continue its efforts for a  comprehensive peace on all the tracks of the conflict. Thus,  Washington is still intent on its commitment to the peace  process, though the role it is now expected to play fails to  live up to its pledge to play the role of a full and honest  partner in the peace process. We believe that, in light of its  special relations with Israel--which have reached the level of a  strategic alliance--the U.S. Administration is capable of  influencing the Israeli stand, which is impeding the U.S.  initiative entailing the implementation of Security Council  Resolutions 242 and 338 and the exchange of land for peace.    [Al-Sa'id] In view of U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher's tour of the region, what is the United States  specifically asked to do as a sponsor of the peace process and  as an honest mediator?    [Salman] What is required is very clear, namely to fulfill  its pledges and commitments to implement its initiative and  effectively fulfill the role of a full and honest partner. This  does not mean exerting pressure on Israel, as some circles are  narrowly trying to interpret this issue, but rather to not leave  international legitimacy's resolutions suspended in mid-air or  subject to Israeli blackmail and bargaining. Israel uses these  tactics in order to avoid the UN resolutions and replace them  with new secret channels, on the Oslo model, so as to deal on  its own with this or that Arab country and thereby conclude  unilateral deals that thwart a just and comprehensive peace.    We hope that Christopher's visit will bring positive signs  that the United States will act in conformity with its  statements on activating the peace process and breaking the  deadlock in the Washington talks, which was reached as a result  of Israeli procrastination and intransigence.    [Al-Sa'id] The rounds of talks have so far proved that  Israel is not serious about establishing peace and that it will  continue its procrastination in order to keep the land as long  as possible. How is it possible to eliminate the obstacles  facing the peace process?    [Salman] This could be done if Israel acknowledges the  inadmissibility of taking other people's land by force and  accepts the land for peace principle. To do this, Israel must  end its continuing occupation of the land and its rejection of  Arab rights. Israel must also stop the its deceptive maneuvers  on international level to disavow the requirements for peace.    The Arabs' steadfastness in the peace battle; the  international community's awareness of the dangers inherent in  the obstruction of the peace process; the unbiased and full  partnership in the peace conference's sponsors, particularly the  United States; and the new reality imposed by the intifadah on  the Israeli occupiers that geographical factors cannot assure  security--it goes without saying that these are all factors in  forcing Israel to abandon its policy that is hostile to peace  and the international legitimacy and for placing the  comprehensive peace process on the right path.    [Al-Sa'id] Israel is convinced that the United States will  not pressure it over talks with Syria due to Israel's internal  situation and their coalition status. Can you comment?    [Salman] This issue concerns U.S.-Israeli relations and the  U.S. desire to maintain the credibility of its commitment to  achieve a just and lasting peace in the region. We know well  the strength of the U.S.-Israeli alliance. But this does not  necessarily mean that the United States is unable to pursue a  policy that serves its special interests or to entertain a peace  plan that is not in line with Israel's, particularly since the  United States is talking about a new world order based on the UN  Charter and resolutions. We should note with guarded optimism  how former President Eisenhower forced Israel to withdraw from  Sinai following the tripartite aggression against Egypt in 1956.    [Al-Sa'id] Do you expect a full or partial Israeli  withdrawal  from the Golan?    [Salman] The withdrawal from the Golan must be complete. We  hope that Rabin's remarks on withdrawal from the Golan are free  of any ambiguity, such as we have been confronting at every  session of talks on the principle of complete withdrawal from  the occupied territories in return for peace.    [Al-Sa'id] Israel claims that Syria is hedging its bets.  On the one hand, it keeps peace exchanges going with Israel,  while on the other, it uses Hizballah as a bargaining chip. How  do you see this?    [Salman] Our policy is not influenced by Israeli  interpretations. The moment we endorsed the U.S. initiative we  made it clear that peace is a strategic goal for Syria and the  Arab world. To achieve this goal, we should employ our  resources in the battle for peace. Therefore, we should adhere  to our pan-Arab principles and support acts of legitimate  resistance. The UN Charter endorses the right of nations to  resist occupation.    [Al-Sa'id] The Gaza-Jericho agreement led to a halt in  negotiations on other tracks and to a discontinuation of the  peace process. What can you say about that?    [Salman] That agreement was an attempt to deprive the peace  process of its foundation, namely, the two UN Security Council  resolutions [242 and 338]. Yitzhaq Rabin admitted as much when  he said: "The Oslo agreement proved the futility of the  Washington talks." Rabin urged secret talks as a way of  reaching separate agreements with other Arab parties to the  peace process. By doing so, Israel hopes to renege on all  commitment to the UN Security Council resolutions.    But Rabin failed to achieve this, despite Israel's  intentional obstruction of the Washington talks, which stumbled  as a result. The Geneva summit ended the premature elation that  accompanied the signing of the Oslo agreement. That summit  confirmed that a comprehensive solution must be found on all the  negotiating tracks.    [Al-Sa'id] Arab world splits are a nightmare that weakens  the  Arab negotiating position vis-a-vis Israel.    [Salman] Since the corrective movement [al-Asad's rise to  power] in 1970, Syria has endeavored to cement Arab solidarity.  President Hafiz al-Asad has said that: "The strength of the  Arabs is in their unity." President al-Asad warned us not to  worrying about secondary issues and forget crucial Arab matters.    There are cracks in the Arab armor, but these can be sealed.  We will do everything within our power to restore Arab  solidarity. Those who fail to learn the lessons of the recent  past have much to lose, and we are afraid the loss will be  bigger this time.    As for those who remain firm and faithful in word and deed  to  the will of the nation, they discern through the clouds of  discord the need for strict adherence to pan-Arab principles and  further commitment to the interests of future generations.</p>

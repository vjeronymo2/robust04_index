			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jose Maria Aznar, leader of the Spanish </F> People's Party, by Ettore Botti in Madrid; date not given:  "Time Is Up for Gonzalez"]    [Excerpts] Madrid -- The Spanish Socialists' congress has  come to an end. As expected, Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has  once again been reelected to the leadership of the PSOE [Spanish  Socialist Workers' Party]. However, though taken for granted,  this outcome was only reached through a compromise -- unexpected  as regards its proportions -- with rival Alfonso Guerra, who  leads the party's left wing. [passage omitted]    [Botti] Do you believe that this was Gonzalez' last congress  as prime minister?    [Aznar] The last, the second last... I cannot tell. What I  do know, however, is that the Socialist cycle has come to an end.    [Botti] Why has it come to an end?    [Aznar] Because the congress has ratified Gonzalez' power,  leaving the basic problems unresolved. The majority of young,  urban voters are now voting for us, that is, for the PP  [People's Party]. The PSOE is backed by those who are not so  young, and those who depend on the state's apparatus. After all  these years, people are tired of this way of governing. The  Socialists should be replacing their ideological platform with a  pragmatic one, but they are incapable of changing.    [Botti] What mistakes has Gonzalez made in his capacity as  head of government?    [Aznar] In a favorable context, he had every opportunity to  transform Spain, but he failed to seize any of them. He gave  rise to a number of irregular practices, which generate mistrust  and pessimism. He failed to link Spain to Europe's more  developed countries.    [Botti] What is your opponent's greatest fault?    [Aznar] I do not like to make personal judgments. If you  wish me to mention a fault, I might say he is inconsistent.    [Botti] Do you think that an analogy can be established  between the PSI's [Italian Socialist Party] collapse in Italy  and the PSOE's present difficulties?    [Aznar] I think that the problem concerns all Socialists in  Mediterranean countries generally. Socialism had its last  stronghold in southern Europe, in France, Greece, and Portugal,  apart from Italy and our own country. In all cases it has  evidenced a strong tendency to conflict, and a similar  conception of power, which has given rise to corruption.    [Botti] Has corruption in Spain reached the same levels as  in  Italy?    [Aznar] I hope not, but it is certainly widespread here, and  patronage is too. This mechanism that generates public  expenditure in order to win votes has seriously contributed to  worsening the state's deficit.    [Botti] Do you think a "manos limpias" [clean hands] enquiry  is required?    [Aznar] I do not think that there will be one, and I am not  advocating one either. It is preferable for regeneration to  take place through a political change.    [Botti] Meaning through you and your PP?    [Aznar] It is up to the Spanish people to decide. However,  the European elections will be very important.    [Botti] Would you rather be considered a center or a  right-wing man?    [Aznar] A center man, whose party covers the entire  center-right area.    [Botti] Do you believe anything can be salvaged from  Francoism?    [Aznar] Nothing is left today of that period. It is a page  in history, and in terms of the people's will, that has now been  definitely turned.    [Botti] What is your answer to those who accuse you of not  having the stature of a leader?    [Aznar] Leaders are created by citizens. Last year 8,200,000  people voted for me, and 9 million for Gonzalez, but I believe  that our votes are qualitatively better.    [Botti] The fact remains that the center-right is in power  in  France, England, and Germany, whereas it did not win in Spain.  Why is this so?    [Aznar] Because of the resistance shown by Mediterranean  socialism, as I mentioned earlier. However, sooner or later we  will win -- that much is certain -- and it still remains to be  seen whether this legislature will reach the end of its term.  Generally speaking, the problem lies in the fact that  governments become worn out, and the need for renewal is felt.  Just as in France people were fed up with the Socialists, in  Germany people may get tired of [Chancellor] Kohl --  irrespective of whether parties are on the Right or the Left.    [Botti] Who will win in Italy, though?    [Aznar] Who knows! I hope that the Left does not win. The  pole of freedom has possibilities, but I think that it still has  to solve some internal problems. The new Popular Party still  has a long way to go. I hope that it will undergo the same  change that we have carried out.    [Botti] What is your opinion of [Forza Italia leader Silvio]  Berlusconi?    [Aznar] Many businessmen turn to politics, but becoming a  politician in the first person requires extraordinary devotion  and capabilities. It is very difficult to be a businessman and  a politician at the same time.    [Botti] Whom would you vote for?    [Aznar] I do not feel I can express a preference. However, I  wish our Popular Party namesakes all the best. [passage omitted]</p>

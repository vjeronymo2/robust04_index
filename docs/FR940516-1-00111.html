			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing to limit CO emissions from large (Class V) handheld engines to 402 g/kWh. In comparison, smaller (Class III, IV) handheld engines would be required to meet the higher standard of 804 g/kWh. The larger Class V engines have technical advantages over smaller engines, with respect to fuel metering and combustion chamber boundary layer conditions, that would allow them to achieve these lower levels of CO emission. This technical rationale is discussed at length in the draft RSD in the docket. In addition to the technical rationale that the Class V engines are capable of lower CO emission levels, a number of engines were tested by the Portable Power Equipment Manufacturers Association (PPEMA) and an individual manufacturer, modified for a six percent enleanment over current production calibration. Approximately 20 to 30 percent of these engines met the 402  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> g/kWh CO standard, achieving average CO levels of eight percent below the standard. The remaining engines tested did not meet either the HC or the CO emission standards. (See data in the draft RSD.) EPA observed that, in general, port design may affect the ease with which engines can meet emission standards. EPA requests comment and data on whether there is a supportable technical rationale why it would not be feasible to further optimize these engines to bring both the HC and CO emissions into line with the engines capable of achieving the proposed standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> PPEMA has argued that the 402  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> g/kWh level is too stringent, but did not focus on Class V engines at the time California rules were being considered since its members anticipated limited regulation of the Class V engines in California due to preemption of many of the products in which these engines are used. In a letter to EPA, a copy of which is included in the docket for this rulemaking, PPEMA suggests that a standard of 603 g/kWh would be more appropriate. EPA would need further data and information that establishes 603 g/kWh as the appropriate technical limit and addresses the need for this higher CO standard as noted above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the data currently available, EPA does not see the need for the higher standard and believes that the proposed standard is achievable. However, EPA is requesting additional information and data that would verify the need for the higher standard and justify why all engines cannot be designed to meet the CO levels achieved by the 20 to 30 percent of engines tested by PPEMA that met all proposed standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> O. Cap on Noise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing to require that engine noise levels not increase as a result of this rulemaking. The type of engine changes which EPA believes will be used to meet the proposed exhaust gaseous emission standards should not increase engine noise above current levels. EPA is aware that several European nations currently have sound level standards for different classes of nonroad equipment, some of which are powered by SI engines less than 19 kW. EPA lacks the necessary information to determine if regulating engine noise without regard to the type of equipment in which the engine will eventually be used is a sensible technical approach. EPA requests data and comments on this issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> P. Applicability of In-Use Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule does not require that small engines meet in-use standards over a useful life period for several reasons. First, limited emission testing of in-use engines has been performed. Additional data will be provided by the in-use testing program described in ``IV.C. Program Description and Rationale.'' Second, EPA does not believe that emission controls proposed for Phase 1 will experience significant deterioration beyond normal engine deterioration, although this area needs more research. EPA does acknowledge its responsibility to achieve enforceable reductions of in-use emissions and plans to develop such measures in its long-term Phase 2 program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Until such measures are developed, EPA proposes to maintain regulatory language in the Phase 1 rule that commits EPA to setting in-use standards and useful life periods by April 1997. In developing Phase 2 regulations, EPA intends to amend this language, replacing it with regulatory language specifying programs that are developed to meet this commitment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA solicits comment on the lack of in-use standards and on the appropriate level of in-use standards, useful life period, and enforcement measures if EPA were to make these a requirement of Phase 1. EPA also invites comment on the regulatory language in the Phase 1 rule that commits EPA to developing these requirements by April 1997. This language states, ``A useful life period for engines subject to the provisions of subpart A of this part will be set by the Agency and will be promulgated no later than the year 1997.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Q. In-Use Testing Requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal requires that manufacturers procure and test a sample of in-use engines and report the results to EPA. In developing this program, EPA considered manufacturer suggestions that any in-use testing program be conducted jointly between EPA, manufacturers, and manufacturers' organizations. EPA is concerned that a joint program would not as efficiently address the goals of the proposed in-use testing program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing the in-use testing requirement with two main goals in mind. Primarily, EPA believes that a critical element in the success of its nonroad program is assuring that manufacturers build engines that continue to meet emission standards beyond the certification and production stages. By requiring manufacturers to test and report results, EPA expects that manufacturers would act responsibly to avoid or correct in-use emission problems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

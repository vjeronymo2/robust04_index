			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Permanent force urged by UN chief MR Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations secretary general, yesterday called for the creation of a permanent rapid intervention force from 10 to 20 UN member states as part of an enhanced peacekeeping role for the world organisation. Each of these member countries would earmark a special battalion in its national forces for use by the UN when required at 24 hours' notice. Such a standby force would not only make the UN into a more potent peacekeeping and peacemaking instrument, but would act as a deterrent to potential aggressors, Mr Boutros Ghali said. Mr Boutros Ghali's proposal is part of a plan called 'An Agenda for Peace' drawn up by him after last year's summit of the 15-nation UN Security Council, on request of its then president, Mr John Major, the British prime minister, whom the secretary general met in London yesterday. The report proposes a new four-phase strategy for dealing with threats to peace and security. In addition to 'preventive diplomacy,' which would provide an early warning system for assessing possible threats to peace, Mr Boutros Ghali suggests a new method of dealing with such threats which he describes as the 'preventive deployment' of UN troops. Under this strategy, UN forces would be sent to an area to deter hostilities instead of waiting until after the outbreak of hostilities. Mr Boutros Ghali insists that, if peaceful means fail, the Security Council should use its power to employ military force to restore international peace and security. It has never been used before, not even in the Gulf crisis, when the Council authorised member states to act on its behalf.</p>

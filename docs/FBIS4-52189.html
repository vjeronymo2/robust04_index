			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- The subsidized propaganda  machines in Seoul are getting over-heated these days in the  anti-DPRK smear campaign through Yo Man-chol, 48, who fled to  South Korea recently.    No one would lend an ear to the ugly torrent of trash  rolling  off the tongue of insane Yo, a human dirt. But we cannot say a  few words about it, because his words are so disgusting and the  South Korean puppets are doing such nasty things by manipulating  him.    Yo Man-chol is a habitual criminal who committed acts never  to be condoned under the political system of the North where a  beautiful and sound life has become a social trait, all people  helping each other and leading each other along.    While serving as a truck driver at the material supply  center  in Hamhung, he stole goods of the state worth more than 100,000  won. When he was carrying materials for daily necessities by  truck from Pyongyang to Hamhung in December last year, he  misappropriated goods worth 30,000 won or more. This theft  committed by him was disclosed in the course of an overall  survey of the warehousing and delivery of materials and  equipment at the material supply centre, and he had to face  justice. Yo felt uneasiness and fear and this was one of the  motives of his defection to South Korea.    A criminal leaves a string of bad names behind him. "A mad  man," "a gangster," "a drunkard" and "a sex maniac" are the  words characterising the human derelict.    One time he was a driver at the Hoesang District security  station in Hamhung. In those days he stayed away from work  quite often under the pretext of illness, and loafed about and  had a fight with his colleagues frequently.    In May 1983, while driving his truck, dead drunk, he hit a  bus stop, inflicting heavy wounds on a number of people standing  there.    Still more grave is that he styled himself an officer of the  traffic safety section of the district security station, going  in false security officer's uniform. In July 1986, disguised as  a senior captain of the public security station, he stopped many  trucks on a night street for no reason and, like a robber he is,  forced the drivers to do something to line his pocket.    For these crimes he was disciplined and ousted from the post  of the truck driver of the district security station.    The fatal evil practice of Yo Man-chol is sex mania which  would make even a brute blush for shame.    Not only once he got it in the neck while attempting to rape  married women. One night in February 1987, in nothing but  pajamas, he broke into the house of a single woman in his  neighbourhood unit and attempted to rape her, only to be  trounced by the neighbours who came rushing at the scream of the  woman.    His beastliness as a sex maniac reached the climax when he  attempted to rape his eldest daughter Yo Kum-chu, 20, a district  kindergaderner. One day in March 1992, when his wife, Yi  Ok-kum, 45, who was a photographer at the Hoesang District light  labor shop, Hamhung, was gone to her parental home in Kapsan,  Yanggang Province, he drank like a fish at home and threw  himself upon his daughter Kum-chu who was 18 years old at that  time. When she resisted, he hit her on the head with a spanner,  injuring her. When his eldest son Yo Kum-yong, who awoke, tried  to stop him, he beat him on the head, leaving him in a critical  condition.    His attempt to rape even his daughter under age, an act  beyond human imagination, is enough to show what a despicable  dirt Yo Man- chol is.    All this glaringly proves that Yo Man-chol is a criminal, a  mentally deranged person and a human dross who do every evil  without the elementary morality, conscience and ethic as a human  being.    It is only too natural that such human derelict became a  target of the accusing fingers of people. He became an object  of guard not only among the neighbours but also among the  Hamhung population who did not want him to live among them.    He was compelled to move to Yanggang Province where his  wife's parental home was. But, there also, he was rejected by  people as a human rubbish. Yo's mental agony grew with the  passage of time.    To cap it all, his misappropriation of a huge amount of  property of the state was brought to light, leaving him no room  to remain under socialism of our style centered on the popular  masses. What he chose, driven to the bay, was to flee to South  Korea.    A deer lives among deers and a dog among dogs. It is only  too clear that the asylum for Yo Man-chol whose career is  stained with indelible crimes and depravity, was the den of the  South Korean puppet clique, the habitat of offscourings which  invites and "welcomes" any human derelict, if it is for the  anti-DPRK political smear campaign.    Still more ridiculous is the mean act of the South Korean  puppet clique in using Yo, who can hardly rank among  human-beings, as a propaganda tool for their sinister political  purpose.    The foolish attempt of the Kim Yong-sam clique to impair the  image of our socialist system centered on the popular masses,  under which the people of the whole country form a big  harmonious family, by using such immoral human dirt, brings into  the open the moral inferiority of the puppets.    Not much penetration is needed to see that the anti-DPRK  smear campaign of the puppets through Yo Man-chol is underlain  by the foolish and sinister intention to evade the crisis of  destruction by lulling the anti-kim Yong-sam sentiments daily  mounting among the South Korean people. But this will lead them  nowhere.    The barking of dogs cannot move a big mountain and the  outcries of human rubbish will only sound like a lamentation  over the "civilian regime" of Kim Yong-sam on the threshold of  death.</p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Warrant underpins C&amp;W rise The bullish mood surrounding Cable and Wireless continued, with BZW issuing 25m call warrants on the non-Hong Kong rump of the shares. The warrants are designed to fac-ilitate arbitraging between C&amp;W and Hong Kong Telecom, in which C&amp;W has a 57.5 per cent stake. According to BZW, C&amp;W's market capitalisation without HK Telecom is Pounds 900,000, but it estimates that the non-Hong Kong business is worth Pounds 3.6bn. The broker believes the apparent 75 per cent discount could narrow to 25 per cent. The warrants, which expire in one year, were issued at 105p each and closed at 112p yesterday. C&amp;W shares, inspired by some other recent positive moves by brokers, advanced 10 to 448p. Hoare Govett reiterated its strong buy stance on Tuesday, pointing out C&amp;W's exposure to the Chinese cellular telecoms market. C&amp;W's rise came amid a strong per-formance from the rest of the telecoms sector, with BT partly-paid shares gaining 4 1/2 at 260p and Vodafone finishing 9 1/2 ahead at 195 1/2 p.</p>

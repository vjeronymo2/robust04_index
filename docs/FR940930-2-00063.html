			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the HIV-related conference support cooperative agreement is to provide partial support for non-Federal conferences to stimulate efforts to prevent the transmission of HIV. CDC will collaborate on conferences that specifically focus on preventing HIV transmission. Because conference support by CDC creates the appearance of CDC co-sponsorship, there will be active participation by CDC in the development and approval of those portions of the agenda supported by CDC funds. CDC funds may not be expended for unsupported portions of conferences. Contingency awards will be made allowing usage of only 25% of the total amount to be awarded until a final full agenda is approved by CDC. This will provide funds for costs associated with preparation of the agenda. The remainder of funds will be released only upon acceptance of the final full agenda. CDC reserves the right to terminate co-sponsorship if it does not approve the final agenda.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Program Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CDC will provide support for conferences that are: (1) regional (more than one State), national, or international in scope and target professionals contributing to HIV prevention efforts; and (2) focused on the transfer of HIV prevention research and evaluation findings to intervention efforts or the application of these prevention efforts to service providers and health professional who provide service to individuals whose behaviors place them at increased risk for HIV infection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Topics concerned with issues and areas other than HIV prevention should be directed to other public health agencies or in accordance with current  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Notices (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Notice 501 published on April 19, 1994, 59 FR 18561). Current recipients of CDC HIV funding must provide the award number and title of the funded program (see the Section Program Requirements, C.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Letter from the Minister for Universities and Scientific </F> and Technological Research, Umberto Colombo, to IL SOLE-24 ORE:  "But His Criticisms Are Without Foundation"]    [Text] I would never have believed that in the debate on  Italian space policy it would have been possible to stoop to  such a low and insolent level as Remo Ruffini has done in his  article.    He sustains that I, in this ministry that "keeps watch over"  the Italian Space Agency (ASI), should have held a more balanced  position on the SAX [X-Ray Astronomy Satellite] project, that  was more in keeping with my important responsibility. Saying  this, he ignores the fact that the minister is not only  vigilant, but also exercises guiding functions for scientific  and technological programs and for programs applied to these  subjects, and gives directives as far as the participation of  the ASI in national and international programs is concerned. It  was therefore my duty to examine the main aspects of the SAX  program, which is the subject of a specific agreement between  the ASI and the Dutch space agency.    I have tried to clarify two key points:    1. Is it true that the cost of the SAX project has continued  to increase, generating continual waste, and that it is out of  control?    2. Is the project valid from a scientific point of view?    There is ample official documentation regarding the first  point, from which it results that the total cost for the project  foreseen today is the same as that calculated in 1988 (this was  the time when the ASI was set up), and indicated in the national  space plan for 1990-94 that was approved by the CIPE  [Interministerial Committee for Economic Planning] in July 1991.  All increases in the cost of the program took place before 1988  and Ruffini knows well that the most important component of this  increase in cost was the change in the program that took place  following the accident of the United States Challenger in 1987,  that brought about the decision of NASA to refuse the  availability of the Shuttle for the SAX mission. Therefore to  speak of irregularities and unlawful administrative acts  totaling 641 billion lire is misleading, and does not in fact  correspond with the communications sent to the ASI by the  Italian audit department.    On the second point, I would like first of all to recall  that  Ruffini himself (who at the time was president of the scientific  committee of the ASI), in his official report to the board of  directors, presented on 13 and 26 November 1991, stated: "The  national scientific project in which the agency is placing the  greatest technological and economic commitment is without doubt  that of the SAX satellite, called for by the scientific  community and needed by the national space plan to allow  national industry to become qualified at the level of prime  contractor for a scientific satellite." So, a little more than  two years ago, when the current cost had been known for some  time and had been stressed, Ruffini was a convinced supporter of  the validity of the SAX program. Evidently he has changed his  mind since then. This would be completely legitimate, if his  current opinion were accompanied by an indication of the new  facts, on a scientific level, that in these two years have made  the validity of the SAX project fade.    I myself, before being nominated minister, was on a  commission that was coordinated by the president of the National  Academy of the Lincei, Giorgio Salvini, and that comprised  including myself, the president of the Papal Academy of  Sciences, Nicola Cabibbo, European Space Agency Council  President Francesco Carassa, and State Advisor Filippo Patroni  Griffi. In reply to a precise question put to us by the  minister, we concluded that the SAX project should be largely  attributed -- precisely because of the goals that it had been  given -- to the program for basic research. In the same report  we expressed deep concern about the time of execution,  indicating, on the basis of the information available to us,  that a delay beyond December 1994 would have been damaging to  the program.    In July 1993, soon after I had taken over the responsibility  for the ministry, I learnt that the date for the launching of  SAX had been moved to December 1995. I therefore had to  ascertain whether this further delay would have reduced the  scientific value of the project to such a level that it was  advisable to end it, even if the expenditure that had already  been sustained, and the expenditure that was contractually  pledged irreversibly had in any case made it necessary to spend  between 75 and 80 percent of the 614 billion lire that made up  the total cost of the undertaking.    I was informed, during a meeting that I had with the  International Scientific Committee on the SAX project, that  other ESA and NASA missions for X-ray astronomy had been  subjected to a parallel delay and that therefore the space of  time for the full scientific validity of the project had been  put forward. A panel, nominated at my request, by the president  of the European Space Science Committee of the European Space  Science Foundation, Heinrich Volk of the Max Planck Institute in  Heidelberg, came to an analogous result. This panel comprised  Professor J. Bleeker of Utrecht, a scientist responsible for SAX  in the Netherlands, Professor T. Courvoisier of Geneva,  Professor J.L. Culhane of London and Professor H.W. Schnopper of  Lyngby, Sweden.    The panel formulated the following recommendation: "Having  considered the composition of the scientific component of the  SAX program and the work that is planned for this mission, and  having compared these with those of the missions that are  currently operative and planned for the near future, we  recommend that this program goes ahead dynamically to ensure a  launch in 1995."    Ruffini thinks that entrusting commissions that are  nominated  ad hoc to give advisory opinions about the individual problems  is an attempt to force preconstituted solutions. This  presupposes the intellectual dishonesty of who nominates the  commissions and who accepts to be part of them, and I would like  to know what leads him to believe that people that are esteemed  by everybody for their moral integrity should behave in a way  that is less than correct.    In particular Ruffini builds up a hypothesis of trickery  based on the fact that I, being at that time the president of  the European Science Foundation (the most important organization  with head office in Strasbourg that coordinates programs and  networks of basic research in Europe and that is systematically  consulted by the European Union Commission and by the European  Space Agency), have in some way influenced the opinion of its  space committee. By thinking this, he ignores the fact that  whoever behaved in such a way would immediately be disqualified  by the international scientific community.    The discourteous behavior of Ruffini penetrates to the point  of trying to intimidate gentlemen like Giampietro Puppi, one of  the most eminent Italian physicists, who is effecting with  competence and absolute dedication the difficult role of  commissioner of the ASI, and dealing with Sergio Ristuccia,  former judiciary and secretary general of the Italian audit  department, in vulgar terms. The seditious accusations of  Ruffini tend to give credit to, and to amplify, the hypotheses  of irregularity and unlawful acts for which proceedings are in  course, opened by the regional attorney of the Italian audit  department, and I hope, that in the interest of the national  space program, these can rapidly be brought to a conclusion,  thereby bringing a situation of uncertainty, that leaves space  for slanderers to do their far from noble work, to an end.</p>

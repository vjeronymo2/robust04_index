			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Finnish premier insists EC must change policy THE European Community must accept the need for policy changes to accommodate the proposed accession of the three Nordic applicants, Finland, Norway and Sweden, Mr Esko Aho, the Finnish prime minister, said yesterday. Spelling out Helsinki's position ahead of what will be the toughest phase during the autumn of the simultaneous accession talks between Brussels and the three, Mr Aho said the climatic and geographic conditions of the region warranted financial support for sectors such as agriculture. 'We cannot change the climate. The main question is whether we are able to get such support which creates even rules for competition for Finnish farmers and farm industries,' he said. Officials said position papers approved this week by Mr Aho's centre-right government, which will be put to Brussels as early as today, demanded EC subsidies for Finnish farmers worth FM3.5bn (Pounds 407m) a year, with a further FM3.5bn coming from the Finnish government. They also call for the maintenance for a transitional period of trade barriers to protect the Finnish food processing industry and EC aid for remote Arctic and sub-Arctic regions. The EC has signalled sympathy for the special needs of the Arctic regions, but has yet to show its hand on the question of new subsidies, particularly given the severe constraints on its budgets. 'That is the problem, maybe, inside the Community. It means that they have to accept, in a way, new policies -a new approach - like they did when Portugal and Spain joined. Then it was the southern approach. Now it is a question of the northern approach,' said Mr Aho in an interview. 'These positions we have presented are based on Community systems so that Community logic is the basis of our demands,' he said. Negotiations with Finland have been considered the least difficult of the three sets of Nordic accession talks (negotiations are also under way with Austria) as public feeling remains hostile to the EC in Sweden and especially Norway. But opinion is still finely balanced in Finland and Mr Aho, whose party is split on the issue, is anxious to drive as hard a bargain as possible with Brussels to ensure victory in a referendum promised before scheduled accession in 1995. He also clearly believes the recent crises within the community on the Maastricht treaty and on currency co-operation have increased the EC's need to score a success in the enlargement talks, thus strengthening the Nordic countries' bargaining positions. 'If the Community is not able to reach its goals in this field, I think somebody is going to ask what is going to happen to the Community,' he said.</p>

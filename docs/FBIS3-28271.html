			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article; "No Agreement Reached on Numerical </F> Targets"]    [Text] U.S. Trade Representative Kantor visited Japan as  an envoy of President Clinton to break a deadlock in Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks, but a series of meetings between him  and Japanese Cabinet ministers ended 3 February, leaving the  split in their opinions over numerical targets unbridged. Mr.  Kantor left Japan for the United States on 4 February and it is  believed he will report to President Clinton that the Japanese  are determined to block the "numerical targets." Now, how the  upcoming Japan-U.S. summit will settle the dispute over  numerical targets has become a focal point.    During the series of meetings with Japanese ministers, Mr.  Kantor stressed the importance of Japan-U.S. relations and then  said: "If the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks fail to  produce any results, the United States would adopt a different  way." In this way, he suggested that the United States will not  hesitate to restore the Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus  Trade Act. In response to his remarks, the Japanese side said:  "He took a tough attitude in an attempt to press Japan for  trade concessions" and added that this tough attitude was  anticipated.</p>

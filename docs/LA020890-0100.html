			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: FAIRFAX;  </P> <P> PARK LABREA GATES CLOSING  </P> <P> The gates of Park Labrea will begin closing Feb. 20, according to the general  manager of the 10,000-resident apartment complex.  </P> <P> Once open to the public, Park Labrea's labyrinthine streets will only be  accessible to residents, guests, workers and emergency vehicles once the  security system is functioning.  </P> <P> Guards at three staffed gates will start monitoring visitors at 11 a.m. on  Tuesday, Feb. 20, but 11 automatic gates will not close until 8 p.m.  </P> <P> "We're going to see how it functions," General Manager Francis Heavey said. "Of  course, we'll practice with them during the day, to make sure they work. For  the first 30 days it will be very loose, to see what the problems are.  Hopefully, it'll work out fine."  </P> <P> Forest City Enterprises Inc., which owns half-interest in Park Labrea and  manages the property, has applied to pass on the cost of more than $3 million  under the city's rent stabilization rules, but the Park Labrea Tenants Assn.  filed a protest. The city has yet to rule on the matter.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The government controlled by Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega is holding  at least 89 political prisoners including opposition party officials, two  opposition leaders charged. "The prisoners are nothing more than hostages,"  Guillermo Endara, a former opposition presidential candidate, said. Former vice  presidential candidate Ricardo Arias Calderon added: "For most (of the 89)  there has been no reply to . . . judicial petitions, showing how deeply the  judiciary is subordinated to the military dictatorship." Many were accused of  threatening the security of the state and were sentenced to a year in jail on  the night they were seized, he said. There was no comment from the government.  </P></p>

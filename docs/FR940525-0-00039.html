			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Requirements for Electronic Submission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A few commenters requested clarification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning the format for electronic reporting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  HCFA provided approved vendors of cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting software with a uniform standardized format for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the creation of the required ASCII file. This format shows  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> how each unique record must be displayed in the electronic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> file in terms of worksheet, line, and column position. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifications required to complete a computerized Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cost Report have been in effect since the inception of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Automated Desk Review (ADR) program in 1983. There are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presently three vendors approved by HCFA for the ADR system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eight other commercial vendors are approved by HCFA for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electronic compilation of the Medicare cost report. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital may use any of the 11 vendors for purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> filing an electronically prepared cost report. Each of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11 vendors must undergo periodic testing in which it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> develops and submits to HCFA a completed cost report to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate its system's ability to conform to HCFA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> display standards. No hospital may file its cost report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electronically unless the commercial software system it uses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has completed the testing process and been approved by HCFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, when the provider files the cost report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the intermediary, the cost report must pass edits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified in the Provider Reimbursement Manual, Part II,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before the intermediary can accept it. If the cost report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fails to pass these edits the intermediary will immediately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reject the cost report and return it to the provider for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correction. The cost report will be considered late if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider fails to correct it before the due date. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider will be subject to withholding of interim payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> until the intermediary receives the corrected cost report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters questioned the need to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> file a hard copy cost report in addition to submitting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electronic cost report. Additionally, commenters were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerned with the lack of a written statement certifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the accuracy of the electronic cost report. One commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that HCFA require providers to submit a written  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification with the electronic cost report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree with the commenters concerns  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding the need to file a hard copy cost report and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lack of a statement certifying the accuracy of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electronic file. Therefore, effective for cost reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periods ending on or after October 1, 1994, we are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eliminating the requirement that providers file a hard copy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the cost report in addition to the electronic file. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new &sect;413.24(f)(4)(iii), we specify that instead of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a hard copy cost report, providers must submit a hard copy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the certification statement, settlement summary, and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement of certain worksheet totals found within the cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report file. We note that the certification statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides that in signing the statement, the provider's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrator or chief financial officer is certifying the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accuracy of the data contained in the electronic cost report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or, if the provider has filed a manually prepared report, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the hard copy cost report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe that these changes will reduce the burden on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providers and ensure the accuracy of the data contained in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the electronic file. However, we also need to ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the electronic cost report is not altered once it leaves the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider. Thus, in conjunction with the changes made based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on public comment, we are implementing a series of changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed to preserve the integrity of the electronic cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report once the provider files it with the intermediary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, we are specifying in new &sect;413.24(f)(4)(ii)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the provider's software must be capable of disclosing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that changes have been made to the cost report file after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the provider has submitted it to the intermediary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, electronic cost reporting software will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modified so that the cost report will calculate a ``hash  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total'', that is, a number representing the sum of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> worksheet totals (mentioned above) contained in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider's as filed cost report. If any data in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electronic file is changed after the hash total is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculated, the electronic file will disclose that a change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been made. We will instruct all automated data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting vendors to develop the capability to calculate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hash totals and disclose changes for all their provider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clients. Second, we are specifying in regulations that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intermediary may not alter a cost report once it has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> filed by a hospital and must reject any cost report that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not pass all specified edits and return it to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider for correction. Third, HCFA will make periodic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> checks to ensure that the totals in the electronic file  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agree with those totals certified by the provider's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrator or chief financial officer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because providers may not have anticipated such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial changes as a result of this rule, we are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> soliciting comments concerning the requirement in new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;413.24(f)(4)(ii) that cost report software be able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disclose changes to the electronic file made after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider has submitted it to the intermediary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter requested that the intermediary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be required to report back to the provider in electronic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost reporting format the audit adjustments made to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider's cost report. This would allow providers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> readily add the audit adjustments to the electronic cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report for future reference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We recognize the merit of this suggestion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and will consider implementing this process in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The intermediaries would need additional computer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programming to be able to provide hospitals with an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electronic file of audit adjustments. We will discuss the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter's suggestion with the 11 approved vendors of cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report software to determine the extent of additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programming needed and the financial implications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

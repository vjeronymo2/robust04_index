			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [YONHAP from Washington] </F>   [Text] The U.S. Government had originally planned to  announce the U.S.-DPRK agreement [habuimun] reached in their New  York contact and to take simultaneous measures [tongsi chochi]  according to it. However, it decided to delay the announcement  on the simultaneous measures as North Korea proposed the  South-North working-level contact to be held on 3 March,  rescheduling the date we proposed earlier.    A high-level diplomatic source in Washington said: The U.S.  Government planned to announce on 2 March -- as soon as the  International Atomic Energy Agency inspection team arrived in  Pyongyang, and South-North working-level contacts were resumed  -- a statement on the ROK Government's consent [chiji] to  suspension of the Team Spirit exercise and on the decision to  hold the third round of U.S.-DPRK talks on 21 March. However,  it has decided to postpone the announcement of all simultaneous  measures until tomorrow [3 March] because North Korea delayed  the South-North dialogue, breaking its promise.    It has been learned that the U.S. Government made this  decision after consulting with the ROK as a result of North  Korea breaking its promise and the United States took  countermeasures [taeung pangan] on this.    Sources said: All U.S.-DPRK agreements are linked with one  another. If, either side, the United States or North Korea does  not implement one of the simultaneous measures, all other  agreements will automatically be invalidated.    Regarding this, a senior officer of the U.S. State  Department  stressed again that the resumption of South-North dialogue on  the nuclear issue by exchanging envoys of South and North Korea  is one of the preconditions [chonje chogon] of the third round  of U.S.-DPRK talks.</p>

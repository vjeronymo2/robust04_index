			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2-YEAR COLLEGE INSTALLS CONDOM DISPENSERS  </P> <P> As part of an AIDS prevention effort, Antelope Valley College in Lancaster  installed its first two condom dispensing machines in student restrooms Friday.  </P> <P> The machines were installed in the men's and women's restrooms in the campus  student center at the recommendation of a health and safety committee composed  of college officials and students.  </P> <P> "Actually, there's many other colleges that have beat us to the punch on this  one," said Steve Standerfer, a spokesman for the two-year college. He said  UCLA, UC Riverside and community colleges in Glendale, San Bernardino and  Fresno are among those that already have the machines.  </P> <P> The college, which has about 8,600 students, plans to use any profits to pay  for AIDS and sex-related programs on campus, Standerfer said.  </P> <P> Thus far, the college has not had any controversy or protests about the  dispensers, Standerfer said.  </P></p>

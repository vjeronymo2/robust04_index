			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Pilkington rises Dealers were surprised at the market's strongly positive reaction to interim results from glass manufacturer Pilkington. Although the group's half-year profits came out at Pounds 30.5m, well up on last year's Pounds 15m and ahead of most expectations, the dividend was cut. Some traders said there was relief that the results had not been accompanied by a rights issue, but others said a cash call had been unofficially ruled out by the company in response to market rumours some weeks ago. And specialists were impressed with the post-results company meeting. The general impression in the market, however, was that the shares had responded mostly to a substantial squeeze of marketmakers' short positions. 'Once the shorts are unwound, there could be a reaction in the share price,' said one marketmaker, who added that the building materials sector had outperformed strongly in the past couple of months. The shares advanced 11 to 168p on turnover of 15m. The pharmaceuticals sector experienced switching from Wellcome to Glaxo on concern over one of the former's key treatments. The New England Journal of Medicine published a report showing that Zovirax, the anti-herpes product, had proved ineffective in treating genital herpes in an otherwise healthy man. Analysts said problems in treating one patient were unlikely to lead to big worries over Zovirax, which represents around 37 per cent of Wellcome's turnover. But they added that it could hinder an application to sell it over the counter in the US. Wellcome shares fell 14 to 656p, while Glaxo rose 9 to 697p. Turnover in Standard Chartered was a hefty 2.8m as the share price gyrated between a record 1259p and 1201p, responding to intermittent bouts of renewed strong buying by institutions seeking to buy market weightings in the stock and flurries of profit-taking. A leading broking house was said to be putting a Pounds 20 a share price target on Standard, which lost 8 at 1229p. Royal Insurance was the pick of a busy composite insurance sector, closing 15 up at 317p after a positive judgment on industrial pollution in the House of Lords. London International Group fell 28 to 111p on reporting a Pounds 5.1m interim loss, against forecasts of a Pounds 4m to Pounds 5m profit. Analysts were quick to cut back forecasts for the company, which has been dogged by problems. Hoare Govett has pencilled in a loss forecast of Pounds 6.5m, against a previous profit estimate of Pounds 10m for the full year, but said everything depends on the timing of disposals and restructuring. Powerscreen International, the Northern Ireland-based manufacturer of screening and stone crushing equipment, came under renewed pressure as rumours persisted of an inland revenue inquiry. The company said it knew of no reason for the decline in the shares, which have collapsed from 372p a week ago to yesterday's 272p, a net fall of 31 on the day. Burmah Castrol was the outstanding performer in an otherwise depressed oil sector, the stock racing to an all-time high of 833p at one point before easing to close a net 13 up at 815p as the market focused on potential beneficiaries of weak oil prices. The majors, on the other hand, suffered from yet another dose of afternoon selling. Dealers said US institutions, which have been the big supporters of BP over the past year or so, have begun to reduce their holdings, certainly in BP and possibly also in Shell Transport. US holdings accounted for around 24 per cent of BP at the last count. BP settled 9 1/2 lower at 320 1/2 p - the shares' lowest closing level since September - after heavy turnover of 12m. Shell retreated 11 to 695p on 3.9m traded. Second liner Clyde Petroleum was firm as recent hints of exploration success gathered momentum, driving Clyde shares up to 53p before finishing 5 ahead at 51 1/2 p. Analysts refused to rule out a series of rationalisation moves in the oil exploration and production sub-sector. Improved UK car sales gave a boost to motor-related stocks. Among component manufacturers, T&amp;N advanced 8 to 199p, Motor World 3 to 326p, BBA Group 7 to 189p and Laird 6 to 335p. Distributor T. Cowie climbed 8 to 258p. The arrival of furniture group DFS in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index helped the shares appreciate 9 to 304p. However, Betterware's exit was said to be behind its fall of 9 to 140p. Profit-taking marred respectable results from Great Universal Stores, the shares giving up 9 to 573p. Signet Group, formerly Ratners, continued to decline on talk of slack sales. The stock slipped 2 3/4 to 15 3/4 p. In a quiet drinks sector, Guinness bore the brunt of a downgrade from Lehman Brothers, the shares sliding 10 to 468p. The US broker was said to have lowered its 1993 profits forecast to Pounds 835m from Pounds 890m, and to Pounds 902m from Pounds 920m for 1994. Greenalls moved forward 8 to 415p on the back of positive comment after results on Tuesday. Results from Compass Group included a 31 per cent profits rise and saw the shares jump 19 to 514p. Hoare Govett moved from 'hold' to 'buy' on the stock following a positive results meeting. UBS was said to have recommended Granada Group, 11 higher at 484p.</p>

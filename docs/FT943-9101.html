			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Berlusconi preaches optimism on TV Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, last night sought to reassure Italians and foreign investors about the political and economic health of the country following another turbulent day on currency, bond and equity markets. In a series of television interviews, Mr Berlusconi said Italy was functioning better than ever, and dismissed the idea of fresh elections only three months after the mould-breaking poll which installed a new political regime. A smiling Mr Berlusconi criticised politicians and pundits on the left, disgruntled after losing the March election, for pulling against the interests of the country. He said he also hoped soon to meet his coalition partner Mr Umberto Bossi, head of the populist Northern League, who has continued to attack the prime minister. 'There are certain people who are making irresponsible declarations, and this is serious,' Mr Berlusconi said. On Thursday the Bank of Italy unexpectedly increased interest rates by half a point, to defend the currency. Analysts have also interpreted the rise as a strong hint from the central bank that the government should act soon to tackle the country's budget deficit. The attempt to protect the lira appeared to have backfired yesterday, with the currency slipping to nearly L1,030 against the D-Mark. At the beginning of the week it stood at less than L1,000 against the German currency. Equity and bond markets were also hit hard by the rise, the first since the September 1992 crisis of the European exchange rate mechanism. At one point Milan stocks had slipped by more than 5 per cent on the day, but the Comit index recovered to close at 644.43, down 3.7 per cent. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year benchmark bond rose to 11.73, up from 11.39 on Thursday. The markets are closed in Italy on Monday. Confindustria, the Italian industry federation, was sharply critical of the Bank of Italy's move yesterday, warning that it 'runs the risk on the one hand of failing to eliminate uncertainty on the markets, and on the other of feeding a negative spiral of rate rises'. The markets also had to digest an interview with Mr Berlusconi, conducted midweek and published yesterday by the International Herald Tribune, in which he admitted that executives of his Fininvest business paid bribes to tax officials. However, he played down the scale and importance of the bribes, which were authorised by his brother Paolo, who is under investigation in Milan.</p>

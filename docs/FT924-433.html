			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Greece passes harsh budget The Greek parliament early yesterday approved an austerity budget for 1993 after the opposition Panhellenic Socialist Movement withdrew one of its deputies, letting the government retain its one-seat majority in the 300-member house, writes Kerin Hope in Athens. Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Pasok leader, made the decision when an Athens hospital refused to discharge Mr Eleftherios Papadimitriou, a deputy from the ruling New Democracy party who was wounded in a terrorist attack.</p>

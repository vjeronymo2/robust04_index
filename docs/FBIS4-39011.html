An ITAR-TASS  correspondent was told of this today by Colonel Aleksandr  Goncharov of the Defense Ministry's information and press  department.    He said that the money will come from the activities of the  military insurance company. According to a Russian Federation  Defense Ministry directive, it will be used to stage military-  patriotic and cultural events and to organize meetings with the  participants of wars and veterans of the armed forces. It is  also envisioned to use the money from the extra-budgetary fund  to pay for the treatment of servicemen and their families, to  provide gratuitous financial assistance to large families, and  particularly servicemen in need, and as subsidies to public  catering enterprises located in officers' houses and officers'  clubs.</p>

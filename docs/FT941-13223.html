			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading Active selling, some of which was done through the use of sophisticated derivative instruments, brought a sharp retreat but reduced volume in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. A strong opening for the March futures contract on the FT-SE 100 Index at 3,494 seemed to indicate a firm session ahead. However, this was soon undermined by selling from Salomon Brothers. A host of other factors played a part in the day's decline. Aggressive selling of the bund futures initiated a similar response in traders of March, as did Tuesday's issuing of an OTC put option. US investment house Goldman Sachs was also said to have issued a call and put warrant yesterday, all of which dampened enthusiasm for the contract. But it was the fall on Wall Street following poor US consumer confidence figures that brought the sharpest decline of the day, sending March below its recent support level of 3,460. It closed at 3,448, down 30 from yesterday's close and at a 6-point discount to its fair value premium to cash of about 7 points. Turnover at 9,721 contracts was one of the lowest in recent sessions. The traded options sector was more buoyant and saw improved turnover of 46,833 lots, Volume in the FT-SE 100 option only showed a slight improvement at 12,921 contracts. Better than expected results from international trading group Lonrho brought increased activity to the group's stock options. They headed the list of active stock trades, finishing with a total of 4,617 lots dealt.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 1 KYODO -- The Chinese Foreign  Ministry on Wednesday [1 June] denounced an incident two days  ago in which a gunman threatened former Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa in a Tokyo hotel by firing a shot at the ceiling.    "It is an act which does not win the hearts of the people to  terrorize a politician who took a wise attitude on the issue of  Japan's past invasion," according to a comment released by the  ministry's information department.    The assailant told police that he was angered by Hosokawa's  apology, when he was premier, for Japan's wartime actions.</p>

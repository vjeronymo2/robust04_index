			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Son Song-pil, ambassador of our country to Russia,  held interviews with reporters of ITAR-TASS, SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA,  and (KOMMERSANTO), on 8 and 10 February in connection with  Japan's nuclear armament maneuvers and with commotions on our  missile threat loudly talked about by Western countries,  including the United States.    The ambassador responded to questions about the commotions  on  our missile threat noisily talked about by the United States and  Western countries.    He said: The United States and Western countries raved that  by developing missiles, we are threatening Japan and South Korea  and are exporting missiles to Middle East countries. Their claim  is a barefaced lie. This is intended as justification for the  United States to continuously keep military bases and troops in  Japan and South Korea and to militarily crush our Republic by  reinforcing its Armed Forces. This is also designed for the  United States to militarily tie down [kunsajoguro olgo  maenochanunde] South Korea. As is known to the entire world, our  defense forces are, for all intents and purposes, defensive  forces of the nation. Public opinion that we will attack Japan  and South Korea first is a trick fabricated by the United  States. Our country is a peace-loving state. The hardline  conservative forces in the United States should not miscalculate  our military power.    It is a firm resolution of our people and People's Army to  defend the nation's independence and dignity. We are fully  prepared for any contingency. We will respond to dialogue with  dialogue and to war with war. If the United States advances  along the road of confrontation with us through strength by  reinforcing armed forces in Northeast Asia, we will take  corresponding countermeasures [sangunghan taeungchaegul  chwihada].    Responding to questions on Japan's nuclear armament, the  ambassador said that Japan recently announced that it will  ignite a new fast-breeder reactor, which is capable of producing  a large quantity of plutonium. He continued:    Japan has the potential to produce nuclear weapons at any  time. In addition, it has a 800-ton annual nuclear reprocessing  capacity. Japan is stockpiling 1.6 tons of plutonium at home and  2.9 tons overseas. Japan plans to possess 50 tons of plutonium  by 2010. When this is realized, Japan will be capable of  producing more than 6,200 nuclear bombs.    Japan has already developed intercontinental ballistic  missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. Japan's  undisguised nuclear armament poses a great threat to peace and  security in Northeast Asia, including the Korean peninsula, and  to the world.    Therefore, the people of the world, not to mention the Asian  people, should deal with Japan's nuclear armament with a sense  of vigilance, and should thoroughly check such armament. If one  fails to check Japan's nuclear armament, the denuclearization of  the Korean peninsula would be meaningless. Therefore, Japan's  nuclear armament must be checked, first of all, to achieve the  denuclearization of Northeast Asia.</p>

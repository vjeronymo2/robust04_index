			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LANDLORDS IN RENT STRIKE TOLD TO FIX DEFECTS, OR ELSE  </P> <P> The Santa Ana City Council on Monday gave the owners of a 10-unit apartment  building involved in a rent strike 60 days to renovate stairs and a balcony or  face having the property declared a public nuisance and repaired by the city --  at their expense.  </P> <P> Nick O'Malley, an attorney for landlords James B. Isbill and Bonnie P. Isbill,  said his clients intend to begin repairs as soon as they receive building  permits from the city.  </P> <P> The two-story building at 607 E. Washington Ave. has four units vacant and six  occupied by low-income families. All of the residents might have been forced to  move had the city declared the building a nuisance.  </P> <P> In August, an attorney appointed by the city declared that the outside stairs  and balcony were so rotten that the building posed a danger to residents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Attorney Calls Building Unsafe  </P> <P> In a report to the council, attorney Keith C. Monroe said the apartment  building is unsafe.  </P> <P> "Credible evidence demonstrated," Monroe wrote, "that the stairs located on the  front of the building . . . are and have been for some time badly dry-rotted  and deteriorated. They are dangerous for residents and others to use."  </P> <P> Because of the conditions, tenants have been withholding rent from the owners  since 1985 as part of a countywide rent strike movement. The tenants filed a  suit against various landlords, demanding better conditions.  </P> <P> O'Malley said the owners of the East Washington Avenue building have not made  repairs or renovations because of the lack of rent income.  </P> <P> O'Malley said the owners had intended to demolish the building in 1984 but  could not proceed with the demolition because of the strike.  </P></p>

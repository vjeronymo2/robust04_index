Introduction </H5>   In recent years, with the adoption of higher density in  semiconductor integrated circuits, the quality requirements for  ultrapure water have become increasingly higher purity.    Actually, it has been required to remove dissolved oxygen  (hereinafter referred to as DO) from ultrapure water, in order  to prevent growth of the native oxide layers on water surfaces.    The conventional processes for removal of DO from water  include physical processes (e.g., vacuum degassing, purging with  N[.sub]2[/] gas) and chemical process involving the addition  of reducing agents with catalyzer. In achieving an extremely low  concentration of DO by the conventional degassing processes,  there are some problems; e.g., a large facility will be  required, they will occur the increase of impurities, and a  large amount of N[.sub]2[/] gas will be required.    This paper describes not only the method of reducing DO to 5  ppb or less by UV ray, but also the decomposition and removal of  TOC by UV ray.  <H5>  2. Removal of DO by Using UV Ray </H5> <H5>  2.1. Experimental and Principle </H5>   DO reacts with hydrogen by irradiating UV ray which contains  a wavelength of 185 nm. However, the reaction between DO and  hydrogen does not occur by using UV ray of more than 254 nm.    Figure 1 shows the test equipment. Hydrogen gas was employed  as the reducing agent and dissolved in water by using a  gas-permeable membrane module. The gas-permeable membrane was  polyolefine hollow fiber type.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-63A>      Figure 1. Experimental Equipment </FIG>     Hydrogen gas dissolves in water because of the pressure  level  of difference outside to inside of membrane. Accordingly, it was  easy to control very small amount of additional gas. Moreover,  gas bubbles were not remained in water.    Low pressure mercury lamps and thimble tubes, which were  used  synthetic quartz glass, were installed in a UV reactor.    Irradiating water contained hydrogen with UV ray of 185 nm,  DO or dissolved hydrogen (DH) is excited and DO reacts with DH  to become water as follows.    1/2 O[.sub]2[/] + H[.sub]2[/] O* + 2H*  H[.sub]2[/]O [h_n_ above first right arrow]  <H5>  2.2. Effect of Water Depth </H5>   UV of 185 nm wavelength is absorbed by water very well. It  is  necessary to bring DO and DH into contact with UV light zone, in  order to gain higher efficiency of UV reactor.    Accordingly as depth of water layer increased, DO removing  percentage of UV reactor went down as shown in Figure 2.  Furthermore, the effect of water was strong according as  retention time decreased.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-63B>      Figure 2. Depth of Water Layer and DO Removing Percentage </FIG>     It is desirable to decrease water depth as thin as possible.  However, on producing UV reactor it is difficult that the depth  becomes 5mm or less. Accordingly, the retention time of actual  UV reactor needs more than 20 seconds and form of buffer plates  in UV reactor are devised.  <H5>  2.3. Effect of Hydrogen Dosage </H5>   Effect of hydrogen dosage injected into water was tested by  using two kinds of UV reactors: One had UV lamp's output power  level of 650 w and another had 1550 w. The results of the test  are shown in Figure 3. Figure 3 shows the relationship between  the rate of DO reaction efficiency and the amount of hydrogen  indicated by 2H[.sub]2[/] per O[.sub]2[/] ratio.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-64A>      Figure 3. 2H[.sub]2[/]/O[.sub]2[/] Ratio and Rate of DO Reaction Efficiency </FIG>     In case of A to have scarce intensity of UV irradiation,  hydrogen per oxygen ratio is had to become more than four, in  order to make the rate of DO reaction efficiency become one.  However, in case of B to have enough intensity of UV  irradiation, the rate of DO reaction efficiency becomes one if  H[.sub]2[/] per O[.sub]2[/] ratio is more than 1.2.    DO concentration of influent is not constant at actual DO  removal treatment.    Accordingly, excess amount of hydrogen gas is injected into  water.  <H5>  2.4. DO Removal Performance of Actual Equipment </H5>   DO removal performance of actual equipment which had  treatment ability of 10 m[.sup]3[/]/h, is shown in Figure 4.  Additional dosage of hydrogen gas was one and a half times of  H[.sub]2[/] per O[.sub]2[/] ratio for initial DO  concentration of 100 g/l.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-65A>      Figure 4. DO Removal Performance </FIG>     It kept always constant even if initial DO changed. It was  enough satisfied to reduce the residual DO in treated water to 5  g/l or less at initial DO of less than 100 g/l.    Furthermore, if initial DO is less than 30 g/l, it is  possible to reduce DO to 1 g/l or less.  <H5>  3. Decomposition of TOC by Using UV Ray </H5>   It is known that the UV ray of 185 nm is able to decompose  low molecular organic compounds without oxidizer. Accordingly,  decomposition of TOC and removal of DO simultaneously achieved  by using a same vessel of UV reactor.    TOC is decomposed into several kinds of organic acids and  carbonic acid by UV irradiation. For example, decomposition  products of ethylalcohol is shown in Table 1.       Table 1. Decomposition Products of Ethylalcohol by UV Irradiation   Test    Ethylalcohol    Percentage of each product  No.     (g/l as C)                           Acetic    Oxalic    Formic    CO[.sub]2[/]    Unknown                          acid      acid      acid      (%)            matters                          (%)       (%)       (%)                      (%)   1       38.1            46.2      4.5       2.9       44.1           2.3   2       56.1            44.7      3.9       2.7       36.5           12.2   3       87.2            45.8      3.4       2.6       32.2           15.9      This result was obtained under the conditions that flow rate  of treatment was 300 l/h and a 70 w low pressure mercury lamp  was used.    As a result, it seems to increase percentage of unknown  matters according to an increase of initial ethylalcohol  concentration. However, TOC of more than 80 percent was  decomposed into several kinds of organic acids, particularly  acetic acid, and carbonic acid. These organic acids and carbonic  acid are easily removed by a conventional anion exchange resin.    As a result of long running actual equipment operation, TOC  of treated water has stably become 2 to 3 g/l at initial TOC  level from 10 to 20 g/l.  <H5>  4. Ultrapure Water Unit at Used Point </H5>   As shown in Figure 5, ultrapure water unit, which is used at  a close point to the ULSI manufacturing place, consists of the  following components: a gas permeable membrane module dissolving  hydrogen, a UV reactor, modules of membrane deaerator for  reducing residual dissolved hydrogen, ion exchange cartridge  polishers, ultrafiltration membrane and non-particle pumps.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-66A>      Figure 5. Flow Sheet of Advanced Ultrapure Water Unit </FIG>     Needless to say, 254 nm of UV ray has a sterilizing effect.    Therefore, this process has ability not only for removing of  DO and TOC but also for the sterilizing of ultrapure water.    Table 2 shows water quality of the advanced ultrapure water  unit.

K. K)     <H5>  5. Conclusions </H5>   1) Decomposition of TOC and removal of DO are simultaneously  achieved by using a same vessel of UV reactor. This process does  not cause any increase in impurities.    2) This process is very suitable to place as close to used  points as possible, because of very compact size.</p>

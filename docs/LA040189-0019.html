			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASSEMBLYMAN'S WIFE GRAZED BY BULLET  </P> <P> The wife of Assembly Republican leader Ross Johnson of La Habra was slightly  injured when a bullet shattered the windows of her van while she was driving  along Interstate 80 near the state Capitol, his office said Friday.  </P> <P> Anne Richards, the assemblyman's press secretary, said doctors reported the  "bullet grazed the chin" of Diane Johnson, 47, as she was driving to Davis from  Sacramento early Thursday afternoon.  </P> <P> "She had some stitches, but she's fine now and back at work today," Richards  said.  </P> <P> After the incident, Diane Johnson drove on to Davis and called police.  </P> <P> Richards said the Yolo County Sheriff's Department has no leads in the case, no  suspects and the bullet has not been found.  </P> <P> Asked if there were any political implications to the incident, she said, "No.  We think it was just a plinker. They've had a lot of problems in that area with  people shooting guns, according to the sheriff's office."  </P></p>

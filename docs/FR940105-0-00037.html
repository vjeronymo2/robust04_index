			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission will adopt the data sets as proposed by the Working Group with one modification. The Commission will require that the point locator information be mandatory. The Commission agrees with the commenters that the ability to locate pipeline points in relation to other points on the system is important if users are to use the common code data base to determine if a package of released capacity fits their needs. When pipelines verify their proprietary codes to PI-GRID, they must include information sufficient to enable users to locate a point on one pipeline in relation to other points. At this point, the pipelines can choose the method of locating the points, such as geographic coordinates, line number or line marker, but the Commission envisions that eventually all pipelines should move to using geographic coordinates so that points on different pipelines can be related to each other.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gaslantic and IPAA support the provision of the data base and updates at no cost to the user. The Working Group report states distributors cannot charge more than postage and handling costs for providing the code itself, but can charge for value added services. The Commission is requiring the pipelines to ensure that users can obtain the data base and any updates at a price that reflects only reasonable costs of distribution and handling. Additional charges, however, may be assessed for other value added services relating to updates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirement that point locator information be mandatory for all pipelines obviates the requests by the National Registry for a further definition of the term ``available'' to describe when point locator information will be provided and for requiring point location disclosure in Form 567 filings. The provision of point locator information also should satisfy Process Gas Consumers Group's request for geographic location points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The National Registry suggests that the Commission require PI-GRID to file a statement with the Commission when it has completed more than 90% of the cross-referencing for each pipeline and provide the code to distributors at that point. The Commission has set a deadline for final dissemination of the common code data base and finds no reason to require filings as the data are compiled or piecemeal implementation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NYMEX/Enersoft contend pipelines should be required to conduct business using common codes. The Commission will not impose this requirement at this time, since it goes beyond the consensus agreement reached by Working Group 5. Shippers will be able to use the cross-reference table to convert electronically from the common codes to the proprietary codes for communication with the pipeline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Process Gas Consumers Group maintains that including the common codes in the capacity release data sets would be more efficient, although they do not suggest pipelines be required to conduct business using the common code. This suggestion too goes beyond the consensus agreement reached by the Working Groups, and the Commission will not impose it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, even if the common code (consisting of 16 digits) was included in the capacity release data sets, the efficiency of the process might not be enhanced to a significant degree. The extensive data base that goes along with the common code would not be on the EBBs, and users may very well need the underlying data base to provide the information they require to perform an analysis of capacity paths. As described earlier, the sequence of numbers in the code itself provides users only with limited information, such as identifying the state and county of the point. But the entire common code data base provides additional information about points, such as the point locator information, that users may well need to use the common code effectively in comparing capacity releases over multiple pipelines. The Commission further notes that Working Groups 1 and 2 have included an optional field for common codes which pipelines may make available to their users. Use of this field may provide a test of whether bidders would derive value from access to the common code numbers, without also having the underlying data base available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In conclusion, the Commission finds that the industry has taken a positive step forward by designing a process that will ensure that those wanting to use common codes can do so effectively within a reasonable period of time. The Commission expects use of this system will prove to enhance efficiency by better enabling shippers to manage the transportation of gas supplies across the nationwide pipeline grid. As pipelines review and update their computer and financial systems in light of the changed business environment created by Order No. 636, the Commission expects them to incorporate the use of common codes. Ultimately, the Commission anticipates that the common codes ultimately will become the standard used for all transactions and communications between pipelines and their customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Issues not Addressed in the Standardized Data Sets and Communication Protocols <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Working Group reports included minority positions on some issues, and these issues also were addressed in the comments on the Working Group reports. On several issues, the Commission recommended that the Working Groups continue their efforts to seek resolution, with reports to be made by February 1, 1994. Others involved policy questions which the Commission found were beyond the scope of this proceeding and would be better examined in other fora.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Proposed Additions to the Standardized Data Sets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Index of Purchasers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Registry proposed that an Index of Purchasers (Index), which would disclose a variety of information about the capacity rights of firm capacity holders, be available on EBBs and through downloadable files. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 52 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  It asserted this index could be used to establish the baseline contractual rights of current holders of pipeline capacity, information which it believed was needed so potential purchasers could determine the releasable rights of firm capacity holders. In the NOPR, the Commission did not propose to include the proposed Index because the proposal appeared too burdensome and costly. But the Commission stated it considered a more limited Index to have value in identifying firm shippers with releasable capacity. It suggested the Working Groups work on a cost-effective method of presenting such information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 52 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission requires pipeline tariffs to include an index of firm capacity holders, with less detail than what was proposed by the National Registry.

			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CONSERVATIVE DAVIS GOES AGAINST IMAGE WITH PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTES  </P> <P> Call it the greening of Ed Davis.  </P> <P> Best known for his cop quips and law-and-order image, Davis, a Republican who  represents the state's conservative 19th Senate District, has become an  environmental advocate.  </P> <P> In recent months, Davis -- a lifetime National Rifle Assn. member and ex-Los  Angeles police chief -- has startled and delighted conservationists by working  to protect mountain lions, crack down on "outlaw developers" along the coast,  create new parkland and slow the pace of home building in the Santa Clarita  Valley.  </P> <P> Indeed, in 1988, he posted the best pro-environmental voting record among GOP  state senators, according to the California League of Conservation Voters.  Davis voted for 85% of the key bills tracked by the league, well above the  Republican average of 68%.  </P> <P> "I hate to ruin my political career, but I consider myself an  environmentalist," said Davis, laughing, during an interview.  </P> <P> For some preservationists, Davis' new devotion to their cause somewhat  jarringly contrasts with his public image as an  ex-cop-turned-conservative-politician. And outwardly, that image is little  changed.  </P> <P> The walls of his Chatsworth offices are festooned with mementoes of his Los  Angeles Police Department days. There is an autographed photo of the late Jack  Webb, star of the old "Dragnet" television series; another photo bears  greetings from the stars of the "Adam-12" TV cop show.  </P> <P> But the man who once urged that skyjackers be hanged at airports now talks  worriedly about the destruction of Amazon rain forests, reads National Wildlife  magazine and declares that developers who violate state coastal rules ought to  be thrown in prison.  </P> <P> His position is all the more remarkable in light of his past antagonism toward  California Coastal Commission officials, whom the colorful, sharp-tongued Davis  referred to as "environmental fascists" and "unmitigated bastards" during his  frequent squabbles with the agency in the early 1980s, when his district  included Malibu (the area was reapportioned away from him in 1982).  </P> <P> </P> <P> Backs Coastal Agency  </P> <P> During the past three years, Davis, 72, has emerged as a strong supporter of  the beleaguered coastal protection agency.  </P> <P> He has voted several times to restore cuts made in the commission's budget by  its political archenemy, Gov. George Deukmejian. Earlier this year, Davis  introduced a bill (recently vetoed by the governor) giving the commission power  to move faster to stop illegal coastal development.  </P> <P> "He's now our champion," said Bill Allayaud, the commission's Sacramento  lobbyist.  </P> <P> Davis said he changed his attitude because Deukmejian's appointments to the  commission have been good therapy for the agency.  </P> <P> "The Coastal Commission has become a constructive force," he said. "They were  properly sent to the woodshed when he came in; they deserved to go to the  woodshed. My feeling is that they have reformed."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Typical Voting Record  </P> <P> Elected to the Senate in 1980, Davis' environmental voting record in his first  five years was fairly typical of Republicans in the upper house, according to  League of Conservation Voters figures.  </P> <P> The league each year compiles scores based on how legislators voted on a number  of key environmental bills. In his early Senate years, Davis' record fluctuated  between 24% and 50%. But in 1986, Davis' record soared to 92%. He dipped to 38%  the following year but jumped to 85% in 1988. Last year, the Senate's other 13  Republicans ranged from 39% to 82%.  </P> <P> Davis' score stands in even more marked contrast to those of Republican  Assembly members whose districts overlap his. Assembly members Tom McClintock  of Thousand Oaks and Cathie Wright of Simi Valley both scored 15% in 1988;  Marian W. La Follette of Northridge scored 28%.  </P> <P> Although he sticks out among fellow Republicans, Davis still scores below most  Senate Democrats, who averaged 89% last year. Six Democrats posted 100%  records, and even the lowest-ranked Democrat, Rose Ann Vuich of Dinuba, had an  81% record.  </P> <P> "He tends to take risks, and he's more statesmanlike than most legislators,"  said state Sen. Bill Lockyer, a Hayward Democrat who had a 100% ranking.  </P> <P> "That may be because of his age. He's said he's an old guy, and he's going to  do what he wants to in spite of what people think."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Alarmed by Development  </P> <P> Davis said that in the past few years, he has become alarmed as developers  built more and more homes in his far-flung district, which meanders from  Woodland Hills in Los Angeles County to Santa Maria in Santa Barbara County.  </P> <P> He has been particularly critical of developers in the Santa Clarita Valley,  where he moved in 1984, charging that the region has been raped by builders  whose projects have brought noise, traffic, pollution and other problems to a  once-pristine area.  </P> <P> Davis' embrace of preservation mirrors a concerted attempt by Republicans at  the state and national levels to capture the issue, long considered the  Democratic Party's political property. Burdened with the image of former  Secretary of the Interior James Watt, Republicans have sought to return to that  of Teddy Roosevelt, an outdoorsman and founder of the national parks system, as  GOP voters increasingly worry about polluted air and water, overdevelopment and  traffic jams.  </P> <P> Alan Hoffenblum, a Los Angeles-based political consultant, said Republicans  representing California's coastal regions are under growing pressure to change  their stances from yuppie Republicans who have flooded into their districts.  These youngish, well-educated and well-salaried voters are highly responsive to  environmental issues, he said.  </P> <P> "All of a sudden, they can't just hold onto their office by being fiscal  conservatives," Hoffenblum said. "They've got to look at social and  environmental issues too."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hot Political Topic  </P> <P> And the environment has become a hot political topic among many residents of  Davis' heavily Republican district, which contains portions of two national  forests.  </P> <P> In a 1988 poll, for instance, 96% of Santa Clarita residents said they viewed  traffic congestion as a serious problem. When the city was incorporated two  years ago, the City Council promptly declared a moratorium on cutting the  valley's treasured oak trees.  </P> <P> Davis' views on growth have led him to tangle repeatedly with the Los Angeles  County Local Agency Formation Commission, an agency that oversees the  establishment of new cities. Davis has criticized the agency for being  dominated by developers and for blocking local incorporation drives aimed at  slowing development.  </P> <P> Some observers suggest that Davis may merely be responding to constituent  pressures.  </P> <P> "In Republican suburbs, the no-growth movement is getting stronger than in some  Democratic areas," Lockyer said. "He may . . . just be tuning in to that  growing body of opinion in his area."  </P> <P> But Davis says he always has been concerned with conservation, dating back to  his boyhood, when he dreamed of being a forest ranger, and to his job as a tree  surgeon for the Los Angeles parks department in the mid-1930s.  </P> <P> Davis has also long been an independent thinker -- and equally independent  voter, often to the consternation of his GOP colleagues in Sacramento.  </P> <P> "I'm not a doctrinaire Republican. . . . I try to think out each issue  individually," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'React in Knee-Jerk Fashion'  </P> <P> "The parties tend to react in knee-jerk fashion. The Republicans are the good  old boys who protect the free enterprise system and overlook something like  taking a mountain out, where Democrats can become offended by that."  </P> <P> As an example of his occasional breakaway voting, he favored a 1984 bill  banning job discrimination against homosexuals, which prompted conservatives to  criticize him. Although he is a longtime opponent of abortion, he startled many  last month by announcing that he favors Medi-Cal paying for abortions for poor  women.  </P> <P> "I don't think he has a world view that makes him automatically susceptible" to  arguments in favor of environmentalism, said Joseph T. Edmiston, executive  director of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, which buys land to be set  aside for state parks.  </P> <P> "But he is somebody who will look at the facts as he sees them. He really is a  sucker for a logical argument."  </P></p>

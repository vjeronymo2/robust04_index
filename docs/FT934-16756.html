			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Technology: Machines set for election victory - Automated counting and voting are polling well Michael Howard, the UK home secretary, will soon decide whether machines can be trusted to count votes at local, general and European elections. Barcodes, light pens and optical mark readers could replace humans, if he decides that the technology offers 'real advantage'. Greater speed, convenience and accuracy make machines attractive, but cost will be the biggest factor. To count ballot papers by hand costs about 5p for every registered elector. But a parliamentary Home Affairs committee has found that it is increasingly difficult to staff ballot counts. Thus the committee is expected to recommend vote-counting machines in its report this month to Howard. Three companies with different systems are waiting for the creation of the new market. The push for technology has largely come from American Information Systems, a company whose optical mark readers (OMRs) were used in 30 states at last year's US presidential election. Blind eyes were turned to allow the southern English town of Bognor Regis to use an AIS machine at a local referendum last December. The count, which would have taken 10 people more than two hours by hand, was completed in 33 minutes. The machine has sophisticated techniques for auditing the ballot and eliminates the need for pre-sorting the papers. However, it only reads special ballot cards, the same width as an A4 sheet but 6cm taller. At the count, stacks of cards feed into the machine automatically. Four hundred a minute can be scanned. Ordinary ballot papers can be used on two other systems. Miste Data Services of Redbourn, Hertfordshire, has adapted OMRs commonly used for marking multiple-choice examination papers. Papers are fed in by hand and the machine is linked to a PC loaded with proprietary software to tally votes. Miste shadowed the St Albans local election in May and claims it is significantly faster than manual methods in multi-seat votes. Epping Forest local authority in Essex has designed its own semi-automatic process. At the count, each ballot paper is placed in turn underneath a template which has a different barcode against each candidate. An operator with a light pen swipes the barcode of the selected candidates and software on a standard PC stores the totals. Epping Forest's system was used at parish elections in Theydon Bois in May. It took five people two-and-a-half hours to swipe 15,000 votes. Manually it would have taken 30 people an hour longer. AIS reckons its system will cost about Pounds 10,000 for a constituency and will take six years for costs to be recouped. Miste's package will cost less than Pounds 5,000. Epping Forest only aims to cover its software development costs and charges Pounds 79 for a single site licence or 1.5p for each registered elector. Two local authorities in the West Midlands have bought licences. None of the machines are likely to be cost-effective or quicker in 'first past the post' ballots such as the British general elections. They will come into their own at district and parish elections when many candidates can appear on one ballot paper to contest several vacant seats. The US, Australia and the Netherlands have gone a step further than merely automating the count. Their polling booths have push-button machines for voting. At the Norwegian general election on September 13, Oslo leased OMRs from British company DRS, to test automatic vote counting. They worked well. Meanwhile, Belgium is preparing to use computer screens, light pens and credit cards to automate voting and counting. Trials costing BFr480m (Pounds 9m) will take place at next June's European elections, using modified school computers. If Howard gives the go-ahead for the machines, Parliament will have to amend the Ballot Act of 1872. He may also have to consider whether ballot equipment grants to cover 50 per cent of the costs should be made available.</p>

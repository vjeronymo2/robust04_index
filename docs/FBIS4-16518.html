			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladas Burbulis] </F>   [Text] Vilnius April 15 TASS--A statement of Lithuanian  Sejm opposition leader Vitautas Landsbergis on the Russian  intention to join the Council of Europe and his accusations of  "Moscow that allegedly commands the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry"  was circulated in Strasbourg during a visit of Lithuanian  President Algirdas Brazauskas.    A statement of the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry circulated  here today says such unjustified accusations affect the prestige  of the Lithuanian state.    As for Russian membership in the Council of Europe,  Lithuania  will support it on condition of Russian observation of its  international obligations as regards troops withdrawal from  Latvia and Estonia and respect to sovereignty of the  neighbouring states, human rights and rights of ethnic  minorities.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam fascist  clique issued an emergency order to arrest some ten students  including chairman of the South Korean Federation of General  Student Councils (Hanchongnyon) Kim Hyon-chun and chairman of  the Seoul District Federation of General Student Councils Yi  Chong-u and then, on Tuesday, ordered the police throughout  South Korea to quickly round up more than 90 hardcore leaders of  Hanchongnyon, charging that the National Reunification Committee  and the Policy Committee of Hanchongnyon have clear "tendencies  of benefiting the enemy", according to a Seoul-based radio.    The suppressive offensive against Hanchongnyon is an  anti-national criminal act to destroy the organisation which is  playing the vanguard role in the struggle for independence,  democracy and reunification in South Korea. It has whipped the  students into fury.</p>

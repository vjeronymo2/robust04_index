			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Government Bonds: Russian power struggle dominates European trading EUROPEAN government bond trading was choppy yesterday with the market again dominated by the power struggle in Russia. Dealers reported heavy trading activity by the big investment and hedge funds, which boosted futures turnover and left most cash markets trailing behind. GERMAN bonds had another rollercoaster ride, with the Bund future edging higher in the morning but falling sharply in early afternoon on confused rumours of troop movements in Moscow. The contract slid as low as 98.25, which one trader described as 'a glaring buying opportunity'. Indeed, the price recovered slightly towards the close, ending at 98.42. Trade is expected to remain erratic as long as uncertainty in Russia persists. 'I wouldn't be surprised if some investors decide to leave the German market and go elsewhere, given that we've had a very strong run here,' said a Frankfurt trader. Bunds today are likely to continue being driven by currency movements and Russian rumours, as well as typical Friday position-squaring as traders seek to reduce their exposure ahead of the weekend. Dealers are also looking to the release of the regional September CPI, expected today. The market has discounted a year-on-year rate of around 4.1 per cent, though forecasts range between 3.8 per cent and 4.4 per cent. DUTCH bonds were dragged lower by weakness in the German market. The yield spread was unchanged from Wednesday, with Dutch bonds yielding 20 basis points below bunds. UK GILTS were among the main beneficiaries of the continental markets' weakness and ended nearly  1/2 point higher on the day. The 10-year yield spread over Germany narrowed sharply on large switches from bunds into gilts, with the yield gap between the 8 per cent gilts due 2003 and the 6 1/2 per cent Bunds due 2003 narrowing to around 86 basis points from 106 basis points two days ago. The bulk of trading activity took place in the futures pits, where London traders reported a massive switch by a US hedge fund into gilts out of bunds. Retail activity was thin but the market has remained well supported in recent days. 'With next week's gilt auction and the Russian troubles, there have been enough reasons to sell - but no one did, which augurs well for our market,' said a gilts trader. FRENCH government bonds again tracked bunds, though France outperformed Germany on the day. After yielding seven basis points over bunds early on Wednesday, French 10-year bonds yielded two basis points below bunds at yesterday's close. As expected, the Bank of France did not cut interest rates at its latest open-market operation, but this had limited market impact. ITALIAN government bonds rose in the afternoon on a largely technical rebound from recent weakness. The December BTP contract on Liffe rose half a point to close at 112.86. US Treasury prices posted solid gains at the long end following a weaker than expected weekly jobless claims report. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  15/32 at 102 17/32 , yielding 6.061 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was down  1/32 , yielding 3.908 per cent. After more than a week of declines, Treasuries continued the rally started on Wednesday. The spark that set off the latest round of buying was the release of jobless claims data, which showed the number claiming state unemployment insurance rose 11,000 in the week ended September 18, a much bigger rise than forecast. Prices, however, could not sustain all of their early momentum, and by late afternoon the long bond had dropped back 1/4 point from its session high.</p>

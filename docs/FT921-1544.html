			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Observer: Ebb and flow A Flood would probably strike most people as the last thing likely to be helpful to a troubled property development called Canary Wharf. If so, most people would be wrong. For A Flood - Al to his friends - is the name of the president of the corporate- banking division of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, and few folk will be more involved in the restructuring of Canary Wharf's developers Olympia &amp; York. Besides being one of the O&amp;Y's two main bankers (the other is Citicorp), Canadian Imperial is among the biggest lenders to the beleaguered London docklands property. Those dealing with Flood will find that he doesn't suffer fools gladly. They may also discover that he has other things than O&amp;Y on his mind. Canadian Imperial will soon announce a new chief executive to succeed Donald Fullerton, who is retiring. Flood, aged 56 and with 30 years service, is the front-runner. His main rival is the investment-banking head Paul Cantor. More outgoing and less formal than Flood, Cantor is seen by many onlookers as a potentially stronger leader for Canada's second-biggest financial institution.</p>

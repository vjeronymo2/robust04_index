			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 8 (AFP)--Chinese dissident Xu Wenli  was detained by police Friday, his wife said, in the third such  action against pro-democracy activists in a week.    Xu was picked up by police on Thursday then returned home  around midnight, but was detained again on Friday, the wife,  Kang Tong, said.    Xu, 49, is a former activist in the 1978-79 pro-democracy  movement who was freed last year after 12 years in jail.

This  resolution approved the procedure to determine the ceiling for  presidential campaign spending. The IFE General Council had  appointed three of its magistrates to establish the amount that  would constitute the ceiling for presidential campaign spending.    The Federal Electoral Tribunal, however, decided that this  procedure transfers the IFE General Council's decisionmaking  power to the magistrates. Therefore, the Federal Electoral  Tribunal, as explained by its president Jose Luis de la Peza,  decided that the IFE General Council should issue a new  resolution before 31 January.    [Begin de la Peza recording, in progress] ...by which it can  determine the ceiling for the amount of money parties can spend  on their campaigns for the presidential elections. [end  recording]    In turn, the Federal Electoral Tribunal issued a resolution  that took into account a suit filed against the IFE by the Party  of the Democratic Revolution.</p>

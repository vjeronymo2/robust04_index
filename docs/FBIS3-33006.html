He has just made a tour of the former Yugoslavia and  thinks that this mission was "the most unfruitful" that he has  made to the region. He blamed the Muslims who decided on  Tuesday [15 February] to boycott the meeting between the  commander in chief of the Serbian forces in Bosnia and the  commander in chief of the government army, although this meeting  was described as "crucial" by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force].    This meeting was to make it possible to define the procedure  for the withdrawal operations and the establishment of control  over the heavy weapons, a process deadlocked on Monday by mutual  distrust. The fact that Mr. Silajdzic said he knew nothing of  this meeting to justify the absence of General Delic does not  argue for the Bosnian prime minister's sense of responsibility,  and it is not known what his motives might be. But can anything  else be expected from somebody who had pledged -- even to  President Clinton's special envoy to Sarajevo -- not to exploit  the shelling truce to regain territory, although the UNPROFOR's  observations on the ground proved the contrary. Mr. Silajdzic's  attitude is lamentable; but that of the leader of the Serbian  Forces, who has just stated that Serbian artillery will not pull  back, is no less so. Nothing more is needed to prompt new  tensions at a time when the NATO ultimatum is running out....    In fact, there is nobody in diplomatic circles who wants the  Atlantic alliance to carry out its threats. But everybody knows  that NATO will not hesitate if the conditions it has put forward  are not met. The situation being what it is, there is reason to  fear that there are people in the two camps who do not fear air  strikes at all, and who even imagine that they might serve their  purpose. When you hear Mr. Karadzic stupidly counting on the  collapse of the alliance if it launched air raids, you have to  admit that the disaster met by Saddam Husayn -- who also  believed that he could defy the international community with  impunity -- has not served as a lesson.    All these signs suggest that reason is not triumphing this  week. In this case, there is strong reason to think that the  alliance will have to intervene and thus strike heavily -- with  all the risks of collateral damage which this operation carries  -- to secure the results it is seeking. That would not  necessarily change the face of Europe....</p>

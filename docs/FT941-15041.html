			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Olivetti agrees to cut jobs Olivetti yesterday agreed with trade unions to cut nearly 2,000 jobs as part of a plan to restructure the loss-making Italian computer group, Reuter reports from Rome. The pact included 'solidarity contracts' under which employees work shorter hours and take a cut in wages, making Olivetti the first large Italian industrial group to adopt this measure. Olivetti has about 37,000 employees, down from over 55,000 five years ago.</p>

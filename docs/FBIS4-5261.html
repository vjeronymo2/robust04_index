			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Opening statement at news conference by Prime Minister </F> Morihiro Hosokawa at the prime minister's official residence --  live]    [Text] At a meeting of chairmen of the ruling coalition  parties and at an extraordinary session of the cabinet that were  held just a while ago, I expressed my intention to resign as  prime minister and received their approval. Since I took office  last August, I have expressed my feelings about problems related  to Japan's wartime past, and worked on such major tasks as  political reform, the Uruguay Round, several packages of  measures to stimulate the economy, the relaxation of  regulations, and Japan-U.S. framework talks. I have put into  effect several reforms the government of the Liberal Democratic  Party was unable to carry out. For Japan's future, I worked out  plans for the reform of the current tax system, the reform of  the current pension system, decentralization, and the freedom of  information within 1993, and some of them were successful,  thereby paving the way for carrying out reforms. I feel very  grateful and I would like to express my gratitude to the people  for their understanding and cooperation.    To my regret, I was not able to fully work on the bold  reform  of the current education system and the reform of the current  administration system in order for Japan to prepare itself for a  new era. Japan was unable to play an aggressive part in  disarmament. For example, Japan was unable to play an aggressive  part for promoting the UN registry system for conventional  weapons. There is also the Minamata diseases trial which  remains a symbolic environmental problem. I had intended to  work on them but it is regrettable that I will now be unable to  do so.    Over the past eight months, I have driven myself to work on  tasks at home and abroad, day and night, without taking a rest.  As I said at the outset of this news conference, I have  expressed my resolve to quit as prime minister. In this news  conference I would like to explain why I resolved to step down  as prime minister. The deliberation of the 1994 budget that  directly affects the people's livelihood has remained stalled,  and this situation is truly worrisome. My personal problem --  it does not matter whether it is being used as a tool in a  political strife -- has become an obstacle to promoting Diet  debates. I have to honestly reveal all the facts unearthed so  far to the people.    First, I would like to refer to the problem about my loan  from the Sagawa Kyubin parcel delivery group. As I explained in  documents I submitted to the Diet, I got the loan of 100 million  yen from the group, and I certainly repaid it. But the report I  received from my office last night revealed that under an  agreement reached between my office and the group, the interest  on the loan was treated as political donations from companies  belonging to the group. The report said these political  donations were properly handled in accordance with the Political  Funds Control Law, and those which exceeded the limit set by the  law were reported in a statement of income and expenses.    Regarding the problem concerning the purchase of NTT  [Nippon Telegraph and Telephone] stocks, as I have repeatedly  said, my father-in-law bought them on his own and my former  secretary Miyama was involved in the investment. I heard that  revenues from the sale of the stocks were sent to my  father-in-law through my office account. But I think this is  not basically a problem. I personally made efforts to help  unearth facts about these problems in a bid to dispel suspicion  on me. But, in the process of investigating them, it has become  clear that there is another problem. There is the problem that  for several years since 1981 my office entrusted my personal  funds to a person for investment, thereby deriving profits.  That person is my old friend. He reportedly asked my office to  entrust my personal funds to him for a sound investment. I have  learned that such investment activities might have dubious  legality. I cannot say more about this matter at the present  because the whole affair is still under investigation. Although  the affair took place many years ago, and my office was  responsible, I have concluded that I should take moral  responsibility as a top political leader who always has to be  straight himself. To assume political responsibility for the  facts which have come to light, and for the stalled Diet  business, I have decided to resign as prime minister.    I deeply apologize for resigning at a time when further  political stalemate should be avoided so the government can pass  the budget bill as early as possible, and tackle many domestic  and foreign issues. I earnestly hope my resignation will  somehow contribute to restoring the people's trust in politics.    I have decided to resign for the reasons I have just  explained. The reforms are only half complete. Although I will  be serving in a different capacity, I am determined to continue  upholding the torch of reform. I again apologize to the people  who have supported reform efforts for my having to resign in  such a way. I sincerely ask you to understand my decision.</p>

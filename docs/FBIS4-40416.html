			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Lunch Hour Break" program] </F>   [Text] Sergey Stepashin, director of the Federal  Counterintelligence Service [FSK], who is touring the Far East,  today gave a news conference in Vladivostok. Stepashin gave the  reasons for his Far East tour as: The increased  counterintelligence activities of the Japanese, North Korean,  and Chinese intelligence services in this region of Russia; the  upcoming Federation Council discussions on Russian border  issues; and to get acquainted with working conditions in  regional FSK departments to find out how the Russian president's  edict on combating organized crime and banditry will be  implemented in practice.    According to the FSK director, the Chinese and North Korean  intelligence services are actively recruiting people, and  studying military technology and the drug business in the Far  East territory.    Stepashin also said the document on joint action to  implement  the president's edict on combating organized crime will soon be  signed with the Russian Internal Affairs Ministry. In the FSK  director's opinion, this edict is very tough and even disagrees  with some statutes of Russian law, but it is extremely necessary  given current conditions. The document specifically permits not  only lengthening the period of investigation, but also gives the  right to legalize operational and technical information and hand  it over to the court.</p>

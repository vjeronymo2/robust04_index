			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / International Company News: Sumitomo Chemical falls 32% SUMITOMO Chemical, the Japanese chemical company which belongs to the Sumitomo group, yesterday reported a 32.8 per cent decline in pre-tax profits last year to Y24.5bn (Dollars 193m). Sumitomo said the steep fall in profits resulted from high depreciation costs, increased distribution expenses, as well as a rise in net financial expenses. Sales for the year came to Y701.2bn, a decline of 2.2 per cent. Sales of speciality chemicals, including dyes, agricultural chemicals and advanced materials, grew by 2.2 per cent to Y210bn. Aluminium sales were hit hard by the decline in ingot prices, with sales falling 20 per cent to Y63.7bn. Basic chemicals sales were off by 1 per cent to Y427.5bn. Sumitomo said that, given the sluggishness of the Japanese economy, it was unable to expand sales to offset the increase in costs during the year. Non-operating financial income fell marginally to Y27.3bn, while financial costs rose by Y4.6bn to Y30.4bn. Net income per share declined by 9.7 per cent to Y9.39. The dividend for the year came to Y6 per share, unchanged from 1990.</p>

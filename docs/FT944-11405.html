			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Albania votes on constitution Albanians voted yesterday on their first post-Communist constitution after decades of Stalinist rule, but opponents of the proposed charter said power would again be too heavily concentrated in one person. President Sali Berisha, casting his ballot, proclaimed the vote 'the greatest day in Albania's history'. He has argued the new constitution will help ease the entry of the country into the continent's mainstream. The Referendum Central Commission said results would not be released until tomorrow night, 48 hours after the polls closed. Opponents contend Mr Berisha would have too much power under the new constitution, which would give him the right to appoint judges and control the government agenda. They argue that approving the constitution is parliament's job, but that Mr Berisha opted for a nationwide referendum because he could not get the two-thirds majority needed for passage. Observers from the European Union and the US were in Albania to monitor the vote.</p>

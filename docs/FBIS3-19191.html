			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed JPH/DVA/PLS: "Claes: Cooperation Treaty </F> Between EU and Ukraine Almost Completed"; as released by  Brussels BELGA Database]    [Text] Kiev, 11 Mar (BELGA) -- On Thursday [10 March] and  Friday in Kiev, foreign ministers of the European Troika  [Belgium, Greece, Germany] and the European External Relations  Commissioner Hans van den Broek prepared a cooperation agreement  between the European Union (EU) and Ukraine for signature  possibly on 23 March in Brussels.    A similar agreement between the EU and Russia is being drawn  up but has not been completed. It appears that partnership with  Ukraine will come first.    During the talks with Ukrainian political leaders (Foreign  Minister Anatoliy Zlenko and Chairman of Parliament Ivan  Plyushch on Thursday and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk on  Friday) the Troika made it clear to Ukraine that the EU is  serious about its "Global Approach Strategy." In other words,  technical and economic cooperation is exchanged for  denuclearization and signing of the Non-Proliferation Treaty  [NPT].    Ukraine has started dismantling the 1,800 nuclear heads on  its territory. In exchange for this, the former Soviet republic  will also receive financial support from the United States.  However, cooperation with the EU goes even further than this.    The objective is to continue the denuclearization process in  Ukraine. Should this process come to a halt, then European  cooperation would also stop.    The European ministers in Kiev also insisted on  normalization  of relations with Russia and on compliance with all the  conditions of the IMF and the World Bank -- two institutions  that Ukrainian President Kravchuk visited last week in  Washington.    The relations between Ukraine and Russia are not very good.  In January, Kiev agreed with Moscow on the dismantling of  nuclear warheads in exchange for enriched uranium for Ukrainian  plants. Recently, President Kravchuk indicated that  denuclearization is underway as agreed. He made it clear that  dismantling of nuclear warheads would be conditional on gas  deliveries from Moscow. This month, Moscow suspended its gas  exports to Ukraine.    During a press conference following the negotiations,  Ukrainian Foreign Minister Zlenko told the international press  that when parliamentary activities resume (after the 27 March  elections), the Ukrainian Parliament would ratify the  Nonproliferation Treaty.    EU Commissioner van den Broek indicated that the success of  the cooperation agreement will "largely depend on the success of  the economic reforms in Ukraine. If Ukraine benefits from the  macroeconomic conditions, foreign investors will be convinced."    Belgian Foreign Minister Claes pointed out that the  cooperation agreement provided for import restrictions on, among  other things, Ukrainian steel and aluminium -- there are 70,000  posts at stake in the European steel sector -- as well as an  antidumping clause. "There will be rules for both partners.  Ukraine and Europe will benefit from the treaty. The contract  is not based on full reciprocity: Ukraine has the advantage,"  Claes added.    Claes said that "the priority was to establish a stable  monetary system in Ukraine to enable foreign investments."    On Friday, the Ukrainian president confirmed to the troika  that he expects to gather the requested majority (and the  requested quorum) in Parliament to ratify the Nonproliferation  Treaty, Claes added.</p>

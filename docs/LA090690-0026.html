			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ARSON BLAMED FOR 5-ACRE BRUSH FIRE NEAR I-8  </P> <P> Fire investigators said a 5-acre brush fire near the on-ramp of Interstate 8  near Mission Gorge Road Tuesday was arson and started by a incendiary device  found at the scene.  </P> <P> Investigators would not release any details about what kind of fire-setting  device was used.  </P> <P> "If I tell you, then everybody will dream up the same device," said Detective  John Buono, a fire investigator with the Metro Arson Strike Team.  </P> <P> No homes were damaged in the fire, which firefighters contained in about 90  minutes. Investigators believe the blaze may be related to a slew of other  brush fires that have been set around the city and the county over the past few  years.  </P> <P> "We've had a lot of other fires in the past five or six years adjacent to  freeways," Buono said.  </P> <P> Buono did not have figures on exactly how many fires have been set, referring  to the incidents as the roadside series.  </P> <P> "We feel that they are related to the same person, but it's hard to determine  that," Buono said. No arrests have been made.  </P> <P> The fires are similar in that an incendiary device is usually used, they are  usually set near a freeway and usually in an area where there are homes that  might be threatened, Buono said.  </P> <P> About four years ago, Buono said, there was a fire near I-8 about a block from  where Tuesday's fire was set.  </P> <P> No incendiary device was found at the time, but Buono said that is not uncommon  for arson-set brush fires.  </P> <P> "There could be devices, (we) just couldn't find them," Buono said.  </P></p>

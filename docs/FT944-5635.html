			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / RJB Mining gets pits price cut by Pounds 100m RJB Mining, the coal company bidding for the English mines of British Coal, is expected to tell investors today it has agreed with the government that it will pay nearly Pounds 100m less than the Pounds 914m it originally offered. The company's pathfinder prospectus is understood to show that the 'due diligence' exercise, involving detailed inspection of the regions's assets, has reduced the agreed price to between Pounds 815m and Pounds 820m. The pathfinder, due to be published today, is also expected to disclose that RJB has negotiated to pay only Pounds 700m initially, with the balance to be settled in staged payments over two to three years. As a result of the changes, RJB is seeking to raise about Pounds 900m in debt and equity. It had previously told institutional investors that it would need Pounds 1.05bn. Neither RJB nor the government would yesterday comment on the deal. RJB was unable to confirm the details in the pathfinder. The Pounds 100m reduction in the deal price is less than some of RJB's rival bidders had been expecting. However the Pounds 815m to Pounds 820m final price, if confirmed, will be considerably higher than the next highest offer. Only one other company, English Coal, a management buy-out team led by Mr Bob Siddall, put in a bid for all three regions and it is thought to have offered considerably less than Pounds 600m. Mr Malcolm Edwards's Coal Investments tendered about Pounds 510m for the two central regions where most of the assets are located. RJB's bid has caused considerable controversy, as it was based on projections for future markets which are considerably more optimistic than other bidders believe likely. RJB, floated on the stock exchange only last year, has a market capitalisation of less than Pounds 160m. However, the reduction in the final price is likely to ease its task in raising funds. The company will tell investors it no longer needs to raise Pounds 100m through a corporate bond issue which it and Barclays de Zoete Wedd, its adviser, had planned. The planned bank debt of Pounds 528m is thought to have been reduced to about Pounds 500m. RJB also needs to raise about Pounds 400m through an issue of shares, against a previous Pounds 425m. Today's pathfinder is expected to be followed by a full prospectus in the next two weeks in which the price of the shares on offer will be revealed. BZW is then expected to announce that the deal has been underwritten. Although the share offer will be aimed at institutions, private investors will be offered at least 5 per cent of the equity. The English regions comprise 15 of British Coal's 16 deep mines which remain in operation and 14 opencast sites.</p>

			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANEL ATTACKS STATE PENSION OFFICIALS FOR STOCK LOSSES;  </P> <P> ASSEMBLY: THE $56-BILLION RETIREMENT SYSTEM PUT $400 MILLION IN REAL ESTATE  HOLDINGS. THIS MONTH THE SHARES LOST 75% OF THEIR VALUE.  </P> <P> Officials who run the state's mammoth pension system were strongly criticized  Wednesday for a decision to privately purchase $400 million in real estate  stock that later plummeted 75% in value as soon as the shares were traded  publicly.  </P> <P> The $56-billion retirement system purchased 10.5 million shares in Catellus  Development Corp., a real estate spinoff of the Santa Fe Pacific Railroad, in  November, 1989. At the time, the state agreed to pay $37.79 a share. But this  month, when the stock was publicly traded for the first time, it sold initially  for about $11 a share and then dropped to $9.25 a share -- a paper loss of  about $300 million.  </P> <P> Assemblyman David Elder (D-San Pedro), who chairs a legislative committee that  oversees the state pension plans, said that before funds from the California  Public Employees Retirement System (PERS) were invested in such a venture,  officials should have taken some step to protect their investment from so  sudden a drop in value.  </P> <P> "Why did PERS pay roughly four times the current market rate for its stock? Or  put another way, where did the $300 million go?" Elder asked at a hearing  called to explore the investment.  </P> <P> Those connected with the purchase defended their actions, saying they had every  reason to believe the investment was a good long-term risk. Officials also  maintained that the loss connected with its drop in value would not have any  immediate impact on employees' retirements.  </P> <P> William Ramseyer, executive vice president of JMB Institutional Realty Corp.,  the investment's underwriter, said the sellers would not have agreed to the  kind of protections Elder was suggesting. JMB collected a fee of nearly $8  million for arranging the stock purchase and earns $2.4 million a year from the  retirement fund for managing the investment. Elder called that an  "unprecedented deal."  </P> <P> On Wednesday, officials were called before the Assembly Committee on Public  Employees, Retirement and Social Security to defend the investment which gave  the state a 20% interest in the railroad's real estate arm.  </P> <P> It was the latest in a series of sporadic legislative inquiries into  investments made by one of the world's largest pension funds. PERS represents  more than 600,000 state and local public employees and 270,000 retirees.  </P> <P> While financially sound and generally considered to have earned a good return  on its total investments, the pension system has been criticized in the past  for individual investment decisions, including a $25-million unsecured loan to  now-bankrupt Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., an investment company that  specialized in the sale of junk bonds. The system also held more than $500  million in so-called high-yield bonds that suffered $87 million in paper losses  with the collapse of the junk bond market.  </P> <P> In 1988, the pension system was roundly criticized in a report by the same  Assembly committee for taking unnecessary risks in the stock market. Together,  the State Teachers Retirement System and PERS had 40% of their money in the  stock market at the time of the 1987 stock market crash and lost a combined  total of $7.6 billion. Those losses were later recouped and the fund managers  have since trimmed their stock portfolios.  </P> <P> Elder said he was concerned that the system had made many investment decisions  during a robust economy and had not considered how these investments would  weather an economic downturn.  </P> <P> Stephan Roulac, managing partner of Roulac Consulting Group, a firm hired by  PERS as its real estate adviser, said he had recommended the purchase because  he considered it a "singular opportunity" and an investment that would be  "advantageous to the system."  </P> <P> The Santa Fe real estate and land holdings -- consisting of 2 million acres of  property mostly in California -- had the potential to produce a highly  favorable long-term return, Roulac said. The property, he said, was acquired by  the railroad over many decades and included some parcels in downtown Los  Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco and others in rural and desert areas that  were undeveloped.  </P> <P> Roulac acknowledged that he had anticipated the value of the stock might drop  as much as 30% when it was publicly traded, but he conceded he had not expected  it to dive nearly 75%. Even so, he told the committee, he considered it a good  investment decision. He said the railroad had the capital to "defer  development" and wait out any downturn in the real estate market.  </P></p>

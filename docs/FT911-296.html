			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Moscow moves towards volunteer armed forces THE Soviet Parliament yesterday approved an experiment for 'contract', or volunteer sailors, in a move which is seen as the first tentative step to transforming the vast Soviet armed services from a conscript to a professional force. The Supreme Soviet also approved a cut in naval service from three to two years, bringing it into line with the army. Mr Anatoly Lukyanov, the Supreme Soviet Speaker, said after the result had been declared that 'a professional army is born'. Colonel General Grigory Krivosheyev, deputy chief of staff of the armed forces, told the deputies the experiment, to run from 1991 to 1994, would provide vital information on the possibility of creating a professional army. The experiment will run in four 'large naval units' - possibly the four main Soviet fleets. Under it, seamen and petty officers will all serve an initial six months - after which those wishing to volunteer will serve a further two and a half years, while those wishing to remain as conscripts will serve a further 18 months. The pay of the volunteers is likely to be much higher than the conscripts - ranging from Rbs250 to Rbs400 a month, compared to wages which are as low as Rbs10 a month. Soviet forces are estimated at around 5m strong, with the navy accounting for only about 500,000 of these. The army has so far strongly opposed a move towards a professional service, arguing that it is an indispensable medium of bringing together the diverse nationalities of the Soviet Union, and that it would be too expensive. The Interior Ministry Troops, or MVD, whose numbers have been swollen over the past year as their services were increasingly required to cope with internal strife, are also to discuss introducing professional status.</p>

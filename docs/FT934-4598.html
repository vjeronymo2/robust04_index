			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Illness forces Sony's Morita aside Mr Akio Morita, chairman of Sony, and Japan's best known international business ambassador, has temporarily given up business activities as a result of a brain haemorrhage. Sony announced the move yesterday, two days after Mr Morita, 72, was taken to hospital after collapsing while playing tennis at home. This will have little impact on Sony's day-to-day operations, since he handed over the group presidency - the top executive job - to Mr Norio Ohga four years ago. But it could upset the balance of power at the top of business community at a moment when its influence on government policy is growing. Mr Morita was expected to succeed Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren employers' association and head of a government advisory panel on deregulation, next May. It would take some time for Mr Morita to recover, but there was no indication that he would give up business activities, said Mr Tsunao Hashimoto, vice president of Sony, denying suggestions that Mr Morita had resigned from the Keidanren. Mr Morita, said to have refused the job of foreign minister in the current government, is an advocate of a more internationally open Japan and an outspoken opponent of US criticisms of Japanese trade policies. He is also a tough critic of management weaknesses at Sony's US and European competitors. The heir to a family sake-brewing business in Nagoya, Mr Morita built up Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation after the war, with his partner, the engineer Mr Masaru Ibuka. They later named the group Sony, based on the Latin for sound. Mr Morita is credited with being the marketing force behind Sony innovations from the tape recorder to the Walkman, and providing the inspiration for Sony's move into the entertainment software business, with the acquisitions of CBS Records in 1988 and Columbia Pictures of Hollywood in 1989. Mr Morita also ensured that Sony was the first to move into home video recorders. But it stuck to its Betamax system long after it was clear that the competing VHS system, developed by JVC, had captured the market - often cited as an example of Mr Morita's stubbornness.</p>

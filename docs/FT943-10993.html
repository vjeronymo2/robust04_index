			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Only cloth caps and tiaras Sir, Clement Crisp's otherwise excellent suggestions smack too much of elitism ('The decline and fall of elegance', July 18). May I suggest two simple changes to provide a little more democracy: To balance the evening dress which would be mandatory elsewhere, all those in the amphitheatre would be required to wear boiler suits and cloth caps. As a concession to the elitists, tiaras could be issued to the occupants of boxes. To ensure absolute equity within the selected dress zones, purchasers of tickets would be issued with standard regulated dress appropriate to their zone on arrival at the theatre, the Crush Bar being set aside for changing purposes.

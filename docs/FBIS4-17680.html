			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent tamara zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 25 TASS -- The memorandum on Civic  Peace and Accord was fundamentally amended after Russian  President Boris Yeltsin met with leaders from factions in the  State Duma and with the heads of Russia's regions, presidential  chief-of-staff Sergey Filatov told ITAR-TASS on Monday.    He reported that the ban on proposing constitutional  amendments which could destabilize the situation in society was  removed. The text now states that the signatories agree to  prepare constitutional amendments "on the basis of agreement."    In addition, the working group which prepared the memorandum  removed the thesis about the obligation of bringing regional  constitutions into line with the federal one, after taking into  account the objections of local leaders. "That task will be  resolved outside of the memorandum," Filatov said. Also in  accordance with regional desires, the document calls for the  proper implementation of the law on rehabilitating small  nationalities which were persecuted during Stalinist rule.    The leaders of the agrarian and communist parties were  likewise listened to; the memorandum now states that the  signatories promise to work towards decreasing the income  difference between the wealthy and poor.    ITAR-TASS asked Filatov if he thought the president did the  right thing in canceling his decree depriving the former  deputies which participated in the anti-Yeltsin events of  October 3 and 4 of monetary compensation and housing,  considering that leader of the front of national salvation Ilya  Konstantinov is continuing to call for early presidential  elections. In response, filatov explained that the cancellation  of that decree did not mean those deputies who were  "black-listed" would receive their housing for free. "Let them  buy it at its market price," he said.    The chief-of-staff noted that Yeltsin did not count on the  support of extremist organisations for the memorandum on accord  and did not invite them to sign it. Concerning the refusal of  the leader of the liberal "Yabloko" fraction, Grigory Yavlinsky,  to participate in the agreement process, Filatov commented that  "the voters are hardly likely to support him in that refusal."</p>

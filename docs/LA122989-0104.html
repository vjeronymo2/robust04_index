			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAN AM OBJECTS TO EASTERN'S SALE OF ROUTES  </P> <P> Pan American World Airways said Thursday that it would vigorously fight the  planned sale to American Airlines of Eastern Airlines' routes in Latin America.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Eastern announced that it planned to cut 600 jobs, mostly  managerial, in connection with the proposed transaction. It also announced wage  cuts.  </P> <P> The objection by Pan Am was not surprising given that it is a major competitor  in Latin America of Eastern and American.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for the Justice Department said Thursday that the agency is  looking into the proposed sale on antitrust grounds and will listen to any  third parties who oppose it.  </P> <P> "We strongly object to the further concentration of American's market dominance  in Latin America and the Caribbean through the purchase of government route  authorities and facilities," said Pamela Hanlon, a Pan Am spokeswoman. "With  its already significant operations in the Caribbean and Latin America,  American's purchase of these routes is clearly anti-competitive."  </P> <P> Hanlon said three U.S. carriers currently serve the area -- American, Pan Am  and Eastern. "With the American-Eastern agreement, there will be, in effect,  only two competitors."  </P> <P> Eastern announced on Dec. 19 that it would sell its Latin American routes and a  number of other facilities for $471 million. It needs the funds to operate  while in bankruptcy proceedings and to pay its creditors. The Miami-based  carrier filed for bankruptcy protection in March, five days after it was struck  by its machinists, pilots and flight attendants. It plans to file a  reorganization plan and emerge from bankruptcy proceedings early next year.  </P> <P> Hanlon said Pan Am planned to file its objections with both the Transportation  and Justice departments.  </P> <P> Hal Paris, a Transportation Department spokesman, said neither Pan Am nor  anyone else had yet filed in opposition to the proposed sale. But, he said, if  there were such a filing, "we would make a careful review of the sale of any  international routes to see if it would have any effect on competition."  </P> <P> A Justice spokeswoman said that agency also had not heard anything from Pan Am.  </P> <P> American declined comment on the Pan Am objection.  </P> <P> Eastern also said it would implement employee wage reductions of 20% for six  months and 10% the following six months, mostly for non-union workers. Although  it plans to reduce its 19,000-person work force by 600, it will try to find  positions elsewhere for these people.  </P></p>

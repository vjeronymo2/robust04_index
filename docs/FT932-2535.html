			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tax year change to be reviewed MR STEPHEN DORRELL, financial secretary to the Treasury, said yesterday that he would consider changing the start of the tax year from April 5 to January 1. Mr Barry Field, Tory MP for the Isle of Wight, called the existing tax year 'peculiar', and recommended an amendment in time for the unified budget in November. But Mr Dorrell said: 'You are meddling with a very long-standing piece of history by wanting to bring the tax system onto the same calendar everyone else has lived on since the 1750s. But I will certainly look at it.' The Inland Revenue said last night: 'If (the change) was easy it would have been done a long time ago.'</p>

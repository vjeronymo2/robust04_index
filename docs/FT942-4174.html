			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Danes show support for anti-Europeans Danish anti-European parties attracted some of the strongest support in polling among the four European Union countries where elections were held yesterday for an expanded European parliament. However, according to one poll, the strongly pro-union Liberal party, led by Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the former foreign minister, stood to add one seat to win four of Denmark's 16 seats. Exit polls indicated that Denmark's two anti-European parties, which are not represented in the country's national parliament, increased their share of the vote to about 25 per cent from 18.9 per cent at the last election in 1989. But they were not expected to add to their four seats in the last parliament. The Social Democratic party, which dominates the present government coalition, was expected to lose one of its four seats. Its share of the vote appeared to have fallen to about 15 per cent from 23.3 per cent. Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the prime minister, said it was 'a clearly disappointing result'. The pro-union Centre Democratic party also appeared likely to have lost both its seats, with its share of the vote falling from 7.9 per cent to about 1 per cent. The polls indicated a turnout of 52 per cent in Denmark, up from 46.2 per cent. But turnout appeared to have fallen in the UK and the Netherlands while in Ireland, the fourth country where voting took place, it was estimated at between 40 per cent and 50 per cent of the 2.6m voters. This compared with 48 per cent in 1989. Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister who is a possible successor to Mr Jacques Delors as European Commission president, said he was distressed by the low turnout. The elections appeared to have strengthened the position of the Dutch Christian Democrat party, which emerged as the largest party in the Netherlands, reclaiming the position it lost in national elections last month. Preliminary forecasts reported by Dutch television last night showed that the Christian Democrats stood to win 11 seats in the European parliament, three seats ahead of Labour, which is now the largest party in the national parliament. For the Christian Democrats, the results would mean a gain of one seat in the European parliament, with Labour unchanged. Elections for the expanded 567-seat parliament will take place in the other eight EU countries on Sunday.</p>

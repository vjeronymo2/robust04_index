			<p>Language: <F P=105> Tamil </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] G.G. Kumar Ponnambalam (Junior), the leader of the  All Ceylon Tamil Congress [ACTC], has appealed to the voters in  Eastern Province and Vavuniya District to go to the polling  stations in the morning and to cast invalid ballots. In a  statement he says:    For various reasons, the ACTC does not welcome the scheduled  local elections in the north and the east. The northeastern  region is still a war zone. Many voters have deserted their  homes and are living as refugees outside the Northern and  Eastern Provinces. The list of voters is incomplete as a  result. Proclaiming themselves members of parties and  independent groups, the pro-government Tamil groups are still  living in those areas. They have been harassing innocent Tamil  citizens. All of these factors will impede the holding of free  and fair elections.    The ACTC strongly believes that the government's stubborn  insistence on holding elections in spite of all these objections  does not reflect its good intentions to establish a  representative government. This is an insidious attempt to tell  the world that the situation has become normal and that peace  has returned to the north and east, in order to hold a  referendum there.    Every Tamil citizen knows that the situation in the  northeast  is not conducive to elections. Therefore, if any Tamil citizen  extends any assistance toward this venture, he should be  considered an accessory to the government conspiracy.    For these reasons, the ACTC has decided not to be a party to  the disinformation campaign. We appeal to the Tamil people in  the north and east to go to the polling stations early in the  morning to present their indignation, protests, and objections.  We make this appeal in order to prevent the impersonation of  genuine Tamil voters and the creation of a wrong impression for  the rest of the world.    The ACTC strongly condemns any Tamil party that makes an  appeal for support of candidates favoring the merger of the  north and east, as that would be contrary to the goal of  opposing the elections. Besides, such a move would also justify  a referendum on the merger of the north and east.</p>

Furthermore, the Legal Expert System is proprietary to MSTC; therefore, participants may not provide third parties with access to the Legal Expert System without MSTC's prior written approval. The new schedule of charges will be effective January 1, 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The text of the proposed rule change is as follows with additions italicized and with deletions bracketed: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

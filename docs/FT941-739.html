			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Outward investment falls UK companies invested Pounds 8.7bn in overseas subsidiary and associated companies in 1992 - slightly less than in 1991 - the most up-to-date figures on overseas direct investment show. The Netherlands, with Pounds 1.5bn, was the top location for UK investment abroad in 1992, the Central Statistical Office reported yesterday. The European Union accounted for 49 per cent of UK outward investment, up 8 per cent from the previous year. North America took 14 per cent, half the value in 1991. The biggest rise in investment was in the rest of the world - mainly developing countries - where it rose 19 per cent to account for 35 per cent. The CSO said the position of the Netherlands as the most popular destination was overstated because many UK companies channelled overseas investment through holding companies in the Netherlands. Next in the rankings were the US with Pounds 1.3bn and Australia with Pounds 1bn. Direct investment into the UK in 1992 amounted to Pounds 9.2bn, an increase of Pounds 0.8bn on the previous year, but still a significant reduction on the figures for 1989 and 1990. North America accounted for 41 per cent of inward investment, a 16 per cent rise. The EU's share of investment fell 16 per cent to 38 per cent.</p>

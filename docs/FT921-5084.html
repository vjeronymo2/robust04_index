			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / International Company News: Anheuser seeks stake in rival ANHEUSER-BUSCH of the US, the world's biggest brewer, which produces the international Budweiser beer brand, is seeking a 30 per cent stake in the rival Budweiser Budvar brewery in Czechoslovakia. Mr Jerry Ritter, Anheuser's chief financial officer, said yesterday the company had told the Czech government it wanted to end its long-running trademark battle with Budvar and to co-operate in developing the Budweiser brands. Anheuser would help Budvar to expand its capacity - at present only 300,000 barrels a year against Anheuser's 86m barrels - and to market its beer internationally. Mr Ritter claimed Anheuser was the 'preferred bidder' among 42 brewers which were trying to acquire a holding in Budvar when it is privatised. The US brewer has given assurances it would maintain the independence of the Czech company and its management, the quality of the beer and the integrity of the brand. Mr Ritter said: 'The heritage of the Czech beer is very important to the expansion of the brand in eastern and central Europe and beyond. It is quite different from the US Budweiser and we believe the two can be developed successfully side by side.' The bid for a Budvar stake marks the first step in what is likely to become a more acquisitive approach by Anheuser to its international expansion. While its priority for the next few years is to increase its 44.1 per cent of the US market to more than 50 per cent, it wants to acquire good quality brewers and beer brands worldwide. Anheuser sells 2.5m hectolitres of beer - less than 3 per cent of total annual production - outside the US. It is brewed under licence in Japan, its main overseas market, Canada, the UK, Ireland, Denmark and South Korea; and it is exported from the US to 40 other countries. Growth in the UK and mainland Europe has been relatively slow. It has taken the UK operations, accounting for 80 per cent of European volume and in which Anheuser has recently taken direct control of marketing and distribution, seven years to become profitable.</p>

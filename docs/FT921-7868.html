			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (1): Brakes on in the car park - Many companies consider the cycle of purchase, operation and disposal of car fleets to be an obvious area for cutbacks and savings. John Griffiths investigates the severe effect on the motor industry, as operators review their policies on replacement of vehicles and contemplate the alternative of giving employees cash AS RECESSION has tightened its grip in the UK and other leading European countries, so the business sector has looked with growing urgency for ways of cutting costs. Not without reason, attention has been drawn ever more closely to the company car park. For whereas the operation of vans, trucks and other commercial vehicles is an unglamorous business in which cost control is paramount, the large 'perk' proportion in company cars, the perceived status and other emotive issues involved in their provision, and - not least - their use as a magnet to attract key recruits, served to thrust cost from the top of the list of concerns almost throughout the 1980s. But with UK unemployment again creeping towards 3m, the property and other large economic sectors showing scant signs of life, and thousands of companies struggling simply for survival, the 1980s-style preoccupations appear increasingly frivolous. And, as a result of successive UK Budgets, they have also become considerably more expensive to indulge. Last year the Chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, hit the motor industry and business car users alike with what both regard as his now-infamous 'triple whammy': A further increase in tax scale charges payable by employees; A hike to 17.5 per cent in VAT, which, unlike any other business good, companies cannot reclaim on car purchases; and The imposition for the first time of National Insurance Contributions, payable by the company, on employees' private benefit of their cars. One effect was to bring to almost tenfold the increase, during the past decade, in the taxable benefit to the employee of his company car. The typical operator of a 1.5 litre car under four years old in 1982-83 paid tax on an assessed benefit of Pounds 360: in the current year the assessed benefit is Pounds 3,250. For most employees, that remains a very good deal - paying tax at 25 per cent, his newish company car will have cost him or her around Pounds 800 in the current tax year, far below the cost of buying and running the same car privately. The additional cost to employers, however, is much more substantial. Thus, a steady stream of surveys - the latest by the UK's Monks Partnership consultancy group in mid-February - has shown a majority of companies identifying the cycle of buying, operating and disposing of their car fleets to be one of the most obvious areas for cutbacks and savings. To the dismay of car makers, importers and dealers, one of the easiest decisions has been to postpone replacement of cars, which, for most companies in easier times, had taken place in two- or three-year cycles. Instead, as shown by the Monks Partnership survey of 202 UK companies operating a combined fleet of 115,000 cars, nearly one quarter are requiring cars to cover more than 70,000 miles before replacement - up from 8 per cent in 1991 - and 31 per cent are keeping cars more than three years (up from 19 per cent). Some 120 of the companies, surveyed between December of last year and the end of January, were shown to be contemplating change to their company car policies this year. Of these, a relative handful - 12 per cent - were contemplating measures which could increase costs while 85 per cent were looking for savings. No less significantly, for the first time several surveys have identified considerable interest by companies in opting out of the hassles of providing and administering company car fleets altogether, usually by offering a cash alternative. The complexity of the calculations involved in determining the extent to which such a course might save corporate cash has provided a field day for accountants. It has also resulted in a flood of often contradictory data from various vested interest groups, such as the specialist contract hire, leasing and fleet management companies which make their living from convincing vehicle operators that they can do a better job than 'in-house'. There is something approaching consensus, however, that probably between one half and two-thirds of company cars are still tax advantageous for companies, although the situation could change, should Mr Lamont decide significant changes in the taxation and other treatment of vehicles and fuel in his forthcoming Budget on March 10. It is likely, however, that a good many more companies would have already taken the plunge into offering cash alternatives, were it not for a number of unresolved VAT and personal taxation pitfalls of which they are deeply fearful. Their fears are well founded. And the irony is not lost on them that it is legislation from a government which committed itself to eradicating the company car 'perk' which is helping to retain it. Much the biggest problem relates to VAT. The courts are testing the decision of Customs and Excise to demand VAT where 'cash for cars' schemes are offered, even if most employees decide to keep their cars instead. To illustrate: if a company offered its 500 employees Pounds 4,000 a year as a cash alternative, and only 10 took up the offer, Customs and Excise would demand from the company VAT on the supply of the retained 490 cars, representing an additional bill for the company of more than Pounds 250,000. Such uncertainties, when combined with those hanging over Mr Lamont's Budget intentions, help explain the continuing sharp fall-off in UK new car sales over the past year which has so severely affected vehicle makers and importers. From a record 2.3m sales in 1989, the market plunged to just 1.59m last year. Commercial vehicle sales have suffered even more, and are now running at little more than half the levels of two years ago. In the past few weeks, the industry has been tossed at least one crumb of comfort - publication of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report into car pricing in the UK, and the related question whether the system of sales through exclusively-franchised dealers (in theory at least) has played a role in keeping prices higher than necessary. In spite of the MMC's conclusion that there was a complex monopoly in the supply of new cars, it found also that this did not necessarily work to consumers' disadvantage. To the chagrin of consumer groups, it accepted both that UK prices were not, overall, disproportionately high in comparison with Continental markets, and that franchised networks were needed properly to care for such complex products with strong safety implications. Its conclusions will be assessed closely by the industry and business vehicle operators in Continental countries, for it is likely considerably to influence the European Commission's own deliberations on pricing after the advent of the single market next year and on whether the present exemption from normal EC competition rules (which allows the franchised car trade to exist) should continue after its scheduled expiry in 1995. The MMC report does, however, propose greater freedom for dealers to compete more intensively with each other. It also is critical of exceptionally large fleet deals, involving very large discounts and concluded directly between vehicle maker and operator. These, it argues, require subsidies from smaller business and private buyers in the form of higher list prices. It is possible that the bringing of such issues into the open, combined with a growing hope that Mr Lamont's Budget next month may reduce the tax burden on cars, may at last persuade fleet buyers back into the market.</p>

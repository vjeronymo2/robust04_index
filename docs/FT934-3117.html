			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Salvation Army wins Pounds 2.21m action The Salvation Army yesterday won a civil action for Dollars 3.3m (Pounds 2.21m) against Mr Stuart Ford, a businessman accused of being at the centre of an alleged Pounds 6.2m fraud against the charity. A High Court judge ruled that Mr Ford, of Bromsgrove, west Midlands, had no defence. He also found against Mr Ford's company, Tilen Securities, of Acocks Green, Birmingham, on the basis it had not filed a defence. Mr Ford, who was not in court, was accused at an earlier hearing of 'salting away' up to Pounds 170,000 of Salvation Army money. He has denied the allegations. The Salvation Army is pursuing claims against 13 other defendants.</p>

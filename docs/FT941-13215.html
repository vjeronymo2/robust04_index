			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Survey of Mobile Computing (6): The paper dilemma - Portable Printers The computer industry has always fought a marketing battle against its own complicated products. If you want to sell a personal computer, you have to persuade the customer that he is buying a smart but simple tool. The mere suggestion of programming or wiring up connections to printers and other peripherals is still enough to deter many users. The portable computer had to establish a foothold in the face of profound scepticism. Bulky initial models in the mid-1980s demanded more muscle than technological knowhow. The portable has grown up since then, acquired a new identity as the notebook and become truly convenient. But the question of hard copy remains. Do users want or need the extra weight and size of an integral printer? How important is it to get the data off the screen and onto paper when you are away from the office? Canon has made the running with small lightweight printers. Apple sells this range under its own badge. Canon's BN22 notebook computer was launched last July and has sold over 2,000 copies so far. Prices range from Pounds 1,899 to Pounds 2,449, and whatever the specification, a printer is built into the machine. Mr Graham Salmons, Canon project manager, reckons the integral printer is essential, but only for a specific category of user. 'These are the genuinely mobile users, people who always use the notebook on its battery.' An insurance salesman's customer may need a policy on the spot, not through the post. Drivers with haulage companies have to print out a receipt after dropping off a few thousand gallons of petrol. The BN22 is approximately the size of a telephone book, with a keyboard that lifts to allow paper to be slotted through and printed over. The BJ10 is a similar A4-sized device, but is a dedicated printer. 'It's designed to be a portable printer. You can run it off the battery, but only 15 per cent of users do that,' says Mr Salmons. Canon has sold 500,000 of the Pounds 299 BJ10s since October 1991. So the stand-alone printer definitely has the edge in portable computing. Hewlett-Packard has an established track record in printers and has ventured into very small notebook computers with the Omnibook. But the company has no plans to merge both areas of expertise. 'The main priority in designing a notebook is size. If you want a printer you can buy it as a separate product,' says Ms Joanne Talfourd-Cook, PC product manager. The Deskjet is a portable printer from Hewlett-Packard; ithas the dimensions of a tissue-box and costs Pounds 230. The Omnibook retails for Pounds 999 and Ms Talfourd-Cook is confident it can do the job without a built-in printer. 'To be honest, we don't appeal to people who want to print on the go.' The Deskjet is designed to appeal to customers whom Hewlett-Packard characterises as the 'carry and park' brigade. Professionals such as auditors will move their printer from site to site, and need something light and portable. But they still set up shop in one location, running off the mains. Compaq claims 20 per cent of the UK's 230,000 annual sales of notebook computers. But none of its portables embody a printer and the company no longer manufactures printers. Mr Lewis Schrock, product manager, is happy for his notebook customers to decide what quality of print they want and then go to Canon or other companies with a pedigree in the field. 'Our strength is PC technology, Canon's is printers. So a built-in printer is a logical development for Canon products.' The mobile printing option extends beyond a choice of hardware. Many portables now include a fax card. So faxing from a hotel room to the house fax machine is a practical and popular way to pick up hard copy. And software has come up with some clever answers. On The Road (OTR) is a program marketed in the UK by Middlesex-based Teleadapt and aimed at the mobile Apple Powerbook user who wants to exploit the heavy-duty print option available in the office. The Powerbook user installs OTR for Pounds 80 and the machine recognises when it is no longer connected to a printer, but stores the print command until the physical connection is made. The document is printed out automatically whenever the Powerbook is plugged in at one of several preset locations. Apple is quite content with shortcuts that evade the portable printer dilemma. 'If you go for an integral printer you have to take something out. Our research indicates people don't want that,' says Ms Kate Cruickshank, Apple notebook product manager. Its remote access facility allows the Apple user to log on to the office network and printers from a distance. The user plugs the Powerbook into a phone jack and sends the document to a server at his home base. This checks his password and then treats the mobile terminal as part of the local network. Apple regards this as more practical than travelling with a printer. 'I know of very few people who need to print out on the road,' Ms Cruickshank adds. The significance of portable printers is dictated entirely by the way individuals do business. Mr Salmons of Canon declares that his portable printer is a commercial success because 'the one thing that business still relies on is paper'. At merchant bankers SG Warburg, powerful Sparcbook portables help demonstrate cross-border leasing proposals to customers. Mr Tim Stone, a Warburg director, is not interested in lugging a printer around, no matter how light. 'Paper is rarely needed at the point where we use the machine, and you can always generate a fax with this equipment. It's so rare that I need paper, I try to avoid it altogether.' Just as notebook computers fill a niche, so portable printing is a matter of taste.</p>

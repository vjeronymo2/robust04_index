			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Boost for hopes of upturn as house sales show rise of 40%: Caution urged over optimistic reports by some estate agents FURTHER evidence of an upturn in the UK housing market came yesterday as estate agencies owned by leading building societies reported increases of up to 40 per cent in house sales in the first quarter of the year, reinforcing hopes of a brighter economic outlook. The rises, compared with the same period last year, were announced on the day one of the main bodies in the estate agency industry reported a 36.4 per cent increase in the number of contracts exchanged in March compared with February. Mr John Wriglesworth, housing market analyst at UBS, warned against talking up the market. 'We are seeing a return to 1992 levels of activity before the reintroduction of stamp duty and no one thought that 1992 was wonderful for the market,' he said. A further caution against over optimism at signs of 'green shoots' in the economy was signalled yesterday by the engineering industry which said the fragile recovery in UK engineering output was being threatened by deepening recession in vital European export markets. Mr Peter Constable, chairman of the Ombudsman for Corporate Estate Agents, an industry-appointed body, said confidence was strengthening in the housing market. The organisation said the contract exchanges reported by its members in March totalled 35,285, a 36.4 per cent increase on February, compared with a low last year of 19,027 in September. The March figure represented a more modest 12.5 per cent increase on March 1992, when the exchanges reported were 31,351. Some of the largest building societies also reported increased sales by their estate agencies. Mr Alan McLintock, chairman of the Woolwich building society, the fourth largest lender, said yesterday that its estate agency arm, Woolwich Property Services, had reported an increase in sales of 40 per cent in the first quarter of the year compared with the same period last year. 'There are concrete signs of the long awaited revival in the housing market,' said Mr McLintock at the society's annual general meeting in London. Alliance &amp; Leicester Property Services said it had seen a year-on-year increase of 38 per cent in sales, while Nationwide Estate Agents reported a 33 per cent increase in sales in the first quarter of the year compared with last year. Abbey National's Cornerstone estate agency reported a 20 per cent first quarter increase in sales compared with last year. Mr John St. Lawrence, chairman of Crest Nicholson, the Surrey-based housebuilder, was also optimistic at the company's annual general meeting yesterday. He said visitor levels across the company's sites and open market reservations since mid-February were above the same period in 1992. But Halifax Property Services, the estate agency arm of the largest lender, said it had seen a rise of 7 per cent in year-on-year sales. This was in line with OCEA figures for gross monthly sales - offers accepted - which were up 7 per cent last year compared with March 1992.

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / World Trade News: UK wins Moscow phones deal GPT, the UK-based telecommunications equipment maker, has been awarded a Pounds 50m contract to modernise Moscow's telephone network. It is the largest individual overseas order for System X, the GPT-designed exchange which is at the heart of British Telecommunications' UK network, according to Mr Piers Cumberledge, GPT sales director with responsibility for the former Soviet Union. He said GPT would install System X exchanges and up to 170,000 digital subscriber lines over two years starting immediately. The company, owned by GEC of the UK and Siemens of Germany, would also supply and install fibre optic equipment, smart card payphones and videoconferencing equipment. GPT's contract is with Comstar, a private Moscow company formed in 1989 by GPT and the Moscow Telephone Network which already offers customers in Moscow international, national and local telephone services. Mr Cumberledge said contract negotiations had been lengthy; the company had held back from announcing the deal until financing was in place. Loan finance, denominated in dollars, will come from Midland Bank backed by the UK Export Credit Guarantee Department. The Russian state had agreed an inter-government credit to repay the loan in hard currency, the first time such a mechanism had been used in Russia with a private company as beneficiary.</p>

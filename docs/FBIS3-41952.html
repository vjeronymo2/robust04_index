			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Some Problems With the `Space </F> Alliance'"]    [Text] All is not entirely well with the transatlantic  alliance between Space Systems/Loral, Aerospatiale, Alcatel  Espace, Alenia Spazio and Deutsche Aerospace. There appears to  be some big divisions amongst the members who are grouped  together to develop and market satellites.    -- Deutsche Aerospace (Prime contractor), Aerospatiale and  Alenia Spazio are partners in Argentina for the Nahuel system;  Alcatel Espace decided not to participate in this venture.  Space Systems/Loral did not show a much interest in Nahuel  either.    -- Alenia Spazio, instead of using and promoting the  Spacebus  platform for the ESA [European Space Agency] Artemis and DRS  [Data Relay System] spacecraft, will develop a new bus with the  financial support of the Italian government.    -- Deutsche Aerospace (MBB, at Munich) is forming a  German-Chinese venture to develop applications satellites for  China; the other partners of the "Space Alliance" are not  involved in this industrial agreement.    -- Aerospatiale is cooperating with Matra Marconi Space in a  joint proposal for the second generation of Meteosat weather  satellites; there are some serious discussions between the  public sector Aerospatiale and private Matra Marconi Space to  upgrade industrial cooperation in the field of space systems.</p>

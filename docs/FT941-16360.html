			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Ageing culvert takes the strain In spite of a respite from heavy rain yesterday the county town of Chichester in West Sussex was last night bracing itself for the possibility that its historic centre could be awash with floodwater by the weekend. The River Lavant, a normally placid waterway which has not misbehaved for at least 100 years, is threatening to burst into the High Street. Ms Teresa Cash, spokesperson of the National Rivers Authority for the southern region, said: 'There has been seven inches of rain since New Year's Eve. Normally there is five inches of rain in the whole of January.' There are two main threats. The Lavant has already burst its banks twice since New Year's Eve, flooding the eastern end of the city of 20,000 people. Twelve families have been evacuated, and although shops have not closed they are all protected by sandbags. The Sainsbury's supermarket has become an island and several petrol stations are under water. The A27 to Brighton has been closed and the road south to Bognor Regis is virtually impassable. But the more significant and immediate threat is to the city centre. The Lavant river divides at a point called The Hornet in the east of the city and goes through a culvert under the city centre. Much of this culvert was built 100 years ago and is under great stress. Ms Jane Gale, emergency planning officer for the county council, said last night: 'There doesn't seem to be any danger at the moment. A lot depends on what the fire brigade and the army manage to do. However, no one knows what the culvert can stand.' The river level fell yesterday, but the city is bracing itself for downpours forecast towards the end of the week. In addition to the main new pipeline that is carrying 2m gallons of water daily away from the culvert to the sea, a further five pipes carry floodwater into drainage ditches around the city. A dam made of sandbags is being constructed on the east of the Lavant to contain the flooding in the area of the city around The Hornet. A further channel made of sandbags is under discussion which could carry a further 2m gallons a day from the Hornet, down Market Road and then back into the river. The council says it cannot estimate the cost of the work and the damage at this point. In the area of greatest flooding the peak flow of the Lavant has been about 30m gallons a day. It has subsided to between 12m and 15m gallons a day.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Spanish courts yesterday sent to the Uruguayan  courts a rogatory letter so that the detained Basques might be  interrogated on incidents linked to the cases that prompted  their extradition petitions.    The Spanish courts' petition has prompted a new controversy  at the judicial branch level, as the interrogatories must  include all Basque citizens who are allegedly ETA [Basque  Homeland and Liberty] members, whether or not their extradition  has been approved.    One of the cases included in the petition was approved, and  this elicited a reaction from the defense attorneys of those  involved.    Attorney Gustavo Puig has filed remedies of appeal and  appeals for annulment. The legal issue now will therefore have  to be resolved by the Court of Criminal Appeals.</p>

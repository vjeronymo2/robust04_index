			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Acquisition helps Gibbs Mew to near doubled profits GIBBS MEW, the family-controlled brewer and commercial property group, which last year fought off a hostile bid from Brierley Investments, yesterday reported a near-doubling of annual profits. On group turnover of Pounds 28.7m (Pounds 20.1m) pre-tax profits for the 53 weeks to April 3 advanced from Pounds 633,000 to Pounds 1.23m. The outcome was buoyed by a six month contribution from UK D which accounted for turnover of Pounds 7m and operating profits of Pounds 471,000. The core brewing, wholesaling and retailing side lifted operating profits by 11 per cent to Pounds 2.16m although bad trade loan and debt provisions amounting to Pounds 262,000 were taken as an exceptional charge. Mr Peter Gibbs, chairman, said that sales of Deacon, the group's new cask beer, were 'most encouraging'. The trading environment for both tenanted and managed houses, however, remained 'testing'. As stated at the interim stage, costs of Pounds 129,000 relating to the bid defence were taken below the line, leaving attributable profits of Pounds 948,000 (Pounds 657,000). Brierley Investments, which first acquired a holding in the company in 1987, has since disposed of its 19 per cent stake to a number of institutions. Fully diluted earnings per share emerged at 16.74p (11.87p) and a recommended final dividend of 4.5p lifts the total to 7.5p (6.75p). The shares, traded on the USM, rose 13p to 263p.</p>

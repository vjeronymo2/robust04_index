These figures were cited by Wang Zukang, director of the  Shanghai Foreign Economic and Trade Commission.    Shanghai's exports to Japan were worth 1.62 billion U.S.  dollars (35 percent up on the previous year), while its imports  from Japan reached 1.17 billion U.S. dollars, 82 percent up.    By the end of 1993, Japanese investment projects in Shanghai  numbered 637, with a total contracted investment volume of 1.19  billion U.S. dollars, or 9.2 percent of all foreign investment  projects in Shanghai, with a contracted investment percentage of  8.7.    Among those projects, 100 are solely foreign-funded with a  contracted investment of 352 million U.S. dollars; 444 are joint  ventures, with contracted investments of 673 million U.S.  dollars.    Wang believed that the economic and trade cooperation  between  Shanghai and Japan has a bright future.    He said that Shanghai will develop new areas more actively  for using foreign funds and learn from Japanese businesses.    Shanghai is also to seek new forms of foreign trade under  the  system of the socialist market economy, including the  possibility of setting up joint foreign trade ventures, he said.</p>

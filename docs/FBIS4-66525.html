This  controversial question is currently being asked in Western  intelligence and political circles. Defacto inquiries are being  made of al-Nahdah's exiled leadership in Paris and London  concerning this subject.    Informed Tunisian sources confirm that Tunisian parties  purchased arms from merchants in several European capitals,  particularly in Brussels and Paris, and that these parties  presented themselves as or intimated their affiliation with the  outlawed "al-Nahdah Islamic movement" in Tunisia. The arms were  bought in small quantities and were directed to a third party.    However, al-Nahdah's leadershiip firmly denies that they  purchased arms for the purpose of smuggling them into Tunisia  and asserted that their movement is political and would never  resort to violence under any circumstances.    One al-Nahdah member who asked that his name be withheld  said  that the Sudan expelled a group of Tunisians who adopted the  policy of "al-jihad," and said that the expulsion took place at  the request of al-Nahdah, which does not want to bear the  responsibility for such a trend.    The same source indicates that the operation to smuggle arms  from Tunisia to the Kabylie region of Algeria is for the purpose  of arming the groups supporting the extremist Berber leader Said  Saadi, leader of the Rally for Culture and Democracy. Two weeks  ago in the French newspaper LE FIGARO, Saadi called for arming  the opposition to the Islamists and forming militias to confront  the supporters of the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front].    These statements caused an uproar in Algeria; commenting  from  abroad, Rabih Kebir, president of the FIS executive council,  characterized Saadi's remarks as "an open invitation to civil  war."    The al-Nahdah leadership confirmed that the source of these  weapons was not the Tunisian army's arsenal, rather that they  were purchased abroad with the knowledge of the security  agencies in Tunisia in order to achieve two goals: "Firstly, to  preoccupy Algeria with a civil war when the FIS takes power and  [secondly,] to implicate al-Nahdah with the charge of purchasing  the arms." However, Tunisian official sources are insisting that  al-Nahdah is purchasing arms to use them in terrorist operations  inside Tunisia.</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Japan's Economic Boost: Sharp rise against dollar in Europe trading THE YEN rose sharply against the dollar in European trading yesterday, as currency dealers took the view that the Japanese economic package would do little to reduce Tokyo's trade surplus. Officials in Washington are keen to see a reduction in Japan's exports to the US and, for most of this year, have adopted a policy of benign neglect as the dollar has depreciated against the Japanese currency. By allowing the yen to rise, the US has helped hold back Japanese exports. Four weeks ago, the US Federal Reserve signalled a dramatic change in the Clinton administration's stance on the dollar/yen exchange rate. The US central bank halted the yen's appreciation (it was up by a fifth since the start of the year) by intervening in foreign exchange markets and selling the Japanese currency. Since then, dealers have been led to believe Tokyo would introduce a strong stimulus to the economy this week that would suck in imports. But although the headline figure for yesterday's boost was larger than expected, currency analysts were disappointed by the absence of tax cuts and a reduction in the official discount rate. After trading at around Y106.50 before the measures were introduced, the yen appreciated sharply, broke through the Y105 barrier and was trading at around Y104.55 last night. Several analysts suggested the yen could have advanced considerably closer to the Y100 level, had it not been for fears that the Federal Reserve might again intervene. 'It would be fair to say that Y100 is on the cards now,' said Mr Steve Hannah, chief economist at IBJ International in London.</p>

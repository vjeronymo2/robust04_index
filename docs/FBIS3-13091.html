			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Tawfiq 'Abid] </F>   [Excerpt] Palestinian sources in Amman have denied having  any knowledge about attempts in the occupied Palestinian  territories to collect a million Palestinian signatures for a  petition asking President Yasir 'Arafat to withdraw from the  negotiations with Israel and to resume the armed struggle to  liberate the occupied territories.    The sources told AL-DUSTUR that Fatah and the Palestinian  Democratic Party have adopted a common stand that is being  enhanced and which affirms that the resumption of the  negotiations requires suspending settlement activities, finding  the appropriate monitoring means, divesting the settlers of  their weapons, expediting the discussion of the issue of  settlements, and dismantling settlements that are direct hotbeds  of tension.

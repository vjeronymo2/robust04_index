			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU beef stocks 'to fall further' European beef exports are expected to drop by over a fifth this year from last, with another sharp decline in beef stocks to their lowest level in five years, according to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Gatt's latest annual report on international meat markets says this should lead to firmer world beef prices and increased export opportunities for other producers, especially those of South America. The EU was the biggest exporter last year, accounting for more than a quarter of the total, but is expected to slip into second place behind Australia in 1994. By the end of 1993, European Union beef stocks had shrunk to 600,000 tonnes from 1.09m a year earlier, and they are forecast to drop to 360,000 tonnes by the end of 1994. EU beef production, which fell 5 per cent last year, is expected to stagnate or rise only marginally in 1994, with a bigger increase predicted for 1995. World beef and veal production declined by about 1 per cent in 1993 and may rise by the same amount this year, Gatt says. Most central and eastern European countries and the Commonwealth of Independent States have reduced cattle herds because of rising production costs and falling domestic demand, and further falls are likely this year. However, outside Europe, herd numbers are rising. World beef and veal consumption also fell last year, reflecting lower demand in Europe and North America. However, consumption rose in several Asian markets including Japan and South Korea which have recently liberalised beef imports. World beef exports shrank by more than 4 per cent in 1993.

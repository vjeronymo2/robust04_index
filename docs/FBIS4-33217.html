			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Helena Tachinardi] </F>   [Text] Brazil has presided and will preside over many  diplomatic meetings this year. Among them are the OAS general  assembly in Belem in June, the Mercosur [Common Market of the  South] member countries conference to define its institutions  during the second half of the year, the Rio Group presidential  summit in October, and the meeting of South Atlantic countries.  The events that occurred earlier this year include Mercosur and  Rio Group meetings with EU foreign ministers; the visit of  Douglas Hurd, British secretary of state for foreign and  commonwealth affairs, and other British secretaries; and the  visit of U.S. Vice President Al Gore and other U.S. officials.  All this reveals the increasing involvement of Brazil in the  world economy and the current global and regional  characteristics of trade.    Last week Brazilian diplomacy achieved a very important  objective: Its proposal to create a South American free trade  zone (SAFTA) was accepted in principle by Brazil's Mercosur  partners (Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay).    Events like this, and the recent opening of a general  consulate in Nagoya, Japan, to assist the "deka-seguis" -- some  200,000 Brazilian citizens of Japanese descent who emigrated to  Japan seeking jobs -- shows that Brazilian diplomacy is seeking  to involve Brazil in the international economy and to change its  profile from a country receiving immigrants to a country  exporting workers.    Brazilian foreign policy has been becoming more pragmatic  and  integrating more with the private universe of the economy. The  Foreign Ministry recently organized two entrepreneurial missions  -- one to Asia and South Africa and one to Mozambique.  Brazilian ambassadors before the GATT and the Latin American  Integration Association (ALADI) increased their involvement with  entrepreneurs, informing them of the evolution of global and  regional trade negotiations. Foreign Minister Celso Amorim has  kept legislators fully briefed on Brazilian commitments with its  partners.     -  Nuclear Policy: The Foreign Ministry persuaded Congress to  approve all its agreements on nuclear policy during this  semester. The only item still pending is a draft bill on  controls on exports of sensitive materials and technologies, an  essential step prior to Brazil joining the missile technology  control regime (MTCR).     Contrary to what was done by Mexico -- which withdrew this  year from the Group of 77 (formed by 126 developing countries)  after accepting a preferential option in North America through  its participation in NAFTA with the United States and Canada --  Brazil is not considering withdrawing from any association.     -  International Order: Ronaldo Sardenberg, Brazilian  ambassador to the United Nations recalls: "Participants have  increased in the area of international order. We have the Group  of 77, the Latin American and Caribbean group (33 countries, all  of which participate in UN organizations), Mercosur, the South  Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone, the Group of 15 (most  important developing countries), the Portuguese-speaking  community of countries, just to mention some." He added: "From  the diplomatic point of view, it is necessary to participate in  all of these groups because they provide the bases for positions  and give us better negotiating conditions."     The ambassador observed that the Group of 77 "is a factor  of international negotiation for Brazil. The reform of the  Global Environmental Facility (GEF) -- a global environment fund  -- is being negotiated between the Group of 77 and developing  countries. There is also an electoral aspect to all this:  Brazil was elected to participate in different organs." He  added: "Brazil does not have a Greta Garbo complex. We do not  want to be alone. Our international style is that of a moderate  country trying to find solutions to different problems. We have  been on the UN Security Council more often than any other  country (as a nonpermanent member).     -  UN Security Council: Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, who  recently met with his French, British, and German counterparts,  usually tells his guests that "Brazilian credentials are either  perceived immediately or never." The country is campaigning  unostentatiously for a permanent seat on the UN Security  Council, a decision that could be made next year during the  organization's 50th anniversary. Amorim notes: "We share  borders with 10 countries. We have a large population, a large  territory, and a presence in the international arena that is  unsurpassed by any developing country. We help international  organizations reach agreements. We have not been to war with  any of our neighbors in the past 120 years. We have a history  of peace that is matched by very few countries." He added: "If  Brazil becomes a member of the UN Security Council it will be on  its own merit, not to represent Latin America."    -  Drug  Trafficking: Brazil will participate in UN international  peace-keeping forces as it did in Suez (Gaza Strip) and in the  Congo. Sardenberg believes Brazil will send a battalion, an  organized force, to countries like Mozambique. In the military  field, the idea that the Armed Forces should not participate in  drug enforcement actions seems to have been  consolidated.    -  Africa: Brazilian diplomats hail their position  regarding South Africa. Two years ago Itamaraty upgraded the  Brazilian presence in South Africa by sending an ambassador.  Brazil thus anticipated the end of the "apartheid" and  currently has good business perspectives with Nelson Mandela's  government. Amorim recently asked Finance Minister Rubens  Ricupero for $20 million to finance Brazilian company projects  in Mozambique, the economic situation of which Itamaraty expects  to improve with the democratization of South Africa.    -  Eastern  Europe: Brazil has been less aggressive in this region. The  Brazilian foreign minister said: "They are more active than us.  We must react to this," adding, "I would like to send a  business mission to Central Europe. Trade relations with those  countries must be reestablished." Amorim said he will send the  Itamaraty secretary general to Moscow at the end of the year  because the situation in Russia "is stabilizing and this will  open up trade opportunities." The Foreign Ministry is planning  to open an embassy in Kiev (Ukraine) still during Itamar's  administration. Franco has already authorized the new embassy,  the only outstanding matter is the decree to create  it.    -  Mercosur: Brazil is actively helping to intensify trade  relations between Mercosur and the EU. Celso Amorim has said  relations with France are intensifying. "I was the first Latin  American personality to address the French Senate," said the  minister who was also the first Brazilian Foreign Minister to  visit the reunified Germany.</p>

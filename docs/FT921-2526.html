			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Building a cheaper roof over one's head: Proposals for new ways to finance low-cost rented housing It is widely accepted that the UK is in urgent need of more 'affordable' housing for rent - an additional 100,000 such homes must be built each year, according to some estimates. Housing associations could play a leading role in meeting the demand for low-cost rented housing, but they are finding it hard to attract enough private sector capital. New approaches may be required if housing need is to be met. Housing associations already receive substantial government grants to build houses for rent. This year they will get Pounds 1.7bn, but they will need another Pounds 500m of private sector capital to meet their housing targets. In addition, they will require as much as another Pounds 2bn a year to finance the acquisition of council homes - transfer to housing association ownership is at the centre of the government's drive to improve the lot of council tenants. So far, associations have managed to raise sufficient funds from the private sector. The Housing Corporation, the quango which regulates registered housing associations, says Pounds 2.6bn has been raised over the past four years, from 82 lenders. However, associations are finding it harder to raise the finance they need. One reason is fragmentation: only a handful of the associations are large enough to borrow directly in the capital markets. Most rely on finance provided by local bank or building society branches, usually at higher rates. But the number of lenders prepared to lend to housing associations has declined. The National Federation of Housing Associations (NFHA) says fewer than a dozen banks and building societies are willing to lend regularly to associations - and each limits the amount it will lend. In recent transfers of housing from local authorities, there have been only four active lenders: National Westminster Bank, Halifax Building Society, Bank of Scotland and Nationwide Building Society. Other lenders which backed earlier transfers such as Banque Paribas, the French bank, have pulled back from the market. One organisation which could help is The Housing Finance Corporation (THFC), a limited company set up by the Housing Corporation and the NFHA to raise money for housing associations from bond market investors, such as insurance companies and pension funds. So far it has found Pounds 250m, using single bond issues to raise funds for several housing associations at cheaper rates than they could get on their own. But THFC has no capital base to absorb bond holders' losses if an association goes under. Without this cushion, investors are mostly unwilling to lend to associations. A study by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, a non-charitable trust which investigates social issues, proposes an intermediary with its own capital base, similar to 3i, the development capital firm, or the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation. It suggests that an intermediary with Pounds 50m of capital could raise about Pounds 500m from the bond market. The Department of the Environment has commissioned a report from Hambros, the City merchant bank, on whether such an institution is necessary and feasible. The Labour party is also attracted to this approach; it is committed to introducing a National Housing Bank which would perform much the same function. The government might, however, be unwilling to find the start-up capital, fearing that the new body will be seen as backed by government guarantee. Borrowing by a government-backed body would, under current accounting rules, inflate the public sector borrowing requirement. Capital could come from the banks, through a stake in the new intermediary like that in 3i. Yet the banks are unlikely to be willing to invest in such a project in the recession - they are already planning to realise their investment in 3i by floating it on the stock exchange later this year, to concentrate on core business. An alternative to a capitalised intermediary would be new instruments to allow housing associations to approach the bond markets directly. The simplest would be a system of 'credit enhancement' where, in return for a premium, specialised insurance companies would guarantee bond issues against default, offering investors additional security. The Rowntree report rejects credit enhancement because the cost would be too high. But some housing associations are already considering credit-enhanced bond issues to raise the large amounts needed to finance the acquisition of local authority housing. Broomleigh Housing Association, for example, is considering a credit-enhanced bond issue if it cannot get bank finance for the Pounds 150m needed to purchase council housing from Bromley council in Kent. Finally, if new organisations or instruments are rejected, housing associations might find it easier to raise the finance they need if their borrowing requirements could be reduced. At present, when council homes are transferred to housing associations, the associations pay an average of Pounds 8,000 for each property under a Treasury pricing formula. If the properties were transferred at a price which reflected the outstanding debt on them, the unit cost would be reduced to less than Pounds 5,500, according to the Institute of Housing. This would reduce the amount housing associations have to borrow, permitting less complex loans of shorter maturity and almost certainly increasing the number of potential lenders. Attractive as it may seem, however, such a change would need to be handled with political sensitivity if it were not to appear that the government was selling off council houses on the cheap.</p>

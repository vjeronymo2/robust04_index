			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by </F> Karmit Gay and political correspondent Shlomo Raz; place not  given -- live]    [Text] [Gay] Can you tell us this morning that the  security issue has been resolved to our complete satisfaction?    [Rabin] First of all, one must remember that when talking  about the negotiations with the Palestinians and with the PLO on  the implementation of the Declaration of Principles [DOP] signed  in Washington, we are dealing with the creation of a very  complex situation. An attempt to bring about peaceful  coexistence between two entities which still harbor some  remnants of suspicion and hatred for each other. These two  entities are jumbled together geographically with tens of  thousands of cars crossing from one entity to the other every  day.    Therefore, the situation we wish to create is very complex  and we must first and foremost guarantee the security issues. I  think that we have taken an important step forward toward  implementing the first stage of the DOP, and I am referring to  Gaza-Jericho First. What was achieved overall? First of all,  the issue of external security has been guaranteed. The IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] will be deployed and will remain in  control of all the external lines: the line separating Judaea,  Samaria and Jordan along the Jordan River, and the international  border between Egypt and Israel.    The border crossings and the terminals near the Allenby  Bridge and Rafah will be situated in an area under IDF control.  Anyone familiar with the Allenby Bridge terminal knows that it  is made up of IDF outposts which are situated several dozen or  hundreds of meters from each other. The border crossings  themselves feature security arrangements stipulated in the DOP  calling for joint cooperation and a Palestinian presence. There  will be two sections at the crossing: one for Israelis and  foreign nationals and a second wing for Palestinians. There  will also be adequate control measures to prevent the entrance  of terrorists, the smuggling of weapons, or the flooding of the  territories by large numbers of Palestinians.    [Gay] What do you mean by adequate control measures?    [Rabin] Adequate control measures means that things will not  be like today, when everything is under our control. The Oslo  agreement, later signed in Washington, calls for cooperation  between the two parties.    [Gay] Will we be able to completely prevent the entry of  undesirable elements?    [Rabin] Even today, we cannot prevent this with complete  certainty. This will continue to be the case in the future;  however, I believe that we have arranged for adequate control.  Second, we mapped out settlement zones in the Gaza Strip: the  Qatif Bloc and the Erez, Nisanit, and Eley Sinay blocs. Along  the borders of the Gaza Strip and in areas abutting the  settlements, there will be zones in which Israel will oversee  security but, of course, the Palestinian authority will be  responsible for the civilian affairs of the Palestinians living  there.    [Gay] Are you talking exclusively about the civilian aspect?    [Rabin] Yes, only about the civilian aspect although there  is a possibility of conducting joint security patrols. However,  the overriding [last word in English] responsibility for  security is Israel's.    [Raz] Mr. Rabin, when all is said and done, will the Jewish  residents of these areas enjoy more security or be less safe?    [Rabin] In the event of full cooperation with the  Palestinians, with them exercising strict control over their  side, then security will be guaranteed in the Jewish settlements  and along the three major roads used by the Jewish residents.  One should bear in mind that some of the roads are used by far  more Palestinians than Israelis.    [Raz] What are the chances of achieving a high level of  cooperation and security?    [Rabin] Look, if the agreement is not bolstered by  cooperation from the Palestinian residents, the Palestinian  authority, and the Palestinian police, then there may of course  be problems. However, the agreement is founded on the  assumption of cooperation. The moment there is no cooperation,  the future of the entire agreement is in doubt.    [Raz] When will implementation begin in the field?    [Rabin] Look, what was signed in Cairo is a very important  step toward completing the agreement. Palestinian and Israeli  teams will still have to meet in Paris, to deal with all the  economic issues, and in Taba to discuss the details and  technique for implementing the principles signed yesterday in  Cairo. In my assessment, it will take at least another month to  complete all the details of the agreement and formulate a  completed document. I hope that we will finish this within a  month but it could take a little more time. One must remember  that we do not have any sacred dates. In the attempt to create  peaceful coexistence in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, we must  first try to predetermine all possible points of friction, which  are very numerous, and attempt to find solutions for them, at  least in principle. We must formulate all this in writing  before we can start implementing the agreement.    [Raz] In other words, there will be no prisoner release or  operative Palestinian police until the end of the month required  for drafting all the details?    [Rabin] No part of the agreement will be implemented before  it is fully consolidated, comprehensive, and final.    [Gay] With your permission, I would like to return to the  issue of cooperation. In the event of problems, what actions  will Israel be able to take in order to guarantee its security?    [Rabin] In any agreement, one does not discuss what will  happen if it is not implemented. Each signatory to an  agreement, and especially so in this case, has ways to safeguard  itself; however, the intention of both parties to fulfill the  agreement must be sincere and stem from a desire to achieve what  was agreed upon in the best possible way in order to really give  a chance... [pauses] and despite the dangers, I believe there is  such a chance, and the chances outweigh the risks.    [Gay] Can you confirm that all the security elements and the  IDF were involved in drafting the agreement and gave their  approval and support for it?    [Rabin] Each party always seeks to achieve more and has to  make compromises during negotiations. For example, the map we  signed on to is a map that was already presented in Taba.    [Raz] Mr. Rabin, why did you leave the issue of Jericho for  an as yet unscheduled meeting between yourself and PLO Chairman  Yasir 'Arafat?    [Rabin] Look, first of all we signed on to a map which  includes the Jericho area. At the time, and with my approval,  Peres told 'Arafat, who had raised several demands, to drop the  matter for the time being and to eventually decide the issue in  a meeting with me. I accepted this idea. I have made  absolutely no commitment whatsoever other than agreeing to  discuss the matter.    [Raz] Is there any chance of Israel giving the Palestinians  more than the 55 kilometers in the Jericho area previously  reported?    [Rabin] I did not measure the exact number of kilometers,  but the issue remains open without any Israeli commitment to  accept the Palestinian demands.    [Gay] This agreement is valid for one year after which a  joint Palestinian-Israeli committee will be able to review it.  What does this mean?    [Rabin] No. The agreement is final. What we said was that  after one year there will be a possibility to review [last two  words in English] and reexamine the agreement. Generally, after  a year one has accumulated some experience; however, I am  convinced that the agreement will be judged on the basis of  whether or not it has achieved its goals -- and I believe it  will -- far before the end of the first year.    [Raz] How does the present stage of the agreement with the  Palestinians influence the other negotiating tracks? For  example, does it have any effect on the talks with Syria?    [Rabin] I think that the very fact of signing the DOP with  the Palestinians, first in Oslo and then in Washington, was  extremely important. Instead of negotiating with four partners  without knowing what kind of linkage they would create between  themselves, we changed the situation, negotiated with one Arab  partner, the Palestinians, represented by the PLO, and reached  an agreement which stands on its own. The Madrid conference  imposed the same limitations as an international conference.  The advantage we achieved by this comprehensive move with the  Palestinians -- aside from the fact that we had to resolve the  feud between the Palestinians and the Israelis, the longest  chapter in the Arab- Israeli conflict -- is that we created a  reality of separate negotiations with each Arab partner for a  peace agreement which stands on its own.    [Gay] Thank you very much, Prime Minister Rabin.</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Interest rate manoeuvres lift Paris and Amsterdam INTEREST rate cuts lifted Paris and Amsterdam yesterday and, coming towards the close in Belgium, they are expected to do the same for Brussels today, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS got its ninth interest rate cut since mid-April and the CAC-40 index rose 18.88 to 1,929.17. In spite of some caution ahead of annual meetings due this week, dealers felt that most bad company news was already in share prices. Volume was FFr2.94bn. Elf Aquitaine rose FFr10.50, or 2.8 per cent to FFr385.40 after losses last week. Peugeot, with a shareholders' meeting coming up this week, was also among the biggest winners with a gain of 2.5 per cent as it rose FFr13 to FFr530. Other big wins included Credit Local de France, up FFr9 to FFr416. Rhone Poulenc A shares fell, by a token FFr1 to FFr537, although the company said that it would sell its 35 per cent stake in Roussel Uclaf, its associated pharmaceutical company, for about FFr4.5bn. Roussel itself was suspended at FFr575. AMSTERDAM picked up as the day progressed in response to lower interest rates and the firm dollar and the CBS Tendency index added 0.9 to 110.1. A 10-basis point cut to 6.90 per cent in the Dutch special advances rate came as little surpise to the market but was seen as opening the way for a broader easing of official bank lending rates. Royal Dutch hit a 12-month closing high of Fl 175.90, up 20 cents, as early US demand triggered more widespread buying. Currency considerations helped Unilever Fl 3 higher to Fl 201.50 and Philips by 50 cents to Fl 28.10. FRANKFURT ended the official session only slightly higher, the DAX index closing 2.92 higher at 1,689.82 but, said Mr Eckhard Frahm at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, it put on another 8 points in the post bourse. The post bourse saw the publication of a German M3 growth figure of 6.7 per cent for May after a revised 7 per cent for April. Analysts felt that the figure, at least, was moving in the right direction. However, there were other features on the day. The strength of the dollar brought improvement to the cyclicals, BMW and Volkswagen rising DM6 to DM495, and DM5.40 to DM348 in carmakers and BASF by DM2.60 to DM237.80 in chemicals. In Bonn, the economics minister Mr Gunter Rexrodt, said that Germany's corporate tax structure could be reformed without a reduction in tax write-off allowances, opening the way for a compromise on the government's tax reform plans. In Munich, Mr Edmund Stoiber, the new premier of Bavaria, said that he wants to push through the privatisation of state holdings, including that in the 58 per cent owned energy group Bayernwerk, as soon as possible. Viag, linked with Bayernwerk through cross-shareholdings, rose DM2.50 to DM362.50. MILAN continued in volatile mood, again taking its lead from renewed falls for Ferruzzi and Montedison. The Comit index shed 2.27 to 525.70, but Ferruzzi fell L60.40 or 9 per cent to L601.0 and Montedison dipped L45 to fix at L894, before L865 after hours. Investors reacted sceptically to the appointments of Mr Guido Rossi as chairman of the two companies, and Mr Enrico Bondi as chief executive. There was also a view that the recovery in their share prices at the end of last week had been overdone. The renewed weakness spilled over into creditor banks. Credito Italiano fell L101 or 3.7 per cent to L2,597; BCI lost L174 or 3.3 per cent to L4,965. The re-emergence of market rumours that Fiat planned an international alliance or major asset sale took the shares L212 ahead to fix at a day's high of L6,190 before they eased back to L6,100 on the kerb. ZURICH took advantage of the strong dollar and shares ended at an all-time high. The SMI index rose 11.5 to 2,329.5. Nestle reversed early small losses to add SFr7 to SFr1,130 while Roche certificates rose SFr85 to SFr4,900. VIENNA's ATX index rose 9.1 to 848.09 in heavy trading, driven higher by strong gains in Creditanstalt preferred on rumours that the bank would publish improved first half results. Creditanstalt preferred gained Sch25 to Sch594, and were quoted higher still in the post-bourse. ISTANBUL closed at its eighth record high this month as the market index soared 679.6 or 6.5 per cent to 11,140.4. The continued optimism followed expectations that talks between the True Path Party and the Social Democrat Populist Party to establish a new coalition government could soon be finalised. The market also welcomed weekend press reports that the prime minister-designate, Mrs Tansu Ciller, would insist on strict enforcement of economic measures, including rapid privatisation, to revitalise the economy.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- June 21                                             THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes           Open      10.30     11.00     12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1183.76   1185.59   1187.32   1190.16 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1239.35   1241.73   1242.21   1245.53  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           13.00     14.00     15.00     Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1190.87   1191.36   1193.29   1193.31 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1247.89   1247.23   1248.45   1250.44  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Jun 18    Jun 17    Jun 16    Jun 15    June 14  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1186.72   1182.69   1181.17   1173.17   1181.59 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1242.58   1238.06   1236.97   1229.86   1234.83  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1193.92 ; 200 -  1251.07 Low/day: 100 -  1183.76  200 -  1239.28 .  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

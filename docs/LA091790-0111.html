Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> BULGARIANS IN ANTI-REGIME RALLY  </P> <P> Tens of thousands of Bulgarian opposition supporters massed in the city center  today to demand the resignation of the government of former Communists.  </P> <P> Protesters waving blue flags of the main opposition Union of Democratic Forces  chanted anti-Communist slogans and blamed the former Communist Party, now  renamed the Socialist Party, for what they called national catastrophe.  </P> <P> "Communists, take your hands off political and economic power in Bulgaria," UDF  parliamentarian Alexander Yordanov said in front of a crowd estimated by  witnesses at more than 30,000.  </P> <P> The rally in front of the main Orthodox cathedral was the first organized by  the UDF since the Socialist Party won an absolute majority last June in  Bulgaria's first free elections after 44 years of Communist rule.  </P></p>

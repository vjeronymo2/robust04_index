F-15 fighter bombers, FA-18 pursuit-assault planes and P-3  anti-submarine planes from the bases in Japan and U.S. Pacific  region were deployed in the U.S. airforce bases in South Korea  after a long-distance flight.    On the same day, C-5 extra large strategic transport planes  which load several tanks and armoured vehicles continuously flew  in the U.S. airforce bases in South Korea from the overseas  bases and the airlifted aggressive forces and murderous  equipment were posted in operational zones.    Earlier, on March 26, C-5, C-141 and C-130 transport planes  flew in South Korea from the U.S. overseas bases.    All the facts show that the U.S. imperialists' preparations  for a war of aggression are reaching an extreme phase.</p>

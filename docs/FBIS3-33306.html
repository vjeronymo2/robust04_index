			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The New Democratic Party [NDP] in St. Vincent and  the Grenadines was returned to power in general elections held  yesterday. As we heard this dispatch from (Andrea Braffitt),  unlike the last general elections, the NDP did not secure all  15, but this time 12 seats.    [Begin recording] [James Mitchell] What was begun here in  North Leeward has continued and will continue, and this time and  at other times, they will never stop this New Democratic Party.    [(Braffitt)] And this was precisely the case when the ruling  New Democratic Party, with party leader James Mitchell, was  reelected for a third consecutive term in St. Vincent and the  Grenadines. An estimated 6 to 7 percent of the 72,000 persons  eligible to vote turned out in Monday's general elections.    Last-lap campaign on Sunday was marked by violence. This  time  around, the NDP did not repeat the landslide victory as the  opposition St. Vincent and the Grenadines Labor Party Movement  for National Unity Alliance gained three of the 15 seats being  contested. Successful opposition candidates are newcomer (Louie  Streker) who won the Central Leeward seat from the NDP candidate  Herbert Young.    [(Streker)] Our young people walk up and down and go to the  politician's office and they make fools of them by telling them  come back next week, come back the following week, and finally  slip out of the back door.    [(Braffitt)] Vincent Beache, leader of the Alliance and  former head of the SVLP in South Windward:    [Beache] And we know how enthusiastic you are and are you  just waiting for the next 17 days or so to pass that you are  gone have a new argument facer. All the newspapers says the sun  is setting and certainly, come the 24th, that would be end of  the sun because it would be eclipsed.    [(Braffitt)] And MNU leader, Dr. Ralph Gonsalves, in North  Central Windward:    [Gonsalves] Joshua build and [name indistinct] build.  Mitchell ain't build. For ten years today, know what Mitchell  say, not last year but just the one before, he say his  government is not in power to build houses for poor people. He  say you want build house, you must go bank and borrow money.  [applause]    [(Braffitt)] The Caribbean News Agency reports that some  observers believe that the three seats won by the opposition  party are a message to the NDP that there is some  dissatisfaction with how it had run the affairs of the country.    [Mitchell] It was NDP before and it will be NDP, it will be  NDP [repeats], it will be NDP [repeats].    [(Braffitt)] The NDP is at the helm once again. [end  recording]</p>

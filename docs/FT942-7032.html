			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / BBC TV in Hong Kong deal BBC World Service Television will return next month to Hong Kong on a limited basis. The BBC last month lost its ability to reach the region after the corporation agreed to take its channel off the Star Television satellite system, now controlled by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. The move was part of a deal to extend its time broadcasting to the Indian subcontinent. Wharf Cable, Hong Kong's cable network, is to carry four hours a day of BBC World Service Television news and information programming, with six hours daily at the weekend. Earlier this week the BBC announced that its news and information channel would be available in New Zealand early next year on a new network of regional stations. Programmes will also be carried on the TVNZ national channel, TV1. Talks aimed at averting further strikes on BBC television and radio were adjourned last night and will resume today. A strike planned for today over performance pay and hours was called off because of the talks.</p>

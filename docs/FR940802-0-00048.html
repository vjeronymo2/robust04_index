			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA also received comments indicating that the Northern and Southern California markets are truly distinct and that the burden on refiners to account for gasoline they market in the Los Angeles and San Diego area would not be great. One commenter stated that EPA may be able to make a rebuttable presumption that all gasoline produced in the Los Angeles and San Diego areas or imported into those areas is reformulated gasoline for the purpose of the renewable oxygenate mandate. However, this commenter also stated that refiners should be able to rebut the presumption with respect to gasoline exported out of the Los Angeles and San Diego area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consideration of the comments received, and as discussed above, EPA has decided to impose the renewable oxygenate requirement only for gasoline used in the Los Angeles and San Diego areas. EPA believes that it is possible to have an effective renewable oxygenate program for the two Federal reformulated gasoline program areas, and recognizes that its authority under section 211(k)(1) is limited to reformulated gasoline areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA received comments from a California state agency which recommended a change in the proposed implementation date of January 1, 1995 to coincide with the March 1, 1996 refinery production deadline for California reformulated gasoline. Combined with this was a request to phase in the proposal over a 22 month period as follows: 10% on March 1, 1996, 20 percent on January 1, 1997, and 30% on January 1, 1998. EPA does not believe that a three year phase-in or delay is necessary and has received no compelling evidence that California refiners would be particularly disadvantaged with respect to lead time. EPA has included a phase-in schedule in today's rule for all covered areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Various comments related to California's air quality outside of the Federal VOC-controlled gasoline season are discussed elsewhere in this preamble. One commenter suggested that, since California has been allowed to develop its own reformulated gasoline regulations ``it might make sense'' to let California decide which renewable oxygenates qualify for the renewable oxygenate requirement and when they qualify. The commenter felt that California officials might conclude, after modeling air quality effects, to allow ethanol even during the summer months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA responds that California is subject to the reformulated gasoline requirements of &sect;211(k) of the Clean Air Act, although an exemption from certain recordkeeping and enforcement requirements has been granted for purposes of the California program. To ensure that the objectives of the renewable oxygenate program are met, EPA believes that it is important that the Federal reformulated gasoline areas located within the State of California to be subject to this program. EPA has a strong interest in consistent application of the renewable oxygenate requirements across all reformulated gasoline areas and does not believe that it is appropriate for state officials to decide which oxygenates satisfy the Federal requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA received other comments specifically related to application of the renewable oxygenate rule to California. A few commenters felt that California should be exempt from the renewable oxygenate requirement as an outgrowth of California's exemption from most reformulated gasoline enforcement mechanisms. EPA does not agree. Although refiners of California gasoline have been exempted from many enforcement requirements, they are not exempt from the requirement that their gasoline meet Federal reformulated gasoline standards. Likewise, EPA believes that Federal reformulated gasoline in California should be subject to the renewable oxygenate standard, with appropriate exemption from certain enforcement procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments received from a California state agency indicated that oversight should rest with the California Air Resources Board (CARB). EPA responds that there is currently no state mandate to correspond to the renewable oxygenate mandate contained in these regulations, thus, this appears to be a moot issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Shoulder Season  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA received some comments from parties concerned that the renewable oxygenate requirement might lead to exceedances of the ozone standard during the ``shoulder season'' (i.e. the time period immediately before and after the Federal VOC control season) due to increased use of ethanol. These comments, and EPA's response, i.e., a petition process which would allow the Governor of any state affected by the reformulated gasoline program to request an extension of the non-commingling season beyond the VOC control season, are addressed elsewhere in section III.G of this preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure that the state shoulder season petitions are implemented effectively, &sect;80.83(i) creates a category of RBOB, called ``non VOC controlled renewable ether only'' which may be blended with ETBE or another oxygenate that does not exhibit commingling effects when blended with other gasolines. If a Governor's petition for an extended non-commingling season is granted, terminals will be required to keep ``non VOC controlled renewable ether only'' RBOB on hand for blending with appropriate oxygenates during the extended non-commingling season.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Other Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters asserted that EPA should allow temporary ``good faith exemptions'' to refiners that make a showing that complying with this proposal would ``result in extraordinary economic hardship.'' The reformulated gasoline rule contains an exemption for ``inability to produce conforming gasoline in extraordinary circumstances.'' See &sect;80.73 of the reformulated gasoline regulations. This exemption does cover extreme and unusual circumstances outside of the control of the refiner and would encompass such circumstances as ``Acts of God'' or natural disasters. EPA recognizes that this exemption may apply to the renewable oxygenate mandate. EPA does not believe that an additional exemption for purely economic reasons is appropriate, particularly given that the renewable oxygenate mandate is a year 'round credit program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Federal Preemption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program is based on section 211(k) of the CAA. The provisions for the prohibition of state and local controls under section 211(c)(4) therefore do not apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

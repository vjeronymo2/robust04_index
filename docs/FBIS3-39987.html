			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] What will France's policy on defense be for the  next 20 years? There is a white paper out which reveals this, a  kind of geostrategic manual containing some 150 pages, drafted  by a commission chaired by Marceau Long. Edouard Balladur and  his defense minister, Francois Leotard, presented it to the  National Assembly and Senate defense commissions today before  revealing its content to the media. Jean-Michel Blier:    [Blier] It is a document made necessary by developments in  the geostrategic context: the fall of the Berlin Wall and the  splitting apart of the Warsaw Pact profoundly changed the nature  of the threats. At the same time the upsurge of nationalism in  several countries has brought about the appearance of conflicts  of a new kind, and the former Yugoslavia is an example of this.  What response, what means, what alliances should be implemented  in view of this new situation? This is the subject of this  white paper, which, compelled by the requirements of  cohabitation, has been the subject of lengthy discussions with  the Elysee [presidential office]. The document which was  presented this afternoon should not affect the consensus, except  on one point, the suspension of nuclear testing, which Francois  Mitterrand has made a question of principle, and which is being  maintained.    Francois Leotard said clearly this evening that he,  personally, was in favor of resuming testing, while at the same  time acknowledging that for the immediate future the credibility  of our deterrent was not in any way thrown into doubt. [passage  omitted] This is Jean-Michel Blier at the Senate for France  Inter.    [Announcer] Jean-Michel Blier has just been talking to us  about it. Let's now listen to Francois Leotard on this subject  of whether or not to resume nuclear testing:    [Begin Leotard recording] For 30 or so years now France has  implemented with great persistence a nuclear policy which means  that today it is the only, or nearly the only, one in Europe to  possess a nuclear force which is produced by itself, produced  for itself, and produced according to its own needs. It would  be a pity to abandon a 30-year effort, and thus in order to  ensure that this force responds to the requirements of the  future, in other words the beginning of the third millenium, its  suitability must be strengthened. At this time this force is in  no way, and I repeat in no way, threatened by the moratorium on  nuclear testing, I stress in no way affected. It is completely  effective, it is completely credible, it is completely  appropriate, and for a long time to come. [end recording]</p>

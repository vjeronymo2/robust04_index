			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Gerard van Nifterik: "European Consortium </F> Expands Back to Feedstock Process"]    [Text] DSM [Dutch State Mines], together with four large  European concerns, including BP Chemicals, has set up a  consortium for chemical recycling. The five companies are to  expand a so-called "back to feedstock" process, involving a  method developed by BP Chemicals, in which plastic waste  mixtures are broken down into oleaginous products. A pilot  plant at Grangemouth, Scotland, is already in operation.    The plant in Grangemouth has a capacity of 100 kilograms per  hour, and around ten million Dutch guilders have been put into  the project. In addition to BP and DSM, the participants are  the petrochemical concerns Elf-Atochem, Petrofina and Enichem.  DSM primarily conducts research into the products resulting  from the process. The company has a small naphtha cracker for  that purpose.    Interest in "back to feedstock" methods (or chemical  recycling) has increased enormously in the last few years. One  important reason is that recycling of different synthetic  mixtures produces quite some problems. Such mixtures can almost  only be recycled into lean materials which usually end up as  flower pots or roadside poles. The market for such products is  small and is nearly saturated. A not yet socially acceptable  alternative for materials recycling is the recovery of its  energy content by combustion.  <H5>  Smaller Pieces </H5>   "Back to feedstock" (or chemical recycling) is a third  option. The aim of the technique involved is to disintegrate the  polymer material into smaller pieces, in some cases even back to  the original chemical ingredients. "Back to feedstock" methods  are currently being researched all over the world.    The process which BP and DSM are examining turns the plastic  waste into an oleaginous product, from which low hydrocarbons  can be produced through petrochemical techniques. It produces a  wax-like product which can be used as a starting material for  naphtha crackers.    The base material for the BP/DSM process is waste synthetics  from household garbage. Before the process can begin, the  plastic fragments must be separated from the rest of the  household waste. The isolated plastic fragments are then ground  into pieces of two centimeter. This granulate is the base  material for the cracking process that comes next.    The disintegration, in which the original long polymer  chains  are broken into pieces, takes place in an fluidized bed  incinerator, which is partially filled with sand. When a  current of hot air is blown in, the actual fluidized bed comes  into being. The waste plastic is thermally crushed at a  temperature of between 400 and 600 degrees Celsius, and produces  a steam mixture of hydrocarbons. Ninety percent of these gases  finally condense into a low molecule wax. The remaining 10  percent are used as fuel which meets the energy requirements of  the installation. The remains of additives in the original  plastic -- such as fillings and pigments -- are left behind in  the sand. Hydrochloric acids resulting from the crushing of PVC  are removed separately.    In general, DSM regards "back to feedstock" techniques as a  promising option which, it is true, does not promise a complete  solution for the problem of synthetic waste, but which is a  valuable partial solution, next to alternative processing  methods such as combustion (energy recovery) or material  recycling. In 1990 the Netherlands produced 850,000 tonnes of  synthetic waste, of which 150,000 was recycled. According to  the environmental policy plan, that last quota will have to  reach 450,000 tonnes by the turn of the century.</p>

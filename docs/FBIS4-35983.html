			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sawsan Abu-Husayn report: "Al-Shar' Tells AL-SHARQ </F> AL-AWSAT: We Will Not Resume Negotiations Before Full  Withdrawal Is Agreed To"]    [Text] Cairo -- Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' has  said that his country will not resume its negotiations with  Israel before receiving its final reply vis-a-vis the full  withdrawal to the 4 June 1967 lines. In an exclusive statement  to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT he said: "Then we would be able to discuss  any Israeli proposal."    On his country's acceptance of a phased Israeli withdrawal  within a reasonable period, the Syrian foreign minister said  that his country "is not at present looking for a phased  withdrawal or its duration. We are awaiting U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher's visit to the region, especially as he  has promised to achieve positive results during his upcoming  tour."    Al-Shar' said: "Israel still has not announced its  willingness to withdraw fully from the Golan, while we accept a  phased Israeli withdrawal, but the question is: Is it all the  Golan or are there other areas which Israel believes subject to  the security clauses?"    On Arab coordination al-Shar' said: "We are committed to it.  We made contacts with Jordan before the Jordanian monarch, King  Husayn, visited Damascus. And Lebanese President Ilyas  al-Hirawi and his prime minister held a meeting with President  Hafiz al-Asad. We also coordinate with Egypt from time to time  by telephone or through frequent meetings. All this falls  within the framework of assessing the situation and the extent  of Israel's seriousness in entering into a comprehensive, full,  and nondeficient peace with the Arab states."    Al-Shar' denied any plan to meet with Faruq Qaddumi in Syria  within days in the framework of Palestinian-Syrian coordination.    On Syria's mediation role between Egypt and Iran he said:  "Neither party has entrusted us with that matter. As for our  relations with Iran, they are extremely good and proceeding on  parallel lines vis-a-vis the important issues in the region."</p>

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Economic Viewpoint: The 'upwards only' price mentality Newspapers used to be known for Spanish practices - union activities which enforced above-market rates of pay for mythical work. There is a similar danger that the retail rental property market will become known for inflationary practices. There is a parallel to the practices discussed by David Sawers in the FT on Tuesday which inflate the prices of some UK goods. Prevailing property practices increase the costs of reducing inflation and aggravate the degree to which the impact of a monetary squeeze comes in lost sales and jobs, bankruptcies and vacant premises, as distinct from lower prices for the final customer. As Prof John Burton explains in a new study* the problem arises in retail rents because only about 4 per cent of payments represent new leases negotiated in current market conditions. The vast majority paid reflect past agreements. The 1990 rent level for shops was about 80 per cent higher than the pre-1985 norm and has since fallen back only slightly. Yet there is widespread excess capacity in retailing and property values have fallen by about 20 per cent from their 1988-89 peaks. The market is characterised by 25-year leases with provisions for upwards-only rent review every five years. Such leases are a product of the 'never had it so good' Macmillan period of relatively stable economic growth and inexorable, but creeping, inflation. The institutions wanted a secure inflation-proof investment; and large retailers security of tenure. Such leases are, however, out of date in a severe and possibly secular property depression. The biggest falls in values have been in office accommodation. But, perhaps because they find it harder to pack bags and move, the biggest complaints come from retailers and small businesses. Most of us know of rows of high street shops remaining vacant because small shopkeepers have quit rather than pay the rent demanded. I mentioned last week the initiative by Sir Desmond Pitcher of Littlewoods to enlist the support of other large retailers to update the commercial leasing system. Meanwhile, however, a host of campaigns has proliferated among small businesses. One of the most professional has been Camforr (Campaign for Rent Reform) run by a doctor and a surveyor**. Camforr wants to end: upwards-only rent reviews; 'unfair lease assignment clauses'; 'unfair arbitration clauses for rent reviews'; and confidentiality clauses on rent agreements. 'Unfair lease assignments', refer to a peculiar provision of English (not Scottish) law known as privity, by which the original lease-holder is responsible for the debts of successive holders - conjuring up the picture of the retired grocer in Bognor Regis being presented with the bills of a defaulting tenth holder, of whose existence he had not previously known. The Law Commission has itself called for reform. Confidentiality clauses bring out the conflict between the right to confidentiality and the need for maximum information in an effective market  -a specific example of the much-discussed conflict between an open society and the right to privacy. A compromise would be to enforce disclosure which would be aggregated into indices before publication. Reform of upwards-only rent reviews must proceed with care. A county court has recently held an upwards-only rent review clause void. But there is still something in the view of Sir Peregrine Rhodes of the British Property Federation that 'present leases have been freely negotiated. . . It would be unacceptable to declare such contracts void'. The main focus of the argument lies with the five-yearly rent reviews which are supposed to re-establish rents at open-market levels. One reason why this does not happen is that there is, according to Burton, a 'contrived contractual inconsistency' between the upwards-only clauses and the requirement in the same leases to set new rents at market levels. But second, and more controversially, Burton says that arbitrators and experts appointed by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors instead of going by standard market analysis - which would concentrate on the excess of demand or supply and expected future inflation - focus too much on 'comparables'. These include newly agreed rents of comparable premises but ignore, according to Burton, the zero rents from vacant promises. The institution's head, Michael Pattison, has said that it will 'respond to requests for a new look at lease and valuation issues'. If arbitrators and adjudicators were to do more to bring rents down to market levels the upwards-only provisions might gradually be negotiated out of existence voluntarily. It would then be only realistic that legislation designed to protect tenants from market forces should also go - an example being the provisions of the Landlord-Tenant Act, which can provide for up to 14 years' security of tenure after the expiry of a lease. A specific landlord's grievance is that business rates are levied at 50 per cent on vacant property; a belated response to the outcry over Centre Point, which stood vacant in the 1960s. The result, however, is that landlords have an incentive to 'strip out' their properties to avoid the charge, something that a bank with a household name has been seriously advised to do for a Pounds 1.5m property in the City. The moral is that hasty tinkering can do more harm than good. The property market will in any case come out of the recession with a changing institutional framework. The pension fund and insurance companies will be less inclined to put property into their portfolios and the gap will have to be met by other kinds of investor. That itself need not be a tragedy. Keynes once remarked that if investment is the by-product of a casino, the job is unlikely to be well done. Is it likely to be better done if it is a by-product of the pensions industry? A more serious problem is the Pounds 40bn of bank loans tied up in property investments of all kinds. If there were ever to be a systemic threat here, the Bank of England should act directly to maintain bank deposits rather than countenance restrictive practices. The intractable issues raised by property rental practices are one example of the harm done by even modest inflation which would not occur to undergraduate debaters. They are also an example of how difficult it is to eradicate inflation once it has taken hold. What the government needs to do is to give a push to the talks now going on and to inject a greater market flavour into them. The issue is worth the personal attention of the Board of Trade president, Michael Heseltine, and his adviser, Walter Eltis. * Retail Rents: Fair and Free Market?, Adam Smith Institute ** 2 Ballshead Passage, EC2, Fax: 071 924 4249</p>

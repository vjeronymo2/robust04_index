			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Up to Date" newscast] </F>   [Text] Shafiq Handal, general coordinator of the FMLN  [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Movement], has termed as  logical a U.S. congressmen's request that President Bill Clinton  withhold economic aid from El Salvador as long as the Salvadoran  Government does not progress in its democratic reforms. Handal  has said there is international frustration over both the  government's failure to comply with certain peace agreements and  irregularities observed in past elections.    Handal said the congressman's request to President Clinton  shows the international community's interest in the  establishment of a democratic system in the country based on the  peace agreements.    [Begin Handal recording] Just as the congressman says, there  is frustration over the progress of democracy in El Salvador. I  think the congressman is right and is defend the right of the  people who were unable to vote. [end recording]    The congressman has said that progress with democratic  reform  is not in sight, because the government is unconcerned with  fulfilling the Chapultepec Agreements.    [Begin Handal recording] I think it will be impossible to  carry out the necessary reforms before 24 April so that the  electoral system may become democratic. A radical, in-depth  change in the electoral system is necessary. [end recording]    At the Civic Plaza on 15 April, Handal participated in the  closure of the political campaign prior to the 24 April runoff  elections. The activity was marred somewhat when an alleged  Arena [Nationalist Republican Alliance] activist was caught  trying to create disturbances. Several FMLN activists captured  and beat him and finally handed him over to ONUSAL [UN Mission  to El Salvador].</p>

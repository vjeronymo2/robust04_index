			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- Students of Kim Il-song  University and Pyongyang University of Agriculture held rallies  and voiced support to the struggle of the South Korean students  and people for checking rice market opening by the authorities.    Speakers at the rallies noted that, with the market of farm  and livestock products including the rice market sold off to the  United States by the South Korean Kim Yong-sam group, South  Korean agriculture is facing a total bankruptcy, the 6 million  peasants will lose the means of livelihood soon and its  catastrophic effect will sweep the economy as a whole.    Referring to the staunch struggle of the students belonging  to the South Korean Federation of General Student Councils  (Hanchongnyon), the peasants and other people of South Korea  against rice market opening by the Kim Yong-sam group, they said  this was an explosion of anger and grievances against those who  seek to prolong their despicable power by selling the people's  right to existence and a righteous patriotic action to defend  the dignity and interests of the nation.    They said the treacherous Kim Yong-sam puppet regime must be  overthrown and an independent democratic government be  established, if rice market opening is to be checked in South  Korea and the dignity and interests of the nation be defended.</p>

			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Beckett slams move to cut sick-pay cash Planned reductions in the statutory sick-pay subsidy would impose 'substantial' costs on small employers, in spite of assurances from ministers that the changes should reduce industry's costs, the Labour party said yesterday. Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, told the Commons that the government had deceived its backbenchers by disguising the true impact of changes in the sickness benefit rules and rushing them through parliament this week. She said that reductions in sick-pay subsidy for employers and increases in National Insurance Contributions (NIC) for employees were taxation items deserving a considered debate by MPs. Ministers pressed ahead with plans to get both bills through their Commons stages by tomorrow, however, saying that they had already been well discussed in both the Queen's Speech and Budget debates in recent weeks. Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, said when introducing a guillotine motion to curtail debate on the legislation that neither bill was 'long and complicated'. Both had to be on the statute book by February if employers were to be presented with a timely indication of their new costs. Mrs Beckett said small employers paying less than Pounds 20,000 a year in national insurance would face bigger costs because they would be getting no subsidy for employees who were sick for up to four weeks. She said surveys suggested that the average employee was rarely sick for longer. Ministers said the increased costs were offset by recent cuts in the NIC rate for employers. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, told Labour MPs in a letter released last night that it was 'indefensible' that the sick-pay and social-security contributions bills should be forced to pass all their parliamentary stages in one day. He said the opposition was determined to continue its campaign of not co-operating with the government when parliament resumed. His statement appeared designed to dispel rumours circulating at Westminster that the campaign, triggered by the guillotine proposals, would be quietly dropped when the Commons went into recess for three weeks on Friday.</p>

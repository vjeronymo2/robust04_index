			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Clinton approval rating up to 56% PRESIDENT Bill Clinton, aided by the PLO-Israeli landmark accord and favourable reaction to his US health reform plan, has risen to a 56 per cent approval rating among US voters, Reuter reports from Washington. Mr Clinton, whose popularity plunged soon after he took office in January, has climbed back above the 50 per cent level for the first time since April, according to the poll by CNN, USA Today and Gallup. It found that 56 per cent of Americans approve of the way Mr Clinton is working, while 36 per cent disapprove. Mr Clinton took office in mid-January with 58 per cent approval, but fell to a record low of 37 per cent by June, after White House gaffes. Americans appear to have renewed faith in his foreign policy skills, with 55 per cent approving, compared with 32 per cent disapproving. A poll last month - before Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO leader, and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, came to the White House to sign guidelines on Palestinian self-rule - showed Mr Clinton with 46 per cent approval on foreign affairs.</p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Hong Kong suffers most from US-China trade arguments: A 25% cut in textiles quotas has raised a storm in China that threatens Hong Kong's entrepot trade It takes just three words - Most Favoured Nation (MFN) - to send Hong Kong companies and government heads alike into a spin. Each year they lash out at the US administration for hurting Hong Kong interests when the real target is China. But when US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor announced on Thursday that US quotas for China-made textile and garment goods would be slashed by 25 to 35 per cent the mood in the colony was remarkably subdued. Remarkably, because re-export trade of China-made textiles and garments to the US accounted for HKDollars 25bn (Pounds 2.175bn) last year and, according to one trade lawyer's estimates, nine out of every 10 Hong Kong manufacturers now rely on factories in China for their output. Re-exports make up around three-quarters of the total volume of Hong Kong's trade: the US and China are its two biggest partners. China, in contrast to Hong Kong, blasted the US decision as 'irresponsible' and warned of possible retaliation. 'This will have a serious impact on Sino-US trade relations,' a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation said. 'If the US persists. . . this will force our side to take corresponding and retaliatory measures.' The statement said China wanted to continue to negotiate and did not outline the possible retaliation. Mr Chris Jackson, deputy director-general of Hong Kong's trade department, said the government remained confident the two countries need each other too much to remain at loggerheads for long. For now, he said, there is no sign the move would effect Hong Kong's re-export trade: 'What the US side has done is raised the stakes,' he said. Mr Henry Tang, managing director of Peninsula Knitwear, is one of the colony's key players in the sector. His company employs about 10,000 workers in China, and around 80 per cent of the goods are exported to America. He said: 'They (China and America) are keen to come to an agreement as soon as possible, but not at any cost. 'If this gets implemented, obviously we will be hit. But the service industry will be hit too. We cannot quantify the hit in cost terms, because once China retaliates, the American (list) will escalate.' If Hong Kong is playing this particular game with pokerfaced calm, it has good reasons for doing so. First, the policy will prove tough to implement. By definition, transshipment is the result of high US demand for textile and clothing quota supply. If manufacturers with more orders than they have quota allowances cannot buy more quota, they can be tempted to falsify the country of origin. Cutting that supply is likely to exacerbate the problem rather than relieve it. Mr Roy Delbyck, a lawyer representing several US importers buying in China, said the US will simply drive up quota prices - which in turn will be passed on to consumers - and create a bigger transshipment problem. 'If by cutting quotas the US thinks it is going to wipe out transshipment or ameliorate it it is sadly mistaken.' Secondly, Hong Kong's argument that it is an innocent bystander in China's MFN dispute with the US is not watertight in the case of transshipment. Many textile and garment factories in China are controlled by companies in Hong Kong, Macao, Singapore, Korea and Taiwan, which play a part in organising such trade. Third, much of Hong Kong's purchasing from China is done early in the year - typically in the first four months - giving companies an early bite of China's quota cake. Hints of quota cuts late last year prompted many to sort quotas out even earlier than normal. Manufacturers have bought ahead, and put goods into warehouses for extended storage. Although the Hong Kong stock market fell 3.28 per cent to 11,001 yesterday, for a two-day fall of almost 10 per cent, analysts said the quota announcement alone had little effect on share prices. The deeper worry for Hong Kong is that the US administration will go beyond mere threats of quota cuts. China would respond by hitting out at the US in key sectors such as aviation. As piggy-in-the-middle, Hong Kong would not only lose trade volume: the growing service industry would also suffer.</p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Management: Retailing - Finding partners for life / John Thornhill reports on how the John Lewis chain looks after staff John Lewis Partnership, which runs 22 department stores and the Waitrose supermarket chain, can claim with more justice than most companies that it looks after its employees. But then it does have a clear incentive to do so: its 32,000 employees own the company. Ever since 1929 when John Spedan Lewis put the family company's assets into a trust for the benefit of past, current and future employees, the partnership has adopted a different approach to running its business than its competitors. Management is given great executive freedom but held strictly accountable by the employees (or partners as they are called); profits are shared equally among members; and great emphasis is placed on retention of staff, training and personal development. As the inspirational Spedan Lewis put it: 'The supreme purpose of the John Lewis Partnership is simply the happiness of its members'. At this point, cynics might reach for their profit and loss accounts, assuming that such high-sounding principles would come unstuck in the competitive world of British retailing. After all, JLP is competing head-to-head against some formidably efficient public companies, such as Marks and Spencer and J. Sainsbury. But in a new book on the partnership*, two business academics argue that JLP's unique organisational structure and its awareness of the role of people has given it advantages in the market-place. Being nice to people can be profitable. The authors examine JLP's performance against a range of financial and economic data and conclude that it is directly comparable with that of the market leaders in both the food and the non-food sectors. They suggest that JLP 'ranks high or top in profitability and productivity, and shows no significant evidence of under-investment, over-borrowing or under-liquidity'. They say JLP's experience casts doubt on the pessimistic theory that performance suffers when there is no capital market discipline and when employees are involved in decision-making. In a rare interview, Peter Lewis the company's present chairman and nephew of Spedan Lewis, naturally welcomed the book's conclusion but was coy about the suggestion that the partnership had much to teach other businesses. In a lofty office overlooking the red-brick splendour of Westminster Cathedral, the imposingly tall but meticulously polite Lewis says: 'We are not a proselytizing company. We do not go out and tell people how to run a partnership. We simply show by what we do that it can work'. He accepts that the Partnership's structure gives the management full scope to decide strategy but rejects the book's suggestion that at times this smacks of 'dynastic autocracy'. The point is, he suggests, that the obverse of executive independence is accountability, the nub of the whole organisation. 'It makes people think ahead. It makes people consider the consequences of their actions' he says. In this sense, as the book observes, the constraints of employee ownership act as a substitute mechanism to capital markets. 'It is our people, not our shareholders, to whom we are answerable,' Lewis says. Employee participation works in a variety of ways within JLP. Under its constitution, partners elect representatives to branch councils (which scrutinise management decision at store level) and to the 140-member central council (which acts as the forum and focus of public opinion within the Partnership). The central council also elects three Trustees of the constitution who have the ultimate power to replace the chairman. Managers are employed to manage the business rigorously but the company accepts that 'those partners who may neither aspire to be a manager, nor possess the abilities to be one, are recognised as individuals with a valid contribution to make to the success of the business'. But accountability also works in less formal ways through the weekly staff Gazette, which carries extensive staff correspondence and detailed information about the partnership's trading performance. Any partner can write to the magazine with a complaint or a question which must be answered by the director of the relevant department. This mechanism is often more likely to lead to changes which affect the daily working conditions of most of the partners. So, for example, a letter-writing campaign in the staff Gazette led to the abolition of confidential staff assessments - they now have to be shown to the relevant partner. Complaints can range from the serious to the bizarre. Last week, for example, 'Sick of Eating Humble Hair' wrote to complain about hairs found in the canteen food. Even a casual perusal of the Gazette reveals that the Partnership is not the idyll of industrial harmony that it might seem. The letters pages are frequently crammed with grumbles about ill-considered decisions or incompetence - much as you would expect in any organisation. But few companies are so open about exposing their faults and trading prospects or so publicly committed to trying to rectifying their problems. The company accepts that some employees find its culture too oppressive or sanctimonious and leave but it points out that its rate of staff turnover is significantly less than that in comparable retail businesses. JLP employs a far higher proportion of full-time staff than competitors and offers more attractive levels of pay because of its partnership bonus scheme. Last year JLP made post-tax profits of Pounds 78.7m, of which Pounds 42.1m was ploughed back into developing the business and most of the rest was distributed among the partners. In the 1979-89 period, the bonus averaged 20 per cent of annual pay. gest that employee-owned companies inevitably face tension balancing short-term rewards with long-term investment. The natural desire is to maintain the bonus in a downturn, thereby undermining the company's competitiveness. Such issues loom large when partners face a cut in their take-home pay. However, Lewis suggests that such tensions can be defused by adopting a consistent approach to bonus payments. Ultimately, he suggests, the partnership boils down to a commitment to social justice. 'It was certainly a driving force in Spedan's ideas. What struck him was the waste of talent and energy in a lot of people who, if only given a chance would contribute to a common enterprise'. Times have changed since the 1930s, but Lewis believes those principles are still relevant today. * Business Performance in the Retail Sector, The Experience of the John Lewis Partnership.

			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Markets expect turbulent week: Share and bond outlook uncertain after Fed move prompts Wall St slide Share and bond prices face an uncertain outlook today with the world's financial markets expecting a turbulent week. This follows Friday's steep fall on Wall Street prompted by the Federal Reserve's decision to push up US interest rates for the first time in five years. The Fed's shift, which marks a distinct change in the investment climate, caught the markets by surprise and prompted a 96-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average as investors grew concerned that the increase might end the bull run in stock markets in the US and elsewhere. The decline was the largest one-day loss on Wall Street for more than two years. European financial markets were braced for turbulence amid fears that further falls in European interest rates might be put on hold as the dollar strengthened. Analysts predicted that European equity markets would take their cue from the sharp drop in US share prices, although most said they did not expect a fall on the scale of the 1987 crash. Trading was thin this morning on the Tokyo share market, with the Nikkei average hovering above the 20,000 mark. By midday the Nikkei was down 262 points, or 1.3 per cent. 'It's a real wait-and-see market after the big drop on Wall Street with foreigners doing very little,' one broker said. In Hong Kong, where property and banking stocks were hit hard, the Hang Seng index was down about 3.1 per cent in initial trading. The Singapore Straits Times index was off nearly 2 per cent. The Fed's modest tightening of monetary policy was viewed as an attempt to forestall inflation by slowing the pace of economic expansion. In the past three quarters the economy has grown at an average annual rate of more than 4 per cent, which the central bank is likely to have viewed as potentially inflationary. Wall Street is braced for short-term falls in US share prices in the next few weeks as investors use the Fed's rate increase as an opportunity to take profits after the US market's strong run in January. Mr David Shulman, equity strategist at Salomon Brothers, said Friday's large drop in share prices was a 'normal reaction' to a Fed tightening, and predicted fresh selling to come. A temporary downturn in the stock market is regarded as particularly likely if, as many on Wall Street expect, the Fed further tightens policy in the next few months to ensure inflationary pressures do not build up. Mr David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Securities in Chicago, predicted the Fed would put up short-term rates from 3 1/4 per cent to 3 3/4 per cent or even 4 per cent, before the end of the year. Yet most Wall Street analysts do not believe that the Fed's decision to tighten monetary policy, by pushing the bank overnight lending rate up from 3 per cent to 3 1/4 per cent, will provoke a sustained sell-off. Many said investors would ultimately see the rate rise as positive for stock and bond markets, because it would show that the Fed was ready to combat the threat of inflation while avoiding serious damage to the prospects for economic growth in the US. Economists at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the Wall Street broking house, have told clients: 'We do not expect a long-lasting effect on the stock market, as the negative effect of tighter monetary policy will be offset by the significant improvement taking place in the economy.' The dollar opened slightly softer against the yen in Tokyo on profit-taking at Y109.13 after its rise against both the D-Mark and the Japanese yen on Friday.

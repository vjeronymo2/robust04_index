			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE REJECTS LANCASTER'S LAST CHALLENGES TO PRISON  </P> <P> A judge gave state corrections officials another victory Wednesday in their  fight to build a state prison in Lancaster, rejecting the remaining challenges  in a suit brought by the city of Lancaster and Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Superior Court Judge John Zebrowski denied a request to order the  state to build only a medium-security prison, rather than the maximum- and  medium-security facility now planned.  </P> <P> The opponents also demanded that state officials expand a planned "greenbelt"  to shield the 2,200-bed facility from the surrounding neighborhood.  </P> <P> The decision, which Zebrowski issued without comment, resolves the second part  of a lawsuit filed by Lancaster and the county in January.  </P> <P> Last month, a judge ruled in the state's favor on challenges by Lancaster and  the county to an environmental review of the 252-acre site in west Lancaster.  </P> <P> Grading began at the site earlier this month.  </P> <P> The only remaining legal recourse for opponents -- who say that the prison will  hurt the Antelope Valley's economy, infrastructure and image -- is to appeal  the rulings.  </P> <P> An appeal of the environmental ruling has been filed and will be heard sometime  in the spring, when work will have already begun on a $50-million contract for  the prison's housing units.  </P> <P> "Obviously, we are disappointed," said David Mann, a lawyer for the city of  Lancaster.  </P> <P> He said the city will consider appealing Zebrowski's decision and consolidating  that effort with the appeal on environmental issues.  </P> <P> City and county lawyers still hope that an appellate court will temporarily  halt construction and order a new environmental review, Mann said.  </P> <P> They believe that the findings of a new study could lead to a compromise  agreement to choose a less populated site in the Antelope Valley.  </P> <P> But both sides say that chances of blocking the prison are diminishing as  construction progresses.  </P> <P> Even if an appellate court requires the state to upgrade the environmental  review, lawyers said, justices may be less likely to delay construction that is  well under way.  </P> <P> "A court would give that serious consideration," Deputy Atty. Gen. Robert Mukai  said.  </P> <P> At the Wednesday morning hearing, Zebrowski questioned the argument by lawyers  for Lancaster that 1987 legislation, which created the prison and a companion  prison in East Los Angeles, permits only a medium-security institution.  </P> <P> Ronald Van Blarcam, a city lawyer, argued that the bill did not specify a  security level.  </P> <P> Therefore, he said, corrections officials were bound by previous legislation  calling for a medium-security prison.  </P> <P> In response, Mukai argued that the law gives discretion on security level to  the Department of Corrections.  </P> <P> Legislation authorizing construction of several other prisons did not specify  security level, he said.  </P> <P> The Lancaster prison is scheduled to begin operating in 1992.  </P></p>

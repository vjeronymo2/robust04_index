			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / China steps up pressure on Britain over Hong Kong CHINA STEPPED up the pressure in its diplomatic row with Britain yesterday, renewing its warnings over trade relations and taking further steps towards setting up a shadow authority for Hong Kong. Mr Li Peng, the Chinese premier, said at the end of a meeting of the National People's Congress, that Sino-British trade could suffer because of the plans by Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, to introduce greater democracy in the colony. He also said China was establishing a preparatory committee to facilitate a smooth transition to Chinese rule over Hong Kong in 1997, and hinted that it might be set up earlier than expected. Western officials and figures in the Hong Kong democratic reform movement fear that China may be planning to establish a shadow government in Hong Kong to compete with Britain in the lead-up to China's takeover in 1997. This would undermine the position of Mr Patten, who will hold talks with senior EC officials in Brussels tomorrow and on Friday before flying to London to meet UK prime minister Mr John Major. On trade, Mr Li said: 'I hope that our economic relations would not be seriously affected.' But he added: 'If the situation continues to deteriorate, I'm afraid we can't entirely rule out the possibility of economic co-operation being affected.' Mr Li Lanqing, vice-premier and former trade minister, issued a similar threat last month. Mr Li Peng, whose second five-year term in office was confirmed by the Congress, China's parliament, also sought to use a Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 840m) trade deal reached this week with Germany, covering the purchase of at least 12 Airbuses and other equipment, to exert pressure on Britain. 'That shows what a huge market China can offer,' Mr Li told reporters in Beijing. 'I believe that British businessmen will also be interested in such a big market.' Beijing has been infuriated by the planned reforms advanced by Mr Patten, which it claims are at odds with understandings reached earlier with London. Mr Li hinted that an original plan to form the working committee in 1996 may be brought forward in the light of difficulties with Britain. Mr Li was equivocal in remarks to reporters about timing, saying that the purpose of the preparatory committee was to ensure a smooth transition to Chinese rule to preserve Hong Kong's prosperity. 'According to our original plan we should establish a preparatory committee in 1996,' he said. The congress's working committee on Hong Kong would decide when it might be established. Politicians in the colony expressed disquiet at Beijing's apparent intention to push ahead with the committee.</p>

			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Markets: There is life beyond gilts - The Bottom Line IF YOU are feeling disgruntled with the low returns available on building society and bank deposits, what are the options? Many investors already hold equities, and should be careful not to concentrate all their investments in one area. For investors who are prepared to look beyond the gilts market, there are other options. The success of permanent interest bearing shares (Pibs) issued by building societies proves that there is a willingness to get to grips with new products, if the potential rewards - 13 per cent interest rates on the first Pibs issues - are sufficiently attractive. The fact that capital is never repaid, and the building society can pass up interest payments did not dent enthusiasm for the product. The latest debt instruments issued by building societies - called collared floating-rate notes - have a rather more complex structure, but also offer some clear advantages. The main attraction of collared floating-rate notes is that they offer a guaranteed minimum return which is higher than current money market rates. Three building societies, the Leeds Permanent, Bradford &amp; Bingley, and Halifax Building Societies, have so far used the structure, issuing notes to the value of Pounds 300m. Leeds Permanent, the first building society to make use of the structure, offers investors a minimum Interest rate of 7 per cent and a maximum of 11 per cent. In effect, the investor opts to sacrifice any potential interest rate increase above, say, 11 per cent, in return for a guaranteed minimum income of around 7 per cent. 'It is quite a nice move for someone coming out of a building society account, who wants to have their money reasonably close at hand,' said Paul Killik, a partner of stockbroking firm Killik &amp; Co. With money market rates at around 6 per cent, the prospect of a 7 per cent minimum interest rate, or floor, appears rather attractive. In theory, floating-rate notes should hold their value better than fixed-rate bonds. Because the interest rate is re-set in line with prevailing money-market rates every six months, the market price of the notes should be protected. However, since the interest on these collared floating-rate notes is capped at 11 per cent, if base rates shoot up rapidly, the price of the notes could tumble. Of course, fixed-rate bonds provide even less protection against possible interest rates rises, since any relative decline in the interest rate compared to market rates must be reflected in the price. So the question is whether the potential capital loss - which would not be built into conventional floating rate notes or deposit accounts - is reward by the higher immediate income. 'It is not a first step into the market, but could make sense as a small part of a sensibly balanced portfolio', said David Barker, a director of Hoare Govett. The minimum investment for collared floating-rate notes so far has been Pounds 1,000 or Pounds 10,000, but these issues are targeted at institutional investors as well as retail investors. The notes can be purchased through any reasonably sized stockbroker; Killik charges commission of Pounds 40 on the first Pounds 10,000. Richard Boath, a director of Salomon Brothers who worked on the structure, believes that the next step is for building societies or banks themselves to offer deposit accounts with minimum and maximum interest rate levels, but with the principal guaranteed. An interesting option for retail investors but one that is still some way off. Another new structure is the so-called reverse floating-rate note. Although not designed for retail investors, some brokers have been looking at the product as a potentially interesting investment. However, the structure is extremely risky. Essentially, it is a bet that interest rates will fall, since the amount of interest paid increases as the benchmark interest rate falls. However, should interest rates move in the wrong direction, not only will the return on the notes decline swiftly, but the price of the notes is likely to collapse.</p>

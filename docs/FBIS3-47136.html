The tirade spun out by the traitor at the "press conference"  was, in a nutshell, a base rigmarole full of disgusting honeyed  words to justify his towering crimes in seeking flunkeyism and  treachery, fascism and violence, division and confrontation last  year under the "civilian" veil, prop up the puppet regime facing  a crisis of destruction caused by the already bankrupt "policy  of reforms" and break the fighting spirit of the people who had  risen up resolutely to overthrow the "civilian government",  disillusioned with it.    Viciously taking issue with the fictitious "nuclear problem"  of the North again, he wagged his tongue freely, blaring that he  would make his "maximum effort for the settlement of the nuclear  issue of the North".    Recent contacts between the DPRK and the U.S. opened up a  prospect for the solution to the "nuclear problem" of the Korean  peninsula and paved the way for a progress of the talks between  the two sides. Quite upset by this, the South Korean puppets  are raising such terrific outcries over the "nuclear issue" of  the North in a bid to set the "international cooperation system"  in-motion at any cost.    The bellicose blast of the traitor Kim Yong-sam about the  "modernisation" of the puppet Army and "establishment of a  security posture" shows that the puppets are virtually seeking a  showdown of strength.    It is an unpardonable anti-national criminal act for the  South Korean puppets to take the road of inciting North-South  confrontation and aggravating the tension in the Korean  peninsula, in league with outside forces, turning down the offer  of fellow countrymen to open a way out for the nation through  the reconciliation and unity of North and South.</p>

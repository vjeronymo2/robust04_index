			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Oil profits 'at record levels' FAR from falling in the aftermath of the Gulf war, oil company profit margins have risen to record levels, according to Mr Frank Dobson, shadow energy secretary. They have increased their gross margin to nearly 39p per gallon compared with 35p in the final quarter of last year, research shows. A report from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in 1990 found that margins of about 25p per gallon allowed the companies to make reasonable profits, Mr Dobson said.</p>

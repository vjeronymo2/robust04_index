			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei declines in line with futures market A LOWER futures market prompted profit-taking by dealers and investment trusts, wiping out share price gains from a morning rally, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average was finally down 212.03 at 17,268.71 after a day's high of 17,601.20 and low of 17,266.40. The index was bolstered in the morning by reports of tax measures to reinvigorate the real estate sector, and depressed by selling in the late afternoon. Volume rose to 250m shares from 213m. Declines led advances by 639 to 351, with 149 issues unchanged, while the Topix index of all first section stocks lost 8.57 to 1,317.33. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 2.99 to 1,069.91. Most of the activity was futures led yesterday, hence the predominance in trading of investment trusts and dealers. Reports that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party had prepared a final proposal on reviving tax breaks for those who renew housing, and that it had reviewed the possible abolition of the land tax system, excited some traders, but most investors remained on the sidelines. Brokers actively traded issues with large latent assets on rumours that financial authorities are minded to allow banks and companies to revalue assets and count any surplus as capital. Most analysts were sceptical over the implementation of such book-keeping measures. Mr Alex Kinmont, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said: 'They would only be exchanging one fictional value for another,' referring to the lack of qualified land surveyors. Nippon Express, which was initially bought on the asset revaluation theme, lost Y4 on balance at Y760, and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone declined Y5,000 to Y549,000. Keisei Electric Railway appreciated Y7 to Y827. Real estate companies rose on news of possible land tax reforms. Mitsui Fudosan put on Y30 to Y1,030 and Mitsubishi Estate Y30 to Y935. Further rumours of a takeover by Harrods pushed Yokohama Matsuzakaya up Y99 to Y639, the largest percentage gain of the day. Nagase, a trading company, advanced Y40 to Y745 on hopes of brisk sales of its antibacterial cloth. High-technology issues lost ground on profit-taking by investment trusts. Hitachi slipped Y2 to Y743 and Fujitsu retreated Y17 to Y557. However, Hitachi Electronics climbed Y40 to Y1,420 on firm earnings projections. In Osaka, the OSE average receded 54.78 to 18,839.62. Large lot cross-trading, or realising profits on long-term holdings without changing underlying portfolios, boosted volume to 117.9m shares, against 21.1m. Nintendo, the video game maker, fell Y100 to Y11,000 on profit-taking. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets continued to be mixed, with domestic issues predominant. HONG KONG strengthened in the afternoon session as some confidence returned to the market following recent nervousness over political relations with China. The Hang Seng index rose 100.15, or 1.9 per cent, to 5,415.96 in turnover of HKDollars 2.4bn. Hang Seng Bank and Bank of East Asia gained as some investors switched out of HSBC Holdings on reports that it might have to make new debt provisions. Hang Seng Bank was up HKDollars 2.25 to HKDollars 51.50 while Bank of East Asia gained HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 33. HSBC closed unchanged at HKDollars 55.50, after a day's low of HKDollars 54.50. SEOUL advanced slightly with interest in Daewoo group stocks on news that Daewoo Corp had won a Dollars 280m construction order from Malaysia. The composite index rose 3.88 to 654.09 and Daewoo Corp added Won500 at Won11,700. TAIWAN remained weak in cautious trading ahead of Saturday's parliamentary elections. The weighted index closed 13.34 lower at 3,674.92 in turnover down to TDollars 6.6bn from TDollars 7.2bn. MANILA was helped higher by the recovery of Philippine Long Distance Telephone in New York. The composite index improved 39.42 to 1,222.91 in combined turnover of 679.5m pesos. PLDT rallied 30 pesos to 840 pesos, while Philippine National Bank advanced 14 pesos to 220 pesos SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index moved ahead 14.52 to 1,456.62 in turnover of some SDollars 252m. Cycle and Carriage, up 10 cents at SDollars 6.50, led the market: Jardine Strategic Holdings, of Hong Kong, said it had bought a 16 per cent stake in the car distributor. In KUALA LUMPUR the composite index ended 4.01 up at 632.89 with Multi-Purpose gaining 2 cents at MDollars 2.21. AUSTRALIA weakened on profit-taking, the All Ordinaries index closing 12.6 off at 1,497.0 in turnover of ADollars 260.15m. News Corp was among the day's biggest losers, following a downgrading by a US broker, and the shares ended 82 cents cheaper at ADollars 29. Banks remained under pressure, with National Australia falling 17 cents to ADollars 7.53, ANZ 5 cents to ADollars 2.68 and Westpac 3 cents to ADollars 3.03. NEW ZEALAND was steady as Fletcher Challenge regained support after falling steeply on Tuesday. The NZSE-40 index closed 0.79 firmer at 1,521.18 with FCL up 5 cents at NZDollars 2.31.

Turnover was thin at Bt1.2bn.</p>

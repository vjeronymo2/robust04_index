			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Observer: Stand up and be counted One of Observer's grouchiest bugbears is so-called general knowledge quizzes. Besides being tarted up with names like Mastermind when all they really call for is memory, the knowledge they test is rarely if ever general. What most of them are about is solely arts-type knowledge, with scientific and mathematical questions hardly ever getting a look in. So hearing the Ashburnham Arms in London's Greenwich runs an unusually good quiz on Tuesdays, Observer called in . . .only to be disappointed. It suffered from the same fault. Seeing my black looks, however, the pub's tenants Dave and Debbie Head agreed to let Observer sponsor seven numeracy-linked questions as a supplement to the next regular contest. On the night, some 40 people took part. The average score was lowish at 2.9 points out of the possible seven. But two contenders got four points, another got five, and the winner scored six. Which prompted the idea of printing the questions to see whether FT-readers could do any better. They are: 1 What is the conventional name for the result of dividing the circumference of a circle by its diameter? 2 What is 12 1/2 per cent of 60 per cent? 3 If 93 people enter a knock-out singles tournament at tennis, how many matches are needed before one player emerges as overall winner? 4 Paper sizes, such as A3 and A4, are designed so that when any size is cut in two half-way down its longer side, the result is two smaller sheets each the same shape as the bigger one. In which case, if the length of the shorter side is taken as 1, what mathematical relationship to that 1 is borne by the longer side? 5 Name the ancient philosopher specifically associated with the theorem which sheds light on question 4. 6 What - apart from the fact that no other number is the same as it - is unique about the number 1,729? 7 Name the unusual mathematician who saw the answer to question 6 instantly? There, then, is the challenge. Whereas the pub's customers had only an hour to work on it (they are of course barred from entering this re-run), readers have until the last post tonight to mail their entries, or until 6pm London time to fax them to Observer on 071-873 3926 or, if that's engaged, 071-873 3196. Telephoned entries won't be accepted. The winner gets a bottle of malt whisky. If necessary, there'll be a tie-breaker consisting of a straight question plus an ultimate decider testing not numeracy, but extra sensory perception.</p>

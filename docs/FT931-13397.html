			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Sterling weakens on gloom over recovery STERLING came under renewed pressure against the D-Mark yesterday, falling another 1 1/2 pfennigs, amid increasing gloom about the prospects for an economic recovery in the UK. The pound fell to a low of DM2.437 in the morning, as currency dealers speculated that the government might cut base rates in the near future, following the release of poorer-than-expected economic data on Thursday. The Bank of England left interest rates unchanged, but the pound still closed at DM2.44, 1 1/4 pfennigs down on the day and more than 6 pfennigs below the level at which it closed last Friday. Sterling firmed against a generally weak dollar, closing at Dollars 1.5345, up more than 1 1/2 cents. On the London stock market, hopes of an early interest rate cut had helped lift share prices to within 6 points of 2,800 on the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares. It closed at 2,781.2, up 7.9 on the day. Sterling has on several occasions in the past three months, dropped to the levels at which it was trading yesterday, only to rally again to around DM2.5. But there were signs yesterday that the currency was under more serious pressure. One of the leading banks in the London foreign exchange market said it had received no requests to buy the pound from its UK corporate customers on Thursday and that there had been barely any improvement in the situation. Mr Neil MacKinnon, an economist at Citibank in London, said Thursday's economic data, which showed a rise in seasonally adjusted unemployment by 60,800 in December to 2.97m, had significantly changed the currency market's mood towards sterling. However, Mr Steven Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London, said the money markets were now virtually discounting a full percentage point cut in base rates before the March Budget, so that the UK authorities could ease policy without affecting the pound any further. 'The only thing that might put pressure on the currency is if the rate cut comes too soon,' he said. Editorial Comment, Page 6 Mixed signs of recovery, Page 7 Currencies, Page 11 Lex, Page 22</p>

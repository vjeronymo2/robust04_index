			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Iberia, Lufthansa in talks on closer co-operation Iberia, Spain's state-owned national airline, is negotiating a wide-ranging commercial agreement with Germany's Lufthansa. The talks form the third leg of a series of preliminary agreements also involving United Airlines of the US. The US carrier has already announced co-operation pacts with both Lufthansa and Iberia. A senior Iberia source said the aim of the Lufthansa talks was to establish as close a co-operation on routes, ticket sales and promotion as is allowed by the European Unions' anti-cartel limits. A share swap between the two national carriers was not a 'primary objective', the source said, and 'would not, in any case, occur in the short term'. Iberia sees Lufthansa as its ideal European partner because the routes of the two airlines, weighted towards east Europe and the Middle East in the case of the German airline and Central and South America in Iberia's, are complementary. The airlines share historic bonds going back to the 1920s. The Lufthansa agreement will make little impact on Iberia's balance sheet but it could bring additional business to its hub it operates in Miami and to destinations in the Caribbean and Central America. The hub has incurred heavy losses. The source said a decision would be taken at the end of the year on whether to sell it to United Airlines. The Spanish carrier is also hoping to dispose of part of its 80 per cent shareholding in Aerolneas Argentinas. Iberia hopes to halve its losses this year to around Pta30bn (Dollars 220m).</p>

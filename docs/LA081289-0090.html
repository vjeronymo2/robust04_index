			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOTHA REBUKES LIKELY SUCCESSOR ON PLANNED MEETING IN ZAMBIA  </P> <P> President Pieter W. Botha threw South Africa's governing National Party into  disarray Friday by announcing that party leader Frederik W. de Klerk, the heir  apparent to the presidency, does not have his permission to meet later this  month with Zambian President Kenneth D. Kaunda.  </P> <P> In a terse statement issued from his Cape Town office, Botha said he had no  knowledge of the planned trip to Livingstone, Zambia, by De Klerk and Foreign  Minister Roelof F. (Pik) Botha, and that they had not obtained the  authorization required of Cabinet ministers before traveling out of the  country.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ministers Summoned  </P> <P> De Klerk, who also serves as minister of white education, immediately summoned  Cabinet ministers to a meeting and said that "it appears that there may  possibly be a misunderstanding." He said ministers had been unable to contact  Botha in Cape Town to arrange a meeting with the president to clear up the  dispute.  </P> <P> Later, however, the state-run television announced that a meeting of the full  Cabinet, including President Botha, will be held Monday to discuss the  controversy.  </P> <P> Botha's extraordinary rebuke of De Klerk, who is virtually certain to become  president after the Sept. 6 elections, was seen by political observers as  widening the gulf that has developed between Botha and the party since the  73-year-old president suffered a stroke Jan. 18, and later was effectively  forced into announcing he would retire.  </P></p>

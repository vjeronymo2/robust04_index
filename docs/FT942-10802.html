			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Business Travel: High - and dry if you want it Wine-enthusiast readers of Business Traveller may feel rather short-changed by last month's issue. For the last eight Aprils the London-based magazine has published the results of its trail-blazing comparison of the big airlines' wine selections. But this year its editor, Gill Upton, has bowed out of the comparative tasting notes and rankings game, partly because of the 'nightmare' of organising last year's taste-offs actually in-flight (at the behest of the airlines), but also because business travellers seem to be less and less interested in what they eat and drink. In the 10 years the magazine has been polling its readers on how they rate airlines' attributes, food and wine has fallen from fourth to ninth place. This drop may, of course, reflect the considerable improvement in in-flight catering since the early 1980s. Certainly a number of airlines have targeted food and, particularly, wine as a significant marketing tool. According to Peter Nixson, British Airways' chief cellarer: 'Wine is one of the areas in which you can make a significant improvement over your competitors.' Most of the big airlines have been hard at work on their wine lists over the past few years, sometimes sponsoring wine competitions and often hiring outside help. American Airlines, for example, has featured its wine expert Dr Richard Vine, looking serious in tenebrous cellars, in its advertising campaigns. BA meanwhile has called upon the services of wine writer Hugh Johnson, Michael Broadbent of Christie's and Master of Wine Colin Anderson to help select the 340,000 cases of wine it buys each year. And Singapore Airlines has regularly fought BA and American Airlines for first place in inter-airline wine comparisons, thanks to its panel of tasters carefully drawn from Britain, Australia and California. It is BA's Anderson who has conducted some of the most detailed research on the psychological and physiological effects of wine drinking in the air. He maintains that our tasting ability is impaired at 33,000 ft, chiefly because of dehydration which dries out the sensory membranes. The upshot is that acidity and tannin tend to be accentuated, making even the fruitiest champagne taste leaner than it should, and flattering fruity exuberant wine styles such as those produced in the New World. The cabin pressurisation also tends to thin the blood slightly, which means that the effects of alcohol are accentuated. This, together with the generally dehydrating effect of air travel, means it is essential to alternate non-alcoholic drinks with alcoholic ones. Another important factor is stress. For many travellers, alcohol is used as an antidote to fear of flying, or simply a release from an angst-ridden airport experience. As Nixson puts it: 'The chances are that the first glass goes down without even touching the sides of the mouth.'</p>

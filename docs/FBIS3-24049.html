			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Sobyanin and Andrey Uglanov: "Should </F> We Look for a Black Cat Where There Is None?"]    [Text] According to G. Popov's version, the political  prisoners amnesty act is an action that had been planned in the  Kremlin. But is it really so?  <H5>  The Duma and Its `Harmlessness' </H5>   The State Duma's central apparat is about to exceed the size  of that under Khasbulatov. Counter to the Constitution, I.  Rybkin is becoming a political figure of significance. Strangely  enough, B. Yeltsin himself, as well as V. Chernomyrdin, is  helping him in that. They interact not with the Duma council, as  they are supposed to, but with him personally.    The first most important stage--the takeover of the Duma  apparat--may be considered a fait accompli. Which means: Its  tremendous transportation capabilities (up to the use of private  airlines); access to all government and military objects;  equipping their offices with all sorts of government  communications; the right to summon to the Duma any officials;  and so on.    Next on the agenda is the removal of the main political  opponent--B. Yeltsin. It is possible in principle? They need the  support of only 20-25 more deputies to reach the 298 votes  needed to impeach the president.  <H5>  The Kremlin and Its `Geniuses' </H5>   Let us leave the president himself outside our commentary.  As  is known, the retinue makes the king. How did it behave in the  amnesty incident? Presidential advisers G. Satarov and Yu.  Baturin undoubtedly are good as political scientists of the  "Itogi" program, but in this case, with the help of that same  television, they have demonstrated an inability to make  on-the-spot decisions. It was disappointing and strange to  realize that sometimes they did not know what was happening  right next to them.    The president's Chief of Staff, S. Filatov, did not make his  position clear, either. The same goes for R. Orekhov, chief of  the state-legal administration (GPU).    As is known, the style of B. Yeltsin's retinue is to react  frantically to events that have already happened. So today rush  preparations are being made for the president's television  address. The resignation of General Procurator A. Kazannik has  been accepted. It came to the point that the president finally  fired the head of the FCS [Federal Counterintelligence Service]  (formerly the KGB) N. Golushko. The investigative detention  facility in Lefortovo was under the latter's jurisdiction. Let  us remind our readers that B. Yeltsin had not dared to do this  even after the October events, when the MB [Ministry of  Security] demonstratively stayed out of the fray.  <H6>  * * * * </H6>   One very much wants to believe that the Kremlin is  conducting  a sophisticated and farsighted policy. But the doubt persists:  Are we not witnessing unpreparedness and confusion among the  Kremlin chiefs as we did in the beginning of the October  rebellion in Moscow?</p>

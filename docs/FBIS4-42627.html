			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Justice Minister Sabine </F> Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger by Alexandra Foederl-Schmid in  Rostock; date not given: "Uniform Laws Against Right-Wing  Extremists"]    [Text] [Foederl-Schmid] Violent clashes took place on the  occasion of the friendly soccer match between Austria and  Germany a few days ago. In your opinion, what should be done  against it?    [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] I deplore very much that such  friendly matches are overshadowed by such acts of violence. Of  course, one has to take consistent action against it, as has  also been done in Germany. This was partly done by calling in  the Public Prosecutor's Office. Of course, it is bad that  extreme right-wing motives also played a role in Austria. This  makes it clear how important it is that Germany and Austria take  joint action against this development.    [Foederl-Schmid] What is the joint course of action against  right-wing extremists supposed to be like?    [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] It is very important that we  cooperate with the police and judicial authorities and exchange  information. We have to sit back and watch cross-border  contacts developing increasingly frequently, not only with  Austria, but also with other European neighbors. We have to pay  even more attention to it than before. For me the German EU  [European Union] presidency will be an opportunity to try to  adjust the different criminal law provisions in the individual  European member states, that is, no European criminal law, but  the attempt to work toward a more uniform level than at present.    [Foederl-Schmid] Can you give an example?    [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] In some European member  states, it is currently not forbidden to produce Nazi symbols or  to print National Socialist ideas in newspapers. These products  enter the German market. In our country this is punishable, but  we do reach the people who produced it. They are in countries  where production is not punishable. Here one should try to  adjust the law among the states.    [Foederl-Schmid] Are the Austrian and the German judicial  authorities already cooperating now?    [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] We have close contacts. Only  a few days ago, talks among my state secretary, my Austrian  colleagues, and experts from the Justice Ministry took place.  The questions that have just been mentioned were also discussed  there.    [Foederl-Schmid] Can Austria be an example with its law  against right-wing extremism? For example, the Auschwitz lie  has been punishable for a relatively long time.    [Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger] We are also planning to make  the denial of the Holocaust punishable. According to my  assessment, the provisions in Germany and Austria are similar.  It will certainly be good if we also follow a joint course in  the EU and try to convince others of it.</p>

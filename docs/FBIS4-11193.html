			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ernesto Iraheta, party </F> representative of the Nationalist Republican Alliance at the  Cuscatanzingo Municipal Electoral Board, by station announcer  Raul Beltran -- live]    [Text] [Beltran] Attention, National Civilian Police. Your  presence is urgently required at the Cuscatanzingo Municipal  Electoral Board. We have reports that riots have just broken  out. Go ahead, Cuscatanzingo.    [Iraheta] We have had some problems here following the  conclusion of the final vote count for this municipality. The  Nationalist Republican Alliance [ARENA] won 46 of the 49 ballot  boxes.    [Beltran] Do you have a total vote count?    [Iraheta] No, we do not have a total vote count. The problem  occurred as we left the voting station. We were attacked by the  hordes of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front [FMLN].    [Beltran] What happened?    [Iraheta] A girl received a serious blow to the head.    [Beltran] Do you need an ambulance to move her?    [Iraheta] She has already been taken to the hospital. Her  name is Maria Victoria Santos Garcia.    [Beltran] Maria Victoria Santos Garcia. How old is she?    [Iraheta] I do not know. Three other party members were  attacked after that. Somebody shot at them with some kind of  short weapon. Fortunately they were not hit, but it was still a  precarious moment for them. We would like to call on the  Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] and the FMLN to remember that  democracy prevails now. Acts of violence and repression are  things of the past. We wish to call on these people to truly  join the democratic process by accepting ARENA's nationwide  victory. Thank you.    [Beltran] Thank you for your report.</p>

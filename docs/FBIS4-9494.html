			<p>BFN     [Text] In an interview on Khorizont's "Konkurenti"  [Competitors] program this morning, National Assembly Chairman  Aleksandur Yordanov said that the only way out of the political  situation that is developing is to hold early parliamentary  elections. He described everything else as halfhearted,  obscure, and vague. The country needs a government that has the  will to push the reform through, the speaker of parliament  stressed. He pointed out that the present problems are  connected with the policies of the majority, to which he himself  does not belong, so his conscience is clear.    Aleksandur Yordanov revealed his conviction that it is now  the turn of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] to make a move.  He said that the BSP should either commit itself more firmly to  the Lyuben Berov cabinet or it should withdraw its support,  pointing out that the BSP is waging a losing battle in either  case.</p>

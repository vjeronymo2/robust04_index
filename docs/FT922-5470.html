			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Cookery Courses: Self-raising standards for food aficionados  -All over Europe, FT writers have been slaving over hot stoves to pick some of the best courses for cooks SELECTING worthwhile cookery courses is becoming more tricky as their scope and numbers increase. Here, I have chosen a baker's dozen which should appeal to enthusiastic, amateur cooks: A Taste of Tuscany is a glorious introduction to the area. Hosted by food writer and historian Anna Del Conte, with Betsy Newell, experienced cookery tutor, it has been praised by participants for its happy mix of cuisine, culture, comfort and companionship. It is decidedly top end of the market. The party stays in four-star luxury at the Villa Areono on an estate complete with cypress-lined avenue, classical follies, its own winery, olive oil and wild boar. Wild mushroom hunts, comparative tastings, hands-on cooking, cookery demonstrations and talks are backed by excursions - exploring Florence's famous mercato centrale, sightseeing in Siena, and sampling some of the best eating houses in the region. There are only 18 places on each of the eight-day courses to be held in October. Cost: Pounds 1,450 per person including Heathrow-Pisa return flights and just about everything else except for the postcards you send home. Tasting Italy is Chiantishire again. Inevitably, there is some overlap with A Taste of Tuscany, but this is less luxe, more rustic. The course is based in a farmhouse where the large, airy bedrooms do not come automatically with bathrooms en suite. Young Italian chefs working in London take turns as instructor: Maddalona Bonino (ex 192, now putting fresh zip into Bertorelli's in Covent Garden), Francesco Zanchetta of Riva, and Claudio Percorari of Cibo. They may be joined by Lucia Bartolini, advocate of the Italian slow-cooking movement. Launched in the spring, with much rejoicing in the cornucopia of young peas, asparagus and artichokes, October sessions will concentrate on autumn produce. Cooking in the mornings, leisurely afternoons. Probably one dinner out and an after-dinner visit to a local sagra or festival, such as Marradi's sagra of the chestnut. The one-week courses in October are limited to 20 places and cost Pounds 795 per person including scheduled flights. Further south, where the sun lingers longer, Nicola Cox escorts groups of up to 24 to Amalfi for Fine Italian Cuisine in early November and February. The party stays at the four-star Luna Convento and morning classes are given by resident chef Eurico Franzese (ex-Cipriani in Venice and The Hassler in Rome and a TV personality). Basically, it is a demonstration of the dishes that go to make up that day's lunch. Explore Amalfi, visit Ravello, Positano and Sorrento in the afternoons. Marinated fresh anchovies and the exquisite semi-sweet lemons of the area are not to be missed. A six-day course costs Pounds 729 including flights but excluding drinks, and dinner on one 'free' evening. Count Tasca's Cookery Course is a rare opportunity to savour the remarkable haute cuisine of Sicily on a family estate 55 miles inland of Palermo where up to 12 participants can stay as house guests in the homes of Count Tasca's daughters. Maria Lo Monzo, the family chef, has worked in Count Tasca's kitchen for nearly 40 years. Three hours are spend in Lo Menzo's kitchen each morning. Afternoons are spent visiting archaeological sites or exploring the estate to see the production of ingredients - wheat, wines, olive oil, orchard fruit, vegetables, poultry, sheep meat and cheeses. Dinner is at the paterfamilias' table. Courses run from Monday evenings to Saturday mornings in early November and spring and Dollars 2,000 (Pounds 1,129.90) a person covers accommodation, all meals, wines and tuition. Gourmet breaks organised by Gencon chef-patron Andrew Daguin offer more than a mouth-watering taste of duck, goose, cassoulet and armagnac. Sunday evening to Wednesday morning 'specials', available from October to April, include visits to a marche au gras and the cellars of chateaux Cassaigne and Monluc, lunch in a ferme auberge, and cookery classes in the hotel's kitchen. Accommodation and hotel meals cost FFr2,850 and you will need your own car for the outings. Serious students prepared to knuckle down to long hours can apply for professional training courses over one or two weeks. Les Casseroles du Midi. Subject: Mediterranean cuisine du marche. Location: the rambling and comfortable provencal home of distiller Henri Manguin and his Italian-born wife Olga (ex chef-proprietor of Les Nattes in Avignon). Programmes and dates are a la carte and numbers are restricted to between four and six so events can be tailored to individual tastes. The unusual format involves daily shopping trips to Avignon market, cooking lunch and preparing dinner with afternoon outings. Favourite recipes include pesto soups, bouillabaisse, truffle omelette, artichauts a la barigoule, gras double, pieds et paquets, civets and daubes. Six-day courses available most months cost FFr1,000 (Pounds 101.21) per day. For luxury and exclusiveness, La Petite Cuisine in the Savoie is hard to beat. The setting is an 18th century chalet farmhouse outside Morzino. It sleeps eight, so you could join forces with friends to make it a private house party. Your tutor: Lyn Hall, director of Michel Roux's Waterside Inn cooking school. The programme: cooking in the mornings and some preparations for dinner; excursions to a Reblochon dairy, baker, Annecy market, a mountain farm. Cuisine: Savoyard rustic finesse influenced by neighbouring Val d'Aosta, Switzerland, and the haute cuisine of Lyon and Nantua - for example, warm goat's cheese mousse with extra virgin and basil sauce. Dates and cost: Seven nights in late June or September, Pounds 8.50. Hotelier Kit Chapman has organised a summer cookery weekend for July 9-12 at The Castle in Taunton, Somerset. Hotel comfort plus my favourite writer, Arabella Boxer, as guest speaker on English food of the '20s and '30s; cook-gardener Geraldene Holt on rare old-fashioned fruits, vegetables and herbs; a visit to Haten Court Victorian walled garden where produce is grown for the hotel; and resident chef Phil Vickery demonstrating fish cookery and barbecue lunch - weather permitting. Pounds 395 a person. Mary Berry's Aga Workshops offer the essential introduction to the Aga plus 'top up' sessions for Aga addicts: New Aga Owners, Making the Most of the Aga, More Adventurous Aga Cookery, Summer Parties, Buffets, Traditional or Gourmet Christmas, etc. One-day courses for a maximum of 18 in Mary's Buckinghamshire kitchen. A jolly and practical cook's day out. Closed in August. Cost: Pounds 68.15 including elevenses and lunch. Master chef Sonia Stevenson, founder of the acclaimed Horn of Plenty near Tavistock, Devon, ran occasional classes in her restaurant kitchen by customer demand. The Horn has been sold and Stevenson is now London-based, lecturing, doing consultancy work and giving short (2 1/2 to four-day) cookery courses at various UK venues. In other words, this outstanding itinerant teacher will travel to you providing a suitable kitchen is available. Stevenson specialises in sauces and fish cookery and takes six (or occasionally eight) people at a time. Participants tend to include as many men as women, absolute beginners and pros. I joined a sauce class and found it time well spent. This is serious stuff - and exhilarating. Not a minute passes without some gem of information being imparted. She starts by making you ruin a sauce to explore the nature of the ingredients. The 2 1/2  day course, including lunch on two days, costs Pounds 195 a person. I wrote about Carla Tomasi's Turnaround Cooks recently so this is a quick re-cap. Day classes include vegetarian cooking of all sorts, pasta, breads, Thai cooking, chocolate workshops. Also five-day intensive courses including visits to London markets such as Brixton and Spitalfields. Held in the kitchens over Books for Cooks in London's Notting Hill Gate: Pounds 50 including lunch for a day of fun. Loaves &amp; Fishes Cookschool &amp; Bookshop is yet another venture by former restaurateurs Angela Rawson and Nikki Routledge who served good, unpretentious food in a converted chapel at Rockley for several years and have written three cookbooks. Their Marlborough, Wiltshire, bookshop opens on June 1 and the kitchens on June 15. Courses will range from one to four days, covering many subjects. Fortes of their restaurant - likely to do well here, I think - include summer puddings, game cookery and traditional English puddings and pies. On the first Saturday of each month, there will be a children's cookery club for four- to seven-year-olds. One-day courses cost Pounds 62 including lunch. Young Cooks of Britain consists of hugely popular short cookery and activity holidays for 11/16-year-olds (in practice, mostly 12-14) held in a school near Chichester. Jam-packed schedules: rounders, swimming, tennis, optional riding, treasure hunt, quizzes, barbecue, visit to a restaurant's kitchens, plus plenty of hands-on and demonstration cookery classes. Midnight feasts, yes. Television, no. Session 1: August 24-28, with Sophie Grigson at the helm. Session 2: Aug 29-Sept 2, with Janet Laurence. Maximum 20 youngsters per session. Cost: Pounds 265.

			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DON'T SELL JORDAN DOWNS TO A DEVELOPER  </P> <P> Only in government do incompetents have the audacity to feel that they should  be rewarded.  </P> <P> A few weeks ago the L.A. Housing Authority announced that it had so mismanaged  and neglected the run-down 700-unit Jordan Downs Housing Project in  South-Central Los Angeles that the only solution would be to turn it over to a  "private developer." The agency said that only a "private developer" would be  able to repair the project and maintain it at a minimal level of habitability.  </P> <P> A close inspection of the few details that have been revealed shows that this  is a bad deal for the public. The city would turn over to a private developer,  at market value, the 40-acre parcel bordering the soon-to-be-completed Century  Freeway. Of that 40 acres, 85% is undeveloped. If the Century Freeway and the  expanded Watts Redevelopment Project are successful, the land could greatly  increase in value. And the private owners would be free to do whatever they  wished with the undeveloped land.  </P> <P> As for the housing project, the new owners would have to commit to repairing  the properties at an estimated cost of up to $14 million. But in return, the  developer would receive a huge government subsidy. Seven hundred Section 8  certificates would be supplied to the developer by the federal Department of  Housing and Urban Development and the city Housing Authority. These  certificates would provide a government-guaranteed income stream of well over  $420,000 a month. It is also estimated that the developer could receive as much  as $1.6 million a year in federal tax credits.  </P> <P> So the developer could make millions off the deal. But what about the public?  The public loses a vital low-income housing resource. In city hands, these  units would remain in the pool of low-income housing forever. In private hands,  they would be low income only so long as federal subsidies to the developer  require it. Currently, this is estimated at from 5 to 15 years.  </P> <P> The tenants, as always, are between a rock and a hard place. If they reject the  plan, the Housing Authority remains their landlord. This is the same landlord  who intentionally ignored their pleas of the last decade to repair Jordan  Downs, allowing it to become the terrible place that it is. But if the tenants  should accept the new private developer in return for some short-term repairs,  they would be confronted with a landlord whose only goal is profit. As a  result, many of the poorest and most needy would soon have no place to live.  </P> <P> Goldrich &amp; Kest, a large developer prominently mentioned as the potential  owner of the project, gave a hint to the tenants as to what to expect. "No  way," said a spokesman, "would they allow tenants to remain if they had been  delinquent in rent." Yet this is a project in which all of the families are  poor. Making ends meet is a daily struggle. Working with tenants in financial  difficulty is one of the challenges of public housing. But private landlords  have no time for these daily dilemmas. Thus lost welfare checks or other  financial crises will cause those families to be put out on the street,  expanding the numbers of the homeless, adding to the government shelter cost.  </P> <P> Will the Housing Authority protect its former tenants' interests? When asked,  its director said that she did not intend to "tie the hands" of the private  developer. Similarly, the City Council has shown little interest in the issue.  </P> <P> Yet there are alternatives. Money for repairs could be borrowed from  Redevelopment Agency funds. Or the Housing Authority could set up a nonprofit  corporation, or work with existing nonprofits, which could take advantage of  the same subsidies as the private for-profit developer. Better yet, the Housing  Authority could explore selling the units to the tenants themselves who, in  partnership with nonprofit housing developers, could take advantage of the same  subsidies to rehabilitate, repair and manage their property.  </P> <P> All of these alternatives would preserve the units as low-income housing.  However, these alternatives take time for study in a cooperative and respectful  environment. None of them can be accomplished in the reactive, crisis-like  atmosphere generated by the Housing Authority's inept handling of the present  proposal. The tenants have asked Mayor Tom Bradley to grant them a year's delay  to develop a proposal that will work. The tenants have also requested technical  assistance to be serious participants in the process. Assemblywoman Maxine  Waters (D-Los Angeles), whose district includes the project, has already  requested a similar delay.  </P> <P> By granting the tenants' request, the mayor could help change the atmosphere  from one of confrontation to cooperation. By working with the tenants, he could  create the possibility of innovative solutions. By questioning the present  proposal, he would send a strong signal to the public that government  incompetence should not be rewarded.  </P></p>

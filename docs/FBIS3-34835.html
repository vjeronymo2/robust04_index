Jassim al-Manai, chairman-designate of the Arab Monetary  Fund  (AMF), said economic ties hinged on the political relationship  between the two sides after they end hostility.    "It is difficult now to speculate about the role which  Israel  will play or how Arab countries will build their relations with  Israel and what is the shape of this relationship. But such a  relationship should be satisfactory for all parties," he told  the United Arab Emirates magazine Al-Shuruq.    "All this depends on the strategy of Arab countries after  the  establishment of peace and their ability to benefit from that  relationship," he added. "There should be a new Arab concept to  work from now to benefit from the coming stage in coordination  with the Arab League."    Arabs have voiced fears economic integration with Israel  will  enable it to dominate their economies given its superior  industrial power at a time when they are striving to boost their  industries to tackle their economic woes.    Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has proposed a Middle  East common market as a measure to boost confidence among the  parties involved and achieve prosperity in the volatile but rich  region.    Talk about a common market intensified after Israel and  Palestinians signed an autonomy agreement in Washington on  September 13. Syria and Jordan have also been involved in peace  negoitations with the Israelis.    But despite the progress, Arab governments have resisted  pressure from the United States and its western allies to end a  40-year old economic boycott against the Jewish State, arguing  the ban would be lifted only when Israel withdraws from the  occupied territories.    Egypt, tied with Israel in a 15-year old peace treaty, is  the  only Arab nation to have officially lifted the boycott, which  has cost Israel nearly 50 billion dollars in addition to large  losses by world companies blacklisted by Arab states for dealing  with it.    "The establishment of a comprehensive peace will have a  great  impact on the region," said Manai, whose Abu Dhabi-based AMF is  one of the Arab League's biggest financial organisations.    "It will boost investors' confidence and the region will  become an attractive centre for foreign capital. This will  benefit Arab states, especially those which need foreign  investment."    Egyptian economist Said al-Najjar, one of the best-known  economic experts in the Arab world, said he believed a Middle  East common market would see light although in the long-run.    "Such a market is not an inevitable result of peace but a  higher degree of economic cooperation which could be realised in  the far future," he told Al-Shuruq. "Arabs should concentrate in  the first stage on cooperation with Israel in joint projects in  the fields of water, energy and environment."</p>

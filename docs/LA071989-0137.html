Final  </P> <P> POLICE AWAITING RESULT OF DONNIE MOORE AUTOPSY  </P> <P> Police today were awaiting autopsy results for former California Angels star  relief pitcher Donnie Moore, who fatally shot himself in the head after  seriously wounding his wife during an argument in their Anaheim Hills home.  </P> <P> Tonya Moore, 35, the baseball player's wife, was hospitalized in critical  condition Tuesday with at least three gunshot wounds to the chest and abdomen;  her condition today was upgraded to serious, said Donna Donan-Drasner, director  of public affairs for Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Anaheim.

Initially, "the two boys were  doing pretty good," Johnson said, "but they had a sleepless night."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Parents Flying From Texas  </P> <P> Police investigators had no additional information about the shootings this  morning pending the release of Moore's autopsy results this afternoon, said  Anaheim Police Lt. Marc Hedgpeth.  </P> <P> The parents of both Tonya and Donnie Moore are flying to Orange County today  from their homes in Texas, Johnson said. Friends of the family, including  people from the Angels organization and Demetria's high school classmates, have  visited the hospital to offer assistance, Johnson said.  </P> <P> Funeral arrangements for Donnie Moore, 35, are pending until the Moores'  parents arrive.  </P> <P> "Right now, everyone is not really sure what to do," Johnson said. "It would be  easier if we had Tonya to make some decisions."  </P> <P> RELATED STORY: Page 8  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Excerpts] By the end of the year, the rate of inflation in  Russia is due to be seven to eight percent per month, while the  budget deficit will be no more than 10 percent of gross domestic  product. The dollar-ruble exchange rate is expected to reach  3,000 rubles to the dollar by the middle of the year and 4,000  to 4,500 rubles by the end of the year. This forecast was given  by Vladimir Petrov, first deputy minister of finance, at today's  hearings on the draft state budget at the State Duma. [passage  omitted]    The government is proposing a tight financial policy. The  main priority is to quickly suppress the inflationary process  and to achieve financial stabilization. The principal methods  are to cut state spending, to be strict about granting credit,  and to extend the deadline for repayment of debts. In this  context, the government intends to continue looking for  investment resources, to increase centralized capital  investment, and to attract resources accumulated in the private  sector. There will also be tight monitoring of the effective,  well-targeted use of state resources. It is expected that as  long as an active policy of economic stabilization is  implemented, the population's real monetary incomes will not  fall by a significant amount.    The government and parliament are organizing working groups,  which are planning to complete work on the budget by the end of  May. In the same month, the parliament and government will begin  working together on the 1995 budget. In other words, one may  conclude that the conditions have been created for constructive  cooperation between the two estates without conflict.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Assault on law'n'order The new home secretary is anxious to win the confidence of the police. There's a revelation for you. In most circumstances it would be information of the quality of 'dog bites man'. This week, however, it is significant. Let me explain. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the previous home secretary, is a rumbustious fellow; his approach to police reform was naturally combative. He was, say the constables with their celebrated tact, controversial. His translation to chancellor has so far been a public-relations success; hired as the best mouthpiece, or spreader of bovine fertiliser, in the government he has been spreading away as fast as he can, to general applause. This may assist in the process of selling the Treasury's economic policy, but it detaches him from the delicate task of restructuring Britain's police forces. We will therefore never know how the increasingly difficult relationship between Kenneth the Mouth and those very forces might have ended. His successor, Mr Michael Howard, is a quite different character. Where Mr Clarke is rough, Mr Howard is smooth. Where the chancellor is taken at his word, the home secretary will ever be judged by his actions. The former comes running at his opponents, knuckledusters rampant; the latter deploys an equally lethal, albeit often misleading, smile. Both are ambitious, but it is the relaxed Mr Clarke who seems to his colleagues to be acceptably so. By the standards of the present government, both show political ability. They fill two of the ministries collectively known as the great offices of state. The foreign secretary, the triple-A Mr Douglas Hurd, occupies the third. If any trio of colleagues can give the prime minister hope that his authority might be restored, this is it. Since the recent reshuffle much attention has been focused on Mr Clarke, who is there to rebuild faith in the government's economic management, and some on Mr Hurd, whose present purpose is to find a European policy around which the Conservative party can reunite. Yet if pure politics be the touchstone, Mr Howard's mission is also of some importance. It is, shortly stated, to counter the extremely effective offensive on law and order mounted by the Labour spokesman, Mr Tony Blair. Mr Blair has managed to convey the impression that, far from being soft on crime, he knows how to deal with thieves and thugs while the Tories do not. The new home secretary has been set the task of recapturing this area of policy so that it may resume its historic function as a Conservative stronghold. He will delight in this. He throws himself into these things. When he was environment secretary he went to Brazil and hugged a tree. I am reminded of the late Mr George Wallace, governor of Alabama, who in his early political life declared that he would not be 'out-segged' by any opponent who professed an allegiance to segregation. Mr Howard is not going to be out-law'n'ordered by anybody, not if he can help it. He will be obliged to rely on symbolic gestures. For there is not much he can do to reduce crime. Although he can tighten the law, in ways already signalled by Mr Clarke, the overall effect is unpredictable. The government may put a few young artful dodgers into 'secure accommodation' (which Mr Blair has long demanded). It may also make it easier to tackle 'new age' travellers. Hard professional criminals have little to fear. For the home secretary cannot significantly increase spending on the police; Mr Clarke's difficulty over the Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement probably requires the government to reduce it. The rate of burglaries will therefore continue to creep gently upwards; so will crimes of violence, albeit from a low base. I will not trouble you with numbers. As those who follow these matters are aware, there is no hokum to beat the pure hogwash of our national crime statistics. What counts politically is the quantity of media scare stories, and anecdotal evidence. Mr Howard's task, therefore, is to change the electorate's perceptions. This suggests a strategy of playing to the public's darkest fears and prejudices. Enter the side-handled baton. This first came to global prominence when it was used by Los Angeles police on Mr Rodney King. Police everywhere lust after it. We British would never contemplate such a fearsome weapon; it is so obtrusive. Mr Howard has, however, been presented with a fold-away, hide-away version of the cops' favourite new nightstick, and he has announced that the police may experiment with its use. Mr Blair has not demurred. All of this is a preliminary to what could be a difficult summer for the home secretary. The new chief of Scotland Yard, commissioner Paul Condon, has warned his staff that the Yard may have to make officers redundant, following the report of the inquiry into police responsibilities and rewards, headed by Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT Industries. This is expected soon. It is anticipated that Sir Patrick will propose the decimation of the upper ranks. This will put Mr Howard to the test. On his table will be recommendations for the greatest restructuring of police management since the war. He may take a while to think about it, but he will have to respond. Mr Condon has also warned of more 'market testing', which means gradual privatisation. There is a clash of purposes here. The home secretary's overriding task is to show Conservative voters that he, not Mr Blair, is the true friend of the law, the protector of safe streets and inviolate homes. His other pressing job is to persist with the challenge to the vested interests of the police federation and prison officers' association, two of the few remaining UK institutions that can make real trouble for the government. He will doubtless seek to reconcile these objectives by offering good redundancy packages, autonomy for local police captains, local budgetary control, and the like. If Mr Howard was a member of a secure government operating in a good year, the odds might be that he would make a success of the twin endeavours upon which he has embarked. But his experience may not be enough. He must also win the trust of both the police and the public, which means saying different things out of each side of his mouth. Perhaps he should apply to the chancellor for lessons in popular locution.</p>

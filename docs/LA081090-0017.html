			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CUTTING WATER USE AND DWP LEAKS  </P> <P> I would like to register my outrage at the way the new storm drain levy  schedule was calculated by the Los Angeles City Council (Aug. 1). Once again,  people who reside on large lot residential properties have been unfairly  singled out.  </P> <P> Isn't the sewer fee devised by the DWP bad enough?  </P> <P> The additional water used on our property goes into the ground, not into the  storm drains and certainly not into the sewers. Our trees, roses and other  shrubs (no pool) help the environment of this increasingly crowded, asphalted  and polluted city.  </P> <P> Indeed, what makes this entire situation so infuriating is that this same group  of geniuses (otherwise known as the City Council) just approved the paving of  the hills of Porter Ranch with 4,000 new homes and office buildings. No doubt  Councilman Hal Bernson will probably tell us that this grotesque project will  have little impact on the storm drains just like it isn't going to impact the  sewers, freeways, air and landfills. Sure, Hal.  </P> <P> LOREN ZELDIN  </P> <P> Reseda  </P></p>

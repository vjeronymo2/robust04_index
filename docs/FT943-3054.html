			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Haitian leaders defiant as invasion threat grows Haitian paramilitary recruits train in front of the presidential palace in Port-au-Prince as the threat of a US-led invasion to restore President Jean-Bertrand Aristide intensified. Leaders of the country's military junta warned yesterday that they would not give way to US threats but their ill-equipped and poorly trained army is not expected to offer much resistance to an invading force. In the US, defence secretary William Perry announced the call-up of about 1,700 reservists and President Bill Clinton met senior foreign policy and military advisers ahead of a televised address to the nation. Many political commentators urged him not to authorise the invasion. Report, Page 7</p>

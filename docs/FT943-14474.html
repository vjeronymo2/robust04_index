			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: CBS switches channels Comcast's move to acquire QVC certainly scores high marks for audacity. Its Dollars 2.2bn bid has already scotched the home shopping channel's rival plan to merge with CBS. Whether it is also a smart move is unclear. If Comcast flushes out a third bidder, it will be able to cash in its 15 per cent stake at a handsome profit. But if it ends up controlling QVC and chairman Mr Barry Diller - whose star status has boosted QVC's value - walks, the price-tag may look steep. Though Mr Diller's intentions are unknown, it is clear he feels QVC on its own is an insufficient vehicle for his talents - hence his plans to acquire Paramount and merge with CBS. With both schemes dead, Mr Diller could cash in his QVC shares and options. He could then cast around for another vehicle into which to inject both his talent and his capital. An accommodation with Comcast cannot be ruled out - though it would presumably have to involve turning QVC into something grander than a home-shopping channel. Meanwhile, CBS may now receive attention from other suitors. Chairman Mr Larry Tisch has done nothing to discourage the impression that he would welcome offers. Yesterday's decision by CBS to buy back Dollars 1.1bn of its own shares is a sign that Mr Tisch is looking to cash in his large stake. He has even given interested parties a price to aim at. Anything over the buy-back price of Dollars 325 a share would presumably be acceptable. The problem is that CBS has effectively been up for sale for some time and the only suitor to emerge has been Mr Diller. If Mr Tisch really wants out, he may have to lower his price.</p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Stocking up - Appetisers Anne Petch, of Heal Farm was, I think, one of the first farmers to start selling traditionally reared meats (fresh, cured and recipe products) by special overnight delivery nationwide. Now she has come up with a natural extension to that range, 'home-made' stocks. Rich pork jelly stock is already available, with lamb and beef stock to follow shortly. She recommends refrigerating the stock on receipt for no longer than two days or freezing it for up to three months - if you can resist tucking in that long. Heal Farm, Kings Nympton, Umberleigh, Devon EX37 9TB. Tel: 0769 574341. Fax: 0769-572839. St Patrick's day celebrations continue with the launch of the 1993 editions of John and Sally McKenna's prizewinning Bridgestone guides: The Irish Food Guide; 100 Best Restaurants in Ireland; 100 Best Places to Stay in Ireland; and 100 Best Places to Eat in Dublin. If you rejoice in good food, fun and feisty prose, it would be a crying shame to visit Ireland without at least one of them. From good bookshops and direct by mail from the McKennas at Estragon Press, Coom Keen, Durras, Co Cork. Tel and fax: 027-61186. Elderly dons donning an apron for the first time, aspiring lads and lasses fresh from school, professional caterers, housewives and pen-pushers like myself are just some of those who have benefited from lessons given by Sonia Stevenson, former chef-proprietor of the Horn of Plenty restaurant. Fish cookery and sauces are her speciality. Classes are limited to eight pupils. Courses run from 1-2 1/2 days midweek, also weekends. Forthcoming venues include Cullompton in Devon, Inverness and Wimbledon. For details contact: Sonia Stevenson, The Old Chapel, Bethany, Trerulefoot, nr Saltash, PL12 5DA. Tel: 0752-851813. And now . . . English eau de vie from Wootton Vineyard in Somerset. Somerset Eau de Vie is made by distilling young wine and ageing it for a few months in cask. The result is extremely successful with a good flavour. Retail price around Pounds 14.75 for 50cl. Inquiries to Major Colin Gillespie on 0749-890359.</p>

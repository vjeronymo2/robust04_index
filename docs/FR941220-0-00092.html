Labor condition application filing dates <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (See &sect; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .730(b).) Through administration and enforcement of the program, the Department has become aware that some employers are filing labor condition applications for periods of anticipated employment which are well in the future ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  one year after the application filing date). This practice poses dangers of abuse and may frustrate Congressional intent for the protection of the jobs and wages of U.S. workers. The prevailing wage, strike/lockout, and notice obligations are based, in large part, upon actions taken and conditions which exist at the time the labor condition application is filed. Therefore, the Department is clarifying the amount of time in advance of the beginning date of the period of employment that an employer may file a labor condition application. This Final Rule requires that a labor condition application can be filed no earlier than 6 months before the beginning date of the period of employment. Labor condition applications which are received by an ETA regional office more than 6 months prior to the beginning date of the period of employment will be returned to the employer as unacceptable for filing. This procedural change will impose few, if any, additional burdens on employers and will facilitate the achievement of the statutory purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.

As the program has evolved, the Department is aware that inconsistent and perhaps confusing interpretations have, on occasion, been provided to public inquiries concerning the Department's enforcement position on the employer's responsibilities under the ``actual wage'' provisions of the statute and regulation. To rectify any misunderstanding with the regulated community, the Department is providing the following guidance regarding its enforcement policy concerning the determination of the actual wage under the Final Rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In determining the required wage rate, the employer must not only obtain the prevailing wage, but also establish the actual wage for the occupation in which the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant is employed by the employer. For purposes of establishing its compensation system for workers in an occupational category, of course, an employer may take into consideration objective standards relating to experience, qualifications, education, specific job responsibility and function, specialized knowledge, and other legitimate business factors. The use of any or all these factors is at the discretion of the employer. The employer must have and document an objective system used to determine the wages of non-H&hyph;1B workers, and apply that system to H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants as well. It is not sufficient for the employer simply to calculate an average wage of all non-H&hyph;1B employees in an occupation; the ``actual wage'' is not an ``average wage.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The documents explaining the system must be maintained in the public disclosure file. The explanation of the compensation system must be sufficiently detailed to enable a third party to apply the system to arrive at the actual wage rate computed by the employer for any H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant. The computation of the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant's individual actual wage rate shall be documented in the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant's personnel file. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the event the employer has not developed and documented an objective system and/or has not calculated the actual wage rate for an H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant, the Administrator_in determining the actual wage rate for enforcement and back wage computation purposes_Wage and Hour may need to average the wages of all non-H&hyph;1B workers who are employed in the same occupation, rather than make determinations for each individual H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant; the employer in such circumstances would be cited for failure to comply with the requirements for determination of the actual wage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

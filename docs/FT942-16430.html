			<p>940411 FT  11 APR 94 / WHO urges drugs groups to develop Aids vaccine Drugs companies should concentrate their efforts on developing a vaccine for Aids, the World Health Organisation said yesterday. Most pharmaceuticals companies are working on Aids treatments such as Wellcome's AZT, rather than vaccines, which immunise in advance of infection. Last week AZT, still the leading Aids drug, was shown in trials to have little if any effect on people infected with the virus who do not yet have the disease. The change to vaccines should come even though 'pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have been reluctant to become fully committed to the development of an HIV vaccine', said Dr Peter Piot, WHO's director of research and intervention development. He backed up his message with the organisation's latest estimate for the spread of HIV. 'Well over 14m adults and a further 1m infants have been infected with HIV. As of 31 December 1993, over 850,000 Aids cases had been reported.' About two thirds of cases are in sub-Saharan Africa, but the region where the infection is spreading fastest is now south east Asia. 'Five years ago, fewer that 200 people in Thailand were known to be infected. By late 1993 (the figures was) over 500,000,' he said 'In most areas, heterosexual transmission is now by far the predominant mode of spread,' he said. In some parts of the region, HIV is believed to be spreading as fast as it did in Africa a decade ago.' Dr Piot acknowledged that science did not fully understand the Aids virus and that he saw 'signs of discouragement among those working on vaccine development'. Nevertheless, a vaccine was needed to complement existing strategies of containment through the use of condoms and viricides. These strategies had worked well in Europe, with condom use among Swiss aged between 17 and 30, for example, rising from 8 per cent in 1987 to more than half in 1992. In the US, the story was more mixed with rapidly rising rates of infection in inner city populations.</p>

			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Bank imposes new curbs on Hyundai companies NEW CREDIT restrictions were imposed yesterday on 10 companies in South Korea's Hyundai industrial group by their main bank, Korea Exchange Bank (KEB). KEB will not approve property purchases or industrial investments by the companies until they recover money lent to Mr Chung Ju-yung, the Hyundai founder, and his family in February. The finance ministry last month warned that it would impose the financial sanctions if the companies did not submit a timetable by mid-April for recovering the Won248bn (Dollars 180m) borrowed by the Chung family. No repayment schedules were filed, although the Chungs repaid Won51bn of the amount in shares last month. The KEB said the loans should be repaid in cash instead of shares. The companies affected by the new credit restrictions include Hyundai Engineering and Construction. Although the decision is considered linked to the government's political feud with Mr Chung, the finance ministry said it is also examining whether the family owners of South Korea's 30 biggest conglomerates have also borrowed funds from their companies for personal purposes, a practice that was banned in February. Mr Chung is believed to used the borrowed funds to help finance his new anti-government political party, the Unification National Party.</p>

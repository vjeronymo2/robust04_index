			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of Dutch Banking and Finance (5): Man in the street is a reluctant shareholder - Sell-off fails to excite public The small Dutch shareholder - the proverbial 'man in the street' - was consciously targeted in June when the government sold off its first tranche of shares in Koninklijke PTT Nederland (KPN), the country's telecommunications and postal company. For the first time in a Dutch flotation, private investors were offered a discount to the price paid by institutional investors. The inducement was considered essential because Dutch households, unlike their counterparts in the UK or even France, have never mustered much enthusiasm for buying shares. The 5 per cent discount, limited to the first 75 shares, attracted considerable attention but did not, in the end, result in the participation of up to 500,000 small investors, as forecast at one point by the Dutch government. Instead, some 188,500 private investors took part, of whom 31,000 were KPN employees. Wim Dik, KPN's chairman, said recently, 'Of course, the issue was three times oversubscribed, but expectations that the KPN share would immediately become a 'people's share' were not realised.' The chairman of the stock exchange, Baron Boudewijn van Ittersum, also acknowledged that the number of new investors was relatively low, but added that the publicity may have the long-term effect of persuading people to consider share purchases another time. 'Until recently, share ownership was seen as something for the 'happy few'. After the KPN issue, it can be seen as an activity for the entire population,' he said. Explanations for the lower-than-expected level of enthusiasm abound. They range from the mundane - the public's irritation with saturation advertising for the shares - to the essential conservatism of the Dutch, their preference for collective savings through pension schemes and impediments created by the country's tax structure. The answer may be more simple. Wilco Jiskoot, senior executive vice-president at ABN Amro, the Dutch bank which lead-managed the global share offering, said: 'The foremost factor was the general climate on the bourse itself.' In the weeks leading up to the issue, the Amsterdam Stock Exchange had softened and was well down on the peaks it had reached earlier in the year. Mr Jiskoot also noted that, in contrast to some other European privatisations which have been done at almost 'give-away' prices, the KPN issue was fairly priced, reflecting the government's goal of getting optimum value for its shares. In contrast to disappointment about private shareholder participation expressed by the government and KPN, ABN Amro said the final result was roughly in line with its own expectations and its internal analysis of the Netherlands's pool of private shareholders. Mr Jiskoot said a distinction must be drawn between real newcomers to the business of investing in shares and the roughly 200,000 Dutch private investors who have regular experience of actively selling and buying shares. Although definitive, combined figures are not available from the various Dutch banks that belonged to the flotation syndicate, ABN Amro estimates that 20,000 to 30,000 new share investors were attracted to the KPN issue. Mr Jiskoot agrees individual Dutch households are still less likely to buy shares than in some other countries but, on balance, private share ownership is nevertheless considerable in the Netherlands. 'The overall situation is not all that different from other countries,' he said. 'The number of active investors is smaller, but their combined holdings in shares are not at all that small.' There are signs of greater public interest in share investments. Since 1990, investment funds, or mutual funds, have become a popular investment vehicle for Dutch households, and most of the leading Dutch banks now offer such funds, as do such traditional participants as the Rotterdam-based Robeco investment group. Nevertheless, the relative reticence of small Dutch investors to buy shares is mirrored by the relatively limited ownership of shares among the Netherlands's big and powerful pension funds. Although the country's pension funds are gradually stepping up their equity purchases, shares account for less than 30 per cent of the average fund's invested assets, which tend to be heavily weighted towards bonds, particularly Dutch government bonds and, to a lesser extent, real estate. In other countries, particularly in the US or the UK, it is not uncommon for shares to make up half of total assets. Again, part of the explanation lies in innate Dutch caution and conservatism. Another factor is that, unlike US or UK fund managers, Dutch pension funds are not normally confronted with quarterly measurements of their investment performances. This may avoid the tendency towards 'short-termism' that is sometimes attributed to foreign institutional investors, but it may also mean that Dutch funds are less motivated to boost their results by investing more heavily in shares. A frequently-cited explanation for Dutch attitudes to investing in shares is the country's tax system. Han Kleiterp, the former chairman of merchant bank MeesPierson, the big civil servant pension fund, has emerged as a determined critic of the double-taxation of distributed profits in the Netherlands through, first, corporate tax and then tax on dividends. Mr Kleiterp, who in May became chairman of Algemeen Burgelijk Pensioenfonds (ABP), the Dutch civil servants' pension fund which ranks as one of the world's largest, argues that the low level of distributed profits acts as a disincentive for private investors to hold shares. In an analysis released earlier this year, he showed that the top 29 listed companies, excluding Royal Dutch/Shell, paid out only 29 per cent of net profits in cash dividends in 1990-92. This compares with more than 60 per cent in the US, more than 50 per cent in the UK and around 40 per cent in Germany. The tax system makes it attractive for Dutch companies to offer shareholders an optional dividend in the form of new shares. But Mr Kleiterp noted that this effectively allowed companies to do a public share offering without the necessity of publishing a prospectus or undergoing the discipline of market reaction to a share expansion. Criticism of the tax system is shared by the University of Amsterdam's Foundation for Economic Research, which in a series of reports has blamed the fiscal treatment of distributed profits for the fact that the Amsterdam bourse has traditionally faced lower price-earnings ratios than fellow exchanges such as Frankfurt, Zurich, London and Paris.</p>

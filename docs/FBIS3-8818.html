Radovan  Karadzic said, the progovernment newspaper TA NEA reports, that  he would soon visit Athens and suggest to Greek Prime Minister  Andreas Papandreou that solutions to the war in Bosnia should be  regarded as the EU's priority task. Karadzic will demand of  Papandreou that Greece, in its capacity as EU president, should  press for restarting the Geneva peace negotiations. As TA NEA  stresses, the president of the Srpska republic expressed  disappointment with the fact that the United States has taken a  lead in resolving the crisis in Bosnia by bypassing the United  Nations. Radovan Karadzic said he would like to see a solution  for Bosnia taking place within Greece's EU Presidency mandate.  Asked by Greek reporters about his views on the West's  continuing habit of stubbornly bringing pressure to bear on the  Serbs and threating them with military action, Karadzic said the  Serbs would no longer accept any ultimatums. In Karadzic's  words, the recent NATO ultimatum was knocking on an open door as  it was a well-known fact that three days before that the Serbs  had agreed to demilitarization with the UN secretary general's  special envoy, Yasushi Akashi. The Greek reporters asked  Karadzic about his opinion of the crisis between Athens and  Skopje. The president of the Srpska republic regards Athens'  policy towards Skopje as correct. He stressed that The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] has a future only if it  joins the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in some form of  confederation -- something that would ensure the preservation of  its integrity.</p>

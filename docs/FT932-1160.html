			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Anger at Bonn's oil tax rise plan THE German industry federation (DBI) yesterday issued an outraged warning against government plans to raise the tax on oil products following an agreement by the leaders of Germany's coalition parties. The BDI said an increased tax burden on car drivers would be 'absolutely counter-productive'. It warned that the move 'will sharpen the downturn in the automobile industry and will have negative consequences for the whole economy'. But the government, in desperate need of additional revenues, seems determined to go ahead with the taxes. Coalition leaders meeting representatives of their parliamentary groups yesterday agreed to increase the petrol tax by 16 pfennig, from the current 92pf per litre, starting on January 1. The diesel tax is to go up by 7pf from its current 54pf per litre. The government coalition is expected formally to ratify the planned increases today, after which legislation will be introduced for parliamentary approval. The coalition will also discuss the introduction of a controversial plan to have motorists pay for using the German motorway network through the use of a vignette (tax sticker) which motorists would have to display. The sharp oil tax rises will provide the federal government with DM8.5bn (Dollars 5bn) a year. The funds are to be used for restructuring the loss-making railways and improving motorways. The move represents a last-ditch effort by Chancellor Helmut Kohl to raise tax revenues before federal elections next year. Long-distance road hauliers are also up in arms against the planned increase in the diesel tax, warning that 'it would destroy any positive effect' from the deregulation of the EC road haulage market. The EC transport ministers agreed at the weekend on a common system for charging lorries for using EC roads. In Germany, taxes on lorries are to be halved to be closer to similar taxes in other European countries. But German hauliers have repeatedly warned that the deal would have no positive consequences if diesel taxes were subsequently increased.</p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Debt-laden USAir asks for cash with Dollars 260m new shares offer USAIR, the US airline in which British Airways invested Dollars 300m for a potential 19.9 per cent voting interest earlier this year, is continuing efforts to improve its debt-laden balance sheet with an offering of up to Dollars 260m-worth of ordinary shares. The company said yesterday it plans to sell 10m new shares to investors  - or up to 11.5m, if underwriters' overallotment options are added in. Hampered by its poor financial condition and uncertainty over its future, USAir has not tapped the equity market since 1987 - in contrast to larger US competitors like American, United and Delta Air Lines - although it has sold debt securities. USAir filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday. The document suggested the maximum offering price for the new shares would be Dollars 22.50. At this price and assuming the full 11.5m shares are taken up, the issue could raise just under Dollars 260m. Yesterday, USAir shares - which were suspended briefly on the New York Stock Exchange - closed down Dollars 1 at Dollars 21 3/4 . USAir's filing was vague about the reasons for the offering, saying only the proceeds would be used for 'general corporate purposes'. But most of the Dollars 300m which the carrier received from BA went towards paying down its Dollars 600m revolving credit facility. USAir's long-term debt at end-1992 stood at over Dollars 2bn. Under its investment agreement with USAir, British Airways has certain rights to buy shares of preferred stock, convertible into USAir common stock, to maintain its underlying interest when the US carrier goes ahead with an equity issue. But yesterday morning the UK-based airline was considering how to respond to USAir's announcement and had no comment on whether those rights would be exercised. USAir's offering comes in the wake of a rally in US airline stocks and amid much new stock offering in the US. In the first quarter, for example, corporate America raised around Dollars 22bn in new equity issues - slightly more than in the same period of 1992. The fillip in airline shares reflects hopes that the US government's attention to the industry's problems and the absence of savage domestic price-wars may allow stronger carriers to return to profitability this year.</p>

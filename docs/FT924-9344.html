			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Price slide alarms Opec ministers NORTH SEA oil prices dipped below Dollars 19 a barrel yesterday to their lowest level since April, but recovered after reports that the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries was considering taking steps to stop the price slide. Brent crude for December delivery ended yesterday at Dollars 19.30, up 20 cents on the day. Earlier, it had fallen to Dollars 18.90. Oil prices had fallen from about Dollars 20.80 two weeks ago to between Dollars 19.30 and Dollars 19.50 early in the week, as rumours of production increases by Iran, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait led to fears that oil supply and demand might not be as closely balanced this winter as analysts had forecast. The fears were compounded by surveys which estimated Opec production in October at between 25.1m and 25.3m b/d in October - well above the 'market share' of 24.2m b/d, plus some extra for Kuwait, Opec agreed in September. Prices were depressed further on Wednesday by the latest figures for US oil stocks from the American Petroleum Institute which showed a rise of 3.64m barrels, compared with an expected rise of only 1m to 2m barrels. They slipped below key support at Dollars 19 a barrel yesterday, before reports that Opec ministers were consulting by telephone and telex pushed prices back up. The Reuter news agency quoted Opec sources as saying that ministers were discussing taking action to curb excess supply, or convening a special meeting before the next scheduled Opec conference on November 25. Mr Joe Stanislaw, managing director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said the increase in stocks was caused by higher-than-expected Opec production in September and October that had occurred ahead of demand. 'If we had a two-week cold snap, you could see prices go back to what they were before,' he added.</p>

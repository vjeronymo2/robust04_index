			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / CBI calls for law against 'squatting' THE CONFEDERATION of British Industry has called for 'squatting' in commercial buildings to be made a criminal offence. It says 'squatting' in shops, factories and offices is costing UK companies thousands of pounds a year. In Scotland offenders can be fined or jailed for 'squatting' in commercial or residential property. In England and Wales the only remedy is an expensive and time-consuming civil action.</p>

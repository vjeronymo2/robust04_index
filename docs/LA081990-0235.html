			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'COLOR' IT CRUDE  </P> <P> I found the show "In Living Color" to be amateurish, crude, racist and very  offensive. The sexually suggestive scenes should not have been included at a  time when children could normally be expected to watch TV.  </P> <P> Tomas Eiser, Canoga Park  </P></p>

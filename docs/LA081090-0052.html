			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> ELEGANT SHOW BY O'ROURKE  </P> <P> There are more than a few good musicians populating the Los Angeles jazz scene  who, for this reason or that one, don't get the recognition they deserve.  Pianist Brian O'Rourke should be taken off that list pronto.  </P> <P> In an appearance with bassist Ernie McDaniel and drummer Kenny Dennis at  Chadney's in Burbank Wednesday, O'Rourke delivered renditions of classic pop  and jazz standards that were marked by abundant spirit, solid musicianship and  a sense of teamwork among the participants.  </P> <P> The youthful pianist, who has been heard with Jack Sheldon, Frank Sinatra Jr.  and Gerald Wilson, employs a light touch and a quick-think technique, and he  dances about the keyboard with an Astaire-like elegance, leaving shimmering  melodies scattered like sequins in his wake. He uses a lot of body language as  he improvises, cocking his head to his right when he gets into a cooking  groove, pulling back from the keyboard -- as if to better examine what he's  playing -- when he executes a lickety-split line, and bouncing his torso in  tempo on the medium-paced tunes. It's obvious he enjoys his chosen line of  work.  </P> <P> Charlie Parker's "Scrapple From the Apple" exemplified O'Rourke at his best. He  delivered the melody with a contrapuntal bass line that, if you listened  closely, was another melody, that of "Honeysuckle Rose," the tune from which  three quarters of "Scrapple" is harmonically derived. His solo included a  bluesiness reminiscent of Oscar Peterson, ringing parallel octaves of stunning  facility and chordal passages that rapidly moved down, then up, then back down  again, like a child devising a creative way to hop two-legged down the stairs.  </P> <P> Dennis and McDaniel were essential components to the success of the show that  also included "I Thought About You" and "Take the 'A' Train." The bassist's big  sound provided lush low-end support for O'Rourke's improvisations, and Dennis'  crisp drum work added rhythmic encouragement.  </P> <P> With more exposure as a leader, Brian O'Rourke, who plays tonight with Dennis'  trio at the Biltmore Hotel's Grand Avenue Bar, could easily become one of the  mainstays of L.A.'s jazz mainstream.

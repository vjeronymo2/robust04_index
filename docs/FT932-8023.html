			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / International Bonds: Denmark three-year issue struggles in spite of Yes vote DENMARK'S hopes of catching a wave of enthusiasm following Tuesday's Yes vote on the Maastricht treaty were dashed, due to the widespread perception that the Kingdom's Ecu250m three-year issue was priced too tightly. The deal, arranged by Morgan Stanley, offered a yield of seven or eight basis points below the yield of the UK's three-year Ecu notes. Given that the UK is a AAA credit, while Denmark's debt is a notch lower at AA1/AA+, the issue was considered over-aggressive, even though the target audience of European retail investors often focus on coupon rather than yield spread. However, Morgan Stanley pointed out that the UK notes were trading at a premium of several points to their par value, which for three-year paper represented several basis points in yield. However, the pricing was not the only problem: the Ecu bond market, instead of rallying on the news of the referendum result, appeared to have fully discounted the event, and was hit by a brief spell of profit-taking. A number of banks turned down invitations to underwrite the issue. They described the deal as 'far too tight' and 'the last thing the market needed'. However, Mr Michael Dee, head of debt syndicate at Morgan Stanley, defended the decision to launch the issue. 'The Ecu market continues to be technically in good shape, and we are confident in doing a deal that others consider aggressive,' he said. He added that he expected the deal to be placed with continental European retail investors. Denmark is using the proceeds of the offering to refinance an existing Ecu250m issue of 7 5/8 per cent bonds due 1996, which are now callable. In the sterling convertible bond market, Allied Lyons' Dollars 200m issue of subordinated convertible bonds met reasonable demand from continental European investors, who have been the mainstay of the recent increase of activity in the market. The conversion price, set at 622p, 17.8 per cent above the current share price, was in line with other recent offerings. However, dealers said that the wave of supply in the sector had eroded some of the initial enthusiasm, which had been fuelled by positive sentiment on sterling, as well as the outlook for UK equities. In the asset-backed sector, a further Pounds 108m of bonds backed by vehicle hire purchase receivables of Chartered Trust was issued by CARS 2, a special purpose vehicle. ABN AMRO Holding is planning to issue its first deal in the Yankee bond market, a Dollars 250m, 30-year subordinated issue.</p>

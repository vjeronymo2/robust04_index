			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c) The county ASC committee shall:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Review the newly determined yield;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Adjust the established yield, if the new yield is less than 90 percent of the current established yield for the crop; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Consider adjusting the current established yield for the crop if both of the following apply:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The new determined yield is 90 percent or more of the current established yield for the crop; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The conditions initiating the reduced yield justify such adjustment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Producers on a farm who have the yield for a crop temporarily reduced may file a request for reconsideration of such reduced yield. Production evidence that indicates that the actual yield exceeds the temporarily reduced yield must be provided by the producer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) If such production evidence indicates that the actual yield justifies an increase in the temporarily reduced yield, such increased yield may not exceed the program payment yield established for the crop for a farm before the temporary reduction, irrespective of such actual yield.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) If a temporary yield is increased, such increase must be approved by a representative of the State committee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) With respect to farms with repeat cropping, the total plantings of the crop shall be considered as the crop acreage. Temporary yield reductions may be made by the county committee with respect to the acreage of the second planting if the yield originally established for the farm was based on a history of a single planting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) If a producer plants either corn or grain sorghum on the permitted acreage of either corn or grain sorghum, respectively, and the county committee determines that the crop planted was cared for in an unworkmanlike manner, and the other crop was earning payments;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A percentage of the reduced production of the crop cared for in an unworkmanlike manner shall be determined, and the yield for the crop earning deficiency payments shall be reduced by the determined percentage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The producer may submit to the county committee actual production evidence for approval to increase such that was reduced yield for the crop.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart E_Crop Acreage Bases <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1413.24  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Crop acreage bases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) A CAB shall be established for a farm for each year for barley, corn, grain sorghum, oats, rice, upland cotton, ELS cotton, and wheat. With respect to the 1994 and 1995 crops of corn and grain sorghum, the permitted acreages of corn and grain sorghum for a farm shall be combined. Separate corn and grain sorghum crop acreage bases shall be calculated for the purpose of making deficiency payments in accordance with &sect;1413.104, and for planted and considered planted credit, in accordance with &sect;1413.11. Producers may plant any combination of corn and grain sorghum on the total of the combined permitted acreages for such crops.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, the CAB for each program crop of wheat, barley, corn, grain sorghum, and oats, for the 1991 and subsequent crop years shall be the number of acres that is equal to the average of the acreage planted and considered planted to the program crop for harvest on the farm in each of the 5 crop years preceding the crop year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) For upland cotton and rice, except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, the CAB shall be equal to the average of the acreages planted and considered planted to such crop for harvest on the farm in each of the 3 crop years preceding such crop year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) If the county committee determines that a crop is grown on a farm in a clearly established crop-rotation pattern for 2 or more years, the acreage base established for such crop will be determined by using the average of the planted and considered planted acreages for the 3 immediately preceding crop years in the rotation cycle that corresponds to the current year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) The sum of the CAB's for a farm for a crop year shall not exceed the cropland for the farm, except to the extent that such excess is due to an established practice of doublecropping on the farm, according to paragraph (f) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Acreages on a farm shall be considered to be double cropped if in the same crop year on the same acreage any of the following apply:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sao Paulo, 26 May (AE) -- Foreign Minister Celso  Amorim and Industry Ministry officials are debating the creation  of legislation to allow the Brazilian Government to stem big  flows of imported products. Amorim is concerned about the  excessive importation of some products following the opening of  the economy. Under the new legislation, the Industry Ministry  might establish quotas on products for which importation is  considered excessive. During a GAZETA MERCANTIL-sponsored  seminar entitled "The New Map of World Commerce," Amorim  emphasized that Brazil must have appropriate instruments to  fight commercial dumping. The minister said the U.S. Department  of Commerce has 600 employees working in the anti-dumping area,  while Brazil has only four or five professionals.</p>

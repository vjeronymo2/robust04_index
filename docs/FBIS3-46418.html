			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jerusalem, 27 Jan (XINHUA) -- 'Oded Ben-'Ami,  adviser to Israeli Prime Minister and Defense Minister Rabin,  announced here today that Rabin had accepted the recommendation  from Israeli military authorities and gave the Israeli Air Force  his concurrence to purchase U.S.-made F15-I jet fighters.    The F15-I jet fighter, manufactured by the U.S. Lockheed  Aircraft Company, is a model of the F15-E which the company  builds especially for Israel. Many consider the F15-E the most  advanced jet in the world today.    Ben Ami said purchasing the F15-I fighters will improve the  "qualitative superiority" of the Israeli Air Force.    It was reported that before Rabin made his decision, Israel  compared the costs, capabilities, and other aspects of candidate  planes in accordance with Israel's defense needs. Among the  candidates were McDonnell's naval aircraft -- the F/A18 Hornet  -- and Lockheed's F-16 double-seat fighter, with the latter  being more favored.    When U.S. President Clinton met with Rabin in Washington  last  October, he said the U.S. Government would consider exporting  F15-E's to Israel; he also agreed to transfer the technology,  which was unprecedented. In November, Clinton wrote to Rabin  indicating he supported the project.</p>

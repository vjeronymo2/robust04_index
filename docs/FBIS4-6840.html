			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 23 (YONHAP) -- Following the abrupt  resignation of Yi Hoe-chang as prime minister Friday afternoon,  public attention shifted Saturday to the timing and scope of the  inevitable cabinet reshuffle that is expected within a few days.  Stunned by the unexpected end of the Yi Hoe-chang cabinet after  only 128 days, top government and ruling party officials awaited  follow-up measures by President Kim Yong-sam.    Kim has already designated deputy prime minister and head of  the National Unification Board (NUB) Yi Yong-tok as his new  prime minister after accepting Yi Hoe-chang's resignation. The  president must now fill the NUB post and possibly reshuffle a  number of cabinet ministers.    Keen public interest is focusing on who will replace Yi  Yong-tok at the NUB. The first name mentioned by many analysts  is Chief Presidential Secretary Pak Kwan-yong, who is widely  recognized as an expert on North Korean affairs. In addition to  this expertise, Pak is a good bet for the deputy premiership  given his stature at Chongwadae [presidential office] and within  the ruling circle.    A spate of misjudgements, confusion and questionable  decisions has plagued diplomatic and national security policy  since the inauguration of the Kim administration in February  last year. Pak is among the very few deemed able to straighten  out the situation as he has stayed close to Kim Yong-sam over  the past 14 months. He has not only assisted the president on  unification and other inter-Korean problems but also served as  "a bridge" among the various ministries.    In this regard, Pak is highly qualified for the job of  deputy  premier and head of the National Unification Board, some senior  officials at the ruling Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] believe.  Others in the DLP, however, say that the current situation was  created by the prime minister's resignation alone, and therefore  replacing Yi Hoe-chang should be enough. The president should  not change his chief secretary, they add.    Along with Pak Kwan-yong's immediate future, attention is  also centering on the scope and timing of the cabinet reshuffle.  A lot depends on whether Pak remains at Chongwadae, however. If  the chief presidential secretary stays on, many observers  believe that two or three ministers, including the deputy  premier, will be changed.    Speculation has it that Labor Minister Nam Chae-hui could  take over the NUB portfolio. In that event, there is a slight  chance that Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and the senior  presidential secretary for foreign and national security  affairs, Chong Chae-uk, who have both contributed to confusion  in the government's foreign and North Korea policy, could be  replaced.    One senior ruling party official pointed out that since the  current cabinet was formed only five months ago, the president  will probably just patch it up a bit. If Yi Yong-tok is quickly  approved as prime minister by the National Assembly on Monday,  Kim is expected to present his credentials on the same day and  go right to work on a limited cabinet shake-up, he said. But  since the Democratic Party has already said it will resist Yi  Yong-tok's appointment, it is difficult to speculate what kind  of "card" President Kim might use to overcome such opposition,  sources say. If parliamentary approval of the new prime minister  is delayed, the scope of the cabinet reshuffle will likely  increase, they said.</p>

			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A NEW ANTITOXIN  </P> <P> There is something average Californians can do about toxic pollutants. They  should encourage legislators in Sacramento to pass a bill that would help  companies use fewer hazardous substances in manufacturing. The measure, AB  1430, sponsored by Assembly members Delaine Eastin (D-Union City) and John  Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara), would establish a toxics-use reduction institute  that would conduct research, circulate its findings among companies that use  toxics and train people in methods to reduce toxics use.  </P> <P> In addition to its fundamental mission of research, the institute would help  companies learn about other firms' success stories, just as the agricultural  extension service helps farmers learn new methods. One way the institute will  be exploring involves encouraging companies to switch materials they use in the  manufacturing process. For example, a Tennessee company that makes gift-wrap  paper converted from ink made from organic solvents to water-based inks,  meaning it could use less toxic cleaning solutions.  </P> <P> Other users of toxic substances have changed their method of operation. Hill  Air Force Base in Ogden, Utah, now strips paint from aircraft with sandblasting  equipment instead of chemical solvents. And some companies have found that  better housekeeping also can reduce toxic leaks or evaporation.  </P> <P> The institute may be based at San Jose State University because of intense  concern about toxics in the Silicon Valley electronics manufacturing area. The  initial cost is estimated at $1.5 million annually. It would be financed from  the unitary tax fund, paid to the state by multinational companies as part of a  compromise aimed at reducing revenue loss. Politically, that may be the only  feasible way to start the institute, but ultimately it probably should be  financed by a tax on manufacturers that produce the toxic substances.  </P> <P> Legislation setting up this vital institute has passed the Assembly Toxics  Committee and comes up early next week in the Assembly Ways and Means  Committee. The best way to reduce the3 million tons of toxic waste that  California generates each year is to develop technology that creates less of  that waste in the first place. This bill would help reach that goal.  </P></p>

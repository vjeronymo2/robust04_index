			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: Portuguese telecom climbs 14% Radio Marconi, Portugal's international telecommunications operator, yesterday announced a 14 per cent rise in consolidated net profits in 1993, to Es4.2bn (Dollars 24.2m). Sales grew 16 per cent, to Es46.5bn, and cashflow rose 17 per cent to Es9.2bn. The private shareholders of Marconi, which is 51 per cent state-owned, will decide this year on a government proposal to merge the company with Portugal's three other wholly state-owned telecommunications operators. The new company would be known as Portugal Telecom. The government plans to privatise up to 49 per cent of Portugal Telecom, and will sell part of the equity to a strategic foreign partner. Mr Goncalo Sequeira Braga, president, said that despite recession in 1993, Marconi reduced total debt from Es25.4bn in 1992 to Es19.3bn last year. Market capitalisation more than doubled.</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN TRIED 2ND TIME IN RACIAL SLAYING ACQUITTED  </P> <P> A Bensonhurst defendant whose first murder trial ended with a hung jury was  acquitted Thursday of murder and manslaughter in the racially motivated slaying  of a black youth.  </P> <P> John Vento, 22, was the third defendant acquitted this week of major charges in  the slaying. However, he was found guilty of riot.  </P> <P> As the verdict was read, the defendant banged his hands on the defense table  and screamed, "Yes, yes, yes." Vento then grabbed and hugged his lawyer before  he was restrained by court officers.  </P> <P> The jury in state Supreme Court returned the verdict during the second full day  of deliberations. The riot conviction carries a maximum term of four years in  prison. He faced 25 years to life in prison if convicted on the murder charge.  </P> <P> The trial was the second for Vento, the former star prosecution witness turned  defendant. Vento backed out of a deal to testify against his friends after he  and his family received threats.  </P> <P> In July, a jury convicted Vento of unlawful imprisonment and menacing, but  acquitted him of intentional murder. The panel deadlocked on a second murder  count and riot. A few weeks later he also was indicted on second-degree  manslaughter.  </P> <P> He is serving a prison term of up to eight years for the convictions.  </P> <P> Prosecutors described Vento as a major participant in the Aug. 23, 1989,  slaying of Yusuf Hawkins in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn. Hawkins, 16,  was in the predominantly white neighborhood to look at a used car when he was  cornered by a gang of whites and shot in the chest.  </P> <P> A jury Tuesday acquitted James Patino and Joseph Serrano of murder charges in  the case. Serrano was convicted of a misdemeanor weapons possession charge.  </P> <P> Another defendant, Joseph Fama, was convicted of murder. Three other defendants  are to stand trial early next year for their alleged roles in the slaying.  </P></p>

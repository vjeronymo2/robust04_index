			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / People (Names in the News): Hilbert's policy for happy longevity 'Maverick' is a word that sticks to Stephen Hilbert. A dozen years of wheeling and dealing has brought the 48-year-old founder of life insurance group Conseco his share of controversy, writes Richard Waters. It has also brought him to the brink of his biggest coup, a Dollars 2.7bn takeover of Kemper, the embattled insurance, fund management and stockbroking group. Hilbert is an unusual animal in the US life insurance industry, as well as its most lavishly rewarded executive. His rise stems from a single Big Idea, hatched in 1979: that the fragmented insurance business, burdened with heavy costs, was due for an overhaul. Starting out with Dollars 10,000, it took Hilbert until 1982 to get the backing to launch Conseco, and since then he has bought 11 insurance companies. Along the way, some of the US's biggest investors have thrown their considerable weight behind him. Calpers has Dollars 100m in Hilbert's latest acquisition vehicle; GE Capital, whose own bid for Kemper Hilbert topped last week, was an investor in an earlier Conseco partnership. Based in Carmel, Indiana, Hilbert's rapid rise has brought him enemies. But he has withstood the criticism of Wall Street and the regulators and and came back fighting - even if his share price has retreated a third from its high point 18 months ago. As he once told the Indianapolis Business Journal: 'I believe the only way you really get rid of all the negative comments is to outlive everyone else.' A message the venerable but labouring Kemper will no doubt take to heart, as it prepares to forfeit its independence.</p>

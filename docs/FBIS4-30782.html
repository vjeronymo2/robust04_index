			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Boyan Marinov: "Nuclear Bosses Again Covered Up </F> the Truth"]    [Excerpt] It was reported through the newspapers a few  days ago that the No. 1 Reactor Unit at the Kozloduy Nuclear  Power Plant was shut down because of a fault in one of the six  cooling pumps. Kozloduy Plant Chief Dyanko Dobrev specified:  "There is no danger of an accident; the unit could have  continued operating, but we stopped it for reasons of greater  security." According to Nikita Shervashidze, chief of the state  department responsible for power supply [National Electricity  Company], the fault could have been corrected very quickly, but  the reactor had to be checked before reentering service.    Following an old tradition, the nuclear chiefs said little,  but kept quiet about much more. In this case, they failed to  divulge the truth about the danger of an accident after the  reactor was shut down.    According to specialists, the situation that arose in the  No.  2 Unit is reminiscent of the dangerous incident in September  1981 that REPORTER 7 wrote about in Issue No. 14 of 8 April  1994. The difference is that the second time the emergency  situation occurred, the reactor was shut down.    Following a suspected leak, the first cooling circuit was  shut down to repair the vent of the No. 1 main circulating pump.  While this repair was in progress, due to inadequate control on  the part of the operating staff, a infraction occurred of the  regulations related to the cooling of the nuclear fuel in the  reactors' active zone. This led to a dangerous situation. The  cooling water in the active zone boiled, negatively affecting  the removal of heat, and this could have led to overheating and  a risk of leakage from the heat-removing elements that contain  nuclear fuel.    In figurative terms, the incident was like a electric kettle  full of boiling water. If the kettle boils dry, it will burn  out. This popular comparison is also correct regarding the  so-called human factor. Operator error, or more specifically  gross negligence and irresponsibility, again produced the  critical situation. Specialists assume that the rise in the  radiation level in the premises housing the first circuit make  the dozing staff "wake up" and react to the situation.    Competent sources describe the incident as "a very serious  emergency situation." It eloquently confirms once again that  the nuclear plant has been left in a state of anarchy and poor  control, as REPORTER 7 noted in its previous article. It seems  that the maxim of "if you get away with it, that is all well and  good," which seems to have been adopted almost as a rule by our  nuclear managers, has been passed down the line and reached the  junior staff of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant.

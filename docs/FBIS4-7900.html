			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Prague, April 6 (CTK) -- The seventh national  conference of the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), to be held in  Brno on April 9 and 10, will deal with local government reform,  the preparation of community and senatorial elections, the  financing of local budgets and security policy.    It will be attended by guests from France, Hungary, Germany,  Austria, Russia, Slovakia and Great Britain.    The ODA is pressing for thirteen local administrative units  -- a relatively low number. At January's meeting of the party's  Central Assembly, chairman Jan Kalvoda rejected information that  the ODA was considering supporting the abolition of the district  level of local administration. "We consider the districts at  present to be the only functioning element of the state  administration, and their abolition would shake the whole  structure," Kalvoda said. At a meeting of the "coalition four"  on March 28, Kalvoda was asked to put forward material on local  government reform and the decentralization of central government  by the end of the week.    As regards senatorial elections, the ODA, together with its  coalition partners, the Christian Democratic Party (KDS) and the  Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party  (KDU-CSL), supports a system of 27 three-mandate constituencies,  whereas the Civic Democratic Party (ODS, the fourth coalition  party) wants 81 one-mandate constituencies. Under a compromise  solution proposed by deputies, this year people would vote for  three senators in each of the "large constituencies," of which  there would be 27. Each of these constituencies would be made  up of three smaller areas, and thus the number of voting areas  desired by the ODS would be achieved.    In the issue of church property restitution, the ODA has  stressed from the start that February 1948 (the date of the  communist takeover) is the cut-off point and a barrier which  restitution should not cross. It believes that the law on  mitigating property wrongs suffered by the churches needs to be  tied to the actual needs of the sects. It favors restitution of  religious property in the form of a law which lists individual  properties to be returned. Kalvoda says the party is a clear  supporter of the principle of the separation of church and  state, and believes that this question should be solved as soon  as possible.    However, the ODA believes that the cut-off date of February  25th, 1948 is no good as regards the restitution of property to  Jewish communities. [passage omitted]    The ODA now has about 2,000 members (in December 1990 it had  100 members), the relatively low number being due to its  selective policy in accepting new members. The party is a  member of the European Democratic Union.    The ODA is a government coalition party. In the 19-member  government it has three posts -- Jan Kalvoda is deputy prime  minister, Vladimir Dlouhy minister of trade and industry, and  Jiri Skalicky privatization minister.    Polls conducted by the Institute for Public Opinion Research  show that the ODA is the second strongest political party  following Klaus's ODS [Civic Democratic Party]. It has occupied  the place since February 1993 when nine percent of the  population supported it. In August 1993 this was 13 percent  (together with the opposition Czech Social Democratic Party of  Milos Zeman), in January 1994 ten percent and in February 11  percent of the electorate.    Surveys show that Dlouhy has for a long time been the most  popular Czech politician, with 62 percent of the population  trusting him in February 1993, 76 percent in September and 82  percent in December 1993 and March 1994. Kalvoda ranks among  ten most popular Czech politicians.</p>

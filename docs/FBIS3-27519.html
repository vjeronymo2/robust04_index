			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Liu </F> Zhenmin (0491 2182 2404) and XINHUA reporter Zhu Youdi (2612  1635 2769)]    [Text] Beijing, 24 Feb (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng  recently invited scientists, educators, and writers and artists  to three forums in Zhongnanhai to solicit their views on  revising the government work report (for the solicitation of  opinions) to be delivered to the Second Session of the Eighth  National People's Congress for deliberation.    Many of the scientists, educators, and writers were invited  to air views on the revision of the government work report in  Zhongnanhai for the first time. The forums were permeated with  a cheerful and animated atmosphere. Among those who spoke were  He Zuoxiu, member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [CAS]; Yu  Changyou, director of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry  [MMI] Automation Research Institute; Cai Rang, deputy director  of the MMI Iron and Steel Academy; Wang Sihong, head of the  Beijing High and New Technology Development Experimental Zone;  Duan Yongji, president of the Stone Group Company; Lu Liangshu,  chairman of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences  Academic Committee; Sun Shu, vice chairman of the CAS Division  of Earth Science; Chen Zhangliang, director of Beijing  University Life Science Institute; Beijing University president  Wu Shuqing; Fang Huijian, party secretary of Qinghua University;  Huang Tiecheng, vice president of Beijing Agriculture  University; Nankai University president Mu Guoguang; Xie Xingui,  president of the Central Radio and TV University; Tian Yutan,  principal of the Beijing No. 1 Experimental Primary School; Shen  Decai, principal of the Tianjin No. 1 Middle School; Ou  Xueguang, principal of the Beijing Changping Agricultural  Vocational School; Qin Shaode, party secretary of the Shanghai  Municipal Education and Health Commission; performing artists  Ying Ruocheng, Liu Changyu, Bai Shuxiang, and Yu Lan; writer  Malaxinfu; writer Pan Xia and cultural relic expert Wang  Shixiang of the China TV Drama Production Center; director Yang  Weiguang of the Central Television Station; Lin Erwei, general  manager and concurrently editor-in-chief of the Commercial  Press; and director Ren Jiyu of the Beijing Library.    They agreed: The government work report (for the  solicitation of opinions) has given a factual summation of  China's remarkable achievements in science and technology,  education, and culture in 1993, which once again bear testimony  to the correct principles behind various structural reforms in  the country. After reading the report, they have increased  their confidence in this year's work.    Discussing the section dealing with science and technology,  scientists suggested that the policy of "holding fast to one end  and leaving the whole field open" should include some areas of  applied sciences that cannot be immediately put to production  use. They also suggested that leading scientific research  institutes and academies should play a significant role in  national economic construction by gearing their work to meeting  the needs of the main front of economic development; that more  effective measures be taken to promote the development of high  and new technology; and that the State Council promptly  formulate detailed rules for the implementation of the law  governing scientific and technological progress. They also made  suggestions on increasing government appropriations for science  and technology, on combining science and technology with  economic construction, on cultivating new industries, on  building large modern enterprises, on adopting policies  regarding high and new technology development zones, on  developing agricultural science and technology, and on training  young scientist and researchers.    While fully affirming the continuous advance of educational  undertakings in the course of reform in 1993, educators said  they were greatly inspired by the report's emphasis on "giving  strategic priority to the development of education." Meanwhile,  in view of the lack of urgency shown in developing education in  some localities and departments, some educators proposed that  the government attach importance to improving radio and  television education, vocational education, normal education,  and compulsory education; and should strengthen the intensity of  educational reform; they added that efforts must be made to  ensure that cultural education helps the healthy development of  youngsters. Other educators suggested increasing government  appropriations for education and stabilizing the contingent of  teachers.    In their speeches, celebrities from literary and artistic  circles said: The government work report's discussion on the  need to bring about a "flourishing of socialist culture" means  encouraging all writers and artists. They shall always adhere  to the principles of serving the people and socialism, and of  letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought  contend.    Some comrades suggested reform of the system under which  literature and art are produced was needed; that the state  should support and finance the creation of literary and artistic  masterpieces; and that, to make progress, the reading public and  audiences needed more excellent works containing positive  messages, though in keeping with the spirit of the times, if the  nation wanted to encourage elegant art and develop its cultural  tradition.    A number of comrades suggested greater cultural opening up  through the improvement of exchanges with foreign countries and  by intensifying research in basic culture.    Li Peng frankly exchanged views with everyone present. He  said: Science and technology play an important role in enhancing  comprehensive national power. We must depend on joint efforts  by the government, enterprises, and all trades and professions  in society to increase input in science and technology.  Scientific research institutions must further strengthen their  own vitality through deepening reform and integrate science and  technology thoroughly with economic construction through  competition. The future of China's science and technology still  relies on its youth. We must attach importance to young  scientists and make the most of the strong points of China's  scientific and technological personnel.    Li Peng affirmed the practice of showing a hundred films on  patriotism in middle and primary schools last year. He also  said: Television education is mobile and flexible. It can be  conducted among a vast number of students. We must increase  television education in the future.    Li Peng said: We live in a great era. We face very good  opportunities for development. It should be a splendid era in  which culture and art will enjoy a high degree of development.  The development of culture and art is closely bound up with  this era. I hope writers and artists can produce works worthy  of a great era.    Li Peng stressed the importance of the role of public  opinion. He said: We must guide the masses of the people to  encourage the spirit of patriotism and collectivism and to  advocate our traditional virtues so as to inspire enthusiasm  among the people for progress. Meanwhile, we must also expose  abominable phenomena in society. While attaching importance to  the social benefit of spiritual products, we must take into  consideration their economic results. We must pay attention to  providing guidance for various cultural phenomena in a bid to  improve the cultural quality of our nation.    Li Peng thanked all present for having put forward very good  opinions. He instructed the drafting group to properly sum up  their speeches and to incorporate them in the government work  report so as to pool the wisdom of the masses, better represent  the will of the people, and do a further good job in conducting  government work.

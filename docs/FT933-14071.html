			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Lech Walesa launches call for solidarity without Solidarity MR Lech Walesa, the shipyard electrician who came to embody the struggle by the Solidarity trade union against communism and who is now Poland's president, says he wants a new kind of solidarity. He has formed a new political grouping to challenge Poland's fractured political parties in September's general election. In a nationwide address on Monday, the president described existing parties as weak and fractious, and warned of unstable future governments. He urged voters back a 'non party bloc for supporting reform', or BBWR in its Polish acronym. 'It's an attempt to recreate the Solidarity movement without Solidarity,' said sociologist Mr Andrzej Rychard. Mr Walesa, elected president in December 1990, is hoping to capitalise on voter discontent with existing parties. The president, an intuitive politician with his roots deep in working class, catholic Poland, has been promoting his new party since parliament was dissolved at the end of May. He decided to go for new elections rather than patch up a new coalition after Ms Hanna Suchocka, prime minister for 11 months, failed by one vote to survive a no-confidence motion put by Solidarity trade union deputies pressing for public sector wage rises. Since then politicians on the fractured nationalist right in particular have engaged in a bewildering and largely unsuccessful effort to establish a united front. A new electoral law states that only parties which gain 5 per cent of the vote, or 8 per cent as a coalition, can enter the new parliament. The new law is intended to reduce the fragmentation of parties and stabilise future coalitions. But the nationalist and liberal conservative parties, which have played an important role in pushing for privatisation and market reforms, are also threatened by the new rules. Opinion polls meanwhile given the BBWR 11 per cent of the vote, although the party has only just unveiled its programme and has yet to select candidates. However, this level of support will leave President Walesa's short of his primary aim, which is to have the next parliament pass a new constitution shifting the balance of power from parliament to the president. For this he needs to control two thirds of the seats in parliament. The BBWR is unlikely to make inroads into the countryside where the PSL, the farmers' party formerly allied with the communists, is expected to re-enter parliament with around 15 per cent of the vote. Mrs Suchocka's Democratic Union, which remains the largest party, is accepting that picking an open fight with the BBWR in the run up to the election is pointless since the two groups are likely to end up forming a coalition. That could mean a period of stable government but not the political re-ordering which Mr Walesa wants before he faces re-election in 1995.</p>

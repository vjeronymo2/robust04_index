			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / RiverBus nears survival target LONDON'S RiverBus was last night close to raising the funds necessary to keep its service along the Thames running to the end of the year. With only Pounds 140,000 still to be raised, it will be kept running over the weekend. The loss-making service, which operates between Chelsea Harbour and Greenwich, is an important link between central London and the Docklands. It has been kept operational by the administrators of the Canary Wharf development in Docklands, London City Airport and other interested parties. However, the company had to raise Pounds 1.82m by the end of yesterday to cover anticipated losses for this year. Donations have been received from large companies, suppliers, staff and individuals according to Mr Michael Davies, business manager. The Corporation of London, the local authority for the City, Westminster City Council and other riverside boroughs were also invited to contribute. 'We even received a Pounds 1,000 donation from a pensioner living in Gibraltar,' said Mr Davies. The final effort to reach the target will be made on Monday. While the company expects further smaller losses it believes that the service will become self-financing by 1996.</p>

			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THREAT OF SUIT DELAYS COUNTY TAX;  </P> <P> FINANCES: SUPERVISORS HOPE FOR AN AGREEMENT WITH MCA TO HEAD OFF A COURT BATTLE  OVER A 2% LEVY ON AMUSEMENT PARKS. THE FUNDS WOULD GO TO MENTAL HEALTH  PROGRAMS.  </P> <P> Threatened with a lawsuit by MCA Inc., owner of Universal Studios Hollywood,  the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday postponed to Jan. 8 its  vote on a 2% tax on amusement park receipts to generate money for county mental  health programs.  </P> <P> But the board approved ordinances for unincorporated areas of the county,  increasing the hotel and motel occupancy tax from 10% to 12% and imposing a 5%  tax on users of gas, electric and telephone utilities. Both take effect Jan. 1.  The utility tax is expected to generate $14.3 million by the end of the fiscal  year, and the occupancy tax would contribute another $300,000.  </P> <P> The supervisors hope to negotiate an agreement with MCA that will head off a  lengthy court battle over the amusement tax. But if that does not work, board  Chairman Mike Antonovich said he has a substitute tax measure on the agenda for  Jan. 8.  </P> <P> The substitute tax would claim 10% of the gross revenues of landfills in the  unincorporated areas, and would raise about $5 million by June 30, the end of  the fiscal year.  </P> <P> Even if one of these taxes is approved, some programs still would require  consolidation, but no patients would be abandonned, mental health officials  said. Without the new taxes and other measures to divert money to mental  health, 27,000 of the county mental health system's 58,000 patients would have  been dropped.  </P> <P> The amusement tax would generate about $4 million, and would apply to Universal  Studios and Magic Mountain, the only amusement parks in the county's  unincorporated areas. The county's taxing authority extends only to those  areas. Cities already impose many of these taxes.  </P> <P> Citing MCA's threat to challenge the tax ordinance in court, the supervisors  put off their vote until the next board meeting. At that time, they also will  consider the substitute landfill tax.  </P> <P> Board Chairman Antonovich, sponsor of all the tax ordinances, said he hoped to  gain MCA's cooperation by tacking a clause onto the amusement tax that would  eliminate it by July 1, 1991. Antonovich said he hoped that such a clause might  persuade MCA to lend its muscle to lobbying the state for the county's full  share of mental health funding.  </P> <P> Last summer, Gov. George Deukmejian cut $71 million in state mental health aid  to counties, precipitating the crisis in Los Angeles County's mental health  system.  </P> <P> MCA President Sidney J. Sheinberg declined to comment on the supervisors' move,  and a company spokeswoman responsible for theme park matters failed to return  numerous calls to her office.  </P> <P> The company, which includes Universal Pictures, has been in the news recently  because of its agreement to be purchased by Japan's Matsushita Electric  Industrial Co. for $6.59 billion.  </P> <P> While it is unlikely that the Matsushita sale influenced MCA's decision to  threaten court action against the supervisors, the company has a reputation for  litigiousness. Sheinberg has been widely credited with once saying that he  viewed corporate litigation as a "profit center."  </P> <P> Even if all the taxes are approved, the mental health department still will be  about $2 million short of what it needs to maintain current programs. The taxes  plus countywide belt-tightening measures and money transfers approved two weeks  ago would raise about $23 million; the department said it needed $25 million.  </P> <P> So Mental Health Director Roberto Quiroz has come up with a plan of program  curtailments and consolidations to address the shortfall. On Tuesday, he sought  the supervisors' permission to begin imposing the measures, but the board  delayed action on them for 30 days to give the department, mental health  advocates and clinic administrators more time to analyze the program changes.  Several people, including Richard Van Horn, chief executive officer of the  County Mental Health Assn., complained that the department's plan was made  available only last Friday.  </P> <P> The plan would close six clinics run by the department, four staff office  buildings and three programs run by private facilities under contract to the  Department of Mental Health. About 3,320 patients would have to transfer to  other programs. The department, meanwhile, could save close to $1 million on  rent and other overhead costs, Quiroz said.  </P> <P> County-run treatment facilities that Quiroz wants to close include the  Metropolitan State Hospital at Norwalk, Compton Mental Health Center, Crescenta  Valley Mental Health Center, San Fernando Mental Health Center, San Pedro  Mental Health Center and South Bay Mental Health Center in Hawthorne.  </P> <P> Also slated for elimination are three outpatient mental health programs for  children and adolescents run by private facilities under contract to the  county. They are located at Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles, St. John's  Hospital in Long Beach and at Stirling Academy in Reseda.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Alan Citron contributed to this story  </P></p>

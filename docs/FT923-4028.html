			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Business and the Environment: New York outpaces its recycling effort In the old days, commuters into New York City would arrive at Grand Central station, leave the remains of their morning paper on the train and throw their empty styrofoam coffee cup into the nearest waste bin, all without a second thought. These days, environmentally sensitive travellers can toss their rubbish into recycling containers and head off to work with a clear ecological conscience. It's part of an expansion of New York's recycling crusade, which has placed 42 recycling receptacles on the city's streets and stations. 'We're trying to incorporate recycling into every aspect of New Yorkers' lives,' said Marcia Bystryn, assistant commissioner for waste prevention in the city. She is also organising pilot programmes for recycling everything from tele-phone books and textiles to batteries. New York already runs America's largest recycling scheme, processing close to 1,200 tonnes of waste materials each day. Despite its good intentions, however, the expansion of New York's recycling programme comes at an awkward time for the industry. Recycling companies say they are having a hard time unloading the materials they already have. Piles of recycled glass, paper and plastics have been accumulating, as a glut in the market continues to make the products unsaleable. Recycling groups say they are being hit from all sides. A surge in the popularity of recycling schemes around the country and the rest of the world has caused an excess supply of materials, while the recession has curbed demand. At the same time, commodity prices are extremely soft. With fresh aluminium, tin, paper and other products available at bargain-basement prices, dealers complain, no one wants to buy recycled goods. 'A tonne of newspapers will sell for Dollars 5 at best after processing,' said Phillip Barretti, head of Nekboh Recycling in Brooklyn. 'Obviously that's selling at a huge loss.' The dealers make ends meet through payments from the city government, which reasons that it is cheaper to pay the recycling plants than to pay a company to haul away the rubbish. Some products are harder to unload than others. Plastics are a problem, because there are many different kinds and they don't always mix together. 'On the plastic side, we're making heavy losses,' said George Wolfson, head of marketing for REI Distributors, which has a contract with the city to take in a certain amount of materials. Glass can also be a problem, especially if it is broken, crushed or green. 'The vendors can't really make any money from green glass,' admitted Bystryn. 'The problem is that the US consumes a lot of green glass in the form of products like imported beers but we don't actually produce much that's bottled in green glass.' Dealers also complain that the public has not been educated to be careful enough in their recycling selection. 'I get in a load of bottles full of things I can't use, like mayonnaise jars,' said Tom Bolton, general manager of Omni Recycling in New York. 'Besides that, we have a big problem with contamination, because people don't clean out the bottles very well.' Even so, people in the industry are convinced that the market will improve. The city government has launched a new campaign to educate New Yorkers about the importance of cleanliness in products destined for recycling. Bystryn is also counting on the size of the New York programme to pull the city through the rough times. 'Because we can guarantee large supplies, the dealers will come to us,' she explained. 'We're lucky, because we're having an easier time than most.'</p>

According to a U.N. press release, following discussions  held  in Vienna during the recent months the DPRK authorities accepted  the inspection activities requested by the IAEA in the seven  declared nuclear facilities.    The release said the DPRK representatives conveyed their  authorities' acceptance following the explanations and  clarifications that the agency had provided during the  discussions.    Inspectors would take certain measures, such as reloading of  cameras and changing of seals, to facilitate future  verification, it said, adding that the aim of the inspection  activities was to verify that nuclear material in these  facilities had not been diverted since earlier inspections.    Welcoming the new development, the IAEA had confirmed today  in writing to the DPRK the agency's readiness to send a team of  inspectors to the DPRK as soon as the necessary formalities for  entry had been arranged.    For the past several months, the DPRK and the United States  had had many rounds of negotiations on inspection activities.</p>

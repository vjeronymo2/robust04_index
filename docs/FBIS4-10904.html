			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Within a week, the fares for public  transportation between Port-au-Prince and the outlying  neighborhoods have gone sky-high. This increase in the cost of  transport is the direct consequence of the increasing price of  fuel. Jean-Max Blanc filed a report:    [Begin Blanc recording, in Creole] In the last week, the  cost  of public transportation has increased in the Haitian capital. A  gallon of gasoline, which was $20 last week, cost $26 on 18  April on Boulevard La Saline. The retailers are asking $28 for  this same gallon of gasoline. A gallon of gas oil costs slightly  less, $24 in La Saline. Public drivers report that they pay $26  to $27 for it.    Therefore, two gourdes was suddenly added to the regular  taxi  fare. There are two kinds of drivers assuring transportation  between Bourdon and Petionville, Petionville and Delmas,  Port-au-Prince Cite Soleil and Port-au-Prince-Airport;  Port-au-Prince and Carrefour. To go from Port-au-Prince to  Carrefour is seven gourdes; the same with Petionville to Delmas;  and Petionville to Christ-Roi.    The first category of drivers are those who do not demand  seven gourdes from the passengers. According to them, the price  still remains at five gourdes. The second category demands seven  gourdes from the passengers. Those drivers explain that the high  cost of gasoline causes them to increase the fares. [passage  omitted]    For the other routes, such as for the buses to the airport,  the cost is five gourdes instead of the 3.5 gourdes it was last  week. The small buses going from Delmas to downtown cost the  same as those going to Cite Soleil or other neighborhoods.  However, the sector that seems to be most affected by the  increase in the cost of public transportation is the students.  Not only are buses scarce, but the fares are too high, according  to a student who worries for the future of students in Haiti.  [passage omitted]    Within a few months, the fare for public transportation has  tripled. It is not impossible that in two months a parent will  have to give 30 gourdes [$6] to his child for public  transportation.    Meanwhile, factory workers are also facing misfortune. The  fare they pay for transport is almost equal to the money they  earn in a day. [end recording]</p>

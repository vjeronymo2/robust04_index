			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Rail unions fail to agree response to pay offer LEADERS OF rail unions yesterday failed to agree on whether to ballot on industrial action or seek arbitration over a pay offer of 7 per cent from British Rail. They will try to establish a common strategy within a week. The executives of the RMT and Aslef rail unions will meet separately to discuss whether to hold an industrial-action ballot of up to 95,000 BR workers over a pay offer which BR says is final and both unions have rejected. Mr Derrick Fullick, Aslef general secretary, said after the meeting of the federation of rail unions that the unions' executives would discuss whether to ballot or seek arbitration through the Railway Staffs National Tribunal. Aslef leaders have favoured arbitration because they are negotiating with BR on new arbitration machinery and do not want to be seen to break the established mechanism under which all pay disputes should be resolved through the RSNT. The RMT is more sceptical about arbitration and some on its executive favour an industrial action ballot to test support for strikes similar to the campaign of industrial action in 1989. Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said BR had 'cynically manipulated' negotiations by delaying talks until the inflation rate had fallen. The unions would consider all options to force an improvement. The two unions will also try to reach a unified position with the TSSA white-collar union, whose leaders will consider the BR offer next week. The meeting in London between the RMT and Aslef came as the Union of Communication Workers separately decided to ballot 14,500 counter and clerical staff in the Post Office on industrial action over a 6.8 per cent pay offer. Mr Alan Tuffin, UCW general secretary, said he could not recommend the 'inadequate' offer.</p>

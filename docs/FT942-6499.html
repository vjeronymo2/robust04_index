			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: UK water Water companies stand out among utilities for having operating costs which have risen since privatisation. The high level of capital investment since then is part of the explanation, since new plant also has to be serviced. But the suspicion remains that Ofwat will impose tough efficiency targets when the results of its regulatory review are announced in July. That would be a way of keeping water bills down while holding out the promise of profits acceptable to the City. Judging which companies will face the toughest targets is tricky. While companies with large urban populations such as Severn Trent and Thames tend to have the lowest unit costs, that is largely a matter of geography. Ofwat's own comparisons between companies have produced differing results. Capital efficiency - a company's ability to build facilities cheaply - should also be taken into account. If Ofwat is concerned to hold water bills down, though, companies which have asked for the highest price increases are likely to be told to achieve most by way of efficiency. Whatever the final outcome, the ability of companies to meet their targets is what matters to shareholders. Companies which can beat their efficiency targets will be able to raise profits and dividends faster than their peers. On that logic, the difference between well-run and badly managed companies will be clearer in the second half of the decade. Water company managers can expect investors to scrutinise their performance more closely.</p>

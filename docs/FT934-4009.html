			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / France raises stakes in Gatt talks: Conditions for settlement reduce impact of likely goods and services breakthrough France raised the stakes in the Gatt world trade talks last night by making a settlement conditional on demands that may jeopardise the Uruguay Round deadline, eight days away. The French gambit overshadowed the successful completion of a deal between the European Union and the US on agriculture, and reduced the likely impact of an expected breakthrough in market access for goods and services. Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, added to the pressure on his European counterparts, meeting in Brussels, by saying he could not accept what he had heard so far of a US-EU trade deal. 'I see no reason for there to be a trade deal - on the contrary,' he said last night. German and British officials at the foreign ministers' meeting expressed concern that fresh uncertainty at this late stage might upset plans to use the EU-US accords to conclude the multilateral Gatt negotiations in Geneva. Mr Gunther Rexrodt, German economics minister, said extra French demands, including improved EU trade defence mechanisms, were the price France was asking for a Gatt deal. 'I think it goes too far,' he said. 'We do not share many of the points of view of the French position.' The Paris government's demands were set out in a letter from Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, to Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, and Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, prime minister of Belgium, which holds the rotating EU presidency. Mr Balladur's intervention came on the eve of yesterday's talks in Brussels between Sir Leon Brittan, the EU's chief trade negotiator, and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative. Both had earlier set the goal of achieving a framework deal on all outstanding issues that the EU was to review at a session likely to continue through the night. Negotiations proved tougher than expected. EU officials said Mr Kantor was having to consult President Bill Clinton in Washington to clear the final hurdles, while Sir Leon was having to keep an eye on his Commission colleagues and the 12 foreign ministers in conclave in the nearby Council of Ministers. Mr Rexrodt said the French demands called for strengthened European trade weapons, including faster anti-dumping procedures; a reform of voting rules to make it easier for the Commission to take action against unfair trading practices; and a new instrument for opening markets on the lines of the US Section 301 trade legislation. 'They want a policy of deterrence,' he said. Other French demands include more generous market access for textiles; safeguards for protecting European television and broadcasting; and a new guarantee on levels of agricultural production which goes beyond yesterday's US concessions on the Blair House pact limiting subsidised food exports. France wants a guarantee that farmers will not have to take more land out of production than envisaged under the reform of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy, in order to meet the Gatt targets. That means that if the CAP restraints on production and price cuts fail to bring European prices to world market levels by about 1996, Paris wants a commitment that prices will be dropped further so that other EU countries, and not France's comparatively efficient farmers, will have take more land out of production. German officials raised objections because Bonn has traditionally relied on high support prices to protect its farmers.</p>

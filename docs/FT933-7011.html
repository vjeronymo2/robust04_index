			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Firm Australian prices forecast for 1993-94 THE AUSTRALIAN Wheat Board said yesterday that returns for Australian Standard White wheat of 10 per cent protein were expected to stay firm at Australian Dollars 155 (USDollars 105) a tonne for the year ending September 30, 1994, reports Reuter from Sydney. Mr John Lawrenson, the board's managing director, said that the estimated return was at the top end of the range of forecasts made over the past few months, although it was well down from returns of ADollars 188 a tonne forecast for 1992-93. The 1993-94 estimate was based on an Australian crop of about 15m tonnes and a continuing build-up of wheat stocks around the world. The wheat board was more optimistic about returns for high protein, premium grade wheats, Mr Lawrenson said. 'We're estimating a return of ADollars 168 a tonne for Australian hard wheat at 12 per cent protein and ADollars 200 a tonne for prime hard wheat at 13 per cent protein. That's a rise of ADollars 3 and ADollars 10 a tonne respectively above our previous estimates.' However, he said the market for protein premiums this season remained volatile. 'They have risen and fallen by as much as ADollars 5 a tonne in the week in recent times and future protein premiums will depend on the quality of the US and Canadian spring wheat crops now being harvested.' Mr Lawrenson estimated that Australia would carry more than 1m tonnes of last season's downgraded wheat into the new selling year, depressing returns for any off-grade wheat produced in the 1993-94 season. 'It's unusual to forecast returns for off-grade wheat so early in the season but growers should be under no illusion as to the difficulty of marketing another large quantity of poorer quality wheat in a world market already over-supplied from last year's damaged crop,' he said. The AWB forecast returns of ADollars 145 a tonne for Grade Pool 1 wheat and ADollars 130 a tonne for Grade Pool 2 wheat for 1993-94.</p>

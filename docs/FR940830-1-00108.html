			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Improving Access To Employment and Training Activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under 7 CFR 273.9(d)(4), households are allowed to deduct from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their income their actual dependent care expenses up to a maximum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of $160 per month per dependent. These dependent care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenses must be necessary for a household member: (1) to accept  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or continue employment, (2) to participate in the Food Stamp  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program's Employment and Training (E&amp;T) Program or an equivalent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effort by those not subject to E&amp;T, or (3) to attend training or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive education or training which is preparatory to employment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 404 of the Hunger Prevention Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100&hyph;435  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (HPA), amended section 5(e) of the Act to increase the dependent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care deduction for certain households and to provide that other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> households would not be entitled to the dependent care deduction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The HPA provided that households eligible for the dependent care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deduction can deduct up to $160 a month per dependent rather than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $160 per household, and specified that the dependent care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deduction cannot be taken for dependent care expenses which are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reimbursed under an employment and training program as specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in section 6(d)(4)(I) of the Act. Accordingly, the Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended 7 CFR 273.9(d)(4) and 7 CFR 273.10(e)(1)(i)(E) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement HPA changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On October 13, 1988, the Family Support Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100&hyph;485, (Family Support Act) was enacted. Section 302 of Title III  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Family Support Act provides for Transitional Child Care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (TCC) for eligible families which have ceased to receive Aid to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) Program benefits as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result of increased hours or increased income from employment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 301 of Title III also specifies that any money received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as payment for child care or any reimbursement for costs incurred  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for child care shall not be treated as income for purposes of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other Federal or federally assisted program that bases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility or the amount of benefits upon need. In response to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title III, the Department amended 7 CFR 273.10(d)(1)(i) to allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a deduction for only the portion of child care expense which is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not reimbursed or not paid for by the Job Opportunities and Basic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Skills Training (JOBS) program under Title IV&hyph;F of the Social  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Security Act (42 U.S.C. 681, et seq.) or the Transitional Child  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Care (TCC) program. (Provisions of the Family Support Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorizing TCC are found in section 402(g)(1) of the Social  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 602(g)(1).) With the enactment of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Leland Act, additional modifications to Food Stamp Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations are required in the areas of the dependent care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deduction and the amount allowed for E&amp;T dependent care and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> work-related reimbursements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Dependent Care Deduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 13922 of the Leland Act amended section 5(e) of the Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by replacing the $160 a month maximum dependent care deduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a two-tier maximum dependent care deduction. For each child  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the age of two, the maximum monthly dependent care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deduction is $200; for all other dependents, the maximum monthly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dependent care deduction is $175. Implementation of the two-tier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum dependent care deduction shall take effect and shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implemented on September 1, 1994. In its discussion on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementing the two-tier maximum dependent care deduction,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress urged that implementation be conducted in ways that will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimize administrative burdens on State agencies. For example,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when a child reaches his or her second birthday before the end of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a certification period, the State agency should not be required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to reduce the maximum monthly dependent care deduction from $200  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to $175 until the household's next recertification (House  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conference Report No. 213, 103rd Congress, 1st Session (1993), p.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 926).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Department is proposing to amend 7 CFR 273.9(d)(4)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 7 CFR 273.10(e) by replacing the $160 a month maximum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dependent care deduction with the $200 a month maximum dependent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care deduction for each child under two years of age and $175 a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> month maximum dependent care deduction for each other dependent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is also adding a requirement that whenever a child  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reaches his or her birthday during the certification period, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum dependent care deduction shall be adjusted no later than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the next regularly scheduled recertification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the Department is proposing a conforming change to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7 CFR 273.10(d)(1)(i) to replace the term ``child care expense''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the term ``dependent care expense'' in order to clarify that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it is dependent care expenses reimbursed by the JOBS or TCC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs which are not deductible for food stamp households, not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> just child care expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Dependent Care Reimbursement for the Food Stamp Employment and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Training Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since 1971, individuals who are not specifically exempted by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act have been required to register for work at the time of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application as a condition of eligibility for food stamp  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits. Currently, 7 CFR 273.7(a) requires that they register  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at application and once every 12 months thereafter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In April 1987, State agencies began operating the Food Stamp  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Employment and Training (E&amp;T) Program, a program aimed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically at improving food stamp recipients' ability to gain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employment, increase earnings and reduce their dependency on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public assistance. State agencies operate a variety of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employment and training activities, including job search and job  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> search training, self-employment efforts, and vocational and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> education activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Work registrants are the most job ready of the food stamp  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population and comprise approximately 8 percent of all food stamp  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recipients. Of those food stamp recipients who register for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> work, about 70 percent are subject to the E&amp;T requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

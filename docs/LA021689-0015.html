			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> Actor Clint Eastwood, the former mayor of Carmel, has offered to help save  central California's Monterey Peninsula from a water shortage by donating 275  acres of land for construction of a $40-million reservoir. The Monterey  Peninsula Water Management District delivers water to about 110,000 people, but  officials have told residents to cut water use by 20% because they fear a third  consecutive year of drought. Eastwood, a longtime resident of Carmel whose  two-year term as mayor expired last April, in the past has donated land for a  low-income housing project and for public parks.  </P></p>

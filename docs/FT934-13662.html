			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Probe of Italian party to go ahead: Judge overrules decision to shelve inquiry into PDS finances THE Milan judiciary has decided to proceed with investigations into alleged illicit financing of the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). The decisions follows a serious split in the ranks of Milan magistrates over whether or not to shelve the investigations that involve Mr Marcello Stefanini, the PDS treasurer, as well a former party official, Mr Primo Greganti. The Milan attorney-general last week decided to discontinue the inquiries. He also took the unusual step of removing from the team of magistrates the one person who had dissented and who was responsible for implicating Mr Stefanini, a senator, in August. However, his decision on the case had to be approved by a judge of first instance who yesterday ruled that further inquiries were necessary before the case could be closed. This is the first time during the country's corruption scandals that genuine doubt has been sown about the involvement of top officials receiving and organising illicit contributions. The PDS has consistently denied the party was involved in illegal practices, and the most it has conceded is failing to declare to the tax authorities the full amount received on a property transaction. Where individuals have been accused of corruption, the party has always said this was an individual matter. However, at least three businessmen have claimed they paid first Communist party and then PDS officials on behalf of the party. The PDS-controlled co-operative movement is also under investigation for helping to provide under-the-counter financing.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Romanian President Ion Iliescu by Corina </F> Dragotescu; place and date not given: "Any Government in  Romania Must Be a Government of Reform"]    [Text] Recently there have been several surprising  evolutions in our political life. The breakup of the  pentagonal, the start of dialogue between the PDSR [Social  Democracy Party of Romania] and the PD [Democratic Party], the  "dual" government formula, and the resumption of discussions  with the opposition are issues that appear every day on the  front page our newspapers.    We asked Romanian President Ion Iliescu to give his views  concerning these most recent events.    [Dragotescu] In your opinion, what chance is there that the  PDSR and the PD will reconcile their differences?    [Iliescu] I believe that what is under discussion here is  not so much the programmatic aspect of the respective issue but  certain obstinate behavior that has appeared in human relations.  Therefore, I believe that dialogue is difficult also because of  these resentments that have arisen and, certainly, because of  the fact that these resentments are emphasized by certain  principles. It is always easy to break up a relationship but it  is much more difficult to repair it. Probably, this also holds  true on a large scale: Namely, a military conflict can break out  easily but it is very difficult to achieve reconciliation. A  split in the family can also be easily provoked when people do  not show enough concern. However, the sides make up with great  difficulty. That is the case with political formations too.    [Dragotescu] Are there any misunderstandings between you and  Mr. Petre Roman [Democratic Party (National Salvation Front)  leader]?    [Iliescu] I have never had any misunderstanding with him.  He started to move along a certain path and I believe that, in  so doing, he also displayed certain aspects of his character  that are not in his favor.    [Dragotescu] In journalistic circles, there is much talk  about the fact that C.V. Tudor [senator, president of the  Greater Romania Party] allows himself to attack you in certain  ways because he has a hold on you.    [Iliescu] Nobody has any hold on me whatsoever. I have led  a straight and honest life and I am not ashamed of anything that  I have done in my life. Therefore, one should not think along  these lines. I have to be more careful when I express myself  because, in view of my official position, I cannot allow myself  to start disputes and feuds with anybody. Considering the way  in which Mr. Corneliu Vadim Tudor behaves, I believe that it  would be completely below my dignity even to offer him a reply.    [Dragotescu] Do you believe in a PDSR-PUNR [Romanian  National Unity Party] government that might operate for a longer  time than the current government?    [Iliescu] It depends on several things. It is not only a  question of direct understanding between two parties that, in  any case, cannot form a majority. If, together, they could form  a parliamentary majority, then, certainly, one could talk about  it. However, given the fact that they cannot, the issue becomes  more delicate.    [Dragotescu] Would you personally prefer a government that  includes the PDSR and the opposition?    [Iliescu] I prefer nothing. I would like a government that,  to a certain extent, is stable and enjoys the support of  Parliament. I have said this often and I see that this is not  how things are perceived at all: Political understanding  between political formations that are included in Parliament is  one thing and the possible structure of a government is another.  The government might also include only specialists or  representatives of a single political formation, but this has to  be achieved on the basis of a political platform that has larger  parliamentary support. No matter what kind of governments will  follow, Romania's problems remain the same. Any Romanian  government should be a government of reform. This, no doubt,  requires broad political and social support.    [Dragotescu] Don't you think that there is a certain  contradiction in what you are saying? On the one hand, you  often accuse the opposition of taking provocative actions that  lead to destabilization while, on the other hand, you accept the  PDSR associating with the opposition.    [Iliescu] No! One can always criticize somebody. This does  not mean a halt to dialogue. In a dialogue, there are also  controversies and differences of opinions, including criticism  of uncivilized behavior. However, I want to repeat that this  does not mean that political dialogue should stop. The aim of  such a dialogue is not to settle differences of opinions and to  start an exchange of niceties. There might even be a heated  dialogue on controversial issues between persons holding  opposing views. However, this is the only way in which Romania's  interests can be promoted.    [Dragotescu] Do you believe that early elections might be a  solution?    [Iliescu] Possibly, if no other solution is found. However,  I believe that this would not be favorable for the country. An  election campaign would only disturb public life. This year, we  should concentrate on doing something positive in the economy in  order to overcome the current crisis.</p>

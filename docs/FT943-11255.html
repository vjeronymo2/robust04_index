			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Milosevic backing for Bosnia peace plan Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic, faced with growing economic sanctions, yesterday urged his kinsmen in Bosnia to accept an internationally sponsored plan to end the civil war in their republic, writes Bruce Clark. It was the first time Mr Milosevic had expressed unequivocal backing for a peace initiative designed by the 'contact group' of five big powers. The group's foreign ministers conferred in Geneva at the weekend and pledged to ratchet up punitive measures against the Serbs, both in Bosnia and in Serbia, unless the plan was accepted. These did not include a lifting of the ban on arms sales to Bosnia's Moslem-led government, an idea strongly supported in the US. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence secretary, said yesterday that Britain still opposed rescinding the embargo but would not veto the move if other countries insisted on it. He reaffirmed that Britain would pull out its troops if arms sales to Bosnia were authorised and said there were already serious concerns about the safety of the UK contingent. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, has praised the Serbian president for helping the peace process. However senior British officials said the Milosevic administration was continuing to supply the Bosnian Serbs with fuel extracted in Serb-controlled areas of Croatia and then refined in Belgrade. Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Moslem president, complained that the measures announced in Geneva were too mild to force a change in Serb behaviour. The five ministers pledged to tighten sanctions against Serbia, and ensure tougher enforcement of the exclusion zones designed to protect Bosnian Moslems. This could eventually lead to an intensified use of Nato air power to protect Moslem safe havens. It might also lead to the establishment of more 'exclusion zones' - where heavy artillery are subject to air strikes - besides the two which exist already. The ministers said they would insist on closer monitoring of Serbia's borders, especially the frontier with the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, through which goods have been passing. Mr Izetbegovic deplored the fact that the ministers made no explicit reference to military action against the Serbs, and questioned the effectiveness of economic measures.</p>

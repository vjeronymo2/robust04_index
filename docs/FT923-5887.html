			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / International Company News: Restructuring at EAC following decline into red EAST ASIATIC Company (EAC), the Danish shipping, graphics and consumer products group, reported a first-half 1992 net loss of DKr181m (Dollars 32m) and forecast a full-year net loss of DKr275m. EAC's net first-half profit for 1991 was DKr82m, with net profit for the full year at DKr245m. The company announced a management reshuffle and a major DKr150m restructuring programme to help it to cope with the difficult trading conditions. Mr Henning Sparsoe, EAC's chairman and chief executive, will hold the post of chairman, with deputy managing director Carsten Dencker Nielsen becoming chief executive. EAC's restructuring programme includes cutting 153 staff at the group's Copenhagen headquarters and decentralising the main consumer products, graphics and transport divisions as well as ending the energy and property division and reorganising the trading division into two new wholly owned units, EAC Timber and EAC Wool. Hafnia, the Danish insurer, which suspended payments last week, said it had completed plans to reduce domestic staff by 21 per cent, Reuter reports from Copenhagen. The 527 job cuts, which will save DKr300m annually, have been planned since last June. The group's bank and insurance units are operating as usual under a new company, Hafnia Holding of 1992, to which assets of DKr5.9bn have been transferred. Debts of around DKr6bn, mainly due to massive losses in share portfolio value, remain in the old holding company which suspended payments.</p>

			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Travel groups begin price war for summer of '95: Rival tour operators race to launch next year's brochures Britain's leading package holiday companies stopped merely kicking sand over each other's towels yesterday and started an outright brawl for a larger share of the summer market. Not for this summer, but for the summer of 1995. There are still 1.5m packages on sale for this summer and more than a third of holidaymakers have not even left home yet. But so intense is the rivalry between tour operators and travel agents that they cannot bear to see competitors publish an earlier brochure, offer a bigger discount or boast that more children go free. First on the beach was Thomson, the largest tour operator, and Lunn Poly, its travel retail chain. Thomson's first 1995 brochure, published on Tuesday, was no more than a sampler - 83 pages of family holidays in destinations such as Spain, Tunisia and Florida. Lunn Poly offered 11 per cent discounts off all summer 1995 holidays. Yesterday, Airtours, the second biggest operator, hit back, sending travel agents 1,600 pages of holidays to places as diverse as Turkey and Thailand. Mr Harry Coe, Airtours' finance director, denied his group had been forced into an early launch by the Thomson brochure. Mr Richard Carrick, Airtours' marketing director, admitted, however, that the company had prepared four possible launch dates to ensure that it was not beaten to the market by Thomson. Airtours, he revealed, had been ready to launch its summer 1995 long-haul programme as early as last month, had Thomson forced it to do so. Going Places, Airtours' travel agency chain, said it would offer discounts of up to 12 per cent on favoured operators. These include Airtours itself, but also rivals such as Owners Abroad and British Airways Holidays. Mr Coe said Going Places' highest discounts would go to those operators which provided the chain with the most 'support', which means that they offered to help bear the cost of the discounts. Other operators' holidays will be sold at discounts of 4 per cent to 8 per cent. Last night, Lunn Poly hit back by announcing 12 per cent discounts on all holidays, following which Going Places increased its top discount to 13 per cent. Thomas Cook, the third largest travel retailer, said it would match the prices of any other chain but said it thought starting a price war this early was silly. Mr Peter Shanks, Thomas Cook's commercial director, said the sensible time to offer discounts for the following summer was in late August or early September when people had returned from holiday. The early launch of summer 1995 brochures meant holidays were now being sold for three seasons: this summer, this winter and next summer. Mr Francis Baron, chief executive of Owners Abroad, the third largest tour operator, said the price battles 'defy commercial logic'. 'It remains to be seen how many people are going to book before they have even gone on this year's summer holiday.'</p>

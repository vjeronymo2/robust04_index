			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Retailer calculates Pounds 3m rise in bill - Minimum wage sparks scepticism - Job loss fears - Employers' concern over expense THE grand rhetoric associated with the imposition of the minimum wage will almost inevitably end up in grim niggling debates for those who would have to implement it. Many companies, feeling the pinch because of the recession, would clearly try to minimise the impact on their wage bills and would spend hours in talks with trade unions discussing how to implement it. Asda, the grocery chain which is the biggest employer in the Yorkshire area, has recently been struggling with high borrowings and tough trading conditions. Earlier this year it introduced a wage freeze in agreement with the GMB union. The year-long freeze applies to all employees, from check-out operators to main board directors, but may be under severe pressure if a Labour government were to enact its minimum wage proposals. Unlike some manufacturing companies, retailers cannot move their operations abroad and would face the full brunt of cost increases in the UK. The immediate effect would be to force Asda to increase the pay of the 25,000 hourly-paid staff who fall below the Pounds 3.40 threshold. That would be likely to cost the company upwards of Pounds 3m a year. Most of Asda's affected employees are only 4p below the minimum, with others falling 7p to 14p short. Employees in London stores would not be affected because they are already paid above the minimum. Other categories of staff may also be affected. For example, Asda is not certain what the position of trainees would be under the proposed scheme. Asda pays employees Pounds 3.08 an hour during their first 12 weeks of training, in line with the wages-council rate. The minimum wage would also generate pressure to maintain pay differentials for staff on higher grades. These pay pressures could be significant, though they are impossible to calculate. The unions accept that this issue may cause difficulties in some circumstances. Hard-pressed companies would find it difficult to absorb the inflationary cost pressures resulting from stepping-up of pay bands. But if differential rates were not raised, Mr Pat Jones of the shopworkers' union Usdaw predicts: 'It would cause a revolt in the stores. Nobody would take a supervisor's job if they were paid the same as someone who collects trolleys.' Mr Phil Cox, Asda's finance director, says: 'Although we are very much against the minimum wage, it is not something that would have a massive effect on us. I do not think it will be an enormous cost but it is certainly not helpful.' He suggests the pressures will be more acute for some smaller competitors. 'The smaller chains will have less flexibility and more of their employees fall below minimum wage rates.' In the grocery sector, at least, the minimum wage is only likely to become another point of competitive differentiation in a rapidly-polarising market.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Mahathir mars Apec consensus - Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Pacific rim leaders yesterday agreed to draw up concrete plans in the next year for completely free trade and investment in the region by the year 2020 in a move they said would give a powerful impetus to further liberalisation in the rest of the world, write Peter Montagnon and Guy de Jonquieres in Jakarta. However, the impact of their decision at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum in Bogor, near Jakarta, was marred by reservations from Malaysia. Its prime minister, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, said the agreement was non-binding and the timetable merely indicative. Other leaders of the 18-member group hailed the agreement as an historic breakthrough, but said they had yet to define what 'free and open trade' meant. Crucial questions include how far it should cover services as well as goods, and whether Apec should demand concessions from other countries before extending its planned liberalisation to the rest of the world. Mr Paul Keating, Australian prime minister, said decisions on these issues would have to wait at least until next year's Apec meeting in Osaka, Japan. But he called the statement, which commits the region's more advanced countries to free trade by 2010, a triumph comparable to the foundation of the Bretton Woods institutions in 1944. US President Bill Clinton said the agreement was 'potentially historic,' but its realisation would require continuing commitment by political leaders. The summit gave a boost to China's hopes of joining the new World Trade Organisation next year by stating that 'full and active participation in and support of the WTO by all Apec economies' was vital to strengthening the world trade system. The meeting agreed to accelerate implementation of the Uruguay Round world trade deal and announced a standstill 'under which we will endeavour to refrain' from measures which increase trade protection. Several leaders sought to play down worries about another clause in the statement which would apparently allow countries not ready to participate in co-operative arrangements to join at a later date. 'To have gone this far is frankly amazing,' said Sir Hamish Macleod, Hong Kong's financial secretary. 'If you think back a year or two, you would not have believed it could happen.' The widespread assumption is that Malaysia's objections will be insufficient to prevent work proceeding. Malaysia has offered to host Apec's meeting in 1998 and demonstrated its interest in free trade by sharply cutting tariffs in last month's budget. Dr Mahathir's chief concern is to avoid being sucked in to a process dominated by the US and outside the multilateral framework. Other countries, such as China, Japan and Thailand, may raise similar objections once work begins on the details. Apec officials have warned privately that defining the scope of the programme will be even harder than setting a timetable for its completion. Already Japan, South Korea and some other countries have said full liberalisation of their agricultural markets would be politically difficult. See Editorial Comment and Observer</p>

			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHARGERS' BOTTOM LINE: SPENCER'S VERSATILITY MIGHT COST HIM JOB  </P> <P> As football has grown more complicated, so has the market for players who can  meet its needs. That's good news for specialists but bad news for players who  have the ability to contribute in many ways.  </P> <P> At the conclusion of the Chargers' workout Thursday at San Diego Jack Murphy  Stadium, Coach Dan Henning addressed the plight of a veteran player who is a  shining example of this but whose football light may soon be snuffed out.  </P> <P> Tim Spencer is described in the 1990 media guide as the Chargers' most  experience runner and blocker. In 1989, Spencer rushed for 521 yards on 134  carries, second only to Marion Butts.  </P> <P> But his position is endangered; 13 players must go by Tuesday, the NFL's  deadline to get rosters down to 47.  </P> <P> Henning said he would be disappointed if the Chargers do let go of Spencer, a  six-year veteran.  </P> <P> "I would miss him," he said, "but it would be based on other people are capable  of doing what he can do, and he just gets caught in the shuffle."  </P> <P> Henning said Spencer, who started at running back for part of last season, then  started at H-back for the last game, would have had a better chance if they had  to cut a total of 27 players.  </P> <P> "He's a guy that was very valuable to us last year in a number of areas,"  Henning said. "If we had to go to a 33-man roster, Tim Spencer would have a  better chance of making this team than five or six other guys that have a  chance now because we're at 47.  </P> <P> With specialization, Henning said, you are constantly putting in new players  for specific purposes, diminishing the need for a player with Spencer's  qualities.  </P> <P> "Tim is a very complete type of football player," Henning said, "but there are  some other people in his area that do some specialized things better than he  does any one individually, so, at the 47-man squad, he can be a very valuable  guy to us or he might slip through the cracks."  </P> <P> Forty-five years ago, Henning said, Spencer would have been invaluable.  </P> <P> "You'd have about 14 players on offense, 14 defensive players, a couple of  kickers, a few spares, and you get more into a homogeneous type of offense and  defense game plan, the way it was 45 years ago. . . . A a guy doing as much as  Tim does would become doubly valuable as you go down in numbers."  </P> <P> Charger Notes  </P> <P> Tight end Arthur Cox, nose tackle Les Miller, tackles Joel Patten and Leo Goeas  and guard/tackle Broderick Thompson aren't injured and will miss Saturday's  final exhibition game Saturday against the Raiders . . . Coach Dan Henning said  the exhibition season is too long and should be whittled down from four to  three games. "It's a serious pain in the (tail). The way it ought to be is play  three games and give you two weeks before the season. Everyone's worried about  who's going to be where, when and whether they're going to make the team.  Legitimately you're talking about letting 13 guys go, but that doesn't mean 13  guys are uptight, because 26 don't know whether they're one of the 13, so you  have almost 40% of the team worried about where they're going to be Tuesday."  </P></p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Letters on BAe jet venture are leaked OPPOSITION politicians in Taipei have leaked letters from Mr John Cahill, chairman of British Aerospace, to a Taiwanese minister in an attempt to show that a joint venture to build regional jet aircraft is politically, rather than commercially, motivated, write Daniel Green in London and Dennis Engbarth in Taipei. Mr Cahill is due to meet today both Vice-Premier Hsu Li-teh and Mr Chiang Ping-kun, whose economic affairs ministry is sponsoring Avro Aerospace International, the joint venture between BAe and Taiwan Aerospace (TAC). The leaked letters, from Mr Cahill to Mr Chiang, are dated August 13 and 16. They threatened to abandon the joint venture if its funding problems were not resolved. One suggested that the Taiwanese government should 'simply . . . have instructed the (state-run) Chiao Tung Bank to provide (the) working capital needed'. Mr Cahill suggested in the letters that both TAC and the Chiao Tung Bank were 'not proceeding in good faith' and threatened to call a press conference to call the deal off. The problem of financing the deal was resolved a fortnight later after further negotiations in Taipei. The venture is part of BAe's efforts to improve its profitability. The RJ series of regional jet passenger aircraft, which would be built partly in Taiwan, loses money for BAe. The venture would also provide a route for Taiwan to enter the passenger aircraft industry.</p>

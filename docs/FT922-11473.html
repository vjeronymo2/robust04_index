			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Man in the News: Trench fighter in the cockpit - John Cahill The inscription on the bulky grandfather clock in BTR's boardroom sums up the simple philosophy of Mr John Cahill, the industrial conglomerate's former chief executive: 'Think of rest . . . and work on.' Mr Cahill, 61, was forced to step down last year after reaching BTR's mandatory retirement age of 60. Instead of taking life easy in his homes in Rhode Island, Florida and London, reading 18th-century English history, listening to classical music or playing tennis - all of which he likes - he has just agreed to take on probably the most difficult job in British industry. As the new full-time chairman of British Aerospace, he faces the daunting task of rebuilding the badly dented reputation of the country's biggest exporter of manufactured goods and restoring a sense of direction to the group. When he was running BTR, he once warned the 1990s would be a tough decade. 'The dinosaurs will roll over and die and the people who will survive will be the ones who offer good service and have a good cost base,' he said. For BAe, the 1990s have so far been tougher than for most other groups. The company has been battered by the cyclical decline in its commercial aerospace, cars and property and construction businesses while its core military activities have been hit by post Cold War defence spending cuts. Since its flopped Pounds 432m rights issue, the subsequent boardroom coup and the ousting of the then chairman, Professor Sir Roland Smith, last September, morale inside the company has been rock bottom. With one foot still in plaster following a fall six weeks ago, Mr Cahill seemed anxious on Thursday to get down to work. 'The man was not designed to relax,' says one of his former BTR associates. 'He is a very bad retiree and he doesn't like holidays.' Lean and long, with an urbane, soft-spoken manner, Mr Cahill has always had the reputation of a workaholic. He has already spent time studying BAe and its current operations. Before accepting the job of chairman, he took independent soundings of the state of the company. 'He came to see me and I gave him a pretty grim expose of BAe's problems. I thought he would never accept the job after what I told him,' says an aerospace consultant. But the job offers Mr Cahill a big opportunity to turn BAe around. As an outsider, and someone who has never been part of the 'old boy' network, he can take a fresh look at the company's problems and engineer its restructuring. 'He's nobody's fool. He thinks on his feet and he will undoubtedly take a hands-on approach to the business,' says a City banker. There is a question mark, however, on how much freedom he will have to introduce new strategies. One of the conditions set by BAe for the job was that the new chairman had to work closely with the company's existing top management team to pursue the broad policy objectives set out in last year's ill-fated rights issue document. Mr Cahill confirmed he intended to work with Mr Dick Evans, BAe chief executive, and the board. Tough decisions will have to be taken on restructuring and these are likely to provoke tensions inside the company. But Mr Cahill appears relatively optimistic and says: 'I understand the philosophy of the industry; I don't regard aerospace as a 'has been' business but a healthy one.' The new BAe chairman is an old-fashioned capitalist in the American managerial mould. He describes himself as 'a factory man'. He is not flash, wears understated suits and quiet ties and he dislikes ostentation - a trait that is in the parsimonious tradition of BTR. His business credo is, in a nutshell, to keep a constant tight grip on costs while improving operational and financial efficiency. 'I'm a trench fighter,' he once said. After leaving school, he worked for a few years in the City as a stockbroker and then became a salesman peddling fancy goods. He joined BTR - then the Birmingham Tyre and Rubber Company  - as a management trainee when he was 25. He worked there until last year with long spells in the US. He rose to become chief executive in 1987. Even after taking charge of BAe, he is maintaining his ties with BTR as a director. But for all his rock-solid industrial background, Mr Cahill will have to display more than his single-minded dedication to business if he is to make a success of his five-year term at BAe. Although regarded as a very good operational man ('He knows how to make a valve company more efficient,' remarks an engineering industry analyst), some doubt whether he will have the necessary vision to deal with the strategic issues facing BAe. These include the need to find international partners for many of the group's diverse activities, sell or dispose of other components of the company and ultimately decide whether to retain the property and car businesses or simply refocus the company around defence and aerospace. Mr Cahill conceded this week that he was not a political animal and suggested it was Mr Evans who had the political contacts. But it is difficult to see how he can remain apolitical as chairman of a company whose primary customers are governments throughout the world - the UK's and Saudi Arabia's chief among them. He will also have to prove he can be number one. Although chief executive, he was always overshadowed at BTR by Sir Owen Green, the chairman. With his appointment, BAe has picked a man with a proven record as a chief executive. The irony would be to see his arrival create a chief executive triumvirate at the top of the company consisting of Mr Cahill, Mr Evans and Mr George Simpson, BAe's recently appointed deputy chief executive. That would leave the company still looking for a chairman.</p>

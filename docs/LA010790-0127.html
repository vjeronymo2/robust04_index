			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUCHANAN ON MONROE DOCTRINE  </P> <P> In response to "Action vs. Words" letter of Dec. 28, it is ridiculous to  compare the actions of the U.S. in Panama to the Soviet Union's use of tanks in  the past.  </P> <P> To say our force was "against the citizens of Panama City" is outrageous. The  purpose of the U.S. was to oust a drug-dealing military dictator who defied the  will of the people in the May election. In my opinion, this action is the  opposite from Stalinist repression that took place over the past few decades.  </P> <P> ELIZABETH KEESE  </P> <P> San Luis Obispo  </P></p>

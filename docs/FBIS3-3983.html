The joint venture between the Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford  and China's Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) will  be the first for Ford, which, in 1978, was the first the big  three automakers to sell vehicles in China after 1949.    "We are extremely pleased to have SAIC as a partner," said  Alex Trotman, Ford chairman and CEO after meeting with  Shanghai's Vice Mayor Jiang Yiren last week in Dearbon.    "We believe that this joint venture will be good for Ford,  good for our partner and good for China," the chairman stressed.    Ford sources said that SAIC's Yan Feng Division and Ford's  Plastic and Trim Products Division will collaborate to produce  automotive components including interior trim, seats, instrument  panels and other plastic parts.    Ford, meanwhile, is involved in discussions with several  Chinese manufacturers that could lead to joint ventures in such  automotive product areas as glass, electronics, engine mangement  and air conditioning.    The company, Ford sources said, is also interested in  vehicle  assembly opportunities in China.    Ford has representative offices in Beijing and Shanghai and  recently established a new Ford China Operations Organization  headed by James Paulsen.    A range of North American-build Ford vehicles, including  Tempos, has been introduced in China and 10 dealers have been  located in major Chinese cities.</p>

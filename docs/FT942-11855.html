			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Apathy wins landslide victory The local elections have been billed as the elections that will decide whether Mr John Major remains in Downing Street. With Mr Major's prime ministership on the line, Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat party managers in London have wheeled their guns on to the local election battlefield in an unprecedented show of force. But with only two days to go, the election campaign has failed to win the hearts and minds of the British public. For all the sound and fury in Westminster, it is hard to detect any great enthusiasm for these elections in any part of the country. In Birmingham, the chairman of the city's Conservative group, Mr Simon Lee, has spoken of the 'enormous apathy and disillusionment' towards all the political parties. In Newcastle, Mr Gareth Edwards, a Green party activist, says that, walking through the city, it is hard to believe there will be elections in less than a week. In north-east London, Ms Liz Pearce, leader of the Labour group on Redbridge Borough Council, says she is depressed to find voters on the doorstep telling her that local politicians are all the same. The media interest has also been hard to rouse in some places. Officials at Central TV in the Midlands complain of the 'low news values' of this election while Mr Jeremy Beecham, Newcastle City Council's Labour leader, complains of the low coverage by local press in the north-east. 'If you get cynical about politics, it becomes trivialised and demeaned and people take less and less notice,' he says. The cynicism is partly explained by the timing of the poll. With the European elections in June, many voters dread the prospect of a series of campaigns stretching out over two-and-a-half months. Another numbing factor is that hard-core Tory voters who are disaffected with Mr Major's leadership look likely to abstain. These voters want to punish hime but they cannot bring themselves to cast a vote for any other party. And the growing disaffection with politics - increasingly felt in UK elections - is playing its part. 'People don't want to display their associations with political parties like they used to,' says Mr Mike Summersby, leader of the Tory group on Newcastle City Council, remarking on the absence of posters in the city's windows. But the principal reason why the campaign has failed to ignite interest is that the mixture of national and local themes has obscured the political battleground. In 1990, when the London boroughs last voted, Labour and the Liberal Democrats managed to fight the campaign on a single issue: the introduction of the deeply unpopular poll tax. The tax eventually led to Mrs Thatcher's downfall later in the year. This time, the Conservatives have tried to repeat that trick, by making the council tax - which replaced the poll tax - the big issue. Tory party managers believe there is a strong public belief that Labour councils charge higher levels of council tax than the Conservatives, and are less efficient. Labour has rebutted these claims. But Mr Jack Straw, Labour's campaign manager, has instead attacked national government policies, in the belief that voters will take their revenge for recent tax rises. As a result, there has been little friction between the Labour and Tory campaigns. That does not mean that the campaigning on the ground has been any less vigorous. Mr Keith Hanson, who is running Labour's campaign in Birmingham, thinks there is an average of 400 canvassers out every night, more than in previous local elections. But, the signs are that the voters have been saturated rather than stimulated. In many places, the key issue on Thursday will not be who wins but how many turn out to vote.</p>

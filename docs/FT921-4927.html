			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Farm debt write-offmay wipe out bank profits in Israel THE BANK of Israel warned yesterday that 1991 profits at the country's leading commercial banks would be wiped out by politically inspired legislation which took effect yesterday enforcing extensive write-offs of agricultural debts. Central bank and finance ministry officials criticised a Knesset bill passed on Wednesday which provided for the automatic write-off of 20 per cent of the debts held by the 500 Moshavim collective farms, along with 21 Kibbutzim settlements and 31 private farms, including that of Mr Ariel Sharon, the housing minister. The Moshavim farms are estimated to have outstanding bank debts of about Shk2bn (Pounds 484m). The banks were already expecting to have to write off more than Shk500m, but treasury officials said this was now likely to rise to more than Shk1bn. Mr Amnon Goldschmidt, the supervisor of banks at the Bank of Israel, said he had told the banks, owned but not managed by the government, to incorporate the write-off in their 1991 accounts, due to be published later this month. He said the effect would be to strip the banks of any significant net profit for 1991. Although he added there was no threat to the overall stability of the banks, officials said the bill would damage investor confidence in the system at a time when the government is trying to sell off its shareholdings. Mr Goldschmidt instructed the banks to include a full explanation of the affair in their annual accounts especially for the benefit of foreign clients and potential investors. The legislation, passed easily despite objections from Mr Yitzhak Moda'i, the finance minister, was pushed through with a clear eye on the farming vote in the June general election. It was proposed by a member of the Labour opposition which has strong ties to the collective agricultural sector. It provides for appointment of an arbitrator to assess farms debts and freezes any property confiscation in lieu of debts.</p>

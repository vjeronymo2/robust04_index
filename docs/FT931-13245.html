			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Management: Switching gears on a rocky road - Christopher Lorenz explains how Flymo forced a common pricing policy throughout the single market / Rethinking Europe LIKE the gardeners who use its innovative lawnmowers, trimmers and other machines for preening their gardens, Flymo has always prided itself on being able to follow a fairly straight line. Yet in the past few years it must have performed more gyrations than almost any other company which geared up well ahead of this month's dismantling of European trade barriers. In response to sharp changes in the marketplace, it has had to rethink strategy and tactics several times. The rethinking done by this successful British company, which employs 450 staff, has been considerable. Since the Financial Times last wrote about its continental European strategy four years ago, it has changed tack on several counts, most recently just two months ago. Having abandoned hope in the late 1980s that the 'hover' mowers which made its name on its home market would ever sell in mass-market volume on the Continent, it has now revised its view again; thanks to improved product design, hover sales are starting to accelerate in several continental countries, notably France, Denmark and Norway. On the other hand, the 'wheeled rotary' mower which Flymo launched in 1989 especially to suit continental markets 'has not done well there - we've found it much tougher than we expected', admits Les Evans, the managing director. Only a quarter of its sales have been made on the Continent. But with the addition of a roller it has sold unexpectedly well in the UK, carving out a new segment. Thanks to the hover boost, Flymo's continental export drive has been transformed from a tentative toe-dipping exercise in 1988 into a rapid forward march. In spite of a slide in prices, the value of its total exports  -most of which go to the Continent - has nearly doubled to Pounds 15m, and is pitched to quadruple over the next four years. At the same time total sales have risen by 'only' a half, to Pounds 73m. It had inadequate influence over how its products were distributed and sold by the various continental sales companies of its parent group, Electrolux. But it has now persuaded most of them to slash overheads and sales prices by cutting out the wholesaling link in their distribution chains. They now sell direct to retailers. It is on the verge of annexing staff from those sales companies and integrating them into its own organisation, run from Newton Aycliffe in north-east England. This single European organisation will have key managers dispersed across several countries. That some of these steps have been made necessary, and others possible, is thanks to three factors. First, the speed with which, against all expectations, a European 'single market' in lawn and garden machinery is being created by several combined forces: the rise of powerful retail chains, some of which are selling across national borders; a flood of cut-price, low-specification, standard imports from Italy and the US; and the impact of the recession on consumers' readiness to buy these machines. Little is now made of the climatic variations and different consumer habits which just four years ago were expected to keep the European market fragmented indefinitely. This retail-driven convergence of consumer buying patterns has enabled Flymo to cut production and inventory overheads by slashing the number of variants of each product. Instead of seven, it now has just two: for the UK (with a 240 watt voltage, and different plug), and for the rest of Europe. The second enabling factor behind Flymo's rethink is the financial strength which has brought it through four of the worst years for European garden machinery that anyone can remember, because of the way drought combined with recession. That strength flows from the company's low break-even point and its commitment to product innovation even through hard times; the latter pays off in the form of a stream of successful product launches, and in healthy cash flow. The third factor - partly the result of the previous one - is the backing that Evans has had from his Swedish parent in his sometimes fraught discussions with Electrolux sales companies across Europe. It has helped him considerably that, 18 months ago, he was promoted to the position of a European 'product line manager' within Electrolux, reporting direct to its president in Stockholm. Previously, he had a product line manager above him. As part of the move, Evans was given responsibility for the consolidated profitability of all Flymo's sales, including those through staff in continental countries who in other respects reported to local Electrolux managers. For companies in other industries faced with intense price competition and over-costly distribution arrangements in European markets, Flymo's experience over the past four years is especially instructive, in spite of its unusual position within a large multinational. In 1988, it was faced with trying to sell through a set of sister companies which were unused to having direct relations with retail chains. Instead, they used wholesalers to distribute to specialist dealers. In most national markets, the structure of the distribution chain for imported machines was also so complicated, and the mark-ups for each link (sales company, wholesaler and retailer) so generous, that selling prices had to be pitched up to twice as high as those in Britain. They were far higher than for local manufacturers. In extreme cases, Electrolux sales companies were trying to make a margin of 40 per cent, wholesalers 20 per cent and retailers 40 per cent. The resulting consumer price in Scandinavia was more than four times the factory cost, against less than 2 1/2 times in Britain. 'This created a vicious circle,' says Phil McGrath, Flymo's sales director. 'It drove sales down to the extent that we were literally going backwards. With the French and German markets shifting quickly from feature-driven brands to own-label low-specification imports through hypermarkets and other retail chains, it was very serious.' But this situation also gave Flymo a perfect opportunity to confront the sales companies. It began to attack the problem by showing them a spreadsheet with the UK manufactured costs and all the mark-ups, plus the consolidated result which Flymo wanted to achieve. It explained that this could be done only if the sales companies cut out the wholesale link, and added mass distribution to their network of specialist dealers. A further weapon which it was able to wield over the sales companies was the growth of cross-border retailing, which has been rapid over the past couple of years on the Continent. Evans and McGrath told the Danish, Norwegian and Swedish sales companies that they would have to sell at a common price, as would those in Benelux, Germany, Austria and Switzerland. 'We said 'if you don't co-operate, the retailer will buy from your sister company across the border',' says Evans. With product specifications no longer varying between countries, 'that was a hell of an incentive'. In the short term, from 1990, Flymo used its financial muscle to subsidise local losses while the sales companies cut prices and broke into the mass market. Some of the national Electrolux sales companies were also ready to help foot the bill for a time. 'We had to support some markets more than others, but we saw it as a brand investment,' says Evans. In the medium-term, the obvious answer was to cut overheads to the bone by redesigning the entire structure of Flymo's sales, internal administration, warehousing and distribution so as to remove duplication of activities between head office and the sales companies. There will be a single warehouse - probably at UK headquarters - provided delivery across Europe in three days can be guaranteed. A project team began work on the details last November, just after Evans and McGrath - in another rethink - had decided to move straight to a pan-European structure, rather than via an interim one with four regions. From this autumn in France, local sales staff will be transferred to Flymo, plugging directly into its UK computer network and all its other systems. Shipping, but not invoicing, is already being done direct from Newton Aycliffe. In late 1994, the same structure will be extended to other continental markets. From then on, Flymo will really be operating as a single market company.</p>

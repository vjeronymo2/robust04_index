			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> ROCK CLIMBING;  </P> <P> TRAINING BEGINS WITH GLUING STONES TO ROAD WALLS  </P> <P> Ventura might seem like an unlikely place for a climbing cult to flourish.  Local hills are sandstone and the rock is insufficient for lead climbing. It's  a long way to Joshua Tree.  </P> <P> But Black Diamond, a well-known Ventura manufacturer of climbing equipment, and  the Ventura River Wall, a 250-foot traversing wall beneath the freeway, have  put Ventura on the climbing map.  </P> <P> Black Diamond employs many climbers. To some of them, Painted Cave, Gibraltar  Rock, Sespe Gorge and other county climbs are out of reach at the end of a  workday. Two years ago, some climbers got a wild idea and started gluing rocks  on a wall in the Ventura riverbed under the Ventura Freeway. That was the  beginning of the River Wall. It's the closest thing to real climbing near home  and is perfect for training during the week.  </P> <P> The River Wall is not the only freeway wall being used by rock climbers. For  years now, rock-climbing enthusiasts have been gluing rocks to acres of  vertical Caltrans concrete to make artificial climbs.  </P> <P> The state Department of Transportation recently came across some rocks glued to  a freeway supporting wall at Flint Canyon Wash near Pasadena. Now that they  know what people are doing there, Caltrans will be removing the rocks, said  Selma Gleason, spokeswoman of Caltrans District 7 in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> But to destroy all climbing walls, Caltrans will have to find them, and that  could take a while. Walls are carefully guarded secrets, passed by word of  mouth in a very small circle.  </P> <P> According to members of that circle, as many as 30 other walls may exist in Los  Angeles County, with dozens more in Orange and Riverside counties.  </P> <P> The River Wall is no longer a secret since it has been written about in  Climbing magazine and is one of three Caltrans walls mentioned in Craig Fry's  "Bouldering Guide to Southern California" (Chockstone Press, Boulder, Colo.).  </P> <P> The wall is easy to miss, almost invisible. When the late afternoon sunlight  slants in under the bridge, the wall could almost be mistaken for quirky  conceptual art -- until climbers get on it, moving in a crisscross pattern from  rock to rock.  </P> <P> The glued-on rocks, collected from climbing areas around the world -- such as  the Shawangunks in New York state, El Trono Blanco in Baja California and the  Blue Mountains in Australia -- are interspersed with manufactured holds. Six  U.S. companies now design and manufacture the artificial holds.  </P> <P> According to Reese Martin, an environmental engineer and a climber, the  creators of the River Wall chose not to bolt anything into the concrete  surface. Instead, to preserve the wall's structural integrity, they used glue.  Reflectorized road marker adhesive is the epoxy of choice, but it's expensive.  Bondo body-work filler is cheaper but more brittle.  </P> <P> "Two kinds of wall-climbing are possible," Martin said. "Some climbs are  designed to go up, such as the 65-foot vertical pillar ascent under the 210  Freeway, a climb which requires bolts and equipment."  </P> <P> The River Wall, however, was designed for horizontal traversing, or  "bouldering" -- climbing close to the ground for fun and training.  </P> <P> For added enjoyment, or perhaps to make up for the missing thrill that height  provides, horizontal climbers play games to help develop their form -- hands  must be kept below shoulders, and no touching the same rock twice.  </P> <P> "Good for the tendons and hands," Martin said, climbing onto the wall. He moved  quickly and smoothly from north to south about two or three feet off the  ground, making it look easy.  </P> <P> "No need to go higher," he said. "It's just practice."  </P> <P> The highest holds on the River Wall are less than 10 feet off the ground. And  yet, far above the highest holds can be seen ghostly, chalky palm prints.  </P> <P> "Made by a hot dog," said Fred Clark, a manager at General Electric and a wall  regular with a disdain for vertical climbing. Clark recently introduced his  12-year-old son, E. J., to the wall.  </P> <P> "He wasn't good at anything," Clark said. "But when he took climbing classes  and found out how good he was, he gained self-confidence and improved  enormously at school.  </P> <P> "He's like a damn spider up there," Clark said.  </P> <P> Russ Clune is a world-class climber.  </P> <P> "The spirit in which the River Wall was built was to have a place where we can  get a good 'pump,' " said Clune, a sales representative for Black Diamond.  "It's a fun social event, and it's not dangerous."  </P> <P> Mark Robinson, an orthopedic surgeon and an avid climber, agreed.  </P> <P> "You'd think there'd be spectacular trauma with such an apparently dangerous  sport," Robinson said. "But in fact you almost never get significant injuries.  Anything more than a bruise or sprained ankle is unusual."  </P> <P> Robinson and his wife, Susan, an internist, have climbed in France and  frequently climb at sites outside the state.  </P> <P> "After I started climbing the River Wall, I got tons better as a climber," said  Susan Robinson, who once broke her wrist climbing. "Climbing the wall's good  for two things: grip strength and moving sidewards -- which gives you more  options when climbing on real rock."  </P> <P> "The wall's an organic thing," Martin said. "Someone adds a hold here, or  steals a hold, or a hold breaks off, it changes."  </P> <P> Over the past two years, so many holds have been added that the wall's not as  difficult as it used to be. But it's not a wall anyone can just get on and  climb either.  </P> <P> "You won't catch the bug on that wall," Martin said. "It's not for beginners.  But you can get a good workout on it."  </P> <P> "The Ventura River Wall was one of the first," Craig Shaw said. "It put a seed  in people's minds. In fact, some climbers had been trying to design wall  routes, but when they came to Ventura and saw the River Wall, they realized  that just placing the rocks aimlessly was better."  </P> <P> Cam Donnahoo learned to climb on Gainsborough Road in Thousand Oaks. He and his  wife both work out on the wall; one climbs while the other holds their  10-month-old son, Daniel.  </P> <P> Like many local climbers, Donnahoo is afraid that the wall's existence is  jeopardized by Caltrans' recent discovery at Flint Canyon Wash.  </P> <P> "We'd love to keep the wall," Donnahoo said, bouncing the baby. "It's the only  local place with easy access."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Climbers' Glue Is a Sticky Issue  </P> <P> Caltrans workers had known for some time that something unusual was going on at  Flint Canyon Wash near Pasadena. The rocks glued to a wall of the freeway  bridge there gave them a clue. But it wasn't until last month that they found  out those rocks had been put there by rock climbers.  </P> <P> Caltrans decided the rocks had to be torn down.  </P> <P> "We look at our bridges, our freeways, our abutments every day, and it's  possible workers are finding the rocks," said Selma Gleason, a Caltrans  spokeswoman in Los Angeles. "But we don't have people out specifically looking  for them."  </P> <P> The primary cause for concern is the safety of both climber and motorist, and  the liability of the state should either get injured in a wall-climbing  incident.  </P> <P> Climbers have been slapping rocks onto the walls without getting permits from  Caltrans to do so.  </P> <P> "They have to fill out an application first," Gleason said. "There is  information they need to answer like, 'What do you want to do? How often? Do  you have insurance?' "  </P> <P> An application for gluing rocks to a wall? Does such a permit really exist?  Well, not exactly. But Caltrans wants certain basic questions answered. Then,  they say, they will review each situation individually.  </P> <P> So there is a chance that someone could get a rock-gluing and climbing permit?  </P> <P> "We can't answer hypothetical questions," Gleason said, "but all applications  are entitled to consideration."  </P></p>

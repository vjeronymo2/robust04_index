			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> The bleachers, barricades and rubberized guard rails have been set up along the  course of this weekend's Grand Prix race through Long Beach.  </P> <P> Now, if someone can just remember to take down those 35 m.p.h. speed-limit  signs on Shoreline Drive.  </P> <P> Secessionist talk is spreading through L.A.  </P> <P> Wilmington, whose dissidents have formed the New Wilmington Committee, is the  latest province threatening to revolt.  </P> <P> Like some malcontents in neighboring San Pedro, the Wilmingtonites claim their  once-independent territory virtually was seized by L.A. earlier this century so  that the city's harbor could be built.  </P> <P> Other satellites speaking of declaring their independence include Westchester,  Venice and Van Nuys. A Venice Town Council member said earlier this year that  "Venice is a potential Poland" that could spark the revolt by the others.  </P> <P> Perhaps, in the end, L.A. will shrink to its 19th-Century dimensions, and  Western Avenue will no longer be a misnomer. It was once considered the western  end of town.  </P> <P> If you thought L.A.'s 72-year-old leader, Tom Bradley, was the county's oldest  mayor, you weren't close. That honor went to La Canada Flintridge's Edmund J.  Krause -- until Monday, when he retired at 88. Krause was, in fact, the  nation's oldest mayor.  </P> <P> The octogenarian was so full of energy that one of his daily customs was to  drive through the city, taking pictures of potholes. The photos would then be  sent to the county, along with a request for road-repair funds.  </P> <P> Krause also headed the city with the longest name in the county, owing to the  union of La Canada and Flintridge in 1976.  </P> <P> Headline writers would have preferred something along the lines of La Flintada.  </P> <P> Sure, it's only right that Zsa Zsa Gabor perform some community service for the  now famous cop-slapping incident.  </P> <P> But let's not forget that she has some public service saved up.  </P> <P> Surely you remember that in 1958 she served as chairman -- there was no such  thing as a chairwoman back then -- of the holiday traffic campaign sponsored by  the Greater Los Angeles Safety Council and the California Highway Patrol.  </P> <P> It was another side of Zsa Zsa -- friend of law enforcement.  </P> <P> At an on-ramp to the Ventura Freeway, Marilyn Young passed a youth holding a  handmade sign that declared:  </P> <P> OUTA  </P> <P> HERE.  </P> <P> While film legend Greta Garbo tried to stay out of the limelight, the pioneer  Swedish director who discovered her suffered through a peculiar kind of  anonymity on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.  </P> <P> His name was inscribed as "Maurice Diller" in 1960, occasioning semi-serious  speculation that the plaque had perhaps been intended for Phyllis Diller or  Barry Diller or Jerry Stiller.  </P> <P> Two years ago, just before a visit by Sweden's royal family, that nation asked  the Chamber of Commerce for a correction. The star was reinscribed as Mauritz  Stiller.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LAny:  </P> <P> Philippe's, the 82-year-old downtown cafe, claims that the French dip sandwich  was invented on its premises in 1918. A customer's roll was dropped  accidentally into a roasting pan, but he took it as was. The diner returned the  next day and asked for his roll to be dunked again. The dish caught on. The  customer, so the story goes, was a policeman called Frenchy.  </P></p>

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Travel: India - a penitential ride to Madurai / David Pilling joins the tide of humanity pressing towards Shree Meenakshee, where 'nothing is remotely intelligible' THE ONLY signs of activity at Pondicherry railway station were two goats gnawing at the door of a stationary box-car and the window of the ticket office slamming shut to mark the start of a three-hour lunch break. My mission to buy tickets to Madurai, a holy city in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, had hit its first, but by no means its last, obstacle. I was bound for Madurai to join the torrent of pilgrims that gushes the length and breadth of India to visit the Shree Meenakshee temple, a medieval walled city that daily draws 10,000 Hindu devotees into its mysterious labyrinth. The path of the Indian pilgrim - spiritual considerations aside - is not an easy one, the most earthly hindrance being the bureaucracy that chokes the railway system. I was just preparing myself to do three hours' penance at Pondicherry station when an old man with a gnarled face like a tree stump took pity on me. Barging through a door marked 'Strictly No Admittance', he barked something in Tamil to a reclining figure in the inner sanctum of the ticket office. The only part of this official's anatomy in sight was the blackened soles of his feet resting on the desk top. The feet shifted slightly, as if in thought, and then a reply wafted back on the stifling midday air. The tree stump wrinkled his brow and translated: 'No tickets left, master.' Pondicherry's four-seat quota had been sold. I would have to travel to Villupuram, an hour's drive away, to 'try my luck'. My object was to secure myself a reservation on the Vaigai Superfast Express, an Indian bullet that 'races' the 300 miles between Madras and Madurai in 10 hours. I would intercept the train about half-way. The next day, in accordance with the tree stump's advice, I caught a bus to Villupuram where the mainline station exuded the same sleepy air that I had encountered in Pondicherry. The windows at each counter, about the size of a fist, were at chest level, obliging customers to stoop to make their inquiries. Adopting this ungainly posture, I peered into the Dickensian gloom of the inner office. Through the fug was revealed a world of dusty ledgers, rows of pigeon holes, and mounds of yellowing papers. Clerks, squinting over thick spectacles, scratched away at dog-eared forms which flapped in the gust from helicopter-like ceiling fans. It was a full five minutes before someone shuffled over to the window. He stuck his head to the opening, displaying a set of splayed, yellowing teeth like windswept tombstones. Tickets for Madurai had to be purchased at the other counter, he said. I was the only customer, so I slid across to the neighbouring window. Here the same official, who betrayed not the slightest sign of recognising me, informed me that all reservations had been sold. He could, however, supply an unreserved ticket. I would, in a phrase to which I was growing accustomed, have to 'try my luck' when the train arrived. I traipsed through an enclosed wooden walkway to the platforms on the other side of the tracks. Resuscitated by a beer - served in a chipped ceramic teapot to bypass the state's licensing laws - I went in search of the station master. The station master was most friendly when I showed him my unreserved ticket stub, but he could not help. He advised me to see the chief ticket inspector in the next office. The chief ticket inspector, a man with a clipped military bearing and a clipped military moustache, thought he could find me a reserved seat. He motioned for me to wait and hurtled off down the platform. Some time elapsed before he returned, somewhat deflated, with the news that all reserved tickets had been sold. I guessed he must have gleaned this information from the man with the tombstone mouth, from whom I had bought my ticket an hour earlier. I resolved to abandon all attempts to finagle a reservation. When the train finally pulled in, the much-touted luck on which I had been encouraged to rely was not in evidence. After the stampede of red-outfitted porters and frantic passengers had subsided, the dust cleared to reveal every seat on the train taken. My only recourse was to stand in one corner of the carriage near a stainless steel washbasin, gulping water in the stultifying heat and closing my eyes as gusts of dust swept through the open window. The train moved along at quite a respectable pace, sliding past a landscape of brick-red plains and neon-green paddy fields. Hawkers rushed up and down the ailes peddling samosas, warm cartons of mango juice, sweet tea, sweeter coffee and Indian sweets, which were not sweet at all. After several hours of this pandemonium, the sun set and calm descended as the train slipped through the night air. At 10pm, Madurai station stole upon us and I joined the scramble to disembark. Outside, the streets were a tangle of bicycles, rickshaws and carts pulled by bullocks with painted horns curved like crescent moons. Everywhere were wheels turning, wheels bumping over stony roads, wheels skidding into muddy potholes and tangling with the spokes of other wheels. The atmosphere was frantic, even by Indian standards. Television sets blared in the absence of viewers, rickshaw drivers touted for business though no one sought their services, and a snake charmer treated me, in spite of my protests, to the gruesome display of a mongoose biting the head off a cobra. I retired early to bed. The next day, I joined the tide of humanity that swept through Madurai's streets to the Shree Meenakshee temple. A walled city within a city, the Shree Meenakshee lives and hums according to its own arcane rules. The complex is entered through one of its four main gopurams, 150-ft-high pyramidal towers smothered in gargoyle-like sculptures of gods and animals. If the ticket office had presented a Dickensian world, then to cross the temple threshold was to enter a medieval kingdom. Inside, barefoot pilgrims milled around. There were gaunt, half-naked men with tousled hair and staring eyes; ladies resplendent in silk saris; musicians blowing on long pipes; beggars in rags; men in orange with shaved heads; men in dhotis; men in suits and men in trances. Everywhere I looked were things I didn't understand. Many people had their heads daubed with yellow, red or white powder; some had intricate tattoo-like patterns etched across their forehead. I wandered through the many-pillared halls, alternately illuminated with shafts of blinding light, and shrouded in grimy blackness. Bats fluttered in the rafters and the eerie sound of chanting echoed through the corridors. In each of the halls were characters from Hinduism's pantheon of gods. There was many-limbed Kali, elephant-headed Ganesha, figurines representing the planets, Shiva, Vishnu, and the sacred bull Nandi. Many of the deities were housed, rather sacrilegiously to my eyes, in padlocked cages. Some were gaudily painted, others charred by incense and candle smoke. All drew a constant procession of worshippers who prostrated themselves before the blackened deities or presented them with garlands of flowers. I became more and more lost in the maze-like city, trying in vain to make sense of a religion that produced such devotion. It was hard to understand how such bizarre representations of gods could exert so strong an influence over Inidia's 700m Hindus. Everything in Shree Meenakshee was endlessly fascinating, nothing remotely intelligible. Hinduism, I concluded, was not unlike the railway system. To the uninitiated it made no sense. But to Indians, well versed in its mysterious ways, it was as good a way as any to navigate the sub-continent's hostile terrain. David Pilling travelled c/o Bales Tours (Bales House, Junction Road, Dorking, Surrey, RH4 3HB, brochures: 0306-885923) in conjunction with the Government of India Tourist Office. Accommodation was with Taj Hotels. Bales organises 10-day escorted tours of southern India starting from Pounds 1,195, which include a visit to the Shree Meenakshee temple, Madurai.</p>

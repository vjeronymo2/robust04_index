			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> The Easter Bunny that visited Children's Hospital here on Sunday was tall, dark  and handsome and had a glorious tenor voice. With Easter baskets and chocolate  rabbits in tow, opera star Placido Domingo spent time with about 20 young  patients, ages 3-16, who are suffering from cancer and other serious illnesses.  Domingo is co-founder and international chairman of Children's Bright Horizons,  a nonprofit foundation dedicated to improving the quality of life for sick and  needy children. Last week, he had arranged for several hundred seriously ill  children to attend "Otello" (which he is performing here), but when some were  too sick to attend, he decided to pay them an Easter visit. "A lot of kids  didn't recognize him, but I think they were really excited about having  somebody visit them on Easter," hospital spokeswoman Michelle Barker said. The  presence of television cameras also told them that something special was going  on. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / British Coal issues code of conduct to bidders British Coal has issued a code of conduct to members of potential management buy-out teams to try to ensure that other bidders are not disadvantaged. Such employees will be expected to 'play a full role in the preparation and verification of information about the business to be supplied to other potential purchasers. They should not give any advice to other potential purchasers on how to respond to or negotiate with the seller of the business.' The document says British Coal is only likely to consider financial assistance to bidding teams that appear to stand a chance of success.</p>

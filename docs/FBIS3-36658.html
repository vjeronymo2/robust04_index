			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Andrey Illarionov, head of the Russian prime  minister's analysis and planning group, who is in fact the prime  minister's expert adviser, said today that the present  government has in fact commenced the economic and political  restoration under the guise of continuing to press on with the  amended reforms.    Our correspondent met Andrey Illarionov.    [Begin recording] [Illarionov] The government has  unequivocally announced a turnaround in its economic policy, in  specific deeds and in words alike. This coup, or this  turnaround in economic policy, has in fact already been  accomplished.    [Unidentified correspondent] Illarionov says the decision to  merge the Russian and Belarusian currencies, the allocation of  enormous resources for the agro-industrial lobby, and a number  of other decisions force the country to face the danger of an  unchecked growth in inflation.    [Illarionov] Toward the end of 1993 the government set  itself  the goal, the main goal for the end of 1993, to bring inflation  down to between 3 and 5 percent. In January this goal was  altered to between 7 and 9 percent. In Davos, the prime  minister spoke of between 15 and 18 percent. At the last  government sitting the figure of 20 percent was mentioned.    [Correspondent] According to Illarionov's predictions, this  will lead the country toward the Ukrainization of its economy  over the next few months. Moreover, what is in store for Russia  is a highly monopolized market with a strong state influence in  all areas, including the setting of prices. A letter of  resignation was this evening sent to Viktor Chernomyrdin. So  far, there has been no answer. [end recording]    In his letter to Viktor Chernomyrdin, Illarionov points out  that recently the government has rejected the services of  specialists and advisers, and as a consequence of this,  according to Illarionov, very strange statements have been made  about the non-monetarist methods of combatting inflation, the  fluctuating and ongoing inflation, the hyper-decline of the  shock therapy, and this, in Illarionov's view, discredits not  just the prime minister but also any person involved in the  government apparatus, and Illarionov regrets to note that  Vasiliy Starodubtsev is among the prime minister's present  advisers.</p>

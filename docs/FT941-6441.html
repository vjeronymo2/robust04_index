			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Settlements forced to top of peace agenda: The issue Rabin was desperate to keep for later in Mideast talks Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, has tied the future of his government and his country to the peace process. If that process collapses, it is likely his government's chances of winning re-election will collapse with it. And, more important perhaps, chances of a stable Middle East emerging in the foreseeable future are likely to disappear too. Yet this week, after the massacre in Hebron's Cave of the Patriarchs and with the Palestine Liberation Organisation demanding a crackdown on extremist settlers as a condition for resuming negotiations on Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territories, the prime minister has held back. Mr Rabin and some of his more loyal ministers have been portraying a new series of measures introduced to curb the wildest settler excesses as harsh beyond precedent. But placing half-a-dozen of the most unsavoury ideologues into three-month terms of administrative detention, and disarming or restricting the movements of about a hundred more, has been insufficient to reassure the Palestinians or to woo them back to the negotiating table. Baruch Goldstein, the Brooklyn-born doctor whose 111 bullets last Friday have done such damage to the fragile Israeli-Palestinian reconciliation, would not have been on the army's top-six list of dangerous settlers, possibly not even in the top 50. The expressions of support for his actions from sections of the settlement movement suggest that there may be more Baruch Goldsteins out there waiting. While few in the Israeli mainstream advocate disarming all 115,000 settlers, as the PLO has demanded, there are many, including several cabinet ministers, who believe the time has come to evacuate the most provocative settlements, such as the Beit Hadassah enclave in the heart of the Palestinian population in Hebron. Then, there is the question of the expense and army manpower needed to protect small settlements against Palestinian extremists. Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign minister, has wondered aloud why the army should have to provide security for the isolated settlement of Netzarim in the Gaza Strip, home to just 28 Jewish families. But Mr Rabin is adamant that no settlements will be dismantled at present and no settlers offered compensation as an incentive to leave. It is not that Mr Rabin is fundamentally opposed to the concept of uprooting settlements, as will be sought eventually by the PLO. Far from it. While he is publicly reticent on the subject, his aides have always indicated that the prime minister regards barely a third of the 140-plus settlements dotted throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip as serving a vital security purpose. His ultimate vision, those aides believe, would be to retain the new Jewish Jerusalem suburbs that have sprung up since the capture of Arab East Jerusalem in 1967, plus a ring of settlements protecting Jerusalem, and another row along the eastern edge of the West Bank, on the border with Jordan. The residents of most other settlements should be offered compensation to move back into Israel, or face the prospect of living under Palestinian rule. The problem with that vision is that it is not shared by a substantial proportion of the Israeli electorate. Many, maybe even most, Israelis are still reluctant to see settlements evacuated in a land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians. Even in the immediate aftermath of Friday's massacre, a newspaper poll showed that while 46 per cent of Israelis wanted the Beit Hadassah enclave evacuated, 50 per cent believed the settlers should be allowed to remain. Mr Rabin's intention, as reflected in the provisions of the framework autonomy accords signed at the White House last September, was to win over public support gradually. This would be achieved by first granting the Palestinians self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. It would then be extended throughout much of the West Bank. Over the next two years this should allow the level of Israeli-Palestinian violence to ebb and the first seeds of mutual respect to sprout. Only in 1996, according to the framework accords, were settlements intended to feature on the negotiating agenda. And by the time it came to encouraging settlers to leave, at the end of the interim period in 1998/1999, Mr Rabin was betting that a substantial majority of Israelis would be prepared to sacrifice settlements in the cause of a peaceful co-existence they were already enjoying. Certainly, Mr Rabin was aware, there would always be settler extremists determined to ensure Israel retained control of the West Bank and Gaza. But they would be an isolated minority; an awkward irritation, not an immovable obstacle. Baruch Goldstein has badly dented that scenario. Palestinian negotiators are asking if there is much point in discussing the minute details of the planned transfer of authority, when Goldstein's admirers are free to roam through Arab population centres, machine-guns at the ready, able to open fire at whim and make a mockery of efforts to bring a new era of calm to the occupied territories. Some Palestinian leaders have been saying since Friday that, unless the settlement issue is placed on the negotiating agenda now, there can be no resumption of talks. Others have stopped short of such a precondition. And Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, has been characteristically vague. Doubtless, in their frequent communications over the past few days, Mr Rabin has been explaining to Mr Arafat exactly why he feels he cannot confront the settlement issue just yet. The future of the Gaza-and-Jericho-first autonomy plan, so close to realisation before last Friday, may well now hinge on whether Mr Arafat accepts that explanation.</p>

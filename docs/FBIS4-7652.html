			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 1 (BTA) -- President Zhelyu Zhelev  suggested that the political forces sign an agreement scheduling  elections for November at a meeting today with representatives  of the New Union for Democracy (NSD) and the Alliance for  Democracy (SD). Both groups consist of MP's who split off from  the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS).    It would be inappropriate to set a time limit for the  elections, Khristo Ivanov MP [member of parliament] of NSD told  the press after the meeting. According to him, parliament  should first pass the minimum of laws essential to the reform.  The representatives of NSD and SD told the president that his  idea of a government supported by the SDS, the ethnic Turks'  Movement for Rights and Freedoms and NSD would be almost  impracticable. This depends above all on the SDS which is not  ripe for this move yet, said Ivan Pushkarov MP of the SD.  Besides, the SDS leadership has confirmed its decision not to  take part in a new government elected by the present parliament.    The MP's of the NSD suggested that Lyuben Berov's government  be given one more chance. The prime minister should spell out  his plans for raising the cabinet's efficiency and for  structural changes. The alternative would be to re-launch the  procedure of giving each parliamentary force a mandate to form a  government and when it is our turn, we will propose an all-NSD  government, Khristo Ivanov said. According to NSD, the Union of  Democratic Forces would refuse to enter a coalition government  and the NSD would not like to form a coalition with the other  parliamentary groups.    The participants in the meeting told the press to expect  further talks with the president.    Speaking to BTA about reports in today's press that  President  Zhelev offered the premiership to SDS floor leader Stefan Savov,  the President's Press Office said it would make no comment on  misinformers' reports.</p>

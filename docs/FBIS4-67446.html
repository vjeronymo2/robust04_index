			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Bjorn Lindahl report: "Russian Nuclear Waste Worries </F> Norway"]    [Text] Oslo -- While a group of Norwegian politicians were  visiting Russia's Polyarnyye Zori nuclear power station on the  Kola Peninsula on 5 March a group of technicians rushed in and  began to screw down the top of one of the reactors. Only a  month later did the members of the Environment Committee hear  that there had been a leak of radioactive water.    A growing number of worrying aspects of the way Russia  handles its nuclear reactors and nuclear waste on the Kola  Peninsula are coming to light in similar ways.    "The more we look into the problem of nuclear waste on the  Kola Peninsula, the more we have come to realize how enormous is  the cleanup operation that must be carried out and how small a  role Norway can actually play. An international mobilization is  needed to solve the problems."    So said Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal who also  wants a more dramatic appeal to public opinion. Norway is  trying to get the rest of the world to take an interest in what  is happening on the Kola Peninsula which, because it is far from  the centers of population in Europe, is not being given priority  in the international work on the environment.    As part of this work a Norwegian public report has been  written on nuclear safety and chemical weapons on the Kola  Peninsula. The problem can be summarized as follows:    -- There are 150 nuclear-powered military vessels in the  Northern Fleet, the majority with two nuclear reactors on board.  Some 50 of these have already been phased out, but only on a few  has the spent and highly radioactive nuclear fuel been removed  from the reactors.    -- There are eight nuclear-powered icebreakers which have  nowhere to store their nuclear waste. This is therefore being  stored on board the ships which are docked in major population  centers.    -- Safety at the Russian nuclear power stations is poor. On  the Kola Peninsula two of the four reactors are of the so-called  VVER [light water reactor] type. This type of reactor has been  classified as a high-risk reactor by Western experts.    -- Russia has dumped nuclear waste and whole reactors in  several locations in the Barents Sea. The sunken and damaged  submarine, Komsomolets, is also on the sea bed off Bear Island.    -- Novaya Zemlya is today Russia's only test site for  nuclear  weapons.    -- According to international disarmament agreements Russia  must destroy a large part of its chemical and nuclear arms.  This is an operation which could have major environmental  consequences if it is not carried out in a manner which ensures  safety.    The Norwegian foreign minister is unable to give any figure  for how much it will cost to make existing reactors safe, build  dumps, and clean up after past emissions.    "The figure is in any case so large that a Norwegian  national  budget would not go far," he said.    The report estimates the cost of breaking up the 90  submarines which are expected to be ready for scrapping in 1998  at 18 billion kronor. In addition money will be needed to build  installations to receive, treat, and store the nuclear waste.  According to information from the Russian authorities, the  Northern Fleet's storage facility for radioactive waste in Lista  Fjord is almost full. If this is true, this is a serious  problem, the report states. Long-term storage alone for the  reactor sections from the 60 submarines which have been phased  out requires 40,000 cubic meters of storage space.    So far the Norwegian Government has not given more than 36  million kronor to various environmental projects on the Kola  Peninsula -- and 20 million of these went to improvements to  safety at the Murmansk nuclear power station.    "This is not a reflection of our level of ambition. Our  contributions and those of others must be increased many times  over," he said.    In the last two years the Norwegian and Russian authorities  have mounted two joint expeditions to measure radioactivity in  the Barents and Kara seas. A third expedition, to the Abrosimov  Bay on Novaya Zemlya, will now be undertaken after a long period  in which the Russian authorities refused to grant permission.    The investigations carried out so far show, however, that  radiation in the Barents Sea is very low. It is half the level  in the North Sea and the level in the Baltic is 18 times higher.    The report nevertheless expresses concern that radioactivity  will leak out from the underground tests that have been carried  out on Novaya Zemlya. A satellite study which the Norwegian  Foreign Policy Institute has carried out has shown three craters  between 75 and 250 meters in diameter left by explosions and in  another location a whole valley has collapsed.    Internal developments in the Soviet Union and later in  Russia  have led to greater openness about and more attention being paid  to the country's environmental problems. But developments have  also made it more difficult to solve major national problems.  The economic and political situation is unstable and it is more  difficult to reach agreement on what priorities are to be  adopted. The report's depressing conclusion is that not even  with comprehensive international efforts can any rapid solution  to these problems be expected.</p>

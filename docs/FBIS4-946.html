			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Full-page advertisements by the National Party; ads are </F> accompanied by large photos of the people being quoted]    [Text] [First ad]  <H5>  I am a pensioner and I'm voting National Party. </H5>   My name is Molly Mndungwana. I'm a grandmother, and I'm  going to vote for the National Party.    The ANC's thugs threatened to burn my house down; but  nothing  will stop me -- or hundreds like me -- from voting NP.    I have three very good reasons:    First, my husband and I are on sickness pensions.    With the NP I feel my pension is safe; but I wouldn't trust  the ANC. They promise everything to everyone. But where is the  money coming from? They will run out of money -- then where  will my pension be?    Second, my son was stabbed to death in the street in 1987. I  believe the violence in the townships has been encouraged by the  ANC.    So if we vote for them I am sure the violence will get  worse.    But if we vote for the NP, then the violence will get  better.  They believe in the law.    Third, because of my son's death, I am bringing up his two  children who are 9 and 10 years old.    We live in a small two room house, and we all sleep in one  room. We would like another room -- and, in a few years, the  children will need houses too.    The ANC promise houses for everyone. But where's the money  coming from? They won't have the money.    I'm much more likely to get my extra room, if I vote for the  NP. And my grandchildren are much more likely to get a house too.    Mr. de Klerk tells the truth. He has a plan to make the  country rich -- so we can afford the houses and to make our  streets look nice.    He has the experience and the strength. He will not run out  of money.    The ANC is full of ideas and dreams -- but they have no  experience.    The National Party has changed. Now we have the new NP and  its got everyone in it of all colours. Mr. de Klerk is working  for all of us. He is listening to all of us.    And the ANC can't bear it. They deny it. But it is true.  They just want to kill people who disagree.    They came to me and said they were going to burn my house  down. Let them kill me.    There will always be someone else who stands up for the NP  --  then they will have to kill them too. How can you vote for a  party like that?    But you can vote for the NP. I know you will be safe with  them.    I shall be at the polling station on the 27th with a badge  with Mr. de Klerk's face on it. So everyone will know who I'm  voting for.    BE SURE OF A BETTER LIFE    Vote for F.W. de Klerk and the New National Party    We've made the change  [Second ad]  <H5>  I was with the unions, now I'm with the National Party. </H5>   My name is Honest Shamase and I, like many other workers,  will be voting National Party.    From 1986, I was strongly involved in COSATU'S [Congress of  South African Trade Unions] activities. My task as a shop  steward at Pep Stores was to represent the workers when they had  a problem with management. I used to negotiate with management  to reinstate those members that were fired or whatsoever.    My other task was to organise for strikes, boycotts or  whatever was needed. I was also in support committees which  helped to organise strikes at other companies.    After 2nd February 1990, after the State President announced  that apartheid was no longer, that each and every one was free  in South Africa, I thought it wasn't necessary for us to keep on  striking, boycotting and so on. I thought now was the time to  sit and negotiate with all parties involved.    What I didn't like about COSATU was that they used to call  boycotts and strikes, especially when the ANC and the Government  were in dispute. So whenever the ANC was not satisfied with  Government they used to use the workers to protest against them.    But the ANC never asked the workers if they would support  that boycott or stay-away.    And that action has cost millions of workers their jobs.  They ended up in the street. So, I didn't like that action.    And then in 1993, at a COSATU special congress in Soweto,  Mandela was addressing the workers, in fact, not addressing the  workers but telling them to vote for the ANC. I didn't like  that because not all the members of COSATU were ANC members, but  we were being forced to vote ANC. The workers too should be  free to vote for who they want.    As soon as I walked out of that meeting I went straight to  the National Party and joined them. Since then, I've recruited  many COSATU members to the NP and they were very willing to join  because they also disliked the way the ANC was using them. It  is the workers who suffer when their employers deduct from their  salaries or fire them for not coming to work. But all this time  Jay Naidoo is sitting in his office, doing his work, getting his  salary, you know.    We can see that foreign investors don't like communists so  we  should not vote ANC. The NP is the only party that can create  the economy to provide jobs. Even after the election we will  still need to work to support our families, to give our children  education, to pay our bonds and so on.    I have always looked after the workers and I can tell them  now that voting NP is in their interest.    BE SURE OF A BETTER LIFE    Vote for F.W. de Klerk and the New National Party    We've made the change</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Lombard League MP quits over probe MR Giuseppe Leoni, one of the most prominent parliamentarians in the populist Lombard League, resigned yesterday. Mr Leoni has been under investigation since last week for allegedly failing to declare L10m (Pounds 4,000) worth of campaign contributions to fight his seat in the northern city of Varese. He announced his resignation yesterday to clear his name, although he had been urged to remain by Mr Umberto Bossi, the League leader. Mr Leoni was one of the founders of the League, along with Mr Bossi. The sum of money involved is the smallest known to have been investigated by magistrates in the corruption scandal. The League is convinced the move is part of a campaign to paint the party in the same colours as the rest of the political establishment, which has been discredited by the scandals. Almost the entire media, as well as the main parties, are on the offensive against Mr Bossi and the League, claiming the party risks forcing the break-up of Italy.</p>

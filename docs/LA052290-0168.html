			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BOND CORP. TO SELL ITS BREWERIES IN DEAL WITH BANKERS, SUBSIDIARY  </P> <P> Alan Bond's struggling flagship, Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd., struck a deal with  its bankers and an independent subsidiary today that will cost it control of  the Australian breweries that are its major asset.  </P> <P> Bond Corp. agreed to sell the breweries, which supply about 40% of the 5  billion cans of beer drunk every year in Australia, to its 58%-owned Bell  Resources Ltd. for $1.85 billion ($1.4 billion U.S.).  </P> <P> The deal does not affect Bond's U.S. breweries, which include La Crosse,  Wis.-based G. Heileman Brewing Co., Bond Corp. said.  </P> <P> Cash flow from the Australian breweries, producers of Swan lager, was the  driving force behind the construction of Bond Corp.'s now shaky empire, which  is struggling with debts of $5.06 billion (U.S.).  </P> <P> Bond Corp. agreed today to limit immediately its voting rights in Bell  Resources to 25% and to sell its holding in the company down to 25% by March,  1991.  </P></p>

			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / High Court approval for BCCI payout offer sought THE liquidators of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) went ahead yesterday with their move to obtain the High Court's approval for an offer to creditors of a repayment of at least 30 per cent. Mr Michael Crystal QC, counsel for the liquidators, told Sir Donald Nicholls, the Vice-Chancellor - senior chancery division judge - that, in spite of opposition from the BCCI creditors' committee, the liquidators still considered that the deal they had negotiated with the government of Abu Dhabi, BCCI's majority shareholder, gave the best chance of a significant and swift return. The deal, which involves the injection of Dollars 1.674bn (Pounds 920m) by the Abu Dhabi government, has to be approved by courts in the UK, Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands this month before it can be put to creditors. The liquidators say it would increase the estimated return to creditors from the range of 0 per cent-10 per cent to 30 per cent-40 per cent, with a first payment of 10 per cent during the first half of next year. It would be subject to acceptance before an autumn deadline by creditors with admitted claims totalling Dollars 7bn - 70 per cent of the estimated Dollars 10bn claims against the bank. Mr Crystal told the court that, as part of the deal, the government of Abu Dhabi would give up potential claims amounting to more than Dollars 2bn against the principal BCCI companies. Creditors accepting the offer would be required to give up any claims they might have against the majority shareholders, and BCCI would give up any corporate claims other than for debts arising in the ordinary course of the bank's business. A sworn statement on behalf of the Abu Dhabi government said it must be appreciated that Abu Dhabi was the principal victim of the BCCI fraud - it lost more than Dollars 6bn. The fraud was carried out at a time when the government held only a minority interest in BCCI and exercised no control over its affairs. It never had any involvement in the fraud. In deciding whether to approve the deal to be put to creditors, Sir Donald will hear the views of the creditors' committee, the BCCI Depositors' Protection Association, the campaign committee for the bank's employees, various individual creditors and the government of Abu Dhabi. The hearing is expected to last several days.</p>

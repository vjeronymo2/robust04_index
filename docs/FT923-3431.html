			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Marseillais find little to sing about in Maastricht: Treaty's effects in dispute in France's second city EXACTLY 200 years ago, the people of Marseilles first heard a performance of the republican hymn which France was to adopt as its national anthem. The port city's first performance of the Marseillaise was sung at a banquet in an elegant neo-classical hall in the rue Thubaneau. The building, now filthy and peeling, is today used as a Turkish bath, run by Nol-el-Dine Benaziza, a sad-eyed, 34-year-old Algerian. In a way, the building symbolises the changes facing Marseilles. For fears of the death of a republican France of the type portrayed in the Marseillaise, growing unemployment and the problems of a big immigrant population are at the centre of Marseilles city dwellers' concerns as they approach the referendum on European monetary and political union in just over a week. The Hamam, opened by Mr Benaziza's family during the second world war, serves the Moslem population of a squalid ghetto in the centre of France's second largest city, where a fifth of the population are immigrants. The rue Thubaneau, a gloomy chasm with cracked and bulging walls, is one of half a dozen streets in the Porte d'Aix quarter that has been left out of the city authorities' renovation drive, a reminder of the deep divisions which have emerged in recent years between the French and the immigrant population. Mr Benaziza has no right to vote, but he wants the Maastricht Treaty to go through because he thinks it will improve security in his area, a centre for crime and prostitution. Maastricht is unlikely to improve the policing of Marseilles, but Mr Benaziza is not alone in having his own interpretation of the treaty. Among those who do have the right to vote, by contrast, suspicion of Maastricht and its consequences runs high. A typical example is Mr Florentin Andre, a supporter of the extreme right-wing National Front (FN), who drives a taxi around the Porte d'Aix area. A fake Rolex glitters on Mr Florentin's wrist as he fulminates: 'We have had enough of these immigrants. They don't work, they take our social security payments, then marry a French person to increase their rights. Believe me, I know. We drivers see the city day and night - it is as if we were the concierges of the city.' Mr Jean-Claide Remedjian, his brother-in-law and another FN supporter, adds: 'I will vote No twice, with both my right and my left hand.' They speak for an important minority in Marseilles, given that the FN won nearly a quarter of the vote in the Provence Alpes Cotes d'Azur region of which the port city is the capital, in last March's regional elections. On both sides, French and immigrant, feelings about Maastricht are confused. A striking number do not know, or even want to know, what the treaty is about. Lucie Perault, 67, a Gaullist voter who runs a fruit and vegetable stall in the Marche des Capucins, says she has not read the treaty but will vote no because she thinks the project will drive up unemployment. She is worried about her university-age grandchildren, who cannot find jobs. A group of Senegalese factory workers, taking a morning smoke outside their hostel in Bellevue (an unsuitable name for this ugly run-down suburb), confess to having no clue what the fuss is about, even though some of them have lived in France for 30 years. Down in the port, France's largest, people appear a little better informed. A good example is Mr Christian Savino, who reads a circular on monetary union in his office at a dockside warehouse. Competition from cheaper ports across Europe has hit Marseilles hard in recent years, but Mr Savino feels confident that his family's fruit transport business can face the future. 'I am for the opening of barriers. I don't see why the port should not profit from it,' he says. 'The problem is that the French government campaign has been handled badly and come too late. People round here don't believe what the politicians say any more.' A few hundred yards away, a group of dockers loading containers on a Corsican cargo ship appear as divided on the treaty as the rest of the French public. 'It is just for capitalists. There is nothing in it for us,' says Mr Alexandre Hettak, a left-wing voter in charge of a team of 20 dockers. 'It should bring social conditions to the highest level in Europe, but instead conditions will fall to the lowest level.' As a mark of how deeply Marseilles' dockworkers feel their livelihoods to be threatened, it is one of the few ports still to hold out against the French government's attempt to reform its 45-year-old dock labour scheme in line with cheaper European competition. Mr Hettak's colleague, Mr Jean-Pierre Roche, is by contrast a fervent Maastricht supporter. More growth in competition for the port, closer European economic integration - these things are inevitable, he argues. 'We might as well share round the cake, otherwise we will all go hungry,' he adds. In Marseilles, as in France generally, the referendum campaign has sparked off an intense but deeply muddled debate. Among the colourful cosmopolitan crowds milling around the harbour front, the outcome is evenly balanced.</p>

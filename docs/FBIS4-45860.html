			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Jaroslav Kmenta report: "A Prank With an Experimental </F> Virus Could Have Caused a Smallpox Epidemic"]    [Text] Prague -- A smallpox virus, with which Czechoslovak  military scientists were working in the 1970's, could have  caused an unintentional epidemic in 1973. Vladimir Kotlar, a  former senior employee at the research laboratory where the  virus was kept, has claimed that -- despite a strict ban --this  dangerous virus was used in diagnostic exercises in the military  institute in Techonin in the Orlicke Mountains.    "This was an inappropriate prank by an officer," declared  Kotlar. He added that the officer filled the test tubes whose  contents the military scientists were to have ascertained in the  exercise with the smallpox virus. "Doctors immediately  vaccinated all of the approximately 20 people who came into  contact with the virus and ensured that the smallpox was not  passed on," he said.    A Defense Ministry inspection team has now begun an  investigation into what happened to the smallpox virus specimen  after the military scientists had stopped working with it. This  was confirmed by an army source who also said that the  inspection team has meanwhile come to the conclusion that this  dangerous virus was undoubtedly destroyed in 1975.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Heinz Vielain report: "Scharping's Tax Plans Meet With </F> Criticism of SPD and DGB"]    [Text] Bonn -- The proposal by Rudolf Scharping, the  candidate of the Social Democratic Party [SPD] for chancellor,  to classify even taxpayers with a monthly gross income of 3,845  German marks [DM] (this means a net income of DM2,500 in the  worst case) as "high-wage earners" has met with lack of  comprehension and criticism even in the SPD and the German Trade  Union Federation [DGB]. At a regional congress of the Christian  Democratic Union [CDU] in Schwerin Chancellor Helmut Kohl called  Scharping's tax plans "absurd."    Scharping wants to present the draft of his government  program to the SPD Executive Committee on Monday [21 March],  after he has presented it to the public at a news conference in  Bonn on Friday.    Concerning the SPD program presented by Scharping,  Chancellor  Helmut Kohl told WELT AM SONNTAG: "The Social Democrats have  not learned anything. If one puts a supplementary tax of 10  percent on those people who work hardest, and these are skilled  workers, one must ask how the structural problems in our country  are supposed to be overcome, if all who `push' the whole thing  and also those on whom one relies are now punished, as is  envisaged in the SPD program."    Scharping's draft for the SPD government program envisages  that high-wage earners are generally taxed more -- with, among  other things, a 10-percent surcharge on payroll and income tax  owed, which is to be levied from singles with a gross annual  income of more than DM50,000 and married couples with a gross  income of more than DM100,000.    Deputy SPD Bundestag Group Chairman Rudolf Dressler rejects  this point of Scharping's proposal and, instead, demands raising  the computation basis for the planned supplementary tax to an  annual gross income of DM60,000 for singles and DM120,000 for  married couples. Dressler reminded Scharping that last year, on  the occasion of the negotiations on the Solidarity Pact, the SPD  had given higher computation bases.    DGB Chairman Heinz-Werner Meyer also demanded raising the  computation bases to DM60,000 for singles and DM120,000 for  married couples as a minimum. According to Meyer, he would have  preferred the SPD to agree on these limits. Then a dispute with  the trade unions could have been avoided.    Particularly harsh criticism comes from the Taxpayers'  Association, which categorically rejects Scharping's plan for a  supplementary tax. Deputy Chairman Dieter Lau called the SPD  chancellor candidate's ideas an "infamous plan." The infamous  thing is that it is pretended that there are enough high-wage  earners, who can be burdened with this tax. In reality, the  majority of the Germans are burdened with new taxes, he said.    The CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] Bundestag group noted  that the SPD chief obviously "does not leave anyone untouched."  Its parliamentary manager, Juergen Ruettgers, told WELT AM  SONNTAG, commenting on the demand for a 10-percent supplementary  tax: "In short, this means that anyone who earns DM50,000 as a  single -- in gross terms that is DM3,845 per month -- or  DM100,000 as a married couple, is to pay 10 percent more in  taxes. This affects more than 2.3 million working people in  Germany. These include not only the so-called high-wage earners  but also skilled workers, engineering and commercial employees,  master craftsmen, traders, and self-employed people."    Michael Glos, chairman of the CSU land group in the  Bundestag, told WELT AM SONNTAG that the SPD's government  program planned by Scharping makes it clear that Scharping wants  to "force" the citizens under the "tax whip" with this  supplementary tax. Glos: "Instead of promoting readiness to pay  taxes, those who do most in our society are to be systematically  plundered."    For the FDP its economic policy spokesman, Otto Graf  Lambsdorff, told WELT AM SONNTAG: "Scharping wants to soak  people and he is making contortions like an eel to do it. He  will have to begin with the skilled worker and the small retail  trader, if he wants to get large amounts of money. Almost one  out of five taxpayers earns more than DM75,000 per year. These  `high-wage earners' are already paying 90 percent of the entire  payroll and income tax."</p>

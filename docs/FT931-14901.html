			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: City gives a favourable response to TSB results FULL YEAR results of TSB may have been unsatisfactory as far as the bank was concerned, but they received a gratifying response. The news that it had made a lower-than-expected pre-tax profit of only Pounds 43m - after a bad debt charge of Pounds 597m - was followed by a jump in the share price. Investors discerned some underlying encouraging news in TSB's record operating profit, which rose to Pounds 648m before exceptional items in the year to October 31. The good cheer also spread to other bank stocks as the market revised its expectations of the full-year results to come. The news was nonetheless well-hidden among other tales of woe in TSB's figures. It is still suffering a hangover from lending in the late-1980s. It even split out the figures for its Mortgage Express subsidiary, and bad loans from its Hill Samuel merchant bank, to make the problems starkly clear. The decision to bite the bad lending bullet even harder than last year - when it became the first bank to incur a significant full-year loss because of domestic lending - came in October. That was when TSB's hope of a quick revival in commercial property prices finally evaporated. The result was the setting-up of its Loan Administration Unit to take on the poor lending of Hill Samuel - much of it made in a two-year burst in the late-1980s. The unit took on a net Pounds 1.8bn of Hill Samuel lending, which has been written down to Pounds 917m after making a provision of Pounds 883m - or 49 per cent. Although property lending makes up Pounds 434m of the total - and is provisioned at 51 per cent - the unit handles a huge array of bad loans spread across industrial sectors. Mr Mike Fairey, the bank's credit director in charge of the unit, describes the property as 'not dreadful, but a mixed bag'. The other big headache is Mortgage Express, the centralised mortgage lender which is being run down. It incurred a loss of Pounds 67m. Six thousand visits were made to borrowers in arrears last year after the alternative - an average loss of Pounds 35,000 on selling repossessed homes  -proved too costly. The separation of these two businesses leaves Hill Samuel and the newly-merged retail banking and insurance business to trade with a lighter load. TSB's long-term profitability - and even whether it survives as an independent bank - depends on the two divisions producing better returns. Hill Samuel is starting with a clean sheet. Its Pounds 2.4bn loan portfolio carries no net bad debt charge because all charges were transferred to the Loan Administration Unit. Mr Peter Ellwood, chief executive, said Hill Samuel might even be kept clean by the transfer of future bad loans to the unit. However, Hill Samuel faces a stiff task in building new and profitable business. TSB wants it to concentrate on the mid-corporate market - companies with a net worth of between Pounds 50m and Pounds 500m - and only lend where cross-selling of other products will boost the return on capital. The group's future profitability therefore depends above all on retail banking and insurance. A firm cost drive this year - which has provoked industrial action - is the main reason for the improvement in operating profits. But it will also need to raise revenue markedly in the long term. Mr Ellwood wants to increase volume by drawing customers to high interest-bearing accounts. He hopes it can compensate for narrowed margins in this way. But he acknowledges the size of the challenge. 'The fact is that too many banks are chasing market share, with massive overlap,' he says. See Lex</p>

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Fashion: That certain Continental sense of style - New London branch of Et Vous IT IS no accident that it is in France, where age has never been any barrier to dressing well, that small designer-led companies manage to produce ranges of clothing that appeal to customers as widely different in age and physiognomy as, for instance, Vanessa Paradis and Catherine Deneuve. Designers such as Agnes B, Sonia Rykiel and Irie seem to know exactly what pleases a certain sort of stylish, metropolitan woman, who then comes to trust them for the essentials of her wardrobe. When she needs a new jacket, an up-to-the-minute shirt, some glitter for the evening or a spankingly original belt to wind round her jeans, she homes in on her favourite supplier, confident that there she will find something to give her wardrobe a lift. All of which explains the huge success of Agnes B when it opened up in London several years ago and the decision of the Et Vous chain to follow in her footsteps. Et Vous is one of those labels that those who shop in Whistles, Harvey Nichols or Harrods may already know. Sophisticated, grown-up, stylish yet well-priced, it manages to provide for the working woman many of the sassy ingredients she needs that are hard to find elsewhere. Now, Et Vous has opened a shop of its own in Chelsea, where the whole range and the collection of accessories can be bought. It manages that very Continental balancing act of being wearable without being dull, interesting but not eccentric. There are black velvet jeans (Pounds 70), embroidered cream and off-white shirts in soft viscose twills (Pounds 80), sweetly coloured tweeds, curvy jackets to fit over stretchy skirts, easy trouser-suits and great, capacious winter coats. It is also a good place to search out the season's essential accessory: the brightly-coloured silk scarf, the striking ear-rings, the necklace that will fit snugly in a low neckline, the shoes that can make or break an outfit. Not the place for sock-it-in-the-eye glamour, for those who like to shock or be in the avant-garde; Et Vous is more likely to become a friend, the sort of place one will return to for the sort of clothes most of us need to wear most of the time. The photograph below conveys something of the Et Vous style - relaxed, uncomplicated, sophisticated but wearable. Pictured is a long green wool coat with side splits, capacious enough to team with long skirts, Pounds 323. The check waistcoat is Pounds 86, the taupe wool jacket, Pounds 208 and the taupe wool trousers, Pounds 98. All from Et Vous, 126 King's Road, London SW3.</p>

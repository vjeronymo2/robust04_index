			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Move to block private Marchioness action AN ATTEMPT to block a private prosecution over the Marchioness pleasure-boat disaster on the Thames, in which 51 people died, began in the High Court yesterday. Last November a London magistrate gave the go-ahead for committal proceedings on a manslaughter charge against South Coast Shipping Company, owner of the dredger Bowbelle, the other vessel involved in the collision, and four senior managers, brought by Mr Ivor Glogg, whose wife died in the accident. Yesterday South Coast Shipping Company and Mr Peter Butcher, operations manager, Mr Brian Darwell, marine manager, Mr Edward Greenwood, company superintendent, and Mr Robert Samuel, general manager, asked two judges to quash the magistrate's decision. The tragedy occurred in the early hours of August 21 1989 when the Marchioness, on which a party was being held, collided with the dredger. Sir David Hopkin, the chief stipendiary magistrate, ruled that Mr Glogg had the legal standing necessary to give him the right to bring a private prosecution. The defendants argue that Mr Glogg lacks sufficient legal standing; that the private prosecution is 'a misuse or manipulation of the process of the court' which amounts to an abuse; that the case is not a genuine prosecution but a means of conducting a public inquiry and airing grievances; and that delay and publicity have led to unfairness.</p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> S.D. REP'S 'ANIMAL NATION': WHAT'S IT ABOUT, ANYWAY?;  </P> <P> THEATER: THE PLAY IS WELL-INTENTIONED AND BEAUTIFULLY PERFORMED, BUT AS MUCH A  MUDDLE AS THE REST OF THE REP'S OFFERINGS THIS YEAR.  </P> <P> The cow dreams of being a giraffe. The chicken dreams of being a rhinoceros.  The horse dreams of being a wild boar.  </P> <P> And "Animal Nation," a world premiere at the San Diego Repertory Theatre, may  dream of being a play. Desperately. Earnestly. But, alas, unsuccessfully.  </P> <P> "Animal Nation," the final offering of the Rep's premiere-laden season  (presented in collaboration with the Dell'Arte Players Company), is as  well-intentioned and beautifully designed and performed as most of the  theater's 1989 shows. And just as muddled.  </P> <P> Just what is Steve Friedman's script about? That's a good question that Jael  Weisman's and Sam Woodhouse's co-direction fails to answer.  </P> <P> At first it seems to be an animal rights play in which two pigs, a chicken, a  cow, a sheep, a stud horse, a Doberman and a new seven-way DNA-splice animal,  called a Webelo, escape from an animal laboratory called BioTech Farms, in  which they have been tortured and tested to the extreme.  </P> <P> Then it veers into a False Messiah tale as the animals, who have chosen the  Webelo as the creature to lead them out of the darkness, are ultimately  betrayed by him and by the DNA tampering process that made him.  </P> <P> In a complicated marriage scene, suggestive of nuns and priests marrying Jesus  and the church, the animals hook up electrically to the dying Webelo, hoping to  pull part of what they worship into themselves. But at the moment the charge  passes into their bodies, the Christ figure becomes an anti-Christ -- actually  a giant rat -- passing on some kind of grand lobotomy rather than liberation.  </P> <P> And then we're into "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" or "One Flew Over the  Cuckoo's Nest" in which one lone pig, who escapes the operation, runs off only  to try, unsuccessfully, to talk the other lobotomized pig into joining her.  </P> <P> "Could you make it simpler?" asks the horse at one point. Ah, there's a note  </P> <P> somebody should have slipped to the writer.  </P> <P> Sad to say that nothing can save this show from the whirlpool of its own  confusion, not an excellent acting ensemble or Gina Leishman's attractive,  quirky score or Victoria Petrovich's handsome set design that transforms the  claustrophobic lab into an airy meadow in a matter of moments.  </P> <P> The actors are aided immeasurably by Nancy Jo Smith's costumes and Rob Watson's  masks and makeup in their uncanny animal impressions. Bernard Baldan is  exceptionally fine, prancing on his high-hoof shoes as the horse; author  Friedman and Joan Schirle do a wonderful waddle in the mud as the pigs; both  Regina Byrd Smith as a vulnerable sheep and Tracy Hughes as a funky chicken add  lovely singing voices to the mix, and Joe Dieffenbacher does a delicious bit as  the smarmy Doberman that no one wants to pair with.  </P> <P> Donald Forrest is compelling as the Webelo -- but neither he nor Friedman nor  Weisman nor Woodhouse ever seem to figure out what motivates the Webelo to do  any of the peculiar things it does. Maybe that's OK if you're Iago, but this  script isn't Shakespeare.  </P> <P> Like the Webelo, the story is so lost in the thicket of its ideology -- whether  it's pro-animal or anti-science or social/religious allegory or whatever --  that it commits the cardinal dramatic sin of never delving into  characterizations. George Orwell, the social critic who wrote "Animal Farm,"  one of this play's initial inspirations, knew how to make you care for the  faithful workhorse and fear the conniving pig.  </P> <P> Nobody is knocking animal rights, but what about audience rights? Maybe it is  too much to expect a play that is comprehensible, but a play about animals that  doesn't even touch the heart? This is an unviable dramatic mutation.  </P> <P> 'ANIMAL NATION'  </P> <P> By Steve Friedman. Directed by Jael Weisman and Sam Woodhouse. Score, sound and  musical direction by Gina Leishman.

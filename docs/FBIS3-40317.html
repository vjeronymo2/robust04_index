			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dr. Miomir V. Kalezic: "A Jewel Among Guns"] </F>   [Text] For antiarmor combat at distances between 2,000 and  3,000 meters, according to the price/efficiency criterion and  from the standpoint of operational use (the variety of the  ammunition kit, high rate of fire, and low flight time of the  projectile), the advantage of artillery pieces over guided  antitank missiles is obvious and manifold. In view of the fact  that there is a need in our armed forces for technical  modernization of antiarmor artillery, during the 1980's they  began research and development in the Military Engineering  Institute on a unified program whereby two activities were  effectively accomplished: a 100-mm towed antiarmor gun was  developed and given the name TOPAZ. This weapon was designed to  incorporate the internal ballistic solution of the T-12 100-mm  gun, with elements used from the carriage of the Yugoslav D30-J  122-mm howitzer. A day-night system of fire control (SUV) was  also developed for this gun; that system can also be used on the  T-12 and MT-12 100-mm antiarmor guns.  <H5>  On the Carriage of the D30-J Howitzer </H5>   In the procedure that preceded selection of the conception  for development of the new cannon, the parameters which from the  standpoint of waging antiarmor combat decisively influenced the  decision to use the carriage of the D30-J 122-mm howitzer were  the following:    -- The D30-J howitzer has a three-leg carriage, which  affords  a circular horizontal field of operation. Even if the butt end  of the barrel is over one of the legs of the carriage, firing is  possible at elevations from -5 degrees to +18 degrees, which is  quite acceptable for direct firing on armored targets.    -- The device to combat recoil on the D30-J howitzer has  been  installed above the barrel. This configuration helps to increase  the stability of the gun during firing, which is an important  advantage in antiarmor cannon from the standpoint of precision,  the rate of fire, and firing conditions.    -- The mechanism for the traverse of the barrel on this gun  is designed so that the barrel can be quickly and easily trained  (by disconnecting one of the elements in the kinematic drive)  and the sector of operation changed (with the strength of just  one operator!).    -- In the traveling position, the two movable legs on the  D30-J mount are folded back and fixed to the stationary leg of  the carriage. The barrel (which has first rotated 180 degrees)  is also fixed to the stationary leg, and the entire gun is towed  by the towing eye, which is fixed to the muzzle brake. This  unusual, but very worthwhile, design makes the gun short in the  traveling position (the TOPAZ is two meters shorter in the  traveling position than the T-12 gun).    -- The torsion-bar suspension system and 9.00x20 tires give  the gun good cross-country ability on all types of roads and  terrains and good maneuvering characteristics.    A barrel has been designed for the new TOPAZ gun which has  the interior ballistics of the T-12 100-mm towed gun, and it can  use the same ammunition, which is a particular advantage from  the logistics standpoint.    The total weight of the TOPAZ 100-mm towed antiarmor gun so  designed with the three-leg carriage is slightly greater than  the weight of the D30-J 122-mm howitzer at 3,600 kg. The  increased weight did not affect the towing characteristics and  cross-country ability of the gun, but it did contribute to  exceptional stability during firing under all conditions.  Incorporation of a seat for the gunner on the gun's carriage has  considerably improved the capability for sighting and tracking a  moving target.  <H5>  The New Fire Control System </H5>   In view of the fact that incorporating a fire control system  considerably reduces the system's reaction time and increases  the likelihood of a kill and effectiveness of operation against  armored targets, a fire control system was designed for the  TOPAZ gun which has laser range-finding to the target and  electronic (digital) determination of the target's angular  velocity. The firing elements on this fire control system are  determined by a ballistic microcomputer, and fed  optoelectronically to the sighting device by the projection of a  bright dot in the gunner's field of vision. Weather and  ballistic figures for adjustment of the firing elements are fed  in manually. This system affords action at night and under  conditions of poor visibility.    The main components of the fire control system are the  day-night sighting device with laser range-finding, the computer  and electronic unit, sensors for the target's angular velocities  in the traverse and elevation, batteries for power supply, and  wiring.    In preparing for operation, the gunner activates the program  for self-diagnosis and thus checks in advance that the fire  control system is in proper working order. After rectification  (bringing the axis of the optical sight and the axis of the  barrel into the prescribed spatial position), figures are fed in  manually on air and gunpowder temperature, air pressure,  components of wind velocity (lengthwise and lateral), the change  in muzzle velocity because of barrel wear, and the angle of lean  of the axis of the cradle shoulder.    After the target has been spotted, the gunner trains the  barrel onto the target with the levers of the mechanism for  movement in the traverse and elevation. Data on the type of  projectile chosen and the course of the target's movement are  entered in the computer. Looking through the eyepiece, he brings  the center of the engraved cross hairs onto the target point on  the silhouette of the target and begins to track the target, at  the same time activating the main program on the ballistic  computer. During the tracking of the target, but after two to  three seconds, reliable data are automatically obtained on its  angular velocity. After that, the bright mark generated by the  computer appears in the field of vision. It notifies the gunner  to activate the laser to measure the range to the target.    On the basis of that data, the computer determines the  firing  elements and projects in the field of vision a bright dot  shifted by the magnitude of the table angle for elevation and  the lead angle in the horizontal plane (the bright dot remains  in that position three to five seconds). Adjustment of the  barrel brings the bright dot to coincide with the sighting point  on the silhouette of the target, and then the projectile is  launched. If a projectile is not launched in the envisaged time,  the bright spot is extinguished and the target tracking cycle is  repeated to determine new firing elements.  <H5>  Significant Tactical Advantages </H5>   The TOPAZ is a modern towed antiarmor artillery piece to  fire  on targets at an effective range up to 2,000 meters. It has high  firepower, high precision, and a high rate of fire. The  probability of hitting a moving target (at distances within the  effective direct range) with the first round is higher than 70  percent. Reaction time of the system at the battery level is  less than 15 seconds! It uses destructive, hollow-charge, and  hard-core shells. It has complete ballistic compatibility with  the T-12 and MT-12 100-mm guns.    Thanks to the low height of the firing line and the tripod  mount (which affords a circular traverse field of operation),  the TOPAZ has significant tactical advantages in combat  operations of antiarmor defense. The compact consideration in  the traveling position and the minimum load on the towing  vehicle provide the TOPAZ gun exceptional cross-country ability  and mobility under all road and weather conditions.    The fire control system of the M91 is used on appropriate  mounts on the TOPAZ 100-mm, the T-12, and the MT-12 guns. It is  designed to determine and visualize the firing elements  (traverse and elevation) in direct and indirect firing on moving  and stationary targets. It is simple to operate, reliable, and  effective. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and the speed of  determining the firing elements (particularly for fast-moving  targets), the accuracy in monitoring the firing elements  adopted, and the exceptionally low total reaction time, the fire  control system is a unique solution on a world scale and an  important contribution to improving the firepower of antiarmor  artillery.    With the new ammunition, that includes a subcaliber  projectile, whose conception and design are up-to-date and whose  penetrability is at the level of antiarmor projectiles of  considerably greater caliber, the TOPAZ system will be a new pet  and reliable weapon in the hands of our artillerymen.

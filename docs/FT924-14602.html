			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Poland escapes label of central Europe's 'sick man': Warsaw's surprisingly self-confident government has achieved results THE DANGER of Poland becoming the 'sick man' of central Europe, plagued by weak governments and squabbling politicians, has receded recently. Against the background of an unexpected export-led recovery. Ms Hanna Suchocka, Poland's first female prime minister, has forged a confident government team. It has won the conditional approval of President Lech Walesa and confounded those who doubted the cohesive power of a coalition government whose members share common roots in the former anti-communist Solidarity alliance. Taking advantage of the summer break, the government, which includes Mr Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, a former prime minister, and several others who held key portfolios in the first two post-communist governments, worked out a co-ordinated economic, political and social strategy. An International Monetary Fund team was the first to examine the resulting policy mix. The government's priorities are to cut a growing budget deficit, speed up the privatisation of state-owned enterprises, depoliticise pay bargaining and sustain the export-led recovery in industrial output without reigniting inflation. The IMF team promised to return to Warsaw this month to negotiate a new 15-18 month IMF loan agreement to replace the original Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 950m) three-year extended term facility agreed in April 1991. This was suspended last September when the government overshot agreed budget deficit, inflation and other parameters. The figures presented to the fund showed that industrial output, including that from the debt-ridden public sector, started to rise in April after a two-year decline which cut production by around 45 per cent from pre-reform, 1989 levels. By July factory output was 9 per cent higher than a year ago. Polish competitiveness has been restored thanks to a decline in real wages and gradual devaluation of the zloty. Exports rose 12.5 per cent over the first half to Dollars 6.88bn, while imports fell 8 per cent to Dollars 5.9bn, resulting in a Dollars 976m trade surplus and Dollars 389m current account surplus. On the negative side, however, a severe drought is expected to cut farm output by 10 per cent this year while unemployment continues to rise, reaching nearly 2.3m, or 12.6 per cent of the labour force at mid-year. Inflation, at 41 per cent in July, is lower than last year's average 60 per cent but is expected to climb again in the second half. Higher food prices and much higher government spending over the second half of the year will boost inflationary pressures towards the year's end. Cutting the budget deficit from an expected 8.5 per cent of GDP to 5.5 per cent next year is crucial for curbing inflation and preventing the crowding out of the private sector by insatiable public sector demands on limited capital and savings. The government intends to tackle the problem at both ends by pruning public spending and raising income through tax reforms and training a small army of tax collectors. Over the last year the profitability of state-owned enterprises has fallen while much of the fast growing private sector, which now makes up about half the total economy, has managed to evade paying taxes. As a result tax revenues were 39 per cent below plan over the first half while spending on pensions, unemployment pay and other social programmes continued to rise. Without tough government action the deficit was expected to soar to about 100,000bn zlotys (Pounds 4.15bn), over 8 per cent of GDP, by the end of the year. The government now aims to cut the projected deficit by 9,500bn zlotys in the fourth quarter and 70,000bn in 1993. The package includes a 10 per cent cut in the real value of pensions and other social payments and a 10 per cent increase in consumer taxes prior to the introduction of a value added tax system and better tax collection next year. More controversially, the package also includes a temporary 10 per cent import surcharge on 75 per cent of Polish imports. The latter will have to be cleared with both the European Community and the Gatt. To sweeten the bitter pill of lower social security payments Ms Suchocka last month unveiled what she called an 'enterprise pact' designed to involve workers more closely in the fate of their enterprises and at the same time depoliticise wage negotiations and labour relations. The hated 'popiwek' tax on wage increases is to be abolished in favour of free collective bargaining, with the proviso that wage increases not related to productivity gains will not be financed by the government. The emergence of an unexpectedly self-confident government does not mean that Poland is without problems. The economic package still has to be approved by parliament. But the lower house, the Sejm, remains fragmented among many small groups which support the government but are prone to factionalism. This could lead to splits that would weaken the government's tenuous majority, although Mr Henryk Goryszewski, the deputy prime minister with overall responsibility for the economy, insists that ideological disputes in parliament - over issues like abortion or the fate of former communists - will not be allowed to derail the government's efforts to find pragmatic solutions to Poland's many problems.</p>

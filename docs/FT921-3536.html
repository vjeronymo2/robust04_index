			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Agencies win victory on credit information CREDIT-REFERENCE agen-cies, which store information about personal creditworthiness, yesterday won a significant victory in a long battle against the Data Protection Registrar for the right to use information about several individuals living at the same address when assessing credit risk. The registrar wants to ban the use of information about any person at an address other than the one applying for credit. Retailers and credit organisations say this would increase the risks of lending and push up the costs of credit to borrowers. The Data Protection Tribunal, the industry adjudicator, in a ruling to Infolink, one of the four main credit-reference agencies, said it could use information about people at the same address, provided they could be assumed to be from the same household. The system will take effect from July next year, although the battle between the credit-reference agencies and the registrar is likely to continue.</p>

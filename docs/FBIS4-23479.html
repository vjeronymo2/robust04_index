			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Joaquim Chissano at a National Frelimo </F> Cadres Meeting in Maputo on 31 May--published as an  advertisement]    [Text] Comrade members of the Mozambique Liberation Front  [Frelimo] Central Committee, comrade militants and cadres of  Frelimo, comrades,    It is with great emotion that I convey the most fraternal  and  warmest greetings to all the comrades coming from different  corners of the country and different sectors of national  activity.    The present National Frelimo Cadres Meeting is taking place  during a crucial moment in the life of our people, particularly  in the life of our party.    We say crucial because of the immense and urgent tasks that  we face today. With peace, we have gained renewed hope to  reconstruct Mozambique, to normalize the life of each citizen,  and to follow the steady path of development, democracy, and  progress for all our people, firm and united as always.    We say crucial because the wishes and aspirations of our  people, affirmed in our political ideals, will only be realized  if there is a strong and competent government after the October  elections, if the elected Assembly of the Republic is truly  representative of our people's political and cultural diversity,  and if the president -- to be elected by the people --  represents and intends to realize these political ideals.    It is crucial, therefore, that our party emerge convincingly  victorious in the coming general multiparty elections.    It is clear to us that Frelimo's victory in the coming  elections is a national necessity, a patriotic cause which goes  far beyond political party limits and interests.    What we are going to do here, esteemed comrades, is to  prepare and organize our victory. We are going to prepare and  organize a better future for our people.    Our mission and pledge before all of our countrymen: to  provide a better future for each and every Mozambican, with more  hospitals, more schools, more workplaces, more houses, and  better working conditions in factories and farms.    This path that we have to thread is already reflected in the  immense work we have carried out since we gained peace for our  people with wisdom and patience: hundreds of kilometers of  roads have been opened or repaired; dozens of bridges have been  rebuilt; hundreds of hospitals and schools have been rebuilt and  new schools and health posts built; factories and other  production centers have resumed production; more than 800,000  Mozambicans who lived as refugees in neighboring countries have  returned to the fatherland and about three million people who  lived as displaced people inside the country have normalized  their lives.    All these things reinforce our conviction that we are on the  right path and that the hope that our people have today is  strengthening their desire to participate in the reconstruction  of Mozambique. We have to know how to use all this potential  knowledge, experience, and love for the fatherland of which our  people are the rightful custodians.    Dear comrades:    The National Frelimo Cadres Meeting will specifically center  its discussions on the electoral manifesto, the government  program after elections, and the party tasks in preparation for  the coming elections. These are the principal components of our  electoral strategy. Our proposals and recommendations will be  channeled to the Special Session of the Frelimo Central  Committee scheduled to take place after this meeting. The  session will also center its discussions on the above issues.    Today there is a lot of talk about democratization, as if  this was the most important issue for our people. It is true  though that the consolidation of democracy constitutes a  necessity in our present moment, our party's goal.    Democracy has no meaning, however, if people have no food;  if  everyone does not have access to health care and education; if  everyone cannot enjoy freedom of movement throughout the  national territory.    We always have to bear in mind what our people's priorities  are. To better realize these priorities, we have to increasingly  create better conditions for the participation of citizens and  all social forces in decision-making at all levels of our  country's life.    The example of democracy begins in our midst, with our  militants, in our party organs. This meeting expresses the  consolidation of the democratic exercise in our party. We have  to constantly improve our working methods to reveal our  individual and local initiatives, with a view to heightening the  intervention of our party organs and militants in society.    The cohesion and unity among party members, sympathizers,  and  all citizens who support Frelimo's cause must be reinforced,  particularly if we take into consideration the wave of violent  and defamatory criticism leveled against us by some political  forces.    We must always be present in society so that these  defamations do not make the Mozambican people forget what the  principal reason was for the present situation of misery  experienced by most of our People.    The principal reason for this misery was the war of  destabilization mounted from abroad, where Mozambicans were used  to destroy their own country, villages, schools, and hospitals  which were useful to their countrymen and their families;  factories, farms, shops, roads, and bridges, which produced,  traded, and helped to distribute products which we all need.    Mozambicans used to serve the interests of revengeful  settlers, Rhodesian racists, and "apartheid" bosses, ended up  becoming victims of this criminal process.    Now that they are part of the national political chess game,  they need houses, schools, hospitals, shops, and factories which  they themselves destroyed. Today they want voters and these  voters are among those who lost their loved ones, among those  who suffered the most inhuman physical mutilations carried out  on orders of anti- Mozambican forces abroad.    The atmosphere of national reconciliation, peace, and the  need to reunify the Mozambican family cannot make us indifferent  to attempts to manipulate the awareness of our people and  falsify history. The darkest pages have been registered in the  life of our people in our country's history, but the most  beautiful pages have also been registered. These beautiful  pages of freedom, independence, fraternity, and national unity,  peace and reconciliation of which we are so proud to champion,  constitute our constant source of inspiration, the constant  foundation of our convictions to face the great challenges of  today and tomorrow.    Dear comrades:    On 25 June this year, Frelimo will celebrate 32 years of  existence and Mozambique 19 as an independent country.    During all these years, we accumulated abundant political  and  technical experience. Our party has always had the capacity to  adjust course following the country's reality in each historical  moment, as well as the courage to identify inadequate policies  and mistakes in order to find solutions. These are some of the  reasons which make our party an esteemed organization.    We are proud to note that most of the participants of this  meeting are cadres who were trained academically and/or  professionally after national independence, as is the case with  dozens of thousands of others found in every corner of this  beautiful Mozambique.    It was these cadres, alongside all other militants and the  people, who enabled Frelimo to draw up objectives and realize a  vast plan of actions for the benefit of the people, despite the  adverse conditions created by acts of aggression carried out by  the racist regimes of Rhodesia and South Africa.    Between 1975 and 1977, the Frelimo government overcame the  crisis in the operation of public administration, following a  massive exodus of qualified technicians.    Until 1982 access to education increased. The number of  primary school pupils doubled, while the number of secondary  school students quadrupled.    More than 5,000 higher institute technicians have been  formed  since national independence. We reduced the rate of illiteracy  by 20 percent. We established another 358 health posts and  centers; while laboratory network quadrupled.    More than 400,000 people began to have clean water,  particularly from wells; important projects were carried out  through the dams of Pequenos Libombos, Corumana, Cuamba, and  Lichinga; we realized our development strategy in  telecommunications and rehabilitated railroads on the Nacala,  Beira, Limpopo Corridors, as well as textile factories in the  north of the country.    I have just cited a few examples of what was accomplished. A  lot of what we built was destroyed by the enemies of Mozambique.  Since our mission is to serve the people, however, even during  the war, our party cadres have always carried out the best of  their work for the country.    Today, with renewed hope and conviction, once again our  cadres demonstrate their political maturity, their technical and  professional abilities, and their immense love for the people.    On behalf of the Frelimo Central Committee, I would like to  salute with great affection all our cadres, men and women, who  throughout the country gave and continue to give great lessons  of patriotism, self-denial, and commitment to our project to  make Mozambicans a truly happy and prosperous people.    Cadres are pillars of the party. That is why we must  continue to do the best we can so that together we can  consolidate peace, justice, and democracy, promote our country's  development and progress, so that each of us can develop and  realize his or her talents as a citizen.    Dear comrades:    We have favorable conditions for obtaining victory in the  coming general elections.    We have a people who continue to respect and admire Frelimo,  because our party has always been known to embody their most  noble ideals and aspirations.    Proof of this are the visits that I recently made to the  Provinces of Gaza, Sofala, Tete, Nampula, and Cabo Delgado.    The affection accorded to the president of the Republic and  other government officials demonstrate the deep esteem for  Frelimo. We need to respect and guarantee the development of  this attitude.    We have a party which has more than 900,000 members. We have  the best cadres in the country. We have youth and women on our  side. What we need is just to work hard, with great tenacity,  since no victory is obtained without efforts and sacrifice.    I repeat: Victory has to be prepared, victory has to be  organized. Let us therefore devote ourselves, with all our  knowledge and energy to work after we have prepared and  organized ourselves here for victory.    Comrades:    As from 1 June, the voter registration process will begin  throughout the country. This is an important pointer for us to  view with optimism the peace process in Mozambique.    This is an important step forward so that in October this  year Mozambicans aged 18 and over can exercise their right and  civic duty to vote in the first multiparty elections the  president of the Republic and deputies of the Assembly, those  whom they feel are the best representatives of their  aspirations, those whom they feel have the ability and  experience to remove our country from the present state of  poverty and decisively move toward economic and social  development.    What we want today is what we have always wanted, but the  mentors of war against Mozambique never allowed us to realize  this.    We want happiness, prosperity, and progress, in brief,  wellbeing for all our people.    It is true that we have been experiencing some delays in the  implementation of the General Peace Accord.    These delays do not, however, jeopardize the implementation  of all phases of the process as provided for in the accord. The  Mozambican Government will continue to carry out all efforts to  guarantee that the multiparty elections take place on 27 and 28  October this year.    There are other positive aspects that need mentioning.  Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] officials, particularly  its leader Afonso Dhlakama, have repeatedly reiterated before  the national and international communities their commitment to  never again resume war, even in case of defeat in the coming  elections.    Renamo has been presenting lists of areas under its control  to be integrated into state administration. This process,  however, must on one hand be carried out speedily, so that these  areas can be opened to all political parties and allow  businessmen to carry out their activities there.    On the other hand, the process must be carried out with all  seriousness, common sense, and good faith, to avoid pretexts  that could lead to new delays in the implementation of the  General Peace Accord.    We are still concerned about the lack of freedom of movement  of citizens in areas under Renamo control; the movement of armed  elements belonging to this organization; and the policy of  violence and torture against citizens who do not obey their  orders or who simply do not show sympathy toward Renamo.    The beating of local officials in Xai-Xai, on the Renamo  leader's orders, are a serious human rights violation and a  gross violation of the law and the General Peace Accord itself.  This issue does not stop being a political issue, even if this  is a criminal offense which must be examined and resolved in  accordance with the law in force.    In other words, there are still Renamo elements who have not  abandoned the tendency to commit crime, which has always  characterized them during various years of the war.    This is neither the first nor the most serious violation of  human rights and breach of the law by Renamo. Frelimo and the  government have been exposing such actions carried out by Renamo  men.    The national and international communities, as well as the  UN  Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz], must not minimize these  incidents.    We would like to call on the Renamo leadership to behave in  a  civilized manner in the political game and order its men to  strictly adhere to the General Peace Accord, as well as to  respect the law and the legally installed authorities.    Dear comrades:    The present political atmosphere being experienced in  southern Africa encourages us to view our future with promise.    In South Africa, the African National Congress' victory, and  the election of our friend and comrade, Nelson Mandela, as the  first South African President chosen by the people marks the end  of "apartheid" and the birth of a new South Africa where  citizens of all races and ethnical groups are equal before the  law; where repression and oppression ceased to be the policy of  the state; a new South Africa which replaces the policy of  destabilization of neighboring countries, including Mozambique;  a South Africa which stands for cooperation and good  neighborliness. In South Africa, the people have chosen the  party that has always defended them from massacres and acts of  aggression, the people chose the party that better embodied  their interests and aspirations.    The end of "apartheid" in South Africa and the establishment  of a democratic government represents a great victory for all of  mankind, particularly for the peoples of southern Africa.    The peoples of our region were targets of the policy of  destabilization of the "apartheid" regime. Mozambicans today  still bear the scars of the policy of aggression of the racist  regime.    Now that South Africa has reemerged with a new political  stance in the region, this reinforces our hope for a better  future for the region and Mozambique in particular.    We all anxiously await South Africa's admittance as the 11th  member of the Southern African Development Community.    In Malawi, a new President, Bakili Muluzi, was  democratically  elected, ending a regime that had ceased to have the support of  the people long ago.    Armed men who took part in massacring Mozambican populations  and destroying economic and social infrastructures transited  through or from Malawi.    We give major importance to the visit that President Bakili  Muluzi has just made to Mozambique.    This is the first time that a head of state or the  Government  of Malawi made an official visit to our independent country.  Mozambique is also the first country that the Malawian head of  state visited. These facts reflect the new political situation  in that country.    All conditions have now been created so that relations of  friendship and cooperation between Mozambique and Malawi can  reach the high levels that we have always desired.    Beginning now, our relations with Malawi are based on mutual  respect, on noninterference in the internal affairs of each  country and on a mutually advantageous cooperation.    We continue to view with optimism the conclusion of the  present peace talks between the Angolan Government and the  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA].    Although there is still concern about eventual impasses  which  could be artificially introduced in the process by the mentors  of war in Angola, the news that the parties are moving toward a  negotiated solution of the conflict is a positive step forward.    We would like to encourage the government led by the Popular  Movement for the Liberation of Angola to continue with efforts  aimed at establishing peace in Angola, and we would like to urge  UNITA to finally respond with seriousness to the appeals of the  Angolan people and the entire world to silence arms in that  fraternal country.    We would like to reiterate our solidarity with the Angolan  people, and it is our hope that they will finally have peace and  tranquility and thus contribute to their national development.    Dear comrades:    As we begin the National Frelimo Cadres Meeting, we would  like once again to stress that we came here to hear your views,  welcome your views and opinions, in order to build the solid  foundations of our victory in elections.    Let us improve our image with better political and  professional engagement, as well as by assuming a public and  moral posture which corresponds with our principles and our  people's desire.    We expect the best participation from all of you.    Let us move toward victory, toward a better future.    For peace, unity, justice, and progress, the struggle  continues!</p>

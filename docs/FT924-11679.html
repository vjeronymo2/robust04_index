			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Motoring: Shadow over the motor show NEVER before has there been a British International Motor Show like the one opening to the public at the National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham, today. Whether there will be a similar one again may depend on how many people pass through the turnstiles between now and Sunday 1 November. For the first time since the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders held a motor show in 1903, there is a sponsor from outside the motor industry and the show is being combined with another event on the same site. The Daily Mail has chipped in with Pounds 2m and the motor show is being held jointly with its Midlands Autumn Ideal Home Exhibition. The same ticket admits visitors to both shows. But never mind. The echoing halls of the NEC contain a dazzling display of the world's latest cars, presented with style and razzmatazz. It's all a bit like one of those grand knees-ups that used to held by the opposing commanders on the eve of 18th and 19th century battles. Reality (for which read recession) is out of sight and mind for a few days, after which the car makers must get down to the task of cutting one anothers' throats again. Some of the biggest exhibitors at NEC spend up to Pounds 2m each on their stands. Privately, they admit they would love to pull out of the motor show altogether - but only if one of their competitors did so first. With about one-third of annual British sales now concentrated into August, they see it as a costly irrelevance held at the wrong time of the year. A cynical view? Of course. But one can argue that the great set-piece motor show is rooted in an age that no longer exists. The concept dates back to a time when there were still lots of British car makers. They used to unveil genuinely new models in a blaze of publicity at Earls Court, where the show was then held. Today, the industry is more international than national. New cars, usually spoken about freely beforehand, appear throughout the year. And at most of the international shows - not just our own - genuinely new models are heavily outnumbered by cars one could see and test drive at a local dealer. Tokyo Show is an honourable exception to this rule. Having said all that, anyone having an interest in motoring, strong legs and a comfortable pair of shoes will enjoy a day at the Birmingham show. If the cars should finally pall - and they do ultimately provoke a sort of visual indigestion - there is always the Ideal Home Exhibition to look at. My personal pick of things to see would be the cars that are new to a British visitor. The Audi 80 estate car, front-wheel or four-wheel driven, that goes on sale here in January is one. Take a look, too, at the Audi 100 saloon with a 2.5 litre direct-injection diesel engine and 6-speed gearbox. It is among the most fuel-efficient cars in the world. BMW's new 3-litre and 4-litre V8 engines power the 730i and a 740i that fills a gap in the range between the old 735i and the V12 750i. Also on show are a V8 engined 530 saloon and the ultimate BMW, a 5.6 litre, 380 horsepower V12 engined 850CSi which reaches Britain in the Spring. Chrysler's ultra-rapid ruffian of a car, the 8-litre, 10-cylinder Dodge Viper, will not be on sale at Pounds 50,000-plus until late next year. But the Chrysler Wrangler and Cherokee Jeeps will start undercutting rival 4x4s from January. Seven 3-door ZX models priced from Pounds 8,500 for an 1.4i Aura to Pounds 14,500 for a very high performing 16v are on the stand of Citroen, which took over five per cent of Britain's new car sales in August. Daihatsu's under Pounds 12,000 Bertone-styled, BMW 1.6 litre engined Freeclimber 4x4 is assembled in Europe and comes outside the agreement limiting UK sales of Japanese cars to 11 per cent of total registrations. This will make it practical for Daihatsu (UK) to import about 600 Mira microcars next year. This tiny five-door has an 850 cc, 3-cylinder multi-valve engine and five-speed gearbox. It will retail at around Pounds 6,000, with a three-year, unlimited mileage warranty. Compare it with Fiat's 900 cc, 4-cylinder Cinquecento baby car, due in Britain early next year. Ford is showing the face-lifted Escort and Orion powered by the new 16-valve Zeta engines. Hyundai's turbocharged Scoupe now has performance to match its sporty looks. Although Honda's British-made Accord is absent, the new 140 mph Prelude VTEC coupQ is being claimed (by Honda) as Europe's safest car. Apart from ABS brakes and electronically controlled 4-wheel steering it has driver and passenger side airbags as standard equipment. Its 2,157 cc four-cylinder engine produces a remarkable 185 horsepower and is said to be significantly less thirsty than that of equally potent rivals. Mercedes, which has announced that driver's side airbags are to be standard on all its cars, is showing revised versions of many current models with multi-valve engines. Mitsubishi's made-in-Australia 3-litre Sigma estate car and the restyled Lancer liftback range are new to Britain. One of the most important British-made cars at the NEC is the new Nissan Micra compact hatchback, which goes on sale in the UK early in 1993. By that time the Spanish-built, up to 8-seat Nissan Serena multi-purpose vehicle, on show for the first time in Britain, will also be available. Peugeot's best-selling, British-made 405 has a new interior, an easier-to-use boot and new engines, including the 1.9-litre turbo-diesel first seen in Citroen's ZX, to go with its class-leading ride and handling. The Safrane, Renault's 25 replacement, will compete with cars like the Ford Granada, Rover 800 and Vauxhall Carlton in the executive market. Rover's MG RV8 has the looks of a 30 year-old MGB but a 3.5 litre Rover V8 engine and 5-speed gearbox give it far more performance. A curious mix in some ways, but its low volume production will keep the name alive and prepare the way for a really new MG. The sleek Aero replaces the Carlsson as the muscle car of Saab's range. Subaru's cheeky little Vivio is good news for any potential runabout buyer living in Britain's snow belt. It has three-cylinders, instantly selectable four-wheel drive and five doors, all for just under Pounds 7,000. motoring 6 The Carina E, due to be rolling off the line at Burnaston, Derbyshire, in a few weeks; the latest 4.2 litre turbo-diesel Land Cruiser; and some entertaining oddities of concept cars, including one that drives on the road or hangs from a monorail, are on Toyota's stand. More down to earth are Vauxhall's restyled Cavaliers, among them turbocharged 4x4 and V6 engined variants. Vauxhall Astras will be offered with driver's side airbags, a new automatic transmission and air conditioning early in 1993. This looks like a smart move. With electronic enforcement of speed limits now a reality, cars of the future will have to be comfortable, easy to drive and safe above all else. The message seems to have gone home at Vauxhall.</p>

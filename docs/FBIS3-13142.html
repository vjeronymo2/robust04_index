			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary: "Blood, Massacre, and Settlements"] </F>   [Text] A very long time will pass before the Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre fades from our memory, a massacre the Zionist  army and settlers committed against worshipers, with advanced  planning, monstrous precision, and a diabolical terrorist  spirit. The perpetrators of this horrible massacre intended it  to violate our people's sacred three: The sacred Friday, the  month of Ramadan, and the Ibrahimi Mosque, so the wound would be  deeper, the pain doubled, and the outrage profound.    The Zionist movement and its successive generations have  adopted this kind of massacre as an article of faith and a modus  operandi against our Palestinian people. Such massacres have  always been a precursor of prominent phases in this long and  sanguinary struggle, beginning with the Dayr Yasin and Qafr  Qasim massacres, continuing with the Gaza, al-Sammu', Khan  Yunis, the al-Aqsa mosque [words indistinct] 'Uyun Qarah [Rishon  Letziyyon], and ending with the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre.    We know that in these massacres, Zionists sought to wipe out  the other side and liquidate it so the reality could be the same  as the myth. The Jewish myth, characterized by racism and  hatred, describes Palestine as a land a without a people. The  massacre was designed to wipe out the people and uproot their  civilized existence and pave the way for the triumph of the myth.    In implementation of the policy of massacres, we find that  the leaders of the Zionist movement, who have been and continue  to be leaders of the State of Israel, made massacres the main  component of their personal history, from which they derive the  feeling of supremacy. They participated in the series of  massacres, beginning with Menahem Begin and Yitzhaq Shamir and  ending with Yitzhaq Rabin, Israel's incumbent prime minister  himself. This means that none of the Israeli rulers, past or  present, stand against this kind of black, bloody terrorism  because none will stand against his own nature and his very  being.    In this latest massacre and in line with our argument, Rabin  cannot be the adversary and judge at the same time, the killer  who is asked to protect the Palestinian people. [Words  indistinct] clear to the international community which says it  wants peace, that it does not approve of these massacres.    The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre reveals to us that the Zionist  settlement in the Palestinian territory cannot be [words  indistinct] in blood. The leaders of the Israeli Government  have several times tried to improve the image ofthe settlements  and belittle their danger. The successive U.S. administrations  also tried to belittle the importance of the settlements in  order to justify to the (?taxpayer) their costs in tens of  billions of dollars. However, the Zionist settlements have  always exposed themselves by themselves, affirming that they  [words indistinct] and the shedding of Palestinian blood during  their prayers.    Those in the Israeli governments who created the settlements  are aware of this. It is natural that when we plant thorns we  should not expect grapes, when we plant bitter plants we do not  expect honey, and when we plant settlements we cannot expect  peace. In short, settlement building is against peace. The  advocates of settlements are against peace. The Israeli  Government that wants the settlements to remain, wants the peace  to disappear simultaneously. This is the aim of the massacre.  This is the motive behind its perpetration at this manner and  at this time so it may madly violate the three sanctities at the  same time.    It is well-known that the peace tool is negotiations and the  perpetrators of the murders aim to stop these negotiations. We  should not fall in the trap set for us. We should not slip into  the abyss prepared for us by the criminals. At the same time,  there can be no negotiations for the sake of negotiations.  Negotiations must have codes. [Words indistinct] The blood  shed at the Ibrahimi Mosque is more important than letting the  course of the negotiations proceed as it is. It is more  important than adhering to the same items and [word indistinct]  of the agenda. Why should it be discussed after two years? Why  not now? Why should the first point in the agenda not be the  settlers and the settlements, because this point is either the  key to peace or the key to the return of bloody clashes. Let  everybody take the responsibility.</p>

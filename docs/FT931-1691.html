			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Dresdner Bank plans DM1.2bn issue DRESDNER BANK, Germany's second-biggest bank, is planning to take advantage of the sharp rise in its share price this year to make a big rights issue in the next few weeks. The two-for-19 issue is expected to raise between DM1.2bn (Dollars 732m) and DM1.6bn. The bank, which next week is expected to report double-digit profit growth for 1992, gave no details on the purpose of the capital-raising measure, one of the largest rights issues ever undertaken by a German company. It said proceeds of the issue would be used to finance growth. The cash was not needed to meet capital adequacy guidelines, and it ruled out using it to buy shares in the Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) to accompany's Dresdner's co-operation with the state-owned French bank. The agreement is likely to be cemented with a 10 per cent share swap. Dresdner intends to issue 4m new shares before its annual meeting on May 14. Further details will be disclosed only after the bank's supervisory board meets on Monday, but analysts are predicting a price of around DM350 per share. The shares closed down DM6.30 at DM399.20 yesterday. The bank's shares have outperformed the rising DAX-30 index over the year, rising nearly 13 per cent, compared to a market increase of 6.7 per cent. This reflects investors' hopes about the impact of lower interest rates on the bank's performance and expectations of a sharp rise in 1992 operating profits. In December, the bank reported partial operating profits, excluding own-account trading results, up by nearly 19 per cent to DM2.09bn. The figure for the full year is expected to exceed DM2.5bn, up from DM2.21bn in 1991. Dresdner has not given any growth predictions for the current year. Growth in business volume actually fell at the parent company in the first 10 months of the year, reflecting the bank's cautious approach to new lending in Germany's worsening credit environment. The rights issue will rank with Daimler-Benz's DM1.95bn issue in 1989 and RWE's DM1.64bn issue this year as one of Germany's largest ever.</p>

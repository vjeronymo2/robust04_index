			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Observer: Stepping back Imelda Marcos, barred from returning to the Philippines to retrieve her 3,000 pairs of shoes, will not be collecting the secretary-generalship of the UN either. Although invited to stand as a nominee, she has told the International Association of the Friends of the United Nations - a New York non-profit organisation - that her UN experience is inadequate and her 'primary duty' is to her country and her people. Her letter nevertheless adds that she can act in some other capacity with the UN or in the Philippines and is ready to serve 'the cause of humanity'. In the interim, her first concern is returning to her country to bury her husband Ferdinand, the late dictator. President Corazon Aquino, who overthrew him in 1986, has promised to allow his widow back before the year end in line with a Swiss court ruling unfreezing Marcos bank accounts worth Dollars 350m unless she is given the chance to return and defend herself. Even so, her aides wonder if she will dare to take up the offer and so face allegations that she and her husband stole billions of dollars during their 20-year rule.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y.C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 27 (CNA) -- Taiwan's bid to join the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, is expected to  push up imports of consumer goods to an all-time high, trade  sources said Monday [27 Jun].    The sources forecast that imports of consumer products will  reach U.S.$11 billion this year, mostly attributable to relaxed  tariff restrictions.    They said further import-duty reductions are a must if  Taiwan  expects to gain membership in the Geneva-based world trade  regulating body by the end of the year. Taiwan now has observer  status with GATT.    With lower tariffs, they pointed out, a substantial increase  in imports, epecially of consumer products, is almost a  certainty. When the government slashed import duties in 1988 and  1992, imports of consumer goods jumped 64.2 percent and 35.7  percent to U.S.$5.68 billion and U.S.$9.27 billion,  respectively, they said.    Government statistics show that consumer imports totaled  U.S.$4.65 billion in the first five months of the year,  accounting for 13.6 percent of Taiwan's aggregate imports and an  increase of 1.8 percent from the year-earlier level.    The officials attributed the growth to the tariff reductions  that occurred earlier this year, when import duties on 70 items  were cut.</p>

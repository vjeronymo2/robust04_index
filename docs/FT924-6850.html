			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Arts: Hagegard and Bonney 'Tender is the North' - Song recitals If the re-opening of the Wigmore Hall had been delayed more than one month, there would have been problems. The festival of music from Scandinavia and the countries thereabouts, entitled 'Tender is the North', is being shared between the Barbican and the Wigmore: the first pair of song recitals fell within what turned out to be the hall's opening week. There is a good range of songs from which to choose. Any fear that this series of recitals would be heavy with Nordic gloom was quickly dispelled. To balance every song that has a chill in its bones - Stenhammar, for example, setting to music the story of a traveller blue with cold seeking refuge at night - there is another which will take as its theme the blossoming of spring. To that composers from Grieg to Sibelius have eagerly warmed. This first pair of recitals came in tandem from Hakan Hagegard and Barbara Bonney. As far as the baritone's programme on Tuesday was concerned, the North may not have seemed as tender as the title would have us believe. The days when Hagegard was a soft-grained singer are behind us. He opened his programme with Sibelius, took the songs in high keys and gave them a brazen, heroic force, which set the voice bouncing off the back wall. No doubt this is a good way to clear the tubes at the outset, but a tendency to sing big beyond the Wigmore's intimate needs ran through the evening. His main Scandinavian contribution comprised a group of five songs, King Erik's Lieder, by Ture Rangstrom. This was admittedly fairly glum Nordic stuff about a King ending his life in prison, but its dark (medieval?) feeling of oppression was chillingly caught by the baritone's concentrated singing. There were some standard German songs, too, and it is worth noting a rare performance of Frank Martin's Six Monologues from 'Jedermann'. Again, Hagegard brought force and tension to these awe-inspiring songs, while his pianist, Thomas Schuback, played as if he was tackling piano transcriptions of an orchestral accompaniment rather than a piano original, as is the case. To catch more of the sun which dispels the Northern gloom, one had to be present at the companion recital on Sunday afternoon. Calling on the songs which she had chosen for her Edinburgh Festival programme, Barbara Bonney put together a selection of brighter Scandinavian settings, starting with a first half devoted to Grieg. This was unrelieved sunshine, forests and lakes, all sung with lovely simplicity by Bonney - fully deserving of Grieg's description, 'beautiful child of spring'. Not much variety there, though. By the second half it was time for the darker clouds that sometimes cast a shadow over Stenhammar and Sibelius (the latter's songs are already looking the most impressive the North has to offer) even if Bonney was pushed to find the vocal depths for which some of them call. Geoffrey Parsons was her admirable pianist. Incidentally, the baritone and soprano are also husband and wife, though that was nowhere mentioned in the programme.

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Supreme Court to review US insurance ruling THE US Supreme Court has agreed to review a court ruling that could close one of the loopholes through which banks can gain access to the insurance market. The Court said yesterday that it would take up a case brought by the Independent Insurance Agents Association against the National Bank of Oregon, contesting banks' right under a 1916 law to sell insurance policies in towns of fewer than 5,000 people. This limited loophole was widened in 1986 when the Comptroller of the Currency, who supervises nationally chartered banks, decided that a bank could expand its insurance sales from its small town base to other markets. A federal appeals court in February not only dismissed this decision, but ruled the entire section justifying it was repealed in 1918 as a result of a congressional drafting error. Lawyers for the Bush administration have backed the bank's appeal against the appeals court ruling. The Oregon bank has been selling policies to its customers nationwide from the small town of Banks, and about 100 banks have also taken advantage of the loophole. The administration's efforts to allow banks much broader rights to sell insurance and other financial services failed in Congress last year. However, the Supreme Court last year refused to review another ruling - in this case, in favour of the banks - on a Delaware state law permitting banks to sell insurance policies through locally chartered subsidiaries. Banks have been excluded from activities such as stockbroking, securities underwriting and insurance by legislation from the 1920s and 1930s. After the 1991 attempt at broader legislative reform failed, they have placed most of their hopes for expanded powers to sell a full range of financial services on piecemeal decisions by regulators.</p>

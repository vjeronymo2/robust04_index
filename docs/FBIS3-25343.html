The documents --  transcripts from the secret trial of a South African Air Force  officer and from the government's classified submissions to the  International Atomic Energy Authority [as published] (IAEA) --  show that much vital information has been kept from the public.  They also show that President Frederik de Klerk's statement to  parliament on 23 March 1993 that the government had built then  destroyed just six crude nuclear devices fell far short of the  whole truth.    The sophistication of the securocrats' nuclear ambitions in  the 1970s and 1980s was grotesquely at odds with the disarray  and venality among the government officials involved in the  project, as evidence given in the secret trial of Air Force  Brigadier Johann Blaauw in 1987-88 at the Supreme Court in  Capetown makes clear.    Classified documents from the trial obtained by AFRICA  CONFIDENTIAL trace how Brig. Blaauw, who negotiated a deal with  Israel for the supply of tritium (a key ingredient required to  make thermonuclear weapons) fell out with former Minister of  Labour and Mines Fanie Botha. Blaauw claimed that Botha had  promised him diamond concessions in Namaqualand, on South  Africa's western seaboard, in return for his work on the nuclear  programme but then failed to deliver. Botha denied this but  said that Blaauw had threatened to make public details about the  nuclear programme and the alleged improprieties linked to it.  By the time of their falling out, Botha had incurred  substantial debts and had his assets sequestrated following his  resignation from ministerial office and parliament on 15  November 1983 after some highly critical press reports.    In November l984, the police in Pretoria arrested Blaauw on  charges of attempted extortion against Fanie Botha and  possession of secret data concerning the Koeberg nuclear power  reactor. However, Blaauw was acquitted in September 1988 and he  is still pursuing his claim for the allegedly promised mining  concessions through the civil courts.    Blaauw had an exemplary Air Force career which began in  World  War II and included service with Western forces in Palestine,  the Korean War and the Berlin airlift. Following his retirement  from the Air Force in l975, Blaauw was the messenger in some of  Pretoria's most sensitive military transactions with Israel.    It is difficult to see how De Klerk, who took over the  mining  portfolio from Botha, would not have been briefed about the  tensions between Botha and Blaauw and the nature of Blaauw's  work on the nuclear programme with Israel.    In fact, De Klerk testified at Blaauw's trial, saying that  Fanie Botha, a political rival, approached him after a cabinet  meeting and told him he had been in the process of awarding a  mining concession to Blaauw and asking if a way could be found  to grant it. There is absolutely no evidence linking De Klerk  to the illicit transactions surrounding the nuclear programme  and sources close to the highest levels of government have told  AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL that De Klerk got in and out of the ministry  as quickly as possible. By the end of the 1980s, De Klerk was  said to be unable "to come to terms philosophically" with the  securocrats' plans to develop thermonuclear weapons whose  primary target would be African civilians.    However, De Klerk's apparent "road to Damascus" on the  nuclear weapons programme still has not facilitated a full  admission of the extent of the government's nuclear programme.  This lack of frankness about the nuclear programme concerns  senior officials in Western governments particularly at a time  when South Africa is negotiating a delicate transition where the  loyalties of some senior officials in the security forces appear  uncertain.    Blaauw's errand to secure tritium from Israel is  significant:  Tritium is a gas used to boost the power of nuclear weapons  creating fusion or thermonuclear bombs. In information  submitted to the IAEA, which monitors compliance with the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) for the United Nations,  the government admitted that its weapons programme had involved  lithium-6 separation, a means of producing tritium. So  sensitive is this information that senior African National  Congress (ANC) officials, some of whom will be holding  ministerial office after the April elections, have been refused  access to it.    According to a September 1993 IAEA document obtained by  AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL, the programme had also progressed by the  early 1980s to planning a 150 megawatt reactor capable of  producing tritium and plutonium. The reactor, which was to have  been built at Gouriqua, near Mossel Bay, never got beyond the  basic engineering preparations. But Pretoria continued to work  on developing thermonuclear weapons until 1985 or l986,  according to Wynand de Villiers of Pretoria's Atomic Energy  Corporation and Roger Jardine, the ANC's science policy  coordinator. Pretoria began dismantling its nuclear weapons  programme in 1990, in preparation for signing the NPT the  following year.    In his 24 March 1993 speech De Klerk also insisted that "at  no time did South Africa acquire nuclear technology from another  country." Apart from United States intelligence reports  attesting to Israeli-South African nuclear collaboration,  additional information would have been available to De Klerk,  during his tenure at the Mines Ministry, to indicate that  tritium production is the result of a highly sophisticated  technology, one which South Africa had not mastered.    At his trial, Blaauw testified that he negotiated for the  supply of 30 grammes of tritium from Israel in exchange for 600  tonnes of "yellowcake" (uranium oxide). The tritium-yellowcake  exchange deal is described in some detail in a recent book by  William E. Burrows and Robert Windrem. ("Critical Mass" by  William Burrows and Robert Windrem (Simon and Schuster) 1994)  They write that the sensitive arrangements were jointly  overseen by South Africa's then intelligence agency, the Bureau  of State Security (BOSS) and the Israeli intelligence division  Lish Ka le-Kishrei [as published] (Lakam) which specialised in  nuclear and technological procurement and came to public  attention when it was linked to the Jonathan Jay Pollard spy  scandal in the USA in 1985.    Blaauw testified at the trial that he had established South  Africa's Israeli connection through a South African who had  emigrated to Israel. In this way Blaauw was able to make  high-level military contacts in Israel. Initially the two men  arranged the emergency supply of South African spare parts for  Mirage aircraft, needed by Israel after the 1973 war.    Then Blaauw arranged a deal with an Israeli front company in  Wiesbaden, Germany, through which he obtained British tanks and  Browning machine guns for South Africa, according to the trial  documents. Finally, Blaauw said he was approached by one  "Binyamin" of Lakam (almost certainly Binyamin Blumberg, chief  of Lakam between 1957 and 1981), who asked if South Africa would  sell Israel yellowcake which can be enriched to make fuel for  nuclear weapons or power reactors.    Through his service in South African military liaison during  the Rhodesian war, in which he took part in many joint covert  activities with Salisbury and helped set up a meeting between  white leader Ian Smith, Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda and  South African Prime Minister John Vorster, Blaauw became a  confidant of General Hendrik van den Bergh, then head of the  security police -- and subsequently the head of BOSS. He told  the court that he then approached Van den Bergh with Lakam's  request and Van den Bergh got the go-ahead for the deal from  John Vorster. In April 1976 Vorster visited Israel and signed a  comprehensive set of military and economic cooperation pacts.    According to Burrows' and Windrem's book, Israeli and South  African officials, including director of Lakam Binyamin Blumberg  and then Information Ministry Secretary Eschel Rhoodie travelled  as escorts on the twelve flights which brought the tritium --  2.5 grams at a time -- to South Africa. Small as the quantity  was, it would have been enough to make one bomb every six weeks.    Piet Koornhof, Minister for Mines at the time the yellowcake  deal was struck, was replaced by Fanie Botha in a Vorster  reshuffle. Fanie Botha's interest in the Defence portfolio was  known by Vorster: Blaauw testified that arrangements were made  for Botha to tour secret Israeli military installations in  preparation for his elevation to the defence portfolio. Blaauw  said he handled the details of Botha's itinerary and accompanied  him to Israel.    Botha was a hit with the Israelis. "Look after Fanie Botha,"  Blaauw's contact in Israel told him. He explained to the court  that Israel wanted to keep Botha at the Mines Ministry until the  yellowcake shipments were complete. After that, they were eager  for him to become Defence Minister, hoping that he would be more  cooperative than Pieter W. Botha, who held the post at the time.    Blaauw testified that he began diverting funds to Fanie  Botha  from a US$1 million "gift" he had received from Israel. The  objective was not to sweeten Botha, Blaauw explained, but to  keep his political career from being destroyed by mounting  personal debt.    Botha's trusted administrative secretary Frances Peter van  Ravensway Whelpton, however, was an outright crook. He pocketed  all but Rand [R] 110,000 ($34,000) of the R. 420,000 that Blaauw  provided for Botha between 1977 and 1980. The funds were  channelled through Whelpton so that Botha would not know the  source and to distance him from the source, which was kickbacks  from Pretoria's arms deals with Israel, according to Blaauw.  Additionally, Blaauw admitted making small payments to  Whelpton, who apparently conceived and facilitated the grant of  mining concessions on state-owned land (Sea Areas 1 and 2 on the  West Coast) to Blaauw's company Ondombo Beleggings which  precipitated the fall out with Botha. Whelpton pleaded guilty  to extortion and illicitly possessing state secrets and was  sentenced to five years in prison. It was several months before  Blaauw realised that Botha was slow to hand over the mining  leases because those areas had already been promised to others.    As an interesting sidenote, two senior officials from Anglo-  American submitted testimony to the trial. According to the  presiding judge's interpretation of the testimony of Harry  Oppenheimer (Chairman of Anglo-American from 1957 to March 1983)  was that Oppenheimer undertook to do what he could to assist  Fanie Botha and in fact had an interview with Tertius Myburgh,  the editor of the SUNDAY TIMES, as a result of which no  information about Fanie Botha's financial position was published  in that newspaper [sentence as published].    However, the judge's interpretation is at variance with  Oppenheimer's recollection of his testimony. Oppenheimer told  AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL on 2 February 1994 that although he had no  control over what was published in the English press in South  Africa he had "said he would pass on to Myburgh what Botha had  told him. He subsequently told Myburgh the substance of his  conversation with Botha, but he did not ask Myburgh whether he  intended to publish any story relating to the Minister's  affairs. Myburgh did say he was aware of rumours surrounding  Minister Botha's affairs, and that these were being investigated  by his reporters. Oppenheimer did not ask, nor did Myburgh  undertake, not to publish any information regarding Botha's  financial position." According to Oppenheimer. nothing was  published about Botha at that time for fear of libel.    The current Chairman of Anglo American, Julian Ogilvie  Thompson, has given his version of the events surrounding the  applications for the mining rights on Namaqualand sea areas l-5.  Blaauw testified that he had disputed with Ogilvie Thompson  about which concessions Anglo American should pursue. Ogilvie  Thompson has told Africa Confidential that he first met Blaauw  in June 1979 in Anglo American's offices where Blaauw "advised  De Beers (Anglo American's sister company) of a change in the  Namaqualand sea areas from discouraging to encouraging  applications for rights to prospect for diamonds." De Beers  subsequently applied for mining rights in sea areas 1-5 but the  forms were mislaid. Ogilvie Thompson says that the last time he  met Blaauw, who he says was trying to negotiate the concessions  for himself, was in March 1980 at a rendezvous on the N1  highway, when he gave Blaauw a duplicate set of the mining  rights applications which were to be delivered personally to the  Minister. Ogilvie Thompson added: "No payment was asked for or  made by De Beers to any person in connection with these  applications."    The Namaqualand sea areas 1-2 were awarded to State Alluvial  Diggings and UK-based Selection Trust Company respectively, and  sea area 3 to US-based Sedco. Areas 4 and 5 went to De Beers:  Setrust, Sedco and De Beers have subsequently joined together  in a joint venture.    In 1981, after attempting to secure the promised leases by  legal action, Blaauw joined by Whelpton began to pressure Botha,  who in turn began lobbying the Van Winsen Committee which had  begun reviewing the leases. According to the court documents,  Blaauw and Whelpton also began threatening to expose how, during  the power struggle sparked by John Vorster's fall in the 1978  information scandal, Fanie Botha, a weak contender for the  succession, agreed that Blaauw should eavesdrop on the phones  and conversations of some his rivals including Foreign Minister  Pik Botha, De Klerk, I.S.J. Schoeman, A.J. Raubenheimer, and A.  P. Treurnicht.    Blaauw and Whelpton also planned to allege publicly that  Fanie Botha plotted with them to implicate two National Party  MPs in illegal diamond transactions, according to testimony in  the case. Another alleged plan, to circulate stories in  Parliament about a sex scandal involving Pik Botha, also made  its way into the court record. More seriously and perhaps a  harbinger of the corruption exposed in the 1990s, the court  entered as evidence a document, which according to Blaauw  testimony, contained a list of Swiss bank accounts opened by  senior officials in the government. The document passed through  the hands of Whelpton and Blaauw, although it is not clear for  what purpose.    When Blaauw threatened to release this information, Botha  called in the police, who began taping telephone calls and  meetings. Botha, who never flatly confirmed or denied that he  had granted the concessions, later admitted to Judge G. Friedman  that he had erased parts of the tape of his meetings with Blaauw.    Friedman cleared Blaauw of extortion and appeared convinced  that Fanie Botha had promised him the concessions in July 1979.  It was proper for Blaauw to have the classified document  concerning Koeberg's fuel requirements, ruled Friedman, because  he was working closely with Wynand de Villiers, director of the  Atomic Energy Corporation, to obtain enriched uranium for the  reactor.</p>

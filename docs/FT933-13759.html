			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Automated benefits urged to beat fraud WIDER USE of automated credit transfer for the payment of retirement pensions and other benefits was urged again by Mr Alistair Burt, a junior social security minister, in the Commons yesterday. Stressing the contribution the system could make to combating social security fraud - estimated to be in excess of Pounds 1bn a year  - Mr Burt denied that extending automated payments would pose a threat to post offices. He reaffirmed the government's wish to maintain a nationwide network of post offices. Mr Burt gave an assurance that any loss of Post Office business through the use of automated credit transfer would be 'more than offset' by an overall increase in the volume of social security transactions over the next few years. MPs were told that in 1991-92 fraudulent misuse of payment order books accounted for Pounds 85m, while a further Pounds 16m was lost through the fraudulent encashment of giro cheques. New technology and the use of bar codes were helping to curb the use of stolen payment order books, and the Department of Social Security was developing plans for fraud-resistant computer systems. Mr Burt said new computers had already been installed to help 'fraud managers' identify patterns of crime, monitor performance and deploy resources. He added that while he was striving for value for money in the Benefits Agency, no firm decision had yet been made about the introduction of market testing in the investigation of fraud. Mr Keith Bradley, Labour MP for Withington, joined the condemnation of social security fraud, but called on the government to show equal determination in dealing with tax evasion.</p>

			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARTHQUAKE SAFETY AFFECTS PLANS AT TWO MUSEUMS  </P> <P> Prompted by earthquake safety concerns, officials at the California Museum of  Science and Industry have closed two of their major buildings, and directors at  the Southwest Museum, facing $2 million in overdue repairs and seismic safety  upgrades, are seeking a new home, perhaps abandoning the site that has housed  their collection for more than 80 years.  </P> <P> At the Science and Industry Museum, across from USC, executive director Jeffrey  Rudolph on Thursday ordered the immediate closure of both the 1912 Ahmanson  Building and the Armory Building on the "very strong recommendation" of Paul  Neel of the Office of the State Architect who on Thursday found them to be  potentially unsafe.  </P> <P> The action shuts about 100,000 square feet of museum exhibition space that  houses, among other things, an earthquake simulation exhibit.  </P> <P> James Dickason, chairman of the board of the Southwest Museum and a board  member of the Science and Industry Museum, confirmed Friday night that  prospects of having to spend $2 million in overdue repairs on a building that  directors fear may have seismic safety problems contributed to the recent  decision to seek a new home for the collection in the stately, Italianate  building in the Mt. Washington area of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Museum trustees have no location in mind, according to Dickason. He said they  plan to announce their decision to relocate early next week, to gauge the  interest of a number of Southern California cities in acquiring the collection.  </P> <P> The museum also must confront limitations of its picturesque but aging concrete  main building. He said it suffers from seismic safety problems serious enough  to prompt fears that its world-famous collection of Native American art and  artifacts could suffer catastrophic losses in a major quake.  </P> <P> For the Museum of Science and Industry, the decision to close the Ahmanson  Building, an unreinforced masonry structure, means having to dismantle most of  the museum's main exhibits, including one on earthquake safety, perhaps moving  them to temporary buildings, Campbell said.  </P> <P> Thousands of schoolchildren have visited the exhibit, which simulates an  earthquake with shaking floors and walls, and demonstrates how to prepare for a  quake.  </P> <P> Deputy Museum Director Bob Campbell said the decision to close the buildings --  two of the six owned by the state in Exposition Park -- will have a  "significant impact" on the ability of the museum to operate.  </P> <P> "We're going to look at the possibility of temporary space to house our  programs by bringing in temporary buildings," Campbell said.  </P> <P> This week's inspection stemmed from a master plan preparation ordered two years  ago by the state Legislature, Campbell said.  </P> <P> Last April, a study determined that it would take about $54 million to bring  the buildings up to code, Campbell said. Neel was invited to inspect the museum  and offer planning advice.  </P> <P> "He did that on Wednesday. On Thursday, he returned with a staff of experts to  take a closer look," Campbell said. "They crawled into spaces and looked  around. Then, Neel offered a strong recommendation to close the buildings to  the public."  </P> <P> A long-range planning study also led to the decision at Southwest Museum.  </P> <P> Within the last few days, museum trustees met with City Councilman Richard  Alatorre, who reportedly raised strenuous objections to the proposed move. He  was told that only a massive infusion of $5 million to $10 million in new  endowment and capital improvement money could keep the Southwest at its current  location.  </P> <P> A source familiar with the museum's deliberations said the plans are largely  undefined. "In a sense, it's a fishing expedition," said the source. "They  don't know where they want to go. They just want to see who might want them."  </P></p>

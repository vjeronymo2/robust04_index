			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINE: A FRENCH ACCENT;  </P> <P> CHATEAU POTELLE: NEW CALIFORNIA WINES WITH A GALLIC TASTE  </P> <P> WHILE MANY new wineries in California are joint ventures with famous French  houses, Chateau Potelle's joint venture is between a French husband and wife.  Jean-Noel and Marketta Fourmeaux du Sartel advertise their wines as "California  wines with a French accent." And they are just that.  </P> <P> The 1986 Chateau Potelle Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc ($7.95) is softened with  15% Semillon. Hints of its aging in French oak ovals are present in the  bouquet. But the wine's subtle finesse has varietal integrity without any trace  of grassiness. It's a wonderful beginning to a meal, best with seafood, creamy  pasta dishes, quiches and poultry.  </P> <P> The 1986 Chateau Potelle Napa Valley Chardonnay ($12) comes from 60% Carneros  grapes and 40% Napa Valley. About 20% of the blending undergoes malolactic  fermentation and 40% is barrel-fermented. In Jean-Noel's words: "This wine is  not an assault but rather a caress." Aged in French oak, it's a wine with melon  gentleness, poetic in Meursault style. Brilliant, silvery, the Chardonnay can  be drunk now. But it will become richer with a year of two of cellar-aging. Buy  it now; it's bound to improve in both value and taste.  </P> <P> The 1984 Chateau Potelle Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon ($12) is a blend  of 87% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Cabernet Franc and 8% Merlot. The enchanting  bouquet suggests berries, plums and a hint of spices. The taste is appealing,  with no tannic astringency. The wine, Bordeaux-French in style, has fine aging  potential and has already won six medals.  </P> <P> Jean-Noel and Marketta first came to California in 1980 to evaluate the  marketing threat of California wines for France's Institute National des  Appellations d'Origine.  </P> <P> After tasting more than 2,000 California wines in six months, they recognized  the potential for California premium quality wine making. In 1983, they moved  with their two young daughters to California, making plans to produce their  wines under the Chateau Potelle label. (Chateau Potelle, the medieval,  twin-towered castle illustrated on their label, is the 900-year-old castle  owned by Jean-Noel's family, which also owns the noted Bordeaux wine estate,  Chateau Leoville-Poyferre.)  </P> <P> The couple's search for premium grapes concluded with long-term contracts with  growers in the Napa Valley and the Alexander Valley. Last year, they purchased  90 acres of mature vines for their Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay in the Napa  Valley. And after a lengthy negotiation, they concluded the purchase of 202  acres of the Hamilton Vose vineyards on Mt. Veeder in Napa Valley.  </P> <P> At last the couple could build their own winery. (Their first wines were made  in leased, custom-crush locations with the couple overseeing every step:  harvesting, fermenting, cask-aging, bottling and labeling.)  </P> <P> Jean-Noel and Marketta have been in the California wine business only briefly,  but already they're producing winners: Last year, their wines came home with  top medals from eight national and international wine competitions. And Chateau  Potelle was one of 63 wineries featured at President Bush's inauguration.  </P></p>

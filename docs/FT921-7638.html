			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help lift Fairway 68% to Pounds 1.8m INCLUDING three acquisitions, Fairway (London) lifted sales to Pounds 19.8m and pre-tax profit by 68 per cent to Pounds 1.77m in 1991. The figures compared with Pounds 8.36m and Pounds 1.05m respectively. The group supplies business and computer stationery. It bought GLS, supplier to publicly-owned schools, educational establishments and councils, Tonbridge Trade Binders, and Systemforms. GLS cost Pounds 2.3m and the group raised Pounds 6m via a rights issue to meet that cost and provide working capital. Mr Gordon Waddell, chairman, said overall group results were satisfactory. GLS made a substantial contribution for the seven months, Tonbridge results were creditable, and Hickey's Trade Bindery also performed satisfactorily. At Fairway Business Forms and Systemforms profits were substantially below last year. Earnings per share rose to 5.14p (4.17p). The final dividend is 2.15p to make 3.15p on the increased capital (3p).</p>

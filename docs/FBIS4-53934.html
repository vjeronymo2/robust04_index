			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 24 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  reportedly said Monday North Korea should give up its nuclear  program and try to solve problems on the Korean peninsula  through dialogue with South Korea as well as the United States.    President Kim made the statement in answer to a question on  what message he wants to send to North Korea through his June  1-4 visit to Russia at a press conference with Russian  correspondents here Monday.    Kim was known to have welcomed Moscow's proposal on holding  an international conference attended by South and North Korea,  Russia, China, Japan, the United States, the United Nations and  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as an expression  of its intention to find a solution to the North Korean nuclear  problem.    He added, however, that it will take a little longer for  these parties to determine whether such a conference would  efficiently help settle the nuclear dispute.    Noting that he believes Russia is firmly opposed to North  Korea's production of nuclear weapons, Kim said he will study  ways to cooperate in the nuclear issue at summit meetings with  Russian President Boris Yeltsin.</p>

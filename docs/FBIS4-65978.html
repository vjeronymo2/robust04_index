			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Barbara Ruete report from Brussels] </F>   [Excerpt] When the Russian defense minister entered the  NATO building this morning, hopes were high that Russia would  recognize the Western alliance as the supreme military and  political body. However, in his speech at the NATO Cooperation  Council, Grachev presented his vision. Russia would like to  expand the CSCE to the supreme political body. In this  roundabout way, the big power would again get a greater say in  important decisions. This is categorically rejected by NATO.    [Begin Defense Minister Volker Ruehe recording] We see the  CSCE as a roof, but what NATO is doing for stability in Europe  cannot be replaced by the CSCE. I do not advocate that Russia  become a NATO member, but I advocate that the Central and East  European states can become NATO members. Regarding Russia, I  advocate a broad dialogue, for instance also about issues that  go beyond the Partnership for Peace. [end recording] [passage  omitted]    [Vienna ORF Television Network in German at 1730 GMT carries  a similar report about the NATO meeting in Brussels, where Ruehe  is shown as saying: "I think that Russia's position is  justified. Who could be more interested than we are in talking  with the Russians, for instance about nonproliferation and about  the safety of nuclear weapons?"]</p>

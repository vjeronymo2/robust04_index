			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Central Europe's big mistake: Lack of bank reforms THE failure of post-communist central European states to make bank reform and re-capitalisation of the banking system top priority has emerged as their biggest single policy error, according to a progress report on economic transformation in central Europe. Published by the European Commission and the London-based centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), the report notes that price liberalisation and financial stabilisation programmes have been successful in the Czech republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia but that further institution building is required to liberalise labour, housing and above all capital markets. It criticises the 'fast track' central European reformers for 'over-emphasising stabilisation at the expense of systemic transformation which has itself concentrated unduly on privatisation at the expense of wider structural change.' While stabilisation policies managed to prevent hyper-inflation, they exacted an unduly heavy price in output and employment. The steep fall in output was exacerbated by the collapse of Comecon trade and the failure to establish a payments clearance system to manage trade between the former Soviet satellites. The unexpectedly sharp decline in economic activity was due largely to 'the unanticipated negative supply side effects as many large state owned enterprises effectively forced banks and suppliers to roll over past loans and capitalise arrears so that a greater than intended real credit squeeze hit the small emerging private sector disproportionately'. In this the experience of central Europe differs markedly from that of the less developed countries where the application of a standard policy package managed to halt chronic inflation almost instantaneously without serious short term output costs. To overcome the specific problems faced by reforming post-communist economies the authors of the report, Prof Richard Portes, director of the CEPR and Prof Mario Nuti, call on international institutions and governments to implement a six-point programme involving recapitalisation of the banks; incentives for better management of state enterprises; the introduction of modern VAT and other taxes; incomes policies linked to creation of effective social safety nets; creation of secure legal frameworks for foreign investment and greater regional co-operation to restore lost intra-Comecon trade.

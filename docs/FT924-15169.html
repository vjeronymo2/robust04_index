			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Oriel disposal as profits decline Oriel Group, the USM-quoted insurance broker, yesterday announced the sale of its general insurance broking division and a downturn in profits for the six months ended June 30. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 1.2m and earnings per share to 5.27p (7.55p). However, the interim dividend is being increased to 2p (1.8p). The directors estimated that the disposal of the general insurance broking division to Jardine Insurance Brokers for Pounds 5.4m in cash would lead to an exceptional profit of about Pounds 1.5m at the year-end after the write-back of goodwill and related costs. They said the sale would lead to a substantial reduction in head office overheads, would eliminate group borrowings and would give scope to fund further acquisitions in specialist insurance areas. As a result of the disposal, Mr Martin Harridine, deputy chairman, will leave the group to join Jardine Insurance Brokers.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by B.C.: "In Slask, Occupations, Blockades, </F> Strikes"]    [Text] The headquarters of the Jastrzebie Coal  Partnership [Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa] has been occupied by  trade union activists for nine days now. Following yesterday's  two-hour warning strike in the partnership's six mines, a  Protest Committee sponsored by "Solidarity," "Solidarity 80,"  and "Kontra" is sticking to its demands for a 15-percent salary  increase.    On the other hand, management says that the partnership  cannot afford such an increase when you take into account, for  instance, the fact that its financial obligations exceed claims  it is entitled to by 2.2 trillion zlotys. To prove the argument  is true, the management ordered that an expert economic analysis  be conducted by the end of the week. The partnership's  president proposes that in the meantime, both sides come up with  mediators to provide assistance in salary negotiations which  started at the beginning of the month. The Protest Committee  informed the partnership's management that, if the talks fail,  the committee will avail itself of Article 15 of the Trade Union  Law--that would mean initiating a continuous strike.    The headquarters of the Gliwice Coal Partnership [Gliwicka  Spolka Weglowa] is also under occupation now, but this time it  is by several dozen activists from "Solidarity 80."  "Solidarity" has been supporting the strike since Tuesday [1  February]. The activists are demanding salary increases  without, however, defining the limits of increases; they also  demand an increase in the value of coal allowances (8 tons) from  850,000 zlotys to 1.35 million zlotys, which is the market price  for coal. But the occupying trade unionists categorically  reject one-time payments of 1.8 million zlotys to the  partnership's miners. That increase is the result of a recent  strike by activists of "August 80," which competes with  "Solidarity 80." Talks with the partnership's management are  under way.    For its part, "Solidarity" organized two-hour warning  strikes  in the mines of the Bytom Coal Partnership [Bytomska Spolka  Weglowa] on Wednesday. The strikes went on from 0600 to 0700 in  six mines; there were strikes until 0800 in two mines, and there  were no strikes at all in three other mines. An open  demonstration was announced in "Jowisz" mine before the second  shift.    About 600 employees of the Bytom Mining Enterprise are on  strike. They are occupying the management's building. The  strike is sponsored by "Solidarity" and by the Miners Trade  Union. The trade unionists are demanding salary increases.</p>

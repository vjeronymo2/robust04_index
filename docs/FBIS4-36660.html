			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lutfi Shatarah] </F>   [Text] London -- 'Abdallah al-Asnaj, foreign minister of  the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY], has accused Jordan of  involvement in the ongoing fighting in Yemen alongside the  forces loyal to the Sanaa leadership. He told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT  over the telephone from Abu Dhabi that 30 Jordanian military air  engineers are equipping Northern U.S.-made F-5 fighter aircraft  with spare parts -- "which has helped to restore their  combat-readiness, thus enabling them to participate in recent  battles."    Al-Asnaj said that "the DRY authorities are investigating  this involvement with the Jordanian quarters concerned and with  a number of Arab states, on the grounds that this involvement is  one of the factors contributing to escalating the war."    It is worth mentioning that a high-ranking Western  diplomatic  source, who asked to remain anonymous, told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT  that "some reports say that Yemen is obtaining arms from  Russia." The sources added that "Jordan may be the channel  through which the arms are imported for Sanaa."    Al-Asnaj pointed out that Northern aircraft, which have  resumed their attacks recently, "are bombing civilian targets in  the Aden suburbs." He stressed that "the DRY will cooperate  with any measures taken by the Security Council to secure a  cease-fire, and may apply to the Council again if [UN secretary  general's envoy Lakhdar] Brahimi's mission fails."</p>

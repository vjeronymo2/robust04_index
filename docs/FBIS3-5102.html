The figure, representing the net balance in the nation's  trade in goods and services and some unilateral transfers,  totaled a preliminary 6.83 billion dollars before adjustments  for seasonal factors, the ministry said.    The January figures followed December's year-on-year gain of  9.3 percent to 12.57 billion dollars. That was a return to  Japan's swelling black ink with the rest of the world after a  November decline broke a string of six straight quarterly  increases from year-earlier levels.    Within the current account, the merchandise trade surplus --  the difference between exports and imports of merchandise --  rose 15.1 percent in January from a year before to 8.26 billion  dollars, the ministry said.    Exports rose 6.9 percent to 25.36 billion dollars, while  imports rose 3.3 percent to 17.09 billion dollars.</p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Tidal wave of anger: Americans are starting to vent their frustration Across the US, voters are sending a damning message to President George Bush as his campaign for re-election in November limps from the recession-scarred north through the midwestern prairies to the sunbelt. The 'primal scream' of anger registered in New Hampshire, where only 53 per cent of Republicans gave their vote to the incumbent president, was a strident warning that people are not persuaded by his expressions of care and understanding for their economic predicament. The point was brought home in a Time/CNN poll last week that showed 59 per cent of those questioned felt Mr Bush did not understand the problems of the average American. Mr Ben Rutland, an unemployed maintenance worker in Forsyth, a small town in rural Georgia, summed up the message: 'I voted for Bush, but I ain't going to vote for him any more. Bush has got to go because this economy's dying.' Mr Clayburn Durham, who owns the village store in Fair Play, South Carolina, concurs: 'The money's not coming across the counter quite like it used to. A lot of people are saying this isn't a recession, it's a small depression.' Despite the outpouring of anger caused by the current recession, measurements such as the national unemployment rate - now 7.1 per cent, compared with an average of 9.5 per cent in 1982 and 1983 - indicate that it is milder than recent downturns. But the anguish of voters appears much keener: this week, the Conference Board, a New York-based business organisation, reported that its index of consumer confidence had dropped to its lowest level since 1974, despite economic statistics showing that business activity might be starting to pick up. 'For the first time the American people don't think their children are going to have as good a life as they've had - forget better,' says Ms Lynn Cutler, vice-chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Particularly acute has been the pain of the middle class. Almost 90 per cent of Americans claim to belong to this category, but a growing number say they have been driven down the scale, or fear that they will be. 'We used to be in the middle class but we're now in the lower class. There used to be three classes, upper, middle and lower; now there's just rich and poor,' says Mr Durham, in Fair Play. Beyond the normal recessionary fear of job losses - and white-collar jobs have been hit more severely than in previous downturns - many Americans fear a wider range of personal disasters: lack of personal health insurance, the cost of a college education for their children, and falling house values. For those in employment, there is the worry that they may be unable to change jobs because a new employer would not want to provide health coverage for their sickly child, or to pay for medical treatment for their dependent parents. Health care forced its way on to the national agenda in November when it became a significant issue in the surprising election of Democratic Senator Harris Wofford in a Pennsylvania by-election. President Bush this month outlined a hastily drafted plan intended to help most of the 35m Americans who have no health insurance to obtain coverage. But a study by the National Association of Community Health Centres argues that another 8m people supposedly covered by the Medicare and Medicaid public insurance schemes in fact receive inadequate medical care. Perhaps the most immediate concern for some middle-class Americans is the declining value of the houses they bought at inflated prices during the 1980s. Nationwide, house prices recovered slightly in January after sliding 5 per cent in the second half of 1991, according to the National Association of Realtors. In the north-east, however, the fall has been sharper and more protracted, and house prices have still not returned to their 1988 levels. 'A lot of the net worth of many Americans is caught up in their home values. That's the foundation of their spending patterns,' says Mr Clayton Yeutter, who has just resigned the chairmanship of the Republican National Committee to become President Bush's chief domestic policy adviser. 'It's been a rather rude shock for a lot of folks to discover that their net worth has shrunk during this recessionary period because of the decline in home values.' Many homeowners, however, have not only seen the value of their investment shrink but have actually lost the roof over their heads as they have been unable to keep up payments on their mortgages. Mr Mohammed Ndiaye, for example, bought a house five years ago, eking out his salary from the De Kalb County local government, in the eastern outskirts of Atlanta, by driving a taxi part-time. Born in Nigeria, he lost his home in December after he was laid off by De Kalb, and is now a full-time taxi-driver. 'I've been a citizen for two and a half years and never voted, but this year I'm going to vote. Life was so sweet when the Democrats were in there. It's terrible, it's just like a third world country.' Mr Percival Bryan shares Mr Ndiaye's occupation of taxi-driver, but not his assessment of the current economic climate. Now 86, he lived through the depression of the 1930s and recalls driving Mr Harry S Truman around Washington when he was an obscure senator from Missouri, before he became president. 'Some of these people were living too high anyway - living high on the hog, with two- and three-car garages and such,' he says. While individuals wrestle with the debts that have accumulated through job losses and homelessness, overhanging them all is this year's Dollars 400bn federal budget deficit, which will hamstring the administration's ability to stimulate economic recovery through higher public spending. 'I would definitely be in favour of the candidate who's going to do something about the national debt and quit strewing money around,' says Mr Clay Owens, who works at Yoders Building Supplies, down the road from Mr Durham's store in Fair Play. But in Washington, only a handful of politicians show any concern about the deficit and the debt they will be handing down to their children. Voters speak scathingly of politicians of all hues for their inability to dig the country out of its economic mess, but the fall-out appears more damaging to President Bush and the Republicans than to the Democrats. Despite his best efforts to shift the blame for recession onto the Democrat-dominated Congress, Mr Bush, born and raised in wealth, has not convinced voters that he can address or even comprehend their difficulties. Even Senator Sam Nunn, the austere and earnest Georgian who chairs the Senate Armed Services committee, has started to crack jokes about Mr Bush's scant experience of daily existence. At a gathering of Georgia Democrats last week he sneered at the president's apparent astonishment on his first encounter with a modern electronic supermarket check-out, and gibed that Mr Bush planned to polish his down-to-earth image with voters in the south, where hunting, shooting and fishing are a way of life, by installing gunracks in his speedboat. As the debate over the economy quickens, the Democratic party hopes to capitalise on Mr Bush's difficulties to reclaim the presidency it has held for only four of the past 24 years. 'People are scared to death in this country. You mustn't underestimate the level of fear and anger that exists in the American people today,' says Ms Cutler. So far, however, the four main Democrats who have entered the race for their party's presidential nomination - Senator Paul Tsongas, Governor Bill Clinton, Senator Bob Kerrey and Senator Tom Harkin have largely failed to deliver a message that connects with the electorate. 'People are frustrated, angry and in many ways very cynical. I don't think there is a candidate who comes to the table who has been able to tap into that anger, so people are forced into voting negatively,' says Mr Ed Brown, executive director of the Voter Education Project, an Atlanta-based foundation working to increase black participation in the electoral process. Many voters are far from convinced that politicians from either party can solve the country's problems and set it on a more prosperous road. 'It's going to take the people to get us out of this. Everybody keeps saying it's the president, but it's got to be the people,' says Mrs Jean Whiten, daughter of Mr Durham, Fair Play's shopkeeper. 'The way things have gone it's so bad the only thing now is for the country to go plum busted and start anew,' concludes her father.</p>

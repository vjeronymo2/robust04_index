			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec optimistic as oil prices fluctuate OIL PRICES fluctuated widely yesterday although traders were at a loss to point to any single factor which was unsettling the markets. Brent Blend for December fell at one point to Dollars 15.60 a barrel before recovering in late London trading to Dollars 16.20. The uncertainty in the markets prompted optimistic comments from officials of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Mr Jean Ping, Opec president and energy minister of Gabon, said the September agreement to keep the production ceiling at 24.52m barrels a day was being maintained and should lead to stronger prices by the middle of November. A survey by the Reuters news agency completed on Tuesday estimated Opec's October production at 24.67m b/d, a level which most analysts say should not substantially undermine prices. But one oil company trader in London yesterday still saw 'more reasons for prices to go down than up'. He said that although Opec members appeared to be abiding by the agreement, the over-production which had previously plagued the organisation had been replaced by sharply increased North Sea production, which at 500,000-600,000 barrels a day was equivalent to a 'mini-Opec state coming onstream'. Opec ministers counted on the onset of the northern hemisphere winter to boost demand and prices when they set the latest quota. But analysts said there were so far few signs of that demand materialising. Mr Jeremy Hudson, research director at Lehman Brothers Securities in London, cited statistics showing that US demand for refined products fell by 1.5 per cent in October despite growing signs of stronger economic recovery. Demand estimates for Europe and Japan were 'being consistently chipped away'. He said the market volatility could be seen as a return to 'normal' conditions after 18 months of relative stability. Another factor continuing to worry traders is the prospect that Iraq will reach agreement with the United Nations on the resumption of oil exports. There is little possibility of Iraqi oil finding its way on to international markets until well into 1994, but it is 'a terrible uncertainty' which is unsettling the markets, according to Mr Peter Gignoux, head of the energy desk at Smith Barney in London.</p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> POWAY CRASH LEAVES 1 DEAD  </P> <P> Sheriff's authorities said Saturday that they are investigating the possibility  that alcohol or drug use may have been a factor in a head-on, two-car crash in  Poway late Friday that left one person dead and four others injured.  </P> <P> Authorities suspect that Richard Ray Laninovich, 27, of Poway, the driver of  the car that caused the accident, was using drugs or alcohol, according to a  sheriff's account released Saturday.  </P> <P> Laninovich was dead at the scene.  </P> <P> The other four victims -- including three passengers in Laninovich's vehicle  and the driver of the other car -- remain hospitalized Saturday with a variety  of injuries. All are expected to recover.  </P> <P> The incident occurred at 11:30 p.m. Friday as Laninovich was driving his sedan  south on Old Coach Road in Poway, authorities said. About a half-mile north of  Espola Road, deputies said, Laninovich's car crossed over the center line and  crashed head-on into an oncoming vehicle driven by Barbara Malone, 54, of San  Diego.  </P> <P> Malone, who suffered severe leg wounds, was taken to Sharp Memorial Hospital,  where she was listed in stable condition Saturday. Also stable at Sharp was  Albert Russell, 22, a Poway resident who was a passenger in Laninovich's car.  Two of the dead man's other companions, Michael Reel, 18, and Nick Cornell, 20,  were in stable condition at Palomar Medical Center.  </P></p>

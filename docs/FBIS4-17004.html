			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Second Rank Captain A. Bogorubov, chief of </F> the Baltic Fleet group for the export of obsolete ships, by O.  Shcheblykin in Kaliningrad, under the "Firsthand" rubric; date  not given: "Ships Will Wait for a While and Never Set Sail"]    [Bogorubov] Our group received its name after the Baltic  Fleet commander in chief issued an order in February 1993. We  are engaged only in preparing ships for sale abroad, while  agreements are signed at the Defense Ministry Central Management  for Material Resources and Foreign Economic Relations.    [Shcheblykin] The Baltic Fleet is in a difficult financial  situation, and the nonbudget money that it could get from  selling obsolete ships would be quite useful.    [Bogorubov] In general, this is how things really stand.  However, the fleet has not yet received anything for the cruiser  "Sverdlov," which was sold to India for $2 million back in 1992.  All appeals to Moscow have been fruitless....    Between 1992 and 1993, with the permission of the Baltic  Fleet command, we concluded agreements on the sale of all  obsolete combat vessels, including those which had sunk, by the  Tallinn naval base. This was better than losing them all for  nothing. The money for lifted and scrapped ships used to come  in the course of work. The work was temporarily discontinued  because the sea froze near the Estonian coast. After the ice  melts, work will begin anew and money will start coming in.    [Shcheblykin] Aleksandr Nikolayevich, as far as I know, a  particularly difficult situation has emerged in Liepaja. There  are a great many sunken vessels there. What will happen to them?    [Bogorubov] Ten ships have been sunk in Liepaja, including  the cruiser "Groznyy," a torpedo boat, and several patrol boats.  Four border patrol boats have been left in abeyance.  Subsidiary ships have also been sunk. We managed to find a  firm that would buy our ships and take care of raising,  scrapping, and selling them. For example, the Latvian company  "Siklin" has undertaken to sell the vessels under such terms.  The fleet would receive 90 percent of the net income. In  September 1993, we signed an agreement with the Latvian company  "Spero" on the sale of 12 submarines moored in Riga for $60 per  tonne. The same firm bought an additional six submarines from  Liepaja for $85 [per tonne]. The deadline for the contract  expired on 31 December, while we are back where we started.    [Shcheblykin] Why did the deal fail?    [Bogorubov] The Latvian businessmen fell victim to the laws  of their country, adopted after the agreement had been  concluded. The export duty soared to 300 percent. "Spero"  representatives began to seek lower prices. While the new  prices were being coordinated with Moscow, time expired and the  deal came to a deadlock.    [Shcheblykin] Russian troops will leave the Baltic states  this year. What will be the fate of the property left in Latvia  and Estonia?    [Bogorubov] This issue also requires the signing of an  agreement on the interstate level. It will be impossible to  ship all the property before the troops are pulled out. We will  need at least two more years. A year and a half ago, we  suggested holding another "Tallinn march" and redeploying all  the obsolete ships from the Baltics to Russia. However, the  fleet command did not find it possible to undertake such step at  that time. We are now examining the possibility to sell the  ships here.    [Shcheblykin] What were the results of your work in 1993?  What are you planning to accomplish in 1994?    [Bogorubov] In 1993, we planned to sell 21 vessels with an  aggregate displacement of 32,000 tonnes. In 1994, we are going  to sell 11 more vessels with an aggregate displacement of 16,500  tonnes. As a result of storms raging in the Baltic Sea, 13  ships sank at the beginning of 1993. Some contracts were  wrecked. Yet, we managed to sell 19 vessels with an aggregate  tonnage of 3,222 tonnes for $100,000. However, we have no  information confirming that the fleet has received the  envisioned 60 percent of the sum.    We have also signed a contract with a U.S. company that  wants  to purchase two large personnel landing craft removed from  combat duty: one from the Northern Fleet and our "Krasnaya  Presnya." They were appraised at $1.5 million a piece. The  Americans never showed up and the deal was also disrupted. There  are many offers but not all of them are implemented. To some  extent this is because the Defense Ministry Central Management  for Material Resources and Foreign Economic Relations, when  fixing the prices for ships, does not take into account regional  peculiarities. Today, we are not the only organization in the  Baltic region trading in obsolete ships. The trawler fleet, the  merchant fleet, and other organizations are offering ships for  sale. Civil organizations fix prices that are much lower than  ours.    [Shcheblykin] As we know, prices for scrapped metal are much  higher than for ships. Is this kind of commerce profitable?    [Bogorubov] Of course it would be much more comfortable to  scrap ships here and then sell the scrap abroad. This would  increase the price several times. However, just as almost  anywhere else in Europe, there is no facility for scrapping  ships here. The scrapping of ships is a very labor-intensive  and ecologically harmful process. Such a plant used to operate  in Spain, but it went bankrupt and closed down.    A step has been made to create our own scrapping facility in  Baltiysk. If it started operating, the Baltiysk zone would be  practically free of sunken, half-sunken, and obsolete ships  which are still afloat. We would be able to scrap all types of  ships. The fleet would greatly benefit from this.</p>

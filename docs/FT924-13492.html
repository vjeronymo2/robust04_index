			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / International Company News: Allegations lead to suspension of Guintoli shares SHARES in Guintoli, the French construction company, were suspended yesterday following reports that the company is being investigated by the Commission des Operations de Bourse (COB), the stock market watchdog, because of its alleged involvement in the Ciments Francais scandal. The French business newspaper Les Echos yesterday said the COB was investigating whether Ciments Francais - whose chairman, Mr Pierre Conso, was dismissed last week after the discovery of huge losses from off-balance sheet dealings - formed a concert party with another company, Cogequin, to buy shares in Guintoli. Guintoli, specialising in railway and motorway projects, is 32.9 per cent controlled by Ciments Francais. Les Echos reported that Cogequin, a company based at Ciments Francais' Paris headquarters, earlier this year bought a 9.15 per cent stake in Guintoli. Under French law, any company, or companies acting in concert, must make a formal offer for a company if they own more than 33.33 per cent of its shares. If Ciments Francais and Cogequin did form a concert party they may have acted illegally in not mounting a formal bid. The COB yesterday declined to comment pending the publication of a formal statement. Ciments Francais has also said it has nothing further to disclose until its new audit is completed and its board meets at the end of this month. Guintoli's shares were suspended at FFr720. Ciments Francais' shares, which fell sharply last week after the disclosure of the off-balance sheet losses estimated at between FFr400m and FFr500m, (Dollars 80m-Dollars 100m) have been suspended since last Friday when the COB began an investigation into its financial affairs. The controversy could also have implications for Paribas, the French investment bank, which earlier this year agreed terms to sell control of Ciments Francais to Italcementi, the Italian cement group. Paribas, which still holds a 34 per cent stake in Ciments Francais, is in negotiations with Italcementi and its adviser, Mediobanca, over the question of compensation.</p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / International Company News: Usinor slides further into red THE CRISIS in the European steel industry prompted a sharp deterioration in results at Usinor Sacilor, the French state-owned steel group. First-half net losses rose to FFr2.59bn (Dollars 455m) from FFr200m in the first six months of 1992. The downturn reflected a continued deterioration in demand and prices for most steel products in Europe. Sales fell 17.4 per cent to FFr39.74bn, the group said. The current six months were unlikely to show any significant improvement over the first half, it warned. Steel industry analysts forecast that group losses would continue to mount, and that the net deficit for the full year would be in the order of FFr5bn. The half-year results included an exceptional surplus of FFr2.4bn resulting from a change in accounting methods. The group said the change brought its accounting methods in line with other European and US steel companies. The exceptional gain, however, was offset by a FFr2.2bn exceptional charge arising from provisions for the group's Saarstahl subsidiary. Usinor Sacilor said that in spite of the weak results, there had been some encouraging developments in the first half. The group reduced net debt to FFr27bn from FFr29.5bn at the end of last year, and forecast a continued reduction in borrowings. This would be achieved through the proceeds of a planned sale of its majority stake in LME, a rolled steel operation, and the sale of shares in J&amp;L Specialty Products, its US stainless steel operation.</p>

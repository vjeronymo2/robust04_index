			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia to adopt mineral licensing RUSSIA IS about to finalise a licensing system for the exploitation of both new and old deposits of its mineral wealth in an important step towards building a market system. Mr Viktor Orlov, head of the state geology committee, said yesterday that the state had already begun to collect royalties last month on the basis of temporary instructions. It is these instructions, issued to give substance to an earlier law on mineral deposits, which will be made permanent by a government decision expected within days. After decades of waste and abuse resulting from an absence of licensing arrangements, which are common in the capitalist world, the Russian royalties will have to be paid by both foreign and Russian enterprises. The licences will also set clear terms for the use of resources to cut down on waste and environmental damage which is so rife of the oil gas and mining sectors. If the Russian authorities are able to enforce licensing conditions, the new system may also help cut down on corruption. Mr Orlov said the royalty rates levied since September as a percentage of the value of what is produced included: 8 per cent for oil, gas and coal, 2.4-4 per cent for strategic metals, up to 10 per cent for gold, and 5 per cent for diamonds and precious stones. These could be adjusted upwards or downwards for depreciation and other factors, and rates for existing deposits may be changed in the government's final document. Royalties for new deposits will be determined by tendering authorities. Chevron, the US oil company, and the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan have agreed to go ahead from January 1, 1993, with a 50:50 joint venture to exploit the huge Tengiz oil field, Russian news agencies said yesterday, reports Reuter from Moscow. Industry analysts say Tengiz is regarded as one of the world's top ten fields with probable reserves up to 35bn barrels. Current output is just 60,000 barrels a day. Chevron clinched a deal to help increase the volume in May and Itar-Tass news agency said details had now been firmed up during a visit by Chevron chief Mr Kenneth Derr, when he met Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, the Kazakh president.</p>

Upon leaving Los Pinos Presidential Residence,  Manuel Camacho stated progress is being made in the right  direction -- toward pacification -- in Chiapas. In very brief  remarks, he noted that statements by the EZLN [Zapatist National  Liberation Army] will be respected, because if each statement  causes controversy, no progress would ever be made in the peace  process. Jaime Guerrero has filed the following report.    [Guerrero] The Mexican Government has confirmed its  determination to reject violence, which only causes more  injustice and controls the political solution, following the  outbreak of violence in Chiapas.    [Begin Salinas recording] The government of the republic  will  continue to favor a political solution over armed confrontation.  We believe in democracy. [end recording]    [Guerrero] The liberation of General Castellanos paved the  way for direct negotiations between the government and the EZLN.  During a short tour of the capital, President Salinas stated  these are times of peace. From his comments, one can infer that  the Mexican Government is ready to negotiate with the EZLN.  Negotiations will begin soon. We must understand to be able to  resolve, the president explained.    [Begin Salinas recording] They all deserve respect. That is  why we must and will undertake the greatest effort to  understand, to talk, and to resolve the situation. We will do  all we can to commit ourselves to a future of harmony and unity,  which we undoubtedly share. We will do all we can to meet our  promises. [end recording]    [Guerrero] The president delivered 2,000 land titles to  residents of the Ixtapalapa neighborhood, where he said the  conflict in Chiapas is affecting the poorest of the poor.    [Begin Salinas recording] We will seek ways to generously  open the way of humanism. These are times for peace. [end  recording]    The message ended shortly afterward. Salinas de Gortari  stepped down from the stand into a large crowd to continue his  activities, which included the inauguration of a school. He said  he was proud to be the president of the republic.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] It has been announced that Turkey welcomes the  German decision to extradite certain terrorists who violate the  law and engage in terrorist activities and that it is ready to  receive those who will be extradited.    A Foreign Ministry statement on the issue notes that Turkey  has, on various occasions in the past, noted that the death  sentence has not been implemented in the country for the last 10  years and that every legal and operative measure has been taken  to prevent torture. Stressing that Turkish-German talks are  continuing on the preparation of a memorandum of understanding  concerning those to be extradited, the statement expresses the  hope that a solution will be reached on the issue soon. The  statement continues: We are sorry [words indistinct] efforts by  certain German laender to prevent the extradition of these  persons. No one should doubt that Turkey, just like Germany, is  a constitutional state and everyone should refrain from behavior  that might encourage acts of terrorism. The existing friendship  and mutual trust between Turkey and Germany is the strongest  guarantee to the solution of such problems.</p>

The head of Khasan district, Anatoly Melnichenko, and the  director-general of Khasansky Sea commercial port visited the  Maritime and Port Administration (MAPA) Thursday to discuss  opening a sea route between Sokcho, a northeastern port here,  and Zarubino.    The Russians said they wanted to improve the port facilities  independently from the central government in Moscow and are  therefore negotiating with neighboring countries such as South  Korea and Japan to attract foreign investment.    They proposed creating joint-venture companies to major  business groups here such as Hyundai, Samsung, Daewoo and Hanbo  and received a positive response, the Russians said.    Zarubino was developed as a fishing port and administered by  the central government before the Soviet Union collapsed in  1991, but administrative power has since been handed over to the  private sector.    Zarubino is located 70 km from the Chinese city of Hunchun,  which was selected as a key area under the Tumen River  development plan sponsored by the United Nations Development  Program (UNDP) in 1991.    If its facilities are modernized, Zarubino Port will thus be  in a good position to link North Korea, China and Russia in a  day's time, the Russians said.    Zarubino port can currently handle four 20,000-ton-class  ships at a time, but it plans to build a 1.9-km quay for six  ships.    The port also aims to construct loading facilities and to  improve rail links with the Trans-Siberian railroad.</p>

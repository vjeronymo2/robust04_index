			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Commons backs oil spill liability Owners of all large ships, not only laden oil tankers, will be liable to pay compensation for pollution caused by oil spills under a bill approved by the Commons yesterday. Mr David Harris, Tory MP for St Ives, who introduced the merchant shipping (salvage and pollution) bill, said it would remove an anomaly that had benefited owners of large container or passenger vessels.</p>

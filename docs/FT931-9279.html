			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Duopoly power THE DEBATE on how to save British miners' jobs seems to have come down to whether the government can persuade the two large power generators, British Coal's main customers, to buy more coal. Cajoling companies to buy what they would not otherwise wish to buy is bad politics and worse economics. If political considerations require such purchases, the least bad solution is for the costs to be entirely transparent. The snag is that, even if British Coal is subsidised so that its prices can fall to world market levels, National Power and PowerGen may not want to buy enough coal to get the government out of its corner. This has led to suggestions that the generators should be given extra incentives to buy yet more coal. Fortunately, it looks as though the government intends to reject one such option - delaying liberalisation of the electricity distribution market, which is largely monopolised by the regional electricity companies. Such a delay would keep electricity prices high. But there are signs that the government may be tempted towards actions which would delay the creation of a more competitive generating market. Hints have been dropped that, if the generators do not buy enough coal, they will be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which could break them up into smaller competing units. The implication is that, if they do, they will not be referred. Any such political arm-twisting would not only be an unhealthy interference with the commercial decisions of private companies. It would also be an unwise use of the threat of MMC referrals. A decision on whether or not to refer the power duopoly to the MMC should not be taken by the government for political reasons, but by Mr Stephen Littlechild, director general for electricity supply, for economic ones. There is already evidence that the duopoly does not work to customers' advantage, and Mr Littlechild has said he will decide by 1995 whether to make a referral. The government should do nothing that constrains Mr Littlechild's ability to make a reference. If this leaves the government with a problem of persuading the generators to buy enough coal to fix its political problem, the way out would be to increase the coal subsidy until they are willing to do so. The full cost of saving miners' jobs would then be in the open. It would also be less than the hidden cost of uncompetitive markets.</p>

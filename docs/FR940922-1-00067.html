			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Assessing the reliability of data is a fundamental aspect of FDA's evaluation. It is just as critical as assessing the adequacy of study design, the completeness of the studies carried out, and the meaning of the results. Therefore, financial arrangements and interests that could affect reliability of data need to be identified and considered. Such interests are already considered to exist and are taken into account when a clinical investigator is a full-time employee of a sponsor. When the investigator is not a full-time employee, the interests and arrangements that need to be identified and considered include financial arrangements in which the value of financial compensation received by the clinical investigator could be affected by the study outcome; significant payments of other sorts, such as grants for ongoing research, compensations in the form of equipment, retainers or honoraria; a proprietary interest of the investigator in the tested product, such as a patent; or a significant equity interest in the sponsoring company. Such arrangements and interests, especially if combined with such clinical trial features as open (unblinded) study designs, studies with subjective endpoints, and single-investigator studies, may increase the risk that purposeful or inadvertent bias could influence the outcome of the study. FDA needs to be aware of influences that could affect data reliability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. The Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In developing this proposal, the agency has considered three broad areas: (1) Identification of financial information that should be reported by sponsors to FDA; (2) procedures for reporting this information; and (3) steps the agency should take to deal with potential bias in data from studies by clinical investigators found to have potentially problematic financial interests. FDA has also considered the proper balance between the agency's desire to detect and help to minimize bias in clinical data and the need to avoid intrusion into the privacy of clinical investigators and unreasonable administrative burdens on sponsors and on agency staff.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In considering procedures for reporting such information, the agency has sought to identify the method that would be least burdensome for sponsors and for agency staff. FDA has determined that a simple, direct and effective method of minimizing reporting requirements would be to give every sponsor the option of either certifying to FDA as to the absence of certain financial interests and arrangements of the investigators conducting clinical studies of the sponsor's product or alternatively, disclosing those interests and describing the steps taken to minimize the impact of possible bias. Accordingly, FDA is proposing to require that the sponsor of any product submitted to the agency for marketing approval submit a list of clinical investigators and make one of two alternative submissions for each clinical investigator who is not identified by the sponsor as a full-time employee of the sponsor at the time reports of clinical studies and their accompanying data are submitted in support of product marketing. The alternative submissions are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The sponsor may certify that for any clinical study relied upon by the sponsor to establish that the product meets the regulatory requirements for approval: (a) The sponsor has not entered into any financial arrangement with any clinical investigator in which the value of financial compensation received by the clinical investigator for conducting the studies could be affected by the outcome of the research; (b) the investigator has not received significant payments of other sorts from the sponsor, such as a grant to fund ongoing research, compensation in the form of equipment, a retainer for ongoing consultation, or honoraria; (c) the clinical investigator has no proprietary interest, such as a patent or other direct financial interest in the clinically tested product; and (d) the clinical investigator holds no significant equity interest in the sponsor's company.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

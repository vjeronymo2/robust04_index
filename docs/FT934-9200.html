			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: Property groups target Mexico City PROPERTY companies run by Mr George Soros and Mr Paul Reichmann have confirmed their intention to go-ahead with Dollars 1.05bn in real estate developments in Mexico City, city officials said yesterday. They said they expected construction to start immediately and take four to five years to complete. The three projects involved - developments in Santa Fe, Alameda and twin tower blocks on the city's main avenue, Paseo de la Reforma - include office, housing, and hotel developments. Details of the exact participations would be settled in December, but city officials said more than 50 per cent of the investment was expected to come from foreign sources. The announcement was made yesterday with Mexican financial markets highly nervous over the North American Free Trade Agreement, which is expected to be voted on by the US House of Representatives next Wednesday. Mexico's stock market surged 4.2 per cent yesterday, after the perceived victory of US vice-president Al Gore over Texan billionaire Ross Perot in Tuesday night's debate on the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p>

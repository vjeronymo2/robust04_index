			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the BTA press review] </F>   [Text] The leader of the extraparliamentary Christian  Democratic Party (Centre) and leader of the unregistered  Vuzrazhdane [Rebirth] National Socialist Party, the Reverend  Georgi Gelemenov, demands from the president a public apology on  national television and sues him for 10,000,000 leva in  compensatory damages for having been called "a medical case" by  the president, says a frontpage story in STANDART NEWS. This is  the first legal action brought against the head of state at the  Prosecutor General's Office so far. The Rev. Gelemenov can  produce a medical certificate to prove his sanity. At the end  of last year, he lashed out at Bulgarian Turks and Gypsies, and  Dr. Zhelev said in a televised interview on December 29 that his  statements should long have been referred to the Prosecutor's  Office. However, the president did not name names in his  "medical case" allusion, STANDART NEWS recalls. The same daily  quotes the president's spokesman Valentin Stoyanov as saying  that it was the Rev. Gelemenov's own business if he identified  himself with the referent of the president's statement.    According to the daily EKSPRES, the National Socialists are  almost ready with their registration papers, and after they hold  their constituent meeting scheduled for next week, the legal  machinery will be put into operation to legitimize their party.  EKSPRES says that the doctrine of the Rev. Gelemenov's party was  based on Hitler's economic policy. The daily found out that the  most active members of the formation included servicemen and  graduates of the German language schools in Sofia. In case the  court denied registration to the National Socialist Party, the  Rev. Gelemenov's people are threatening they will start  operating underground.    The 24 CHASA daily frontpages a report that in Istanbul Adem  Kenan, leader of the unregistered Turkish Democratic Party,  denigrated the Bulgarian Constitution and asked for help from  Turkey. "Sofia is carrying on its assimilatory policy towards  its citizens of Turkish origin," Mr. Kenan said yesterday,  quoted by the Bulgarian National Radio and Television. 24 CHASA  recalls that the prosecutor general ordered a preliminary  inquiry into the activities of Mr. Kenan's party, which was  conducted by investigators in Shumen (northeastern Bulgaria).  The results of the inquiry are expected at the Prosecutor  General's Office.</p>

			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Letter: Snobbery is not the prerogative of the English Sir, Your leader, 'An honourable case for change' (December 30), attempts to justify an abolition of the hereditary principle within the House of Lords on the basis that it would remove a great deal of snobbery from the UK. As anyone who has lived and worked in either France or Germany realises, social snobbery is not the prerogative of England alone. The very fact that no new peers are created on the Continent (with the exception of the Vatican) means that in many circles titles are regarded with a kind of awe due to that which is unobtainable. The difference between the continentals' fascination with aristocracy and our own is primarily that, in England, it is continually discussed and deplored by newspaper editors. As far as hereditary privilege being undemocratic, what could be more Athenian than to have an element of the legislature selected purely on the basis of accident of birth?

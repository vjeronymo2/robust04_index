			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Inland Revenue changes tax relief eligibility on Lautro levies THE LEVIES imposed on life insurance companies under the terms of the Lautro investor compensation and indemnity schemes will be eligible for tax relief, the Inland Revenue has ruled. Lautro is the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation, the industry regulator. In an extra-statutory concession, the Inland Revenue said contributions through the Lautro investors' compensation scheme could be treated as a management expense. Separately, the Inland Revenue said regulations were laid before the Commons this week to allow relief under the Lautro indemnity scheme. Relief will be available for levies paid at any time since the scheme was set up. The investors' compensation scheme requires levies from life insurers under the provisions of the 1986 Financial Services Act. It can treat the levy as a management expense, which makes it eligible for tax relief. Other life insurance company contributions to the investors' compensation scheme, which are not imposed under the terms of the scheme, do not qualify for tax relief. However, under the new concession, contributions paid under the rules of a Lautro imposed levy introduced in December last year can now be treated as expenses of management. The compensation scheme, which was established in 1988, provides compensation to investors for otherwise unrecoverable losses. The costs of compensation are allocable under the rules between the members of the various self-regulating organisations and bodies regulated directly by the Securities and Investments Board. The regulations allowing tax relief on Lautro indemnity levies extend the concessions already available under the 1975 Policyholders Protection Act and the Investments Board scheme created by the 1986 Financial Services Act.</p>

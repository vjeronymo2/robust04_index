			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / International Company News: Unisys sees 'small profit' in opening term UNISYS, the struggling US computer manufacturer, said that it expects to be profitable in the current first quarter in spite of continuing market weakness and a tough competitive environment. After several years of heavy losses, Unisys returned to profitability in the fourth quarter of 1991. The company now expects 'a small profit in the seasonally weak first quarter, compared with a loss of Dollars 98m, or 79 cents a share, in the first quarter last year', said Mr James Unruh, Unisys chairman and chief executive. 'Clearly, we consider a first quarter profit another significant milestone in our recovery. Given the environment, a profit was not a sure thing. We remain very cautious about global economic conditions, particularly in the first half. But we have not altered our view of 1992 as a profitable, though difficult year,' Mr Unruh told Wall Street analysts yesterday. Outlining Unisys' strategy, he said that the company aims to lower its costs in order to maintain profitability in spite of weak business conditions. With 'our continually improving cost structure, any incremental revenue we can generate will have a positive impact on the bottom line,' he said. Mr Unruh said that Unisys plans to continue to reduce its Dollars 3bn debt and that the company expects to generate more than Dollars 700m in cash flow from operations in 1992. 'We believe we were early among our computer systems competitors to reshape our business to the new realities of our industry. There is no easy or rapid way to solve today's challenges. But we have indeed made a new start and will begin in 1992 to reap the benefits."</p>

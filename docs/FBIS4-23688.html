			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] According to news sent to us by our colleague  Louise Kayibanda in Gitarama the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]  troops found an enormous hole where many people had been buried.  Louise Kayibanda says that along the Gitarama-Nyanza road,  there are many refugees who escaped the killings and other  refugees who had come from Gisenyi. These had earlier fled the  fighting and went to Gisenyi, but they were sent back because  they were Banyenduga. They returned to the RPF area. [passage  omitted]    Government forces are in a critical situation on all fronts;  those on Kigali hill are counting their days. Those on Jari  hill may even have fled by now. For the government forces, it  is as bad to hear about the fall of Gitarama as the fall of  Kanombe airport area. Gitarama was the second headquarters of  the so-called government. Shortly, the government will be on  the run forever. [passage omitted]</p>

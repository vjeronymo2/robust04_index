			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Managua BARRICADA in Spanish of 26  December 1993 on page 7 reports that the Instancia de Reflexion,  an association which was organized at the end of 1990 by  "religious, political, and socioeconomic groups" in Chontales,  has helped to resolve land issues and disarm groups in the  region. Luis Enrique Figueroa, Sandinist National Liberation  Front departmental coordinator, explains that through discussion  and the participation of members of the church, the Sandinist  People's Army (EPS), mayors, and others, the organization has  "neutralized" conflicts between former EPS and Resistance  members. Figueroa explains that property issues are more  difficult to resolve because deeds are required from the  government, which he calls the "Achilles Heel" in conflict  resolution. Figueroa hopes that the program "will serve the  nation" as a model because relations in Chontales are "friendly,  respectful, and fraternal."</p>

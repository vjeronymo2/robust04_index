			<p>BFN     [Text] We have just received a statement from today's  session of the Presidential Council for Defense and National  Security, which was held in the presidential palace and chaired  by Dr. Franjo Tudjman, president of the Republic of Croatia.    The Council considered some questions with regard to  international and internal relations, and a report on the visit  of Franjo Tudjman to Bosnia-Herzegovina.    In this connection the Council assessed that, through this  visit, the Republic of Croatia has provided a significant  impetus to the revitalization of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  federation and a confederation with Croatia, while international  groups have been able to see for themselves that the Croatians  are implementing the Washington agreement consistently.    The prime minister, who led a Croatian delegation at an  international gathering in Crans-Montana, told the Council about  the numerous meetings he had at this gathering. The Croatian  Government delegation won recognition during the many contacts  made at the gathering for the successful maintenance of  stability of the Croatian national currency, the kuna, and for  the successful implementation of economic policy. Great interest  was shown in the many meetings aimed at creating investments in  the Republic of Croatia. The Croatian delegation also had talks  on the complicated problems of transforming socially owned  property into privately owned property, something facing all  postcommunist countries.    The Council also considered the package of measures which  the  Croatian Government should implement in order to breathe life  into the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation and a confederation with  Croatia. In this connection the need was expressed for constant  coordination -- and analysis of trends and the achievement of  results in different spheres -- between the Republic of Croatia  and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation.    The Council considered some problems of transformation and  privatization in Croatia, and at the proposal of the Government  concluded that, because of the enhanced interest of large  international companies and Croatians abroad in investing in  Croatia, the Council would devote one of its coming sessions to  this problem alone, the statement from the president's office  concludes.</p>

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Hospital reforms set to proceed THE government will press ahead with proposals to merge or slim down some of London's hospitals after the cabinet agreed yesterday to the plans put forward by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary. But some changes will be qualified and others deferred to blunt the overall political impact of the decisions. An announcement is expected next week on the response to the report from Sir Bernard Tomlinson. His report recommends reducing the capital's provision by 2,500 beds to enable more resources to go to London's GP services. Speaking on BBC Newsnight, Mrs Bottomley highlighted the number of consultants in central London and the need to use specialist services more efficiently. 'We must grasp the nettle,' she said. The white paper will include firm decisions, such as going ahead with the merger of the Middlesex and University College hospitals and proposals in a review of specialist services, including the future of the Royal Marsden and Royal Brompton hospitals. St Bartholemew's hospital, which has been the focus of a high-profile campaign against closure, is thought likely to survive, but in a diminished form. The paper will also set out government plans to expand community care, and re-organisation plans on a longer timescale. Although allowing Bart's to continue and by blurring the future of the specialist hospitals, ministers have avoided some of the most politically difficult decisions arising from Tomlinson the remaining hospitals under threat will still pose a problem.</p>

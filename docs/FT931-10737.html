			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / The Long View: Uneasy in Eastbourne IT IS TIME to look again at the battle of the generations, the fluctuating economic struggle between young and old. For some years, the British wrinklies were doing remarkably well. You can't keep the young folk down for long, though, and they are hitting back hard with their penetrating weapons, cheap money and inflation. But have they been booby-trapped by debt? The European exchange rate mechanism, as run by a beleaguered Bundesbank, has turned into a geriatric charter. Soft-hearted Helmut Schlesinger may at last have relented but French, Danish and Spanish short-term interest rates have been well in double figures this week. In the UK, money market rates stayed at 10 per cent until September and generated a huge flow of net interest payments, from young borrowers to old investors. Only 16 per cent of people taking out new building society mortgages are 45 or older. The total annual servicing cost of some Pounds 330bn of mortgage debt was Pounds 27bn after tax relief. But that is now tumbling by Pounds 7bn, money lost in the main by the largely elderly savers who speak for the bulk of the Pounds 250bn-odd deposited in personal savings accounts at building societies and banks. To make matters worse, pensions in payment will not be protected properly against inflation in the near future. This is because the retail price index is being reduced by the fall in mortgage rates, whereas the rise in the pensioners' price index (which excludes housing costs) is likely to accelerate from 3 per cent in the latter part of 1992 to 4 or 5 per cent this year. Capital transfers within the housing market are also looking much healthier for the young. In the late 1980s, older owner-occupiers were selling out or trading down at extraordinary prices, and young people were assuming enormous debt burdens. But the number of house market transactions has dropped from 2.1m in 1988 to about 1m a year at present, while the average house price has dropped by 11 per cent in two years (and by 30 per cent in four years in the south-east). For first-time buyers, the improvement in affordability has been remarkable (so long as they can find a job). In 1989, the average first-timer's mortgage interest payments was 26 per cent of income; now, the proportion is 14 per cent. Of course, youngsters have to be confident that there will not be another U-turn in policy to propel interest rates smartly up again. But it seems they now have so much buying power that they can, in many cases, afford to buy decent houses, leapfrogging their counterparts of five years ago who, burdened by Pounds 10,000 or more of negative equity, are stuck indefinitely in bottom-rung-of-the-ladder homes. This is the nub of the problem. The fall in interest rates has addressed the imbalance in young people's income and expenditure accounts, but it has done nothing for their balance sheets. Personal sector debt has eased by only a few percentage points from a 1991 peak of 115 per cent of disposable income; until 1980, the ratio was consistently close to 60 per cent. The Amex Bank Review has just calculated some implications should this ratio fall back by 1995 - not to 60 per cent but, less ambitiously, to the average of the 1980s (financial deregulation may have led to a long-term increase in debt tolerance). Either the savings ratio will have to rise from its present 12 per cent or so to more like 18 per cent, implying years of still more terrible depression; or incomes must rise by nearly 50 per cent (or, presumably, some combination of the two). Incidentally, if it is any consolation, Amex Bank finds that Japan's fix over personal indebtedness is almost as bad as as the UK. The danger for Britain's wrinklies is that, having lost much of their investment income, they could forfeit part of the real value of their capital, too. Events in the foreign exchange markets this week have shown once again that weak governments are driven towards inflation. As sterling crashed on Wednesday, the Treasury insisted that the exchange rate was being given 'full weight' in its monetary assessment. Since there is no credible hint of any move to protect the pound with higher interest rates, the implication is that the devaluation is deliberate. Has somebody in the Treasury also calculated that 50 per cent pay inflation in three years (cumulative, not annual) would eliminate the suffocating effect of the huge financial claims by the older generation on the young? Retail price inflation would have to be even higher, because real UK incomes must fall. Just take a look, if you dare, at the wealth-preserving manifesto of the woopies (well-off older people). Pay (and social security benefits) must be cut to preserve Britain's trade competitiveness at a higher exchange rate than now; the state must take responsibility for Pounds 50bn-plus of the mortgage debt of overstretched individuals; and taxes must rise by Pounds 20bn. There might be votes for this in Eastbourne but not in East Grinstead, let alone East Kilbride. There is one last tantalising pot of gold for the oldies. Their stock market investments are jumping in value - and, more importantly, so are those of their pension funds, which have a commitment of nearly 85 per cent to UK and overseas equities. But the actuaries who value company pension schemes are behaving like spoil-sports. The funds are puffed up by higher share ratings, but the dividend income they generate is, if anything, falling. So, on the basis of actuarial valuations, pension funds have failed to keep pace with their pay-linked liabilities during 1992. Youth, said George Bernard Shaw, is wasted on the young. But the economic curse of young people is that the world is already owned by the previous generation, which is trying to charge rents. Still, they may decide that wealth is wasted on the old.</p>

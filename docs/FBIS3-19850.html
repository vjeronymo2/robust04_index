			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Potsdam (DDP/ADN) -- The coalition in Brandenburg  Land consisting of the Social Democratic Party [SPD], Free  Democratic Party [FDP], and Alliance [the east German Greens]  has finally collapsed six months before the land elections.  Following the session of the coalition committee, the  Brandenburg parliamentary group leaders announced the end of the  trilateral alliance in Potsdam this evening. It appears that a  minority government consisting of the SPD and FDP will govern  the land in the future. The SPD has 35 seats in the 88-member  Landtag; the FDP has six.</p>

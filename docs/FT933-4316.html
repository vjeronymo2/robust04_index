			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / IRI stakes in BCI and Credito Italiano set for public float IRI, the Italian state holding company, has abandoned plans for the trade sale of its majority stakes in Banca Commerciale Italiana and Credito Italiano in favour of public share offerings. The move was widely welcomed yesterday, with Milan bourse operators suggesting the decision to opt for a public flotation could give a much needed boost to the stock market. IRI's shares in the two banks - it has 67 per cent of Credito and 57 per cent of BCI - will also be floated on foreign stock exchanges. The timing of the flotation has yet to be announced and IRI, headed by Mr Romano Prodi, yesterday declined to place a notional value on its two holdings. However, IRI will shortly select advisers and a lead manager. The absence of any indication on pricing resulted in cautious trading yesterday in the two shares on the Milan bourse, with BCI shares down 2.1 per cent and Credito up 1.3 per cent. IRI is under pressure to complete the deals as soon as possible to offset its increasingly parlous financial position. It has borrowings of L72,500bn (Pounds 30.2bn) and losses this year are expected to reach L5,300bn. Last October Merrill Lynch was hired to advise on the sale of Credito with the aim of finding either a large domestic financial institution or a foreign buyer to absorb part or all of IRI's holding. Since then no Italian financial institution has shown much enthusiasm for what is Italy's sixth largest bank. Some 27 foreign institutions were also sounded out. Estimates of the total value of the bank also varied from L6,000bn to L10,000bn while the stock market capitalisation is around L2,000bn. By opting for a public flotation, IRI is now seeking wider ownership for the two banks. This includes clients and employees who will be given preference along the lines of some UK privatisations. The government is expected to encourage the formation of a small hard core of domestic institutional investors. The government first announced plans to sell IRI's stake in Credito some 12 months ago. At the time the government was thinking in terms of matching BCI with the state owned Banco Nazionale di Lavoro. A BNL-BCI alliance is now formally excluded.</p>

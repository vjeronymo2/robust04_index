			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Pitching for the market It is an odd kind of labour dispute. On one side is a strong union, insisting that its members' salaries be set by market forces. Their bosses say wages must be capped, so that profitable employers can subsidise loss-making ones. Meanwhile, pundits muse that resolving the strike would save the presidency. For millions of US baseball fans, the six-week-old major league baseball strike is certainly different. It ruined this year's regular playing season. Now it has put paid to one of the high points of the American sporting year, the World Series, cancelled on Wednesday for the first time since 1904. But non-enthusiasts should also take note. The wrangle over top players' pay is a good example of how market forces work in the modern labour market. The team owners are essentially an old-fashioned cartel trying to tilt the system back in their fav-our. At first glance, it is the players' side that looks outdated. In a country in which only about 12 per cent of private sector workers are unionised, the Major League Baseball Players Association's ability to bring the industry to its knees sounds more like the 'big labor' of the 1950s and 1960s than the 'flexible' US labour market of the 1990s. But the players' strong bargaining position does not come from membership of the union. In the US, unlike many other countries, employers may hire permanent replacements for striking employees. A bill which would have banned this failed to pass Congress earlier this year. Quite apart from the probable public reaction, however, the owners cannot do this because many of the players are all but irreplaceable. In effect, the team owners are facing a dilemma common to many US and UK shareholders. Greater labour market deregulation helps to push down the cost of unskilled workers. At the same time, however, a core group of highly skilled employees in each firm is able to demand a lot more. Baseball players, once little more than a team's indentured servants after signing their first contract, won more individual rights in the courts in the 1970s. Salaries have risen ever since: from an average of Dollars 400,000 to over Dollars 1.2m in the past five years. Wages now account for 58 per cent of total industry revenues. The teams argue that the cost of bidding for the best players is driving the smaller, less popular, teams in the league out of business. They would like to see the overall wage bill capped at only 50 per cent of revenues. They say that the resulting extra profits would be used to bail out the teams that are in trouble. It is not up to the players to allow the companies to be so collectively minded. Even if it were, one cannot judge whether such cross-subsidisation is even necessary, since all of the teams' finances are shrouded in secrecy. In fact, since the owners are possibly the only US businessmen to be entirely exempt from anti-trust provisions, they may make any agreement they like, without outside interference. On Wednesday evening, President Clinton rightly suggested that this cosy cartel should be reconsidered. The baseball strike is a market failure, which stems from the cartel and not from the players.</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / International Company News: Mazda omits dividend as loss grows MAZDA, the Japanese car-maker 24.5 per cent owned by Ford of the US, yesterday said its losses this year would be larger than forecast, forcing it to pass the dividend for the first time. Pre-tax losses are forecast at Y32bn (Dollars 296m) rather than Y12bn estimated in May, while sales are expected to fall to Y1,920bn from a previously forecast Y2,070bn. This would be the company's first loss in 23 years. The downward revision reflects the severity of the business climate surrounding Japanese carmakers. Last month, the industry saw exports decline 14.7 per cent, the fifth consecutive monthly fall and the worst performance in 14 years, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association. Mazda said the loss would arise largely as a result of the yen's sharp appreciation and a worse-than-expected downturn in the European market. Mazda does not expect to return to profit next year, since it sees little hope for a strong recovery in either the Japanese or European markets. Mr Makoto Miyaji, executive vice-president, said that Mazda hoped to return to profit and resume dividend payments in fiscal 1995. The yen's appreciation is expected to shave Y65bn off annual revenues, while the fall in European sales will make up the bulk of Mazda's expected 18 per cent decline in sales overseas. In Europe, Mazda is forecasting an 18 per cent fall in sales to 240,000 units at the retail level, from 292,000 units last year. This compares with a 16 per cent fall in overall demand in Europe. Unit sales in Japan are expected to decline 3 per cent to 455,000 units from 470,000 units last year. Mazda has introduced restructuring measures, but had not been able to 'catch up with the changing business environment within a short period', it said. It is closing a production line in Hiroshima, where it employs about 300, and shifting its production to other lines. Restructuring plans will be strengthened and brought forward. Staff levels will be reduced through natural attrition by 3,000 over the next three years, rather than 1,500 as planned. The company is cutting costs and reducing its capital expenditure to Y60bn from Y80bn last year. It may cut the number of cars in its range to deal with a slower market, Mr Miyaji said.</p>

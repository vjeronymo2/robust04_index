			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Technology: Keeping the knife at bay - Paul Abrahams reports on the latest advances in prostate therapy, in a series on drug discoveries Twenty years ago the American journal Science published an article about 24 inhabitants of a village in the Dominican Republic. The article led Merck, the world's biggest drugs group, to develop a class of drug likely to save billions of dollars in healthcare costs. The article looked at the cases of 24 individuals who until puberty were believed to be female. At birth they appeared to have a vaginal pouch and a clitoral-like phallus. However, at about 12 the voices of these pseudo-hermaphrodites deepened, their muscles developed mass and their phallus enlarged to become a functional penis. The authors proposed that the condition was the result of a genetically-caused deficiency of an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase. This enzyme transforms testosterone, the male hormone, into another hormone, DHT, which is involved in prostate growth. Researchers at Merck quickly spotted the medical opportunities of controlling levels of 5-alpha reductase. If the enzyme was implicated in prostate growth, then it should be possible to block either the production of the chemical or its action. According to Brian Leaker, clinical project manager at Pfizer Research, a quarter of all men in Europe and the US have some clinical signs of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BHP) - a condition involving an increase in the size and number of prostate cells - by the age of 50. That means that 17.2m men in Europe currently display some symptoms. The condition becomes more common with ageing. Those men in developed nations who survive to 80 have a 50 per cent chance of being put either on drug therapy or the operating table. BPH is caused by the physical non-cancerous growth of the prostate from approximately the size of a walnut to the size of a lemon, says Leaker. The expansion of the prostate constricts the urethra through which urine flows out of the bladder. The symptoms of BPH include increased frequency of urination, hesitancy, leakage and, in some cases, discomfort and pain. Why the prostate expands with age remains unclear. 'It appears to be a natural consequence of becoming older - as inevitable as night following day,' says Mike Wyllie, director of discovery biology at Pfizer Research. 'We know that DHT is a stimulus to growth. But what is happening at the molecular level is a 'black box'.' The prostate consists of three distinct anatomical elements. These are a capsule within which the prostate lies; the true prostate material; and the muscle tissue around the prostate. BPH appears to be caused partly by an increase in the number and size of the cells in the true prostate, and by an increase in the size of the capsule and muscle tissue around the prostate. BPH is expensive. Surgery, which involves putting a telescoped strimmer device down the penis, is the most common therapy. For men over 50, the risk of requiring such surgery is between 25 per cent and 30 per cent. Annually, there are more than 400,000 such operations in the US, costing a total of Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.4bn). Surgery can lead to side-effects such as impotence, bleeding and incontinence. The operation also sometimes needs to be repeated within a few years since the prostate continues to grow. A new form of surgery using a balloon catheter which is inserted and then expanded has recently been introduced. The only previous medicinal therapies were herbal. 'In some patients there is a measurable improvement in urine flow with herbal remedies. The problem is that the condition waxes and wanes, dependent on stress, cold, and other therapies. It's difficult to be sure whether the herbal treatment is actually responsible for any improvement,' explains Wyllie. After the Science article, Merck's researchers set to work developing a compound that would act specifically on 5-alpha reductase. They discovered Proscar, which in a single dose can reduce the levels of DHT in the blood by an average of 65 per cent. Merck, and many financial analysts, had high expectations for Proscar. The company claims the drug, which costs about Dollars 530 a year per patient, is cost-effective. That compares with surgery at Dollars 8,000 for each procedure. Nevertheless, sales growth has been slow. Many urologists have not been convinced about the drug's effectiveness. First, it takes between three and six months for symptoms to improve; second, the drug appears to work in only a minority of patients. 'The problem may be that there are two forms of 5-alpha reductase,' says Kurt Hogaboom, associate director of urology and prostate disease at SmithKline Beecham. 'Proscar affects type two, but it may be necessary to control type one too.' The clinical trials have also proved difficult to design, given that placebos tend to work well - at least in the short term. Although Proscar reduces levels of DHT, the direct relationship between DHT and prostate size, urinary flow and symptomatic relief is yet to be established. Merck is frustrated by the slow uptake of what it considers a ground-breaking drug. 'This is one of the breakthroughs of the decade,' says Roy Vagelos, Merck's chairman and chief executive. 'I would not want to speculate why the urologists have been hostile to Proscar,' says Edward Scolnick, president of Merck research laboratories. 'The drug changes the disease's natural history and it's safe. It's just not rational not to use it.' The irony is that other companies may benefit as much if not more from Merck's work. Many have experimented to see if their existing compounds might have an effect in BPH. The most successful class have been alpha-blockers, usually prescribed for heart disease. Alpha-blockers work by preventing the constriction of muscle, explains Akira Shiga, manager in charge of BPH and cardiovascular development at Eisai of Japan. The muscle around the prostate contains unusually large numbers of alpha receptors which are involved in the expansion of the blood vessels. By blocking the receptor site, the drug prevents the cells enlarging and so reduces BPH symptoms. Alpha-blockers in development or already marketed for BPH include Synthelabo's Xatral; Pfizer's Cardura; Abbott's Hytrin; Yamanouchi's Harnal; Eisai's Detantol; and Recordati's REC 15-2739 which is being co-developed by SmithKline Beecham. The benefits of alpha-blockers are that they work quickly in relieving symptoms and are effective in about two-thirds of patients. However, they do not alter the underlying condition. In addition, most alpha-blockers were first developed for heart conditions and have a tendency to reduce blood-pressure which leads to side-effects such as dizziness and fatigue. A race is on to develop alpha-blockers that act specifically on the prostatic alpha sites and therefore have reduced side-effects. Toichi Takenaka, board director in charge of discovery at Yamanouchi of Japan, says rapid advances in molecular biology have allowed scientists to identify alpha 1c, a particular sub-type most prevalent in the prostate. Merck is not abandoning Proscar. The group is 18 months into a four-year study designed to demonstrate that Proscar changes the disease's natural history. Meanwhile, SmithKline Beecham is developing its own 5-alpha reductase inhibitor called epristeride. This is being targeted specifically at type two alpha-reductase. Fujisawa also has a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor in development. 'We still really don't know what is going on,' says Leaker. 'But our greater understanding of molecular biology is going to lead to an exponential increase in knowledge over the next five years.' The series continues next month with a look at treatments for toxic shock.

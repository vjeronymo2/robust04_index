			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY COLLEGE BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> AFTER A LINEUP SHUFFLE, ERROR-FREE GOLDEN WEST BEATS CYPRESS  </P> <P> Golden West College's baseball team was shaken up by Orange Coast last  Thursday. Golden West Coach Burt Villarreal responded by shaking up his infield  Saturday, and it helped gain a 5-3 victory over Cypress in an Orange Empire  Conference baseball game at Cypress.  </P> <P> Golden West was demolished by OCC, 15-2, Thursday as the Rustlers made four  infield errors, which led to five unearned runs. After that, Villarreal decided  to make a few changes.  </P> <P> Josh Bammer was moved from third to first base, shortstop Craig Paquette moved  to third, Robb Carabba moved from second to short and Mike Willey moved to  second from the bench.  </P> <P> Golden West (16-11-1 overall and 10-6 in conference) responded with no errors  Saturday and is tied with Cypress (24-12, 10-6), a game behind  conference-leading Rancho Santiago. Rancho Santiago defeated Riverside, 19-2,  also Saturday.  </P> <P> "We had to do something," Villarreal said. "We needed to shake it up a little  bit and give some people a chance that deserved it."  </P> <P> Golden West starter John Gonzales took a 5-3 lead into the ninth but gave up a  lead-off double to Ken Kendrena. Cypress' Joey Gonzalez hit a sharp grounder  between third and short, only to have Paquette dive far to his left, grab the  ball, get up and throw out Gonzalez by a step.  </P> <P> Terry Tewell hit a much easier grounder to Paquette for the second out, and  Mitch Kaylor lined out to second baseman Willey for the final out.  </P> <P> "I told myself in the last two innings that if anything came my way I was  getting dirty," said Paquette, who played third last season, but switched to  shortstop this season.  </P> <P> Gonzales (3-2) allowed nine hits, walked two and struck out two for Golden  West. Cypress' Jeff Patterson (6-2) pitched seven innings in relief to take the  loss.  </P> <P> Golden West took a 2-0 lead in the first inning as Paquette singled and Bammer,  a freshman from Edison High School, followed with a home run to left, his  fourth this season.  </P> <P> Cypress' Steve Gill walked and later scored by on a single to right by Doug  Yates as the Chargers cut the lead to 2-1, also in the first. Gill hit his 12th  home run of the season in the fifth to tie it, 2-2.  </P> <P> Golden West broke the tie with two runs in the sixth with the help of an error  by Cypress left fielder Bobby Thome. Steve McKowen was on second with one out  when Bammer bounced a single over third baseman Brett Gregory's head. McKowen  stopped at third, but the ball went under Thome's glove and all the way to the  wall, allowing McKowen to score and Bammer to reach third.  </P> <P> Cypress then played its infield up and Shelby Hart singled up the middle to  score Bammer.  </P> <P> Paquette walked and later scored on a single by Dan Villegas in the eighth.  </P> <P> Cypress rallied a bit in its half of the eighth. Gregory had a two-out double  to score Gill who had singled. But pinch-hitter Mike Neal flied out to center  with runners on second and third.  </P> <P> In other Orange Empire Conference games:  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago 19, Riverside 2 -- Jack Bailey (9-2) pitched seven innings for  the victory as host Rancho Santiago (22-12, 11-5) had 22 hits. Danny Ontiveros  and Tim Reynolds had four hits and two RBIs each.  </P> <P> John McTaggart and Marty Neff each hit their eighth home runs of the season for  Rancho Santiago. Neff had three hits and McTaggart also had a sacrifice fly.  Riverside falls to 6-21-1, 3-12-1.  </P> <P> Orange Coast 19, Saddleback 4 -- Scott Talanoa hit his conference-leading 14th  home run in the first inning for visiting Orange Coast (11-6, 24-9-1). Hector  Santa Cruz had three hits, scored a run, and had four RBIs, Eddie Pierce had  two hits, scored three runs, and drove in a run for OCC.  </P> <P> Mike Kelly had two hits and scored a run for OCC. John Duris (7-1) pitched a  complete game for the victory. Justin Pysar had three hits including a double  for Saddleback (13-11-1, 5-8-1).  </P> <P> Long Beach 11, Fullerton 4 -- Tony Osendorf had four hits including a double  for visiting Fullerton (10-20).  </P></p>

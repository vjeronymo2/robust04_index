I am sure that  all of you still recall the occasion as if it were yesterday.  Two years have gone by quickly. As the term of office for the  first group of Hong Kong affairs advisers is about to end, the  State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and the XINHUA  Hong Kong Branch have jointly decided to reappoint the first  group of 43 advisers for another term. Today, as we hold this  reappointment ceremony in the warm and blossoming city of  Shenzhen, let me first offer my heartfelt congratulations to the  reappointed advisers on behalf of the State Council Hong Kong  and Macao Affairs Office and the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch!    Acting as Hong Kong affairs advisers to you is not so much  an  honor as a responsibility to be shouldered. First, this  reflects your sense of responsibility as masters who regard it  as their responsibility to achieve "one country, two systems,"  Hong Kong's smooth transition in 1997, and to maintain Hong  Kong's stability and prosperity. On the other hand, it also  embodies the Chinese Government's determination to ensure the  "rule of Hong Kong by Hong Kong people" and to achieve a high  degree of autonomy for Hong Kong. Precisely based on this high  sense of responsibility, over the past two years you all have,  through a variety of means and channels, put forward large  numbers of valuable opinions and suggestions on a series of  questions regarding Hong Kong's handover of power and a smooth  transition. We alone have received hundreds of letters from  advisers. The State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office  and the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch have held many discussion  meetings with advisers to listen directly to their opinions.  All advisers, whether the first group or the second, have made  their greatest efforts and done their best and have rendered  very great help and support to our work. They are our think  tank and a force we rely on in handling Hong Kong affairs. I  would like to take this opportunity to express our deepest  gratitude to all Hong Kong affairs advisers.    A few days ago, the British Hong Kong Legislative Council  passed the partial bill which was formulated in accordance with  Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's "political reform proposals."  The British Government even published a White Paper regarding  the Sino-British talks on the political system. This series of  unilateral measures, which have ruined cooperation, show that in  the remaining three and a half years of the transition period,  the British side will cling obstinately to its course and  continue to pursue a policy that puts itself in confrontation  with us. By doing so, they will only enable all kindhearted  people to see clearly so that they no longer harbor any  imagination about "cooperation" which the British side hangs on  to verbally. Moreover, this will consolidate our determination  to rely on our strength to ensure Hong Kong's smooth transition  and long-term stability together with vast numbers of Hong Kong  compatriots who love the country and who love Hong Kong. Mr.  Deng Xiaoping said as early as 10 years ago: "It is psychology  left over by the old colonialists that people trust that the  Chinese in Hong Kong can exercise good rule over Hong Kong but  do not trust that the Chinese are able to exercise good rule  over Hong Kong." Deng added: "Hong Kong's prosperity has come  about by the work of Hong Kong people the majority of whom are  Chinese." "Hong Kong people are able to exercise good rule over  Hong Kong. We should have self- confidence in this." We  believe that you advisers seated here and vast numbers of Hong  Kong people have this self-confidence! At present, our country  has social stability, its economy is developing continuously,  and its international status is rising daily. More and more  Hong Kong people are consciously standing on the side of  safeguarding Hong Kong's stability and prosperity and peaceful  transition. We are going to appoint the third group of Hong  Kong affairs advisers soon. They will come from all strata and  all quarters of the Hong Kong community. We can say that the  contingent of Hong Kong affairs advisers has grown large and  they are much more representative. This contingent will surely  play a more important role on the road to achieving Hong Kong's  reversion. It will gather thousands of people to form a large  army to write a new epoch-making chapter for Hong Kong.  Although the British side's lack of cooperation and  confrontational attitude will place obstacles on our road of  resuming the exercise of sovereignty and will make various kinds  of trouble, with the strong backing of the motherland and with  the concerted efforts of vast numbers of Hong Kong compatriots,  we will have no insurmountable difficulties and dangers or  unremovable obstacles!    Advisers, under the present situation, the burden on your  shoulders is heavier and your tasks will multiply. I hope that  all of you will continue your efforts, continue to use your  talents, wisdom, experience, and influence to make a new and  greater contribution at the critical stage as Hong Kong is  reverting to the motherland.    Thank you!</p>

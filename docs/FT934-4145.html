			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Left set to win power in Italy's municipal elections: Former communists reap benefits from broad-based alliances Leftwing alliances looked set last night to win control of Italy's main cities in the second round of voting in local elections. Early returns indicated that strong challenges from the populist Northern League in north Italy and from the neo-fascist MSI in the centre and south had been defeated. Mayors backed by alliances controlled by the former communist party of the Democratic Left (PDS) were winning in Genoa, Naples, Rome, Trieste and Venice. Mr Achille Occhetto, the PDS leader who has sought to present the party as responsible and sensitive to the markets' concerns about a left-dominated government, declared that the local elections marked an historic turning point. He said they had finally broken the power of the traditional parties that have ruled post-war Italy. 'This country has a mature left that wants to govern,' he said. However, the strong performance of the MSI places the party in a powerful position to dominate the political agenda on the right in the run-up to the general elections. Nevertheless, much of the MSI support came from disillusioned voters who formerly backed the Christian Democrats and the Socialists in government. In Naples, Mr Antonio Bassolino, the PDS candidate, won 55.6 per cent of the final vote compared with 44.4 per cent for Ms Alessandra Mussolini, the candidate of the MSI and granddaughter of wartime dictator Benito Mussolini. In Rome, where the MSI was also involved in a tight battle, Mr Gianfranco Fini, the party's leader, was in second place behind Mr Francesco Rutelli, the Green candidate backed by the PDS. Projections from early returns credited Mr Rutelli with around 53 per cent of the vote, against 47 per cent for Mr Fini. The result is a vindication of the PDS policy of forging broad alliances, and gives the party a strong position for the general elections probably due in March. Under electoral laws approved in March, the winning alliance behind the mayoral candidate has the right to 60 per cent of the council seats. Yesterday in the second-round run-off, 129 mayoral seats were being contested with nearly a quarter of the electorate involved. In Genoa, Trieste and Venice, the Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi lost out to PDS-backed coalitions, scoring just over 40 per cent of the vote. However, in all three cities, the League is the largest single party. The same applies to the MSI in Naples and Rome. Mr Fini said he was proud of having done so well against an alliance of left-wing interests. 'I was alone against everybody,' he said. Ms Mussolini, for her part, stressed the need for the right to muster its forces for the general election. Mr Bossi admitted for the first time that his movement would now have to reconsider its policy on alliances. The League has consistently rejected alliances but has seen in these elections that it is not enough to be the largest single party to gain power. Premier Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said the elections were a sign of the country pulling together despite the turmoil wrought by the arrest or implication of 3,000 politicians and business figures in corruption probes.</p>

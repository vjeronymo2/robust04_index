			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Russia today denounced  again the NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions near  the town of Gorazde, urging an immediate end to the use of force  in the former Yugoslav republic.    In a statement released here, Ivan Rybkin, speaker of the  State Duma (lower house of the parliament), noted that the exact  number of victims of NATO air strikes at Serb positions near the  Bosnian town of Gorazde is still unknown and the military losses  and the number of existence of civilian casualties have not been  reported.    The statement said the air strike against Bosnian Serbs  showed that NATO has easily ignored not only the view of Russia,  but also the achieved agreements.    "We demand an immediate end to the unilateral, unsanctioned  use of military force by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  and urge the parliaments of all the states of the world to  actively contribute to the process of achieving a peaceful  political settlement of the Yugoslav crisis," the statement said.    According to the ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY, the Duma speaker  said  on another occasion earlier today that NATO air strikes against  the positions of Bosnian Serbs may be "an obstacle" to Russia's  joining NATO's "partnership for peace" program.</p>

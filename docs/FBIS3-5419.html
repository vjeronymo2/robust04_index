A celebration meeting was held at the Zimbabwe Talian Millet  state farm on February 23.    The general manager of the farm said in his speech that the  rural theses published by the great leader President Kim Il-song  is a programme which indicates a shortcut to the ultimate  solution of the rural question and a true textbook which makes  clear the way of freeing peasants from hard work and helping  them lead a rich and civilized life.    Seminars on the work of President Kim Il-song "Theses on the  Socialist Rural Question in Our Country" were held by the group  for the study of the chuche idea of Comrade Kim Il-song in  Enmoe, Guyana, and the Nepal Institute for Chuche Studies and in  Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania on February 24 and 25.    Manik Lal Shrestha, chairman of the Nepal Institute for  Chuche Studies, in his report said: President Kim Il-song  flawlessly indicated the fundamental principle, tasks and ways  for the solution of the rural question. The brilliant  achievements in the countryside of Korea today are a proud  fruition of the rural theses.    The Mozambican Committee for Friendship With the People of  the DPRK said in a statement on February 22 that the application  of the chuche farming method brings a bumper harvest in the  countryside of North Korea every year, but South Korea, same  territory, which was once called a granary has been devastated  and farming ruined every year for lack of water.    The statement expressed the hope that Korea would be  reunified at an early date according to the proposal for  confederation and the South Korean peasants would receive a  favour from the rural theses and the chuche farming method.    Commemorative articles were carried by the Bangladesh papers  GONO GONTU, FEREZ KHAJOZ, SAMACHAR, NATUN KATHA and AL AMIN, the  Thai paper SIN CHONG YUAN PAO, the Pakistani papers NIDA-E WAQT  and JIHAD, the Zimbabwean paper PEOPLE'S VOICE, the Senegalese  paper LE TEMOIN, the Burkinabe paper LE PAYS and aired by radio  Santarosa of Peru, radios America and Primerisima of Nicaragua.    Korean photo exhibitions, film shows and lectures were held  in Yugoslavia, Nigeria, Mozambique, Mongolia, Bulgaria and other  countries.</p>

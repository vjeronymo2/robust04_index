			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Surinamese Development Aid Minister Assen by </F> Linda Otter in Paramaribo; date not given: "`If We Do Nothing  Now, We Will Lose All Our Credibility'"-- first 10 paragraphs  are DE VOLKSKRANT introduction]    [Text] Paramaribo -- "There is strong resistance to the  International Monetary Fund [IMF] in Suriname," says Suriname  Development Aid Minister Assen. As a result his country does  not intend to deal with the IMF, as the Netherlands demanded.  However, Suriname will have to implement whatever hard-hitting  restructuring measures the IMF may require, he conceded.    "Last year, many Surinamers still thought that they were  doing the Netherlands a favor implementing a restructuring  program. They did not understand that they were doing so out of  pure necessity." Surinamese Development Aid Minister R. Assen  rapped his knuckles sharply on the table to underline his words.    Assen, who back in September took over from his predecessor,  ex-minister E. Sedoc, who retired for health reasons, believes  that Suriname must get down to work straight away. "We must not  wait until money starts to arrive from the Netherlands, but  simply make a start."    The relationship between the Netherlands and Suriname cooled  considerably when the Netherlands stopped making payments (worth  200 million -- DE VOLKSKRANT editor's note) out of a slush fund  aimed at stimulating production. Such money would only be made  available if Suriname, which had fallen a considerable way  behind in implementing its structural adjustment program [SAP],  turned to the IMF.    This demand aroused a great deal of emotion. According to  the government, doing business with the IMF was tantamount to  committing political suicide. However, things would now appear  to have settled down again somewhat, following a compromise  proposal drawn up by Assen which was delivered to the  Netherlands Government in The Hague last week by members of the  Surinamese Parliament. Suriname stated its readiness to turn to  the Warwick Research Institute to monitor its SAP. The  Netherlands could then turn to the IMF for advice concerning its  findings.    Although members of the Netherlands Parliament found the  plan  "rather laborious," Development Aid Minister Pronk did not react  dismissively. Assen admits that the compromise does not in any  way affect the way in which Suriname will have to implement its  adjustment program. Both the Warwick Research Institute and the  IMF are making strong demands regarding Surinamese restructuring.    According to Assen: "It is a highly sensitive issue. In  Suriname there is strong resistance to the International  Monetary Fund, partly because of the poor image that it had one  year ago. For example, wild tales were circulating about actions  in the streets of Jamaica, where an adjustment program was also  being implemented.    "The first party to turn feeling against the IMF was the NDP  [National Democratic Party] (the opposition party led by ex-Army  chief Bouterse -- DE VOLKSKRANT editor's note), back in 1988.  When the IMF was in the news again last year, the members of  the government were extremely cautious. Primarily because the  trade unions were also strongly opposed to the IMF. It would  have taken me years to convince them that the IMF had  significantly changed their tack in the meantime, and become  more lenient. We cannot tolerate a situation such as this.  After all, we have just emerged from a period of military rule,  during which the government exercised insufficient control over  the army. Furthermore, the army gained hold within a political  party (the NDP -- DE VOLKSKRANT editor's note) which seemed  pretty likely to come to power."    "However, we have already overcome one important obstacle.  In October, the trade unions announced actions due to the fuel  shortage and the tremendous increase in electricity prices.  When Bouterse decided to go along with them, betting that the  government would fall before Christmas, it suddenly became dead  quiet. If Bouterse had kept his mouth shut, then the government  might indeed not have lasted until Christmas."    Assen already has the dates of the restructuring measures  in his head. On 1 June, Suriname, which currently practices  four different exchange rates, will make the transition to  having just one uniform rate. In addition, import duties will  have to be raised at around the same time, and the plan for  restructuring the civil service will also have to be ready. "We  will have to implement specific, coherent measures," said Assen,  "which means that the working population will have to accept a  wage adjustment."    [Otter] It is not the first time that the government has  announced hard measures.    [Assen] I think that today the government is certainly  convinced that there is no way around implementing a structural  adjustment program. If we do nothing now, we will lose all our  credibility. By 1 June we must have a uniform exchange rate.  The bottom line for me is that the Surinamese economy must be  restructured, with or without foreign help. Naturally,  receiving help would considerably facilitate the task of keeping  the rate under control, but I am not counting on receiving that  money before June. I think that The Hague is saying: "Let us  wait and see how serious you are about implementing your plan."    [Otter] In Suriname, there was a strong emotional reaction  when the production slush fund worth 200 million was frozen.  How important is that money?    [Assen] The balance of payment support makes it easier for  us  to keep the rate under control. And with the industrial fund we  could stimulate exports. We must increase the state's foreign  exchange revenue. Surinamese companies are primarily trading  and packaging companies. The entrepreneurs will have to become  more export-oriented. That is difficult because trading yields  a great deal. The mentality of our entrepreneurs must change.  If the purchasing power of the people declines further, then  that will probably happen of its own accord. At the same time,  we must all attend to replacing imports. Suriname must give  priority to production that makes the country self-sufficient.    [Otter] Until now, the government had refused to implement  the restructuring measures, being mindful of a possible popular  uprising.    [Assen] If we offset the measures by others that raise  people's incomes, then I think there will be less resistance  than anticipated. Perhaps we will leave salaries as they are  and work with a system of bonuses. That will not trickle down  to secondary provisions (social security, etc. -- DE VOLKSKRANT  editor's note). If the government's plans are to be  restructured, then the officials must be accommodated within the  private sector. Then we will have to extend our social safety  net, e.g. by raising officials' pensions.    [Otter] Why did the government not act any earlier if it is  all that simple?    [Assen] It is not simple. Last year we needed to devote our  energy to dealing with the question of power. In the meantime,  attitudes have changed somewhat. There are now many more  Surinamese who understand why the SAP is necessary. For a long  time, Suriname was isolated, due to its period under military  dictatorship and the freezing of development aid. There were  only a few people who had heard of an adjustment program, and we  needed time to find our feet.    I can still remember speeches by ministers which contained a  great deal of rubbish about the SAP. Now we understand that the  SAP is not being forced on us from abroad. So in that respect  we have become a little wiser.</p>

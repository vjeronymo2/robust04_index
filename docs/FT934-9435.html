			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (8): A thirst for expansion - Femsa MONTERREY began attracting money during the US civil war from the smuggling of goods across the border to the Confederate states. Among the enterprises built with the capital thus attracted to the city was a brewery, the Cerveceria Cuauhtehmoc, which still stands today. It is now part of the Femsa group, the headquarters of which abut on the brewery and which itself is part of the Visa group. The company began to shift its strategy from 1989, realising that thriving in Mexico's newly-opened economy would require different qualities from survival in a closed economy. Investments have been made, international expansion is under way, and, say senior executives, the 'search continues for other markets and other technologies'. Femsa's beer brands are increasingly famous abroad: Dos Equis, Tecate, Carta Blanca and Sol, to name a few. But Femsa - which employs 37,500 people and had 1992 revenues of more than Dollars 2bn - is more than a beer company. It has interests also in packaging, soft-drinks - it holds Mexico's Coca-Cola franchise - and a chain of convenience stores. This year, the company floated in the Mexican and international markets a minority stake in its soft drinks subsidiary. Retaining a 51 per cent stake for itself, it sold 30 per cent to Coca-Cola for Dollars 195m and 19 per cent to the public for Dollars 177m. The soft drinks subsidiary now plans to go after other markets, particularly in Latin America and first perhaps in Argentina. Mr Othon Ruiz, the company's chief executive, says the company is talking to prospective foreign partners over similar arrangements in its packaging and beer subsidiaries. Philip Morris of the US, maker of Miller beer and holder of about 8 per cent of Femsa stock, is thought to be interested in the beer business. The company - forced to increase debt significantly after the acquisition by Visa shareholders of Bancomer from the government - used the funds from the flotation to pay down debt. Followers of the company say it remains fairly heavily indebted and worry that some senior managers spend too much time on the bank.</p>

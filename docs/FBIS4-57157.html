			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister-designate Gabriel Lewis </F> Galindo with unidentified reporters at the Los Capitales  Nacionales Corporation in Panama City; broadcast in progress --  live]    [Text] [Lewis Galindo] ...I wish to thank Dr. Perez  Balladares for choosing me as his foreign minister. This is a  great honor for me because I am familiar with Perez Balladares'  background. I am a close friend of his and worked in close  association with him in General Omar Torrijos' time. We were  part of Gen. Torrijos' inner circle or advisers. I wish to  express my appreciation for this opportunity to serve Panama. I  had already retired from business and public life.  Nevertheless, I accept this call to serve the homeland with  great energy. To serve my country at the Foreign Ministry holds  a poignant value for me. My father held the post of foreign  minister and struggled hard for the same cause that I championed  through the Treaties that were signed in 1977. My father  succeeded in having the Panamanian flag flown for the first time  at the military bases in our territory. During the  independence, my grandfather served the country in the same  capacity. So, three generations have served the homeland in a  similar way.    At this time, I wish to acknowledge publicly President  Endara's honest management of the elections. President Endara  made good his promise. He will go down in history as a great  Panamanian. In addition, I wish to acknowledge the Electoral  Tribunal's hard work. The way the vote counting was performed  deserved the warmest praises from the foreign observers who  witnessed the elections. The Catholic Church and the Justice  and Peace Commission created by Archbishop McGrath played a  significant role in persuading the Panamanian people that their  votes would be carefully counted. More than anything else, these  elections demonstrated the Panamanian people's lofty civic  spirit. I will cooperate with Dr. Omar Jaen, who has been  designated deputy foreign minister. I think I do not have much  else to say about him. He is an intellectual of international  prestige, a historian who has written Panama's history.  Whenever he has had time, he has put it down in books, but he  has always had it at hand in his personal computer. Welcome  aboard, Omar.    I have been talking with Dr. Perez Balladares on priorities.  As you know, he has set as his administration's priority to  improve the Panamanian people's standard of living. To do this,  it is necessary, first of all, to create jobs.    The Foreign Relations Ministry will be radically changed  under the government of Ernesto Perez Balladares; that is, the  Foreign Ministry will become a productive institution.  Incorporating Panama into NAFTA is a similar priority we will  pursue. This incorporation will let our products gain access to  great markets in Mexico, the United States, Canada, and any  other country that might join NAFTA. It is important for Panama  to establish friendly and praiseworthy relations with the United  States, relations that will allow us to obtain benefits and to  gain respect.    With the reorganization of the Panamanian diplomatic corps,  we will turn our embassies and consulates into agencies to  promote investment and tourism as well as seek markets.  Ambassadors around the world will have to obtain scholarships  so our young people can be improved intellectually. I think it  is a priority for the Panamanian people to raise their  self-esteem. We must recover our international prestige, just  as we did in Gen. Torrijos' time. Under the new national and  international circumstances, it is mandatory for Panama to again  be included among the respected and worthy nations of the world.  It is important to improve our political and economic relations  with all the nations of the continent and the world. We will  attach special importance to improving our relations with Mexico  and Peru. These relations have been a little on the downside.  We will maintain excellent relations with our neighbors  Colombia and Costa Rica. President [title as heard] Perez  Balladares has been invited by President Gaviria and President  Figueres to pay a quick visit to those countries and familiarize  himself with problems of common interest. In addition, Perez  Balladares has been invited by the governor of Puerto Rico, a  very close friend of his.    It is important to stimulate our commercial relations with  the EU, the Pacific Basin countries, and very particularly with  Japan. All of those things lead us to plan the creation of a  ministry of promotion. All of us Panamanians are proud when we  travel abroad. We should strive so the name of Panama can be  pronounced with respect. In particular, we will support  President Cesar Gaviria in the reorganization of the OAS. It is  important to stimulate better relations with the countries that  use the Panama Canal. It is also important to inform them that  the Panamanians will be capable of managing the waterway, which  will soon revert to us. We should have some type of relations  with the Eastern European nations that were recently liberated  from the Soviet yoke. This will be done in due time, but it is  also part of the list of priorities drafted in the few days that  Perez Balladares and I have been working together.    As I said before, it is important to recover our  international prestige. This can be done only by visiting those  countries and letting industry, banking, and government leaders  see the human quality of the team formed by Perez Balladares.  It goes without saying that the persons he has in mind to  appoint to positions in his cabinet are much more capable than  myself. I am proud to be able to work with the people Perez  Balladares has in mind for his government. I hope they will  accept when the proposal is made to them. All of us must lend a  shoulder to advance the homeland.    I will tell you something. I do not intend to stand with my  arms crossed. I have worked hard to build my business interests  through sacrifice and hard work. I have already spoken with  Panamanian Ambassador to Italy Rodolfo Aleman to advise him that  I will visit there during the month of June and expect to meet  with all the Panamanian consuls in that country. At that  meeting I plan to make them aware of what exactly we are  seeking: investment promotion, Panamanian goods promotion, [word  indistinct], and prestige for our country. Whoever is willing  to keep up with this can be certain of my support, otherwise we  will have to seek a replacement.    To me, it is important for all government officials to feel  secure. I plan to respect the stability of all Foreign Ministry  officials. It is important for us to create a climate  comfortable to work in if we expect to increase efficiency. If  an employee does not feel secure in his or her position, then  efficiency and productivity falls. These are some of the  guidelines I have been able to formulate so far. I would like  to ask for your cooperation. We must all work hard. If we all  work together, then I believe we will have a Panama we will all  be proud of.    [Reporter] You mentioned changes within the Foreign  Relations  Ministry. Specifically, what type of transformations were you  referring to?    [Lewis Galindo] We plan to transform the Ministry into an  agency of promotion. Costa Rican President [Jose] Figueres  appointed a commission to carry out a study related to  restructuring his country's Foreign Relations Ministry.  Everything I have heard so far about that study has been  positive. Costa Rica has surpassed us with regard to promoting  the country's business, tourism, in everything. So, I believe  it would be worthwhile to take a look at what they did.    At this time I would not dare tell you what our  transformation is going to be like. But one thing is for sure,  we are going to have a transformation. We plan to transform the  Ministry into an agency of promotion, in addition to maintaining  cordial relations.... [pauses] I just cannot imagine an  ambassador in Paris simply scratching his belly all year around.  That man must produce, regardless of whether it is  scholarships, investments in Panama, or promoting our products.  How is it possible that while Japan and Korea sell us thousands  of dollars worth of cars, and we have embassies over there, yet  we are still trying to determine what to do with a product such  as bananas because the European countries are setting up  barriers? All of this is give and take. However, if the  ambassadors simply sit around with their arms crossed and merely  send.... [pauses] We will never accomplish anything if the  ambassadors are persons who do not produce regardless of what  positions they occupy, and we tend to reward them with an  embassy, as we have done in the past, or simply because they are  related to someone or some legislator. This is not going to be  the case.    Panama will be represented by its most capable officials. I  cannot fathom a foreign relations ministry under my direction in  which I will be receiving calls from a country's foreign  ministry requesting the withdrawal of a certain ambassador  because he has spent his time illegally importing cars. That  simply cannot be. We must be proud anytime we travel overseas.    [Reporter] What can you say about Panama's integration to  the  Central American Parliament [Parlacen]?    [Lewis Galindo] I would rather have the minister of planning  and economic policy answer that question at a later date.    I personally believe that we have nothing to do with market  integration in Central America. We can have cultural  integration, but our business realm and wage scale do not match  those of Central America. That is why I feel that what is more  interesting for us is to think big -- let us associate ourselves  with the three powerful northern countries. This does not mean  we should hurt our relations with Central American countries; on  the contrary. We have very basic economic differences. This is  my personal opinion, and this topic is not my business, it is up  to the planning minister. I am only giving my opinion as a  businessman.    [Reporter] Could it not prove politically beneficial?    [Lewis Galindo] Politically?    [Reporter] To have the Legislative Assembly integrate  Parlacen.    [Lewis Galindo] The Legislative Assembly.... [pauses] Well,  the political side, fine. My disagreement is with economic  integration.    [Reporter] The general commentary is that your return to  public life, especially to the Foreign Ministry, is basically  due to the transfer of the Panama Canal. There is word that due  to your success with the treaty negotiations and your close  relations with former President Jimmy Carter, and all the team  that works with President Clinton, there is a possibility of  negotiating a new base treaty.    [Lewis Galindo] President Carter is very respectful of  Panama. He does not hold any official post in the U.S.  Government. He has not spoken to me or anyone else about U.S.  bases. This is a problem that I am sure we will discuss with  the Americans in due course. But you can be sure that as long as  I am foreign minister anything we do will take into account  Panama's best interests and always with respect. As long as I  am there and Dr. Perez Balladares is in the presidency, we will  work and struggle for the recovery of our sovereignty. We will  not give it away to anyone, but this does not mean that, if the  study of the presence of U.S. military bases is required, I will  oppose it. These then become not nationalistic issues, but  cheap nationalistic issues.    Countries such as Spain, Italy -- powers with plenty of  tradition -- have foreign bases there. Tell me where does the  United States not have bases? We belong to the group of  countries that make up the Western world; these barriers no  longer exist. Perhaps one could argue whether the presence of  U.S. bases is justified; up to now they have not done anything.  I for one do not believe that we should make the first move and  say: stay here, stay here. If the United States seriously needs  the bases and is willing to talk to us, Dr. Perez Balladares has  already said on several occasions he is willing to sit down and  talk about the issue.    [Reporter] How do you feel about Cuba returning to the OAS?    [Lewis Galindo] Cuba is a very complex issue. Dr. Perez  Balladares has issued statements in this regard, so I would not  dare comment on this topic right now because it is a  controversial topic. I would prefer to discuss this further  along the line. This is a topic.... [pauses] We must wait for  Dr. Perez Balladares to take office and then he can decide. For  the time being I cannot say anything further on this because I  am unaware of his opinion.    [Reporter] When will the elected president meet with  Presidents Gaviria and Figueres?    [Lewis Galindo] In the next 15 days. In fact, we are about  to send emissaries to coordinate the details of the visits. We  will send them to both countries.    [Reporter] Mr. Lewis Galindo, going back to NAFTA. Could a  renegotiation of the military bases give Panama an opportunity  to reach Mexico's level regarding the renegotiation of the  Treaties?    [Lewis Galindo] Well, that is part of a negotiation. We will  open the negotiations. When one negotiates, ones does so with  the cards on the table. They have their cards, we have ours.  Let us see what they propose. We will open the negotiations  and then see. But first we must get the three countries to  negotiate with us. For this reason, it is very important to  resume very friendly relations with Mexico and create a better  climate between Canada and Panama. We must increase the degree  of our relations with Panama if Canada and Panama are to be  economic partners. First of all, however, we have to win over  three countries before entering NAFTA.    [Reporter] Several Panamanians are in exile. At the Attorney  General's Office several cases are pending. The extraditions of  several individuals have been requested from several countries.  Such requests have not been processed. Do you intend to follow  up these cases?    [Lewis Galindo] Well, I do not know what it is all about.  First of all, I must familiarize myself with these things. The  government of President Perez Balladares is persecuting no one,  however. I suppose that the legal procedures against people who  have cases pending with the administration of justice by reasons  of their offenses or crimes will have to continue.  Nevertheless, this does not fall under my authority but rather  that of the administration of justice.    [Reporter] Regarding the EU and the division of the  countries  [words indistinct]?    [Lewis Galindo] I think Spain owes us an opinion poll. We  should talk with President Gonzalez and ask him to admit that  the existing ties between the United Kingdom and its colonies  and between Spain and its former colonies, such as the Central  American countries, should be similar. The fact that we  obtained our independence in the 19th century and that Jamaica  and the other English colonies obtained theirs in the 20th  century does not justify Spain neglecting its relations with us.  We must have a powerful sponsor, such as Spain. We will  eventually talk with our friend President Gonzalez and the  Spanish authorities. I am sure that in this way we can strike  some kind of arrangement favorable to Panama.    [Reporter] What can be done to have the U.S. Senate ratify  the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty?    [Lewis Galindo] We must trust the Panamanian officials. U.S.  senators do not trust Panamanian officials because we have given  proof of scant seriousness and, in this case, they say: Since  this is a two-way thing, we can give Panama certain information  and it may end in the drug traffickers' hands. However, that  can change and I think that with the attention that Perez  Balladares will give all those problems we will recover the  trust in Panama -- not only with the United States but also with  the rest of the world.    You tune in a radio or television station in Paris speaking  about Panama and the stations say Panama has just held elections  and the country is one of the largest drug trafficking centers.  This was told to me by a French banker who indignantly phoned  me this morning. This government has done a number of good  things but has overlooked reporting them. Consequently,  Panama's prestige has dropped down low. As I said before, we  must restore Panama's name to the level it had during Torrijos'  time.    [Reporter] Do you belong to any one political party?    [Lewis Galindo] I do not actively participate in any one  political party. Nevertheless, I joined and voted for the  Solidarity Movement out of solidarity with my brother. He is  the politician. I am a businessman and a retired one at that.  I have been taken out of retirement to be put to work again. I  wish to say something else. The door to the Foreign Ministry,  headed by myself and Jaen, will remain open. Sometimes I am too  frank and stick my foot in certain things. So help me not to  because I am not too much of a diplomat.</p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Plan to fight huge housing shortage The South African Housing Ministry and the Association of Mortgage Lenders, a group of big banks and building societies, have announced a R2bn (Pounds 350m) plan to open up mortgage loans to the lower end of the housing market. The plan, which will provide for up to 50,000 loans worth R10,000 in its first year of operation, represents the first big initiative by government and the private sector to combat South Africa's huge housing shortage. The government has agreed to indemnify banks for the first three years of the programme in case of a breakdown in law enforcement that would prevent them repossessing the property of defaulters. The new plan appears to indicate that broad agreement on how to implement the policy has now been reached and further initiatives are expected to be unveiled next week at a planned National Housing Summit in Botshabelo, Orange Free State. Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary-general, yesterday denied reports he was planning to step down from his post at the party's planned national conference in December. Mr Ramaphosa was responding to press speculation that he was tired of political life.</p>

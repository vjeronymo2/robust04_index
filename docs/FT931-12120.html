			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: Coca-Cola gains 9.5% to Dollars 392.6m in fourth quarter COCA-COLA, the Atlanta-based soft drinks company, yesterday reported a 9.5 per cent advance in fourth-quarter profits after tax, to Dollars 392.6m, on sales 12.7 per cent higher at Dollars 3.24bn. With accounting-related charges stripped out, the rise would have been 11.8 to Dollars 400.6m. The group's full-year figures are muddied by the effects of the change in accounting methods for non-pension retirement benefits. Before these items, net profits showed a 17.8 per cent improvement, at Dollars 1.91bn. After the accounting-related charge, the advance is reduced to 2.9 per cent, leaving net profits at Dollars 1.66bn. Sales for the full year were 13 per cent higher at Dollars 13.1bn. Coca-Cola said that the fourth-quarter volume growth helped the final quarter's figures. 'It augers well for 1993 that we ended 1992 with such momentum,' commented Mr Roberto Goizueta, chairman. Coca-Cola said that operating profits from its soft drinks operations within the US advanced 9 per cent last year. Unit case volume sold to retail bottle/can and fountain customers grew 2 per cent, and gallon shipments of concentrates and syrups advanced by a similar amount. On the international side, soft drink operating profit was up by 18 per cent. Unit case volume sold to retail customers increased by 4 per cent, and gallon shipments of concentrates and syrups grew by 3 per cent.</p>

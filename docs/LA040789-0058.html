			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VETS BACK FROM VISIT WITH EX-FOES  </P> <P> A group of Vietnam veterans returned from Southeast Asia on Thursday to an  airport greeting of confetti and hugs and kisses.  </P> <P> "Boy, we didn't get a greeting like this when we came back from the war," said  Army veteran Steve Brooks of Santa Cruz.  </P> <P> While in Vietnam, the veterans helped build a 14-room clinic for their former  enemies, using $50,000 in donated money.  </P> <P> With the cooperation of the Vietnamese government, the veterans, along with  about 30 Vietnamese, erected a one-story, 2,500-square-foot building at Vung  Tau, 60 miles from Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon.  </P></p>

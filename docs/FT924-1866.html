			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Vodafone group wins Australian licence AUSTRALIA has awarded an operator's licence for a mobile telephone network to a group owned by Vodafone of the UK. The Vodafone group, called Arena GSM, becomes the third licence-holder for Australia, one of the fastest growing markets in the world. Arena GSM is paying ADollars 140m for the licence and intends to invest another ADollars 400m in the project. It beat off three other shortlisted companies: Singapore Telecom and two local operators Matrix Telecommunications and Voxson. The new service is scheduled to start by next October and must be available to 80 per cent of the population by the end of 1996, according to the terms of the licence. The latter also requires Australian interests to control more than half of Arena GSM by 2003. Vodafone said it would wait until the business was profitable - at least three years after the start of services - before reducing its 95 per cent stake. Arena GSM will be competing against existing licence-holders, Optus Communications and the state-owned Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation. Mr Bob Collins, Australia's communications minister, said that no more licences would be issued until 1997. The infrastructure for the new network is likely to be supplied either by Ericsson or Sweden or Finland's Nokia. It will be based on the GSM digital standard, the same as that used in a pan-European mobile network now being built. Vodafone, which a decade ago became one of the two original licensees for the UK's mobile telephone network, is also bidding for Germany's third mobile telecommunications licence. The result could be made public before the end of this month, said Vodafone. Vodafone - see Lex</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: A timely story from Reuters FT-SE Index: 2,523.7 (-13.4) Reuters managed to announce its annual results several minutes before the figures appeared on the official Stock Exchange news service - a neat way of embarrassing the competition. The figures themselves highlighted the company's continued resilience in the second half: Reuters has been coping with recession better than most. Granted, the earnings and the full-year dividend increases of 10 and 13 per cent respectively were a far cry from the heady growth of a few years ago. But Reuters' markets have scarcely been growing apace, and Pounds 24m of rationalisation costs and Pounds 29m of accelerated depreciation were absorbed easily enough. As in the previous year, it was an unexpectedly strong rise in the cash position which made the difference. Reuters now has more than Pounds 500m of net cash, which generated Pounds 50m of interest and funded the dividend increase. The question of what to do with the money is gradually becoming more pressing, although quarterly and half-year billing for customers currently paying in advance will act as something of a brake on further accumulation. The strong performance of the shares since last July means they are on a historic multiple of 20. That is somewhat at odds with Reuters' frank admission that trading this year will continue to be tough, so the shares' progress from here may be limited. Both the Dealing 2000 (phase two) and Globex projects should at last go live this year, which will help counteract the costs of yet more rationalisation. But the group will manage only small price increases and is braced for fewer new orders. While Reuters will have to pedal hard to make headway, yesterday's evidence suggests it will not be going backwards.</p>

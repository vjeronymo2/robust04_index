			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: India-Pakistan Talks: The Atmosphere Is Not </F> Improving; It Is Troubled"]    [Text] The Pakistani government has expressed grave concern  about the increasing atrocities of the Indian troops in Kashmir  and has asked friendly nations to help stop these atrocities and  put pressure on India. It is important to create an atmosphere  that is conducive to productive talks at the secretary's level,  to start on 1 January. A spokesman of Pakistan's Foreign  Ministry said during a routine briefing that the foreign  secretary has informed diplomats from eastern Europe and Islamic  countries about the situation in Kashmir and the Indian  atrocities there. According to the spokesman, the government of  Pakistan has warned India to stop the activities of RAW  [Research and Analysis Wing (Intelligence Agency)] in Pakistan,  because Pakistan and some neighboring nations have proof of its  ugly activities. The spokesman further said that if India does  not stop the campaign of disinformation against Pakistan, then  Pakistan will unmask the activities of RAW.    India and Pakistan will have talks on Kashmir in Islamabad  on  1 January at the foreign secretary's level. The Pakistani  government took back a resolution introduced in the United  Nations about human rights violations in order to create a  friendly atmosphere for these talks. According to the Pakistani  government, some friendly nations have assured that India will  be serious in these talks; however, the attitude the Indian  government has taken does not give us much hope. India responded  to Pakistan taking back the resolution from the United Nations  with inhuman acts in Sopur and endless destruction in occupied  Kashmir. Afterwards, India continued its shameful atrocities in  occupied Kashmir. In Sopur alone, 150 people were killed and 20  were wounded on 26 November. Over 400,000 Indian troops are  already present in occupied Kashmir. Recently, East Punjab has  sent fresh forces to the valley. The agents trained by the  Israeli secret agency, Mosad, are creating havoc in Kashmir.    Pakistan has also taken notice of Indian intelligence agency  RAW's instigative activities in Pakistan. The fact is that India  is using RAW to spread chaos in Pakistan, especially in Sindh,  in order to divert the attention of the world from the Kashmir  issue and to spread fear and terrorism in Pakistan. Sindh is  especially a target of RAW's activities. It is an open secret  that some separatist elements in Sindh have a direct connection  with RAW. The agents of RAW, dressed as robbers, encourage  instigation and terrorism. India wants to create a situation  similar to that of East Pakistan in Sindh. The communal and  racial riots of Sindh were also encouraged by agents of RAW  there.    Now the situation is such that the shameful atrocities in  Kashmir are increased, the number of troops is augmented, help  from Mosad is taken to crush the activities of Kashmiri freedom  fighters, and India's intelligence agencies are active against  Pakistan's freedom and unity. We cannot call all these  activities sincere or the atmosphere friendly. Pakistan has  informed the friendly nations about the atrocities being  conducted against Kashmiris, especially those countries that  have assured Pakistan that India will be serious in the next  series of talks, has taken a very appropriate step. The  government of Pakistan should also inform them about India's  atrocities in Kashmir and RAW's activities in Pakistan, so that  if no progress is made in these talks because of India's  attitude, then India will not be able to accuse Pakistan.  Instead, these countries will learn that it is India's attitude  that is the major hindrance to making these negotiations  successful.</p>

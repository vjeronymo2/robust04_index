High-level contact between  the two sides recently has increased and it is believed that  this trend will continue.    Qian Qichen made the above statement at the airport this  morning in Beijing on his return from Paris, in reply to a  reporter's question about his talks with U.S. Secretary of State  Christopher during his visit to France.    He described the talk as constructive, saying that despite  differences between China and the United States on issues such  as the most-favored-nation status, both sides have the same  wish, which is that this problem would be solved properly and  prevented from interfering [gan rao 1626 2371] in the  development of relations between the two countries.    Qian Qichen said: One of the international trends at present  is strengthening relations with China. He said: The  normalization of Sino-France relations carries great  significance. Because the West European economies at present  are not too good, they are all optimistic about the large  Chinese market. France's decision to develop relations with  China is undoubtedly a good thing.    Qian Qichen said: He had a talk with the French leader in an  harmonious atmosphere and achieved satisfactory results.  Consensus was reached on many issues and both sides stressed  complete normalization in Sino-French relations.    On his tour of six African states, Qian Qichen said that  many  African countries are developing countries and have very good  relations with China. China sets great store by developing  relations with African states.</p>

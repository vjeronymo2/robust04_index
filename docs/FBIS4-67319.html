			<p>CSO     [Text] Yesterday, the European Observatory for Drugs  and Drug Addiction (OEDT) was opened officially in Lisbon, to  determine a strategy for the Twelve to combat drugs, with a  budget of 906,000 contos.    "We are here today to take a decisive step toward the  practical implementation of a major project of the European  Union." This was the opening statement made by Marques Mendes to  the 16 members of the OEDT board of administration: 12 from the  member states, two from the European Commission, and two  specialists designated by the European Parliament.    In his official speech, the deputy minister greeted those  present in the name of the government, guaranteeing Portugal's  "total commitment and its best effort" in support of the  observatory's installation: a task that he wished to be "rapid."    Marques Mendes stressed the fact that, "Combating the  scourge  of drugs and drug addiction requires determination, cooperation,  and solidarity." He gave a reminder that, "It is impossible to  do effective work based on mere amateurism."    As for the informational role that this observatory will  assume in the future, that member of the government claimed that  "paths for cooperation" are being opened for action on a  European scale, which could result in "more effective  intervention."  <H5>  Two Candidates for Future Director </H5>   At yesterday's meeting, the first convened by the OEDT board  of administration, and held at the Belem Cultural Center, the  members debated topics related to the start-up of this first  Community agency with headquarters in Portugal. They discussed  the organization of internal regulations, the selection of a  president, and various possibilities concerning the  observatory's installation.    The session was chaired by Vanden Abeele, the Commission's  general director for budget, who, during a brief press  conference, announced that the observatory's budget for this  year will be 4.6 million ecus [European currency units], nearly  906,000 contos. He commented: "However, only half of that sum  has been made available."    The second meeting will take place before the end of July,  at  which time a director will be designated, as well as a genuine  work program. The profile of the future director was debated  yesterday, with emphasis on two candidates: Father Feytor Pinto,  the high commissioner for Project Life, and George Stievenard,  in charge of the Drug Department of the Commission of European  Communities' Secretariat General. DN [DIARIO DE NOTICIAS]  published an interview with the latter yesterday.    According to the regulations establishing the OEDT, its  purpose is to provide objective, reliable, and comparable  reports, on the European level, regarding drugs and their  respective consequences, not only from the social and health  standpoint, but also from that of trafficking and repression.    However, the observatory cannot adopt any measure extending  beyond the specific realm of information and respective  treatment. It has a computerized network available, establishing  the infrastructure for collection and exchange of information  and documentation. The system has been designated the European  Network for Information on Drugs and Drug Addiction (Reitox). It  is intended to create a link between the national information  networks, the specialized centers in the member states, and the  information systems of international organizations and agencies  cooperating with the observatory.  <H5>  Taking Europol Into Account </H5>   In this respect, stress should be placed on the third  article  of the regulations, which states that the observatory shall take  into consideration activities carried out, specifically, by the  European Police Service (Europol), and make an effort to  evaluate them.    Dealing with a rather sensitive issue, the regulations  stipulate that the observatory shall not collect data that would  make it possible to identify persons or small groups of persons.  It must also refrain from any informational activity relating to  concrete cases and specific names.    It must take into account the Council of Europe's Convention  108, on protection of persons, insofar as the computerized  treatment of data of a personal nature is concerned.</p>

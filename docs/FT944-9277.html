			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: BSkyB says piracy could undermine float confidence British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television consortium, has admitted in a High Court affidavit that piracy could undermine confidence in its flotation unless rigorously tackled. Last week BSkyB was granted a High Court injunction, under copyright legislation, against Mr Bill Leach and Mr Russell Craven, trading as BSB Electronics. The small electronics company was alleged to have been using regional newspaper advertisements to sell a device it was claimed could switch on BSkyB smart cards whether the holder had paid their subscriptions or not. Another blocker device was claimed to be able to prevent the satellite company deactivating the cards. The largest proportion of BSkyB's revenues are earned by broadcasting channels, such as Sky Sports, which can only be viewed by subscribers who have a card to unlock the signal. The BSkyB case was that unless the defendants were stopped, the satellite company, in which Pearson, owners of the Financial Times currently holds 17.5 per cent, would suffer 'substantial and unquantifiable loss'. This was spelled out in the affadavit as: a loss, perhaps accelerating, of current and potential subscribers; the possible loss of agreements and intended agreements with independent broadcasters; possible loss of confidence in BSkyB's impending flotation. BSkyB's pathfinder prospectus, valuing the company at between Pounds 4bn and Pounds 4.6bn was published on Monday. The legal document also says that BSkyB has come across a few examples of pirate 'period 9' cards - the more sophisticated cards introduced in May to wipe out piracy. The cards were knocked out by signals broadcast over the air. Ms Sharon Southwell-Gray, BSkyB's deputy head of legal affairs, says in the document that some of the individuals and companies involved in piracy have sophisticated resources. 'I believe it is only a matter of time before pirate period 9 cards become available,' she conceded. In its pathfinder document, BSkyB says pirate devices range from counterfeit cards to 'blockers' designed to upgrade genuine cards. The directors say they are not aware of counterfeit cards still functioning, and add that blockers were not in wide circulation. Apart from over-the-air anti-piracy measures, BSkyB would continue to replace its cards periodically.</p>

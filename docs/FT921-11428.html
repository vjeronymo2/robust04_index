			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / World leaders to call for enhanced UN role WORLD leaders meeting in New York today will call both for a more active peace-making and peace-keeping role for the United Nations and more stringent controls on nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, in a joint declaration proposed by the UK. The UN ambassadors of the Security Council members reached broad agreement last night on the proposals which will be submitted to government leaders for adoption at the Council's first-ever summit session today. The draft of the declaration, to be read on behalf of the members at the end of the summit tonight , asserts that the world now has the best chance for achieving international peace and security since the UN was founded in 1945. The Council declaration proposes that the secretary-general submit by July 1 recom mendations to strengthen and make more efficient the UN's capacity for preventive diplomacy, an area in which it has a particularly poor record. This could cover its role in identifying potential crises and areas of instability. The draft also deals with arms control, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, nuclear proliferation and the problem of chemical weapons. Sir David Hannay, the UK ambassador, who led the drafting, emphasised last night that now it was up to the government leaders, because there was never an intention that the declaration be agreed by ambassadors before the summit, then for it to be rubber-stamped. The summit meeting will be chaired by Mr John Major, the British prime minister, because Britain holds the rotating presidency in January. He proposed the session to reinvigorate the UN and set a political course for the five-year term of Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, of Egypt, who became secretary-general on January 1. Most of the Security Council members consider that Mr Boutros-Ghali should be urged to adopt a higher profile on the international stage than has been the practice for a UN secretary-general. Apart from spelling out new preventive diplomacy and financial proposals, Mr Boutros-Ghali is also expected to suggest ways in which the UN could quickly mobilise small military contingents for deployment in trouble spots. Citing the example of the expulsion of Iraq from Kuwait, under the authority of the UN, the declaration is expected to place particular emphasis on the principle of collective security as a means of dealing with future threats to peace. It will also reiterate the need for member states to carry out their obligations under existing arms control agreements, to bring negotiations on chemical weapons to a rapid conclusion, and to strengthen nuclear non-proliferation arrangements. Just as important as the summit itself will be bilateral meetings today and tomorrow. Those to be held by President George Bush of the US with Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, who will be making his first appearance at the UN, and Li Peng, the Chinese prime minister, promise to be particularly significant. Mr Bush and Mr Yeltsin, who are due to meet at Camp David near Washington tomorrow, are expected to have detailed discussions on their respective proposals for significant cuts in the strategic nuclear arsenals of the US and Russia. Apart from the proposed cuts in the land-based multi-warhead missiles of both sides, the discussions will focus on Mr Yeltsin's proposal that the US and Russia should co-operate on a global system of defence against long-range missiles.</p>

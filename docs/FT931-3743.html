			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Serb shelling kills women blockading UK troops SHELLING by Serbs killed and wounded a number of women and young children blockading British soldiers in a Moslem village in east Bosnia yesterday, Reuter reports from Sarajevo. Major Martin Waters, at the headquarters of the British UN battalion in Vitez, central Bosnia, said two doctors were performing operations on the victims without the use of anaesthetic. 'There are quite a few dead, and six children under five were seriously injured, two with their legs blown off.' Five British soldiers are being held hostage in the besieged village of Konjevic Polje by Moslems demanding a ceasefire, the stationing of UN monitors in the region and humanitarian aid. The soldiers, in two armoured cars, were escorting a UN medical convoy to Konjevic Polje on Thursday when they were surrounded by Moslems demanding their wounded be evacuated. After spending the night in the village the five soldiers continued talks with a group of villagers, most of them old people, women and children. The British soldiers were joined by a third armoured car yesterday. Artillery from surrounding mountains opened up and shells hit the crowd. 'The fire was very well-aimed, they obviously had an observation post in the mountains,' Major Waters said.</p>

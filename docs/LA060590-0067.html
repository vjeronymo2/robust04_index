			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUESTIONS RAISED ON COURT-ORDERED COMMUNITY WORK;  </P> <P> JUDICIAL SYSTEM: FORMER SUPERVISOR AT ANIMAL SHELTER PLEADS NO CONTEST TO  HELPING CONCEAL THAT ASSIGNMENTS WERE NOT BEING PERFORMED.  </P> <P> A former supervisor of a Los Angeles County animal shelter in Baldwin Park  pleaded no contest Monday to a felony charge that he prepared false documents  concealing the fact that court-ordered community service work assigned at the  shelter was not being performed.  </P> <P> Jaime Meraz, 44, a Chino resident who is a 20-year employee of the Los Angeles  Department of Animal Care and Control, entered his plea before Municipal Court  Judge Rand Schrader, who set sentencing for July 2 in Superior Court.  </P> <P> The case, like the controversy last month over actress Zsa Zsa Gabor's  performance of community service work after slapping a Beverly Hills police  officer, raised more questions about how well court-ordered community service  work is monitored.  </P> <P> An official with the Los Angeles County Probation Department said action will  soon be taken to improve oversight of the referral system, which was  responsible for an estimated 52,000 community service sentences last year.  </P> <P> Although the issue in Gabor's case was whether her fund-raising activities for  a Venice program for the elderly met the requirements of her sentence to  perform community service, the issue in the Meraz case was whether a county  employee wrongly certified that court-ordered service had been performed.  </P> <P> Meraz's case is related to charges leveled a year ago against one of his  Baldwin Park shelter employees, Jorge A. Gamont, who was accused in June, 1989,  of accepting bribes from three people assigned to do community service work as  an alternative to jail sentences.  </P> <P> Gamont pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of falsifying evidence and was  sentenced to three years' probation.  </P> <P> According to Deputy Dist. Atty. Reid A. Rose of the special investigations  division, which investigates cases of official misconduct, there was no  evidence showing that Meraz knew of the bribes.  </P> <P> But, Rose said, "As manager of the shelter, he was responsible for approving  the referral forms verifying service had been performed. . . . He was aware the  work was not being performed."  </P> <P> Meraz on Monday had no comment. "Mr. Meraz never knowingly did anything wrong,"  said his attorney, William A. Hinz. "He never benefited one iota." Hinz  declined to elaborate.  </P> <P> Officials in the district attorney's office and the county Probation Department  said no officials there monitor community-service sentences, usually imposed  for misdemeanor cases such as traffic violations, driving while intoxicated or  petty theft.  </P> <P> The monitoring falls to the seven community volunteer centers -- all members of  the Volunteer Centers of Southern California -- which are under contract with  the Probation Department, said Carol Koelle, a regional director of the  department.  </P> <P> "We expect them to do whatever monitoring is necessary to make sure that people  do their time," Koelle said.  </P> <P> But Lenore Jacoby, head of one of the seven centers -- the Volunteer Center of  Greater Pomona Valley -- said that although the number of community service  referrals climbs steadily, with an 8% increase projected for this year, the  centers "are paid a very small amount . . . $7 or $8 a case. . . . That leaves  little money to do follow-up monitoring."  </P> <P> Mike Wada, a Hacienda-La Puente School District official who is familiar with  the district's court-referral program, said: "There are people who take  advantage of the system. You'd really need to monitor almost 24 hours a day to  make sure there isn't hanky-panky going on."  </P> <P> De-De Hicks, president of the Volunteer Centers of Southern California and head  of another contracting center, said, however, that cases such as Baldwin Park  were "an isolated incident," and that the community-service programs were "one  of the most problem-free anyone could ask for."  </P> <P> But, Koelle said, "We are concerned with instances of highly inappropriate or  improper behavior." She said that she and other probation department officials  hoped to have a plan for better oversight by mid-June.  </P> <P> Wada said his program has been making community-service referrals to the  Baldwin Park shelter, but added that its status as a referral agency would now  be reviewed.  </P> <P> Meraz was transferred from Baldwin Park in 1989 after Gamont was charged with  bribery, county animal control spokesman Bob Ballinger said. Despite his  conviction, Gamont remains a department employee, Ballinger said.  </P> <P> Meraz was also Baldwin Park supervisor during a period in 1988 when a monthlong  county audit of the shelter found 145 animals, mostly cats and dogs, were  apparently missing and could not be accounted for.  </P> <P> Until mid-May, Meraz was assigned tasks such as overseeing department vehicles,  Ballinger said, but then he was named deputy manager at the county's shelter in  Downey. Ballinger called this "a lateral move, not a promotion," and said the  department will not consider any change in Meraz's employment status until  after the sentencing.  </P> <P> Meraz faces up to three years in prison on the charge. But the district  attorney has recommended that he be sentenced to three years' probation, a $500  fine and, ironically, 100 hours of community service.  </P></p>

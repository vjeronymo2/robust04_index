			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. RIGHTS STAND STIRS ISRAELIS AS UPRISING TOLL CLIMBS  </P> <P> On a day that a U.S. human rights report critical of Israel stirred the  country, four Palestinians died of Israeli bullets while an Israeli civilian  burned to death in his vehicle. Preliminary reports indicated he was the victim  of an Arab firebombing, but investigators later said they could not be sure.  </P> <P> The Wednesday incidents are likely to be grist for the passionate arguments  here over Israel's handling of the Arab uprising in the West Bank and Gaza  Strip, as well as Washington's reaction to it.  </P> <P> The killings of the Arabs could be used to bolster charges that Israel uses  excessive force. The State Department's annual human rights report, issued  Tuesday, said Israel's use of live fire had resulted in "many avoidable deaths  and injuries."  </P> <P> However, the attack on the Israeli civilian, if confirmed, would strengthen  Israel's rebuttal. The government argues that the uprising is in essence a  terrorist campaign against the country, that human rights criticism is  misplaced and that the United States should stop talking to the Palestine  Liberation Organization, which claims leadership of the uprising.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir responded to reports of the firebombing by  saying: "It's a very grave event. It shows there is no relation between the  report in Washington and the reality of this country."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Israeli settlers who live on the West Bank demanded that the Israeli  army crack down harder on Palestinians throwing stones or gasoline bombs. Some  tried to enter Arab villages, apparently seeking revenge, but were headed off  by soldiers.  </P> <P> The first of Wednesday's Palestinian fatalities occurred when Arab prisoners  rioted at a jail in northern Israel after visitors outside began to wave  Palestinian flags.  </P> <P> After shooting tear gas and bullets made of plastic and metal at the rioters,  troops opened fire with full metal rounds, killing one prisoner.  </P> <P> Shortly afterward, two youths were shot to death in stone-throwing clashes with  the army in separate villages in the West Bank. A third man died in an Israeli  hospital after being hit in the head by a bullet the day before.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the State Department had put the toll of Palestinians killed in the  intifada, as the uprising is known in Arabic, at 366.  </P> <P> The apparent firebombing occurred near the West Bank settlement of Alfei  Menashe, not far from Israel's official border. The army initially said that  the driver, Albert Jerussi, 38, was returning to his home in the settlement  when a Molotov cocktail hit his vehicle and burst into flames. Later, they said  they could not find debris from the bomb and could not confirm that it was an  ambush.  </P> <P> Jerussi, a father of three, died before arriving at a hospital in Kfar Sava. He  would be the 15th Israeli killed since the intifada began in December, 1987.  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, the State Department human rights report had been  front-page news in all Israeli newspapers. Opposition members of Parliament  called for the government to resign over the criticism.  </P> <P> The report found fault not only with the use of bullets by Israeli troops but  also with other means Israel uses to fight the uprising: detentions without  trial, demolition of homes and the expulsion of Arabs.  </P> <P> An array of Israeli officials publicly described the criticism as "harsh,"  "tough," "exaggerated" and "lamentable," while privately, they wondered how a  widening gap in viewpoints with Washington might affect relations.  </P> <P> Israel considers the intifada to be part of a terrorist campaign to destroy the  country. As such, it is no more than an extension of past wars made on Israel  by the hostile Arab world.  </P> <P> In contrast, the State Department report claimed that the uprising stems from  activities of "primarily young men and women motivated by Palestinian  nationalism and a desire to bring the occupation to an end."  </P> <P> Israeli officials say they have been assured the human rights report will not  impair overall ties with the United States, a relationship that includes close  military cooperation and about $3 billion a year in aid from Washington.  </P> <P> However, it is apparent not all is unchanged; unlike last year, the State  Department did not give Israel an advance text of the report.  </P> <P> In December, then-Secretary of State George P. Shultz decided to open talks  with the PLO. Shultz accepted the PLO's verbal renunciation of terrorism as one  of the bases for talks.  </P> <P> Israel claimed that the PLO had not changed and has tried to reverse  Washington's decision. Over the weekend, Israel said its troops aborted an  attempt by an armed PLO unit to infiltrate Israel and kill civilians. The PLO  responded that its guerrillas were after military targets.  </P></p>

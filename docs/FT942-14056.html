			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: Electrolux sells US associate for Dollars 114m Electrolux, the Swedish electrical appliance maker, has sold its US-based asphalt machinery-making associate Blaw Knox Construction Equipment Corp to Clark Equipment Corp for about Dollars 114m, agencies report from Stockholm. The sale generated a capital gain of Dollars 94m for Electrolux, but write-offs of goodwill of SKr820m (Dollars 104m) mean that it will take a net charge of SKr80m for the sale in its 1994 accounts. 'The divestment of Blaw Knox will strengthen the group's financial position and is in line with our strategy of streamlining the group's operations and concentrating resources in our core areas,' said Mr Leif Johansson, the chief executive. Leif Hoegh, a Norwegian shipowner, reported a sharp decline in first-quarter net profit to NKr67m (Dollars 9m) from NKr117m in the same period last year, and forecast a weaker result for the year as a whole, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. The shipowner said the results were not directly comparable, as Bona Shipping, a unit in which the shipowner holds a 42 per cent stake, is no longer consolidated into accounts while Cool Carriers, in which it holds a 37.5 per cent stake, is. Hoegh suffered weaker markets in several of its shipping segments, reduced its car carrier fleet and experienced routine drydocking of liner vessels. Freight revenue rose to NKr1.01bn from NKr608m, while operating profit plunged to NKr47m from NKr101m. Pre-tax profit fell to NKr93m from NKr163. The shipowner forecast 1994 profit, after financial items, of NKr300m against NKr385m in 1993.</p>

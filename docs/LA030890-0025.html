			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARMENIAN GENOCIDE  </P> <P> Daniels apparently feels that America should not trifle with Turkey's  sensibilities by recognizing the Armenian genocide. This attitude of willful  neglect of moral responsibility for short-term political gain sells America's  soul for immediate foreign policy gratification. Daniels should not forget that  Turkey could easily go the way of Iran as a strategic ally while the Armenian  genocide will remain a historical fact forever.  </P> <P> SHANT AGAJANIAN  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

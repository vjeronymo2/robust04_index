			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Money Markets: French roller-coaster French futures had a frenetic day yesterday, initially heading downwards before a dramatic late rally, writes Stephanie Flanders. The September Pibor initially fell with the French currency, falling 17 basis points to reach a low of 92.93. There was clearly a sense that the pressure on the franc would slow the pace of interest cuts. Later, however, the mood changed dramatically, with September futures reaching a contract high of 122.28. The late gains were due to speculation about German interest rate cuts following the D-mark's recent strength against all the major European currencies. The shift was ironic, given that that the franc's morning fall had been partly triggered by the Bundesbank's decision to set a fixed unchanged fixed repo of 6.80 per cent at yesterday's tender, which was thought to lessen the prospects of lower German rates. The Bundesbank's decision was driven by a desire to regain control over money market rates. Traders said that they still expected the German central bank to cut its discount rate by half a percentage point at the first post-recess council meeting on August 26. 'This is a technical adjustment - the Bundesbank was in a difficult situation after the call money rate fell below the discount rate,' said Bank Julius Baer economist Gerhard Grebe. Sterling money markets were a good deal more tranquil on Tuesday compared to the previous day, since there was neither important economic news nor difficulties at the short end to stir the market. 'Unlike recent weeks, it was really a pretty ordinary August day,' said one trader. Most of a large Pounds 1.2bn shortage was removed early on in Bank of England operations which a number of traders described as 'easy-going' on both sides. As a result, overnight rates fell as low as 4 3/4 per cent through late-morning, before tightening a little in the afternoon to close at around 5 1/4 per cent. Overnights had risen slightly first thing, in a hangover from the exceptional difficulties of the previous day. Trading further out was similarly low-key. Yearly money closed up  1/16 at 5 5/8 per cent, while three month money closed unchanged. Sterling futures were more lively, with the September contract catching up a little of the ground which it has lost on December sterling in recent weeks. The September contract gained 5 basis points to close at 94.21, while December sterling was unchanged at 94.67.</p>

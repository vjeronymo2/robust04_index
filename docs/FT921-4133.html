			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Low aluminium prices forecast to halt capacity expansion ALUMINIUM SMELTER expansion plans are about to come to a halt, suggests the New York-based Spector Report in its latest survey of primary aluminium capacity. 'After 1994 almost all the planned capacity additions fall into the uncertain category,' it says. 'The industry cannot justify building new capacity until aluminium ingot prices rise to 75 cents a lb (Dollars 1,653 a tonne) and remain at that level for a sustained period of time. With prices under 75 cents a lb, cash flow generation would be insufficient to cover debt service, especially in the early years of a project. Last night the cash aluminium price closed at 57.6 cents a lb on the London Metal Exchange. The report suggests that at present prices it is 'next to impossible' to finance a new smelter project - including those government-sponsored projects in less developed countries where political risks are high. It points out that this year four smelters will start up, adding 1.1m tonnes to the industry's installed capacity base. In 1993 two projects will add another 167,000 tonnes. Two small additions will add 75,000 tonnes in 1994. In 1991 the industry outside the former eastern bloc countries added 3 per cent to capacity to take it to 15.6m tonnes, according to Spector. This year capacity will increase by 2.8 per cent to 16.1m tonnes. In 1993 capacity increases by another 2.3 per cent to 16.4m tonnes and in 1994 by 0.8 per cent. The report points out: 'Projects now in the very early planning phase due for completion in 1995 could add 4.6 per cent to industry capacity. This could be followed by capacity increases of 4.3 per cent and 6.2 per cent in 1996 and 1997 respectively. However, until ingot prices rise, most new projects planned for 1995 and after are graded as uncertain'. It suggests that, if ingot prices do not rise to at least 75 cents a lb by 1993, capacity, especially in Europe, may have to be closed.

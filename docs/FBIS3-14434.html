			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] AL-THAWRAH writes about the vitality, importance,  and positiveness of the Syrian stand vis-a-vis the peace  process, about Israel's repressive practices, and about the need  to deter Israel through firm international and American pressure  to restore the credibility of international legitimacy.    Under the headline "The Vitality of the Syrian Stand,"  AL-THAWRAH notes that Dennis Ross, the U.S. coordinator for the  peace process, has reiterated that the United States appreciates  Syria's vital and important role in the peace process. The  paper says: This new U.S. reiteration of the importance of the  Syrian role confirms the fact that there will be no peace in the  region without Syria and that Israel, through its intransigent  policy, maneuvers, and aggressive course, constitutes the only  obstacle to peace and the peace process.    AL-THAWRAH notes that there will be no peace without Syria.  The paper says: No further proof is necessary now that the  world has felt the importance of the Syrian role in launching  the peace process and rectifying its march and now that events  have proven that it is impossible to bypass this role or ignore  its importance with regard to continuing the peace process and  achieving its objective; namely, a just and comprehensive peace.    AL-THAWRAH says that the peace process, which began  approximately two and a half years ago in Madrid and which  continued over this long period of time, would not have begun or  continued had it not been for Syria's agreement on the U.S.  initiative and had it not been for its positive stand on all  efforts aimed at activating the peace process and providing  opportunities to achieve the required progress.    AL-THAWRAH adds: When the importance of the peace process  and the kind of peace to be achieved through this process were  addressed, Syria was the first to underscore this importance, to  abide by the peace process, and to adhere to the principles and  points of reference of this process. Syria's only condition for  the peace process and its objective is to see this process forms  an effective framework and an appropriate means to achieve a  real, lasting, just, and comprehensive peace based on the  principles of international legitimacy, as defined by President  Hafiz al-Asad in the Geneva summit -- the peace of the brave  that restores rights to their owners.    AL-THAWRAH also dwells on the policy and methods of  deception  and maneuvering that Israel has resorted to to prevent the peace  process from achieving its objectives on the basis of the Madrid  conference and the resolutions of international legitimacy.    Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: Reactivating the peace process  toward its objective requires, during the current stage, a clear  international stand in which the U.S. Administration assumes a  major role in exerting pressure on Israel to force it to abandon  its policy of maneuvering, extortion, and aggression and to  frankly accept the principles of the peace process, as defined  by the Madrid formula, and to implement its basic principle,  land for peace, without misinterpreting the content and the  principle of this formula.    In another commentary, AL-THAWRAH writes about the Israeli  massacre perpetrated against the Palestinian people inside the  holy Ibrahimi Mosque last month in which more than 400 were  either martyred or wounded. The paper says that this massacre  was only the beginning, and that it is another test balloon  through which the Tel Aviv rulers aimed to measure the  international community's reaction to and influence on the  course of events. AL-THAWRAH also notes the new massacre in  Hebron the day before yesterday, which coincided with the U.S.  Administration's endeavor and the moves of U.S. coordinator  Dennis Ross in the involved capitals to activate the peace  process and to give momentum to its obstructed process. The new  massacre also came in the wake of Security Council Resolution  904. In addition, Israel escalated its military attacks against  the cities and villages in southern Lebanon.    AL-THAWRAH notes that this does not hold out any hope that  Israel will succumb to the will of peace, that it will respect  its points of reference, that it will respect the resolutions of  international legitimacy and its charters, that it will abandon  racist terrorism, or that it will restore the Arab's usurped  lands and rights.    The paper emphasized the need to exert international  pressure  and to abandon quiet diplomacy in order to make the rulers of  Israel follow the right path and accept the requirements of a  just and comprehensive peace. The paper notes that Israel's  terrorist practices constitute a serious threat that needs a  firm and swift response from the international community and the  U.S. sponsor -- whose role, initiative, and interests are being  targeted -- to champion the international credibility and  resolutions that are still being violated openly so that Israel  will not remain above the laws of the international community  and above questioning and punishment.    Concluding, AL-THAWRAH calls for the resolutions of  international legitimacy to be implemented, for protection for  the citizens in the occupied territories to be secured, and for  a firm stand to be taken to curb Israeli aggression to force it  to withdraw from all occupied Arab territory.</p>

			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> CHINA, HUNGARY RETAIN TRADE STATUS  </P> <P> President Bush today granted a one-year extension of trade benefits to China  and Hungary, based on their performance on human rights.  </P> <P> In a notice to Congress, Bush said he is keeping the two countries on the list  of nations that enjoy the "most favored nation" trading status.  </P> <P> The designation protects these nations from higher tariffs that the United  States imposes on countries it deems to have poor records on human rights and  emigration.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union, for example, does not have preferred trade status, but Bush  has offered to grant that designation if Moscow formalizes its relaxed  emigration policy.  </P></p>

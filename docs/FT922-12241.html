			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Survey of Seattle and Puget Sound (2): A flying start for prosperity - The long-term economic outlook is still reasonably bright THE economy of Seattle and the Puget Sound has been the envy of many other US cities for the past few years, as the region outpaced most of America during the boom years of the 1980s and proved more resilient to the national recession which set in last year. The long-term outlook is still reasonably bright, but the city has no grounds for complacency: the local economy has been soft for the past year, with Washington state growth barely positive and employment stagnant, while growth prospects over the next two years also look fragile. 'Many local businesses are noticing slower growth, and hiring plans are quite modest,' notes Mr John Mitchell, chief economist at US Bank. 'If 1991 was a very slow year, 1992 may not be a whole lot better for many Washington businesses, with employment expected to increase by only 2 per cent." Fast growth, moreover, has brought with it problems: a surge in migration of new residents to the area in the late 1980s from outside Washington has pushed up inflation and housing prices, and has led to much greater traffic and other environmental problems. Seattle's economic buoyancy is a new phenomenon. Traditionally, the Northwestern US, and Puget Sound in particular, have tended to suffer a steeper decline in a recession than other parts of the US. This was certainly the case in the 1981-82 downturn. But the 1980s brought a spurt of investment in new industries in the region  -notably high technology computer software, led by sector leader Microsoft, and bio-technology - which local economists say have gone some way to protect it from its traditional reliance on Boeing, the aircraft manufacturer and largest local employer, as well as timber logging. Another significant positive factor this time around has been the relative buoyancy of the agricultural sector in the Washington hinterland. All this said, local boosters are in danger of overstressing Seattle's diversification. For the city owes much of its 1980s' prosperity to a rapid expansion by Boeing, and it owes much of its present buoyancy to the size of the company's order book: at around Dollars 90bn this represents well over three years' of civilian aircraft sales. Indeed, a study carried out for Boeing in 1989 by three independent regional economists argued that, with 15 per cent of Washington state jobs linked to the company, the economy was no less dependent on Boeing than it was 30 years before. While a lower percentage of the workforce worked directly for the company, one Boeing job created 2.8 others in the region, compared to 1.8 in the 1970s. Older, more guarded Seattle businessmen still recall the two 'Boeing Busts' of recent decades - in the early 1970s,when the number of the company's employees in Washington state plunged from 102,000 to just 41,000 three years later, and a lesser contraction at the start of the 1980s. Boeing's local employment is now more than 100,000 again, and its long-term outlook seems good, given the expected growth in world aviation over the next 20 years. The next few years are more uncertain. Although Boeing is planning to trim some 6,500 Washington jobs by the end of this year because of reduced defence spending and slower demand for one type of civilian aircraft, the company insists its overall order backlog is unaffected. It expects to deliver a record number of commercial jets in 1992. Yet some aerospace experts fear it could suffer a sharply reduced demand for deliveries in 1993 and 1994. And if that happened, history might record that Seattle did not so much escape the 1991 recession, but merely lagged it. 'The best we can hope for,' says Mr Robert Chase, research director at Pacific Northwest Executive magazine, 'is that the aerospace sector will remain resilient and stable.' Certainly, the build-up at Boeing in the 1980s will not be repeated during this decade. And this, coupled with other factors, suggests that Seattle's growth during the 1990s will tend to mirror, or slightly outpace, that of the nation, rather than exceed it dramatically. 'There is growing awareness,' says Mr Chase, 'that the boom years of the late 1980s are over and the 1990s will be essentially different.' Boeing apart, one of the main factors making for less frenetic growth in the 1990s will be a host of environmental initiatives. Many of these are local, prompted by Northwestern concern over the impact of fast development in the past decade, but others have assumed a national character, most notably the battle between environmentalists and the timber industry over the fate of the Northern Spotted Owl. A complex tangle of court battles and government regulations has sharply reduced logging in spotted owl habitats throughout the forests of the Northwest over the past few years. Whatever the outcome of these confrontations, it is already clear that they will mean a perpetual slowdown in logging activity, and a loss of many jobs in the industry. While the timber industry is located for the most part outside the greater Seattle area, this reduction will nevertheless have a substantial knock-on effect on the city, given its role as the region's main trading and shopping centre. And another conservation issue, which could have an even greater impact on the regional economy, is looming just behind the spotted owl: efforts to preserve salmon in the Columbia river system could mean a reduction in hydro-electric power and a sharp increase in local electricity prices. Yet Seattle has many other forces working in its favour. It has avoided the boom-bust commercial property cycle which has hit the East Coast and California so hard, and the slowing of the boom gives it the chance to address the structural problems in the housing and transport markets which have come with growth. While its traditional industries may see relatively slow growth, or decline during the 1990s, a wide range of service industries will provide new job opportunities. For Seattle's exhilarating physical surroundings, and its reputation as one of the best places in America to do business, means that it is an attractive place for mobile, knowledge-based businesses to put down roots. 'We are in the thoughtware business up here,' says Mr Bill Stafford, executive director of the Trade Development Alliance of Seattle. Indeed, Seattle's University of Washington boasts more US federal Government research grants than any other American public university. This, in turn, will attract new immigrants and increase the size of the local consumer market. Washington is expected to have among the top five population growth rates in the US through the 1990s. Leading growth industries in the service sector will include computer software, bio-technology, tourism, fashion design and environmental services. (Seattle's clean-up of Lake Washington, formerly a local cesspool, in the 1960s, was not only a local political landmark but also a spur to the environmental business.) International trade has been crucial to the Seattle economy since the days when it was the main entrepot for the Yukon goldrush, and its importance will increase over the next decade on the back of global economic integration: the ports of Seattle and Tacoma and the region's Sea-Tac airport are equidistant from London and Tokyo. Closer to home, local politicians and businessmen are throwing considerable energy behind the idea of a greater Northwestern regional economy. Dubbed 'Cascadia', this would incorporate the four Northwestern US states and Alaska, together with the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Alberta.  ---------------------------------------------- Location  ---------------------------------------------- The city of Seattle is located in the state of Washington on Puget Sound, 113 miles from the US-Canadian border.

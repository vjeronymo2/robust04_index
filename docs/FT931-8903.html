			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / British Airways finds the glory days are over: UK airline blames sterling's depreciation but fares wars have hit margins The squalid story of intrigue and dirty tricks against Virgin Atlantic has kept British Airways in the headlines this year. But after reporting an 80 per cent drop in its third quarter pre-tax profits, the emphasis yesterday shifted to how the world's 'favourite' and most profitable airline is coping with the current harsh realities of the industry. Although the fall in profits was not as bad as some City analysts had anticipated, it raises the possibility that the corporate darling of the Thatcher years is losing some of its glamour. Sir Colin Marshall, who took over as chairman from Lord King this month, blamed much of the fall in profits on the depreciation of sterling. But BA has not escaped the fierce fares wars that are cutting airline profit margins, and the down-trading which has seen first and business class passengers moving down the cabin to cheaper seats. On the plus side, BA expects the benefits of the weaker pound on its international revenues to show through in coming months. Sterling's devaluation had an almost instantaneous negative effect on half the airline's operating costs, while the foreign revenue benefits will show through later because most tickets are booked in advance. The airline continues to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry; it operates in profit at a time when most of its competitors are swimming in red ink ('I think the most important thing is that we made a profit,' Sir Colin said yesterday); it has invested heavily in other airlines to strengthen its global reach; it continues to cut costs; and it believes it will be in a strong position to take advantage of the recovery when it comes. But for all this, the 1990s are likely to be a fundamentally different decade for BA compared with the 1980s. BA was among the first airlines to address the problem of costs and to introduce aggressively the commercial techniques of retailing. It was also the first to recover from the Gulf war crisis. But now Lord King has gone and with him perhaps some of the airline's considerable political influence, which risks being further eroded by political reaction to the Virgin affair. BA and Virgin are still trying to come to a settlement and bury the hatchet for good. The saga has left scars on BA's image and internal morale. Allegations of a fraud at BA's property maintenance department, which surfaced last weekend, have not helped clear the atmosphere. 'It suggests that management controls are not all they are made out to be,' said one analyst. Although the airline industry has traditionally lived through 'boom and bust' cycles, there is no guarantee that the eventual upturn in the current cycle will be as robust as previous ones. 'A structural change is taking place in the revenue outlook for the industry,' says Mr Chris Tarry, aviation analyst at Kleinwort Benson. 'There is likely to be continued pressure on revenues and fare yields are unlikely to recover fully when the cycle comes up again.' BA's competitors, which were slow to react during the last decade, are now also scrambling to cut costs and stitch up international alliances to strengthen their market presence. BA is also absorbing a series of investments in other airlines, including USAir, Qantas, the former operations of Dan-Air, as well as some smaller European airline ventures. With Dan-Air, the challenge will be to turn loss-making activities at London's Gatwick airport into profit. The first step has been to convert the Gatwick-based European operations into a lower-cost airline. All these operations have been grouped at the airport's North terminal and last week BA launched a Pounds 4m marketing campaign to promote it. As for the investments in Qantas and USAir, the benefits will not be immediate and could take as long as one or two years to emerge, according to some analysts. Moreover, the new Clinton administration, under intense pressure from the big three US carriers (American Airlines, United Airlines, and Delta Air Lines), may try to block the USAir deal. The question is whether BA will be able to take full advantage of the access it will gain into USAir's domestic network in America without having to give up some ground at its Heathrow base to other US carriers. 'I can't see BA's protection under the existing US-UK aviation agreement lasting for ever,' the head of a large European airline has said. A further sign of the new competitive pressures facing BA came yesterday from the airline's current bete noir. Mr Richard Branson said he would step up his challenge to BA at Heathrow by starting a service to New York's Newark airport at the end of next month, adding a fourth long-haul destination out of BA's home base.</p>

			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / The Clinton-Yeltsin Summit: Japanese come into line on aid LINGERING doubts about the extent of Japan's commitment to the multilateral Russian aid process have been resolved. According to the White House spokesman, President Clinton spoke on Friday to Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister. Mr Clinton then told President Yeltsin in their first round of talks that the US backed Japan's claim to the Kurile islands and that Mr Miyazawa has assured him of Japan's strong support for the Group of Seven and bilateral assistance. This represents no shift in official policies. The US has always supported Japan's claim to the Kuriles, occupied by the Soviet Union at the end of the last World War, while Japan, its reservations about the efficacy of large-scale assistance to Russia notwithstanding, has never publicly threatened not to take part in the multinational effort. But it has been important for Mr Clinton, both for his own domestic purposes and in his presentation to Mr Yeltsin, to demonstrate that the leading industrialised nations are willing to act in concert to help Russian economic reform. Thus the US side in Vancouver emphasised that both Britain and Canada had on Friday announced increased bilateral contributions, with expectations that the rest of the G7 countries will have fallen into line by the time the foreign and finance ministers meet in Tokyo on April 14. Mr Miyazawa's commitment, as conveyed to Mr Clinton, appears designed to satisfy US criticism about the extent of Japan's willingness to help bilaterally and, as current chairman of the G7, to ensure the success of the Tokyo session. The US is not pushing for early permanent Russian membership of the G7, which would have disconcerted Japan. Mr Clinton mentioned, without disclosing details, that other countries outside the G7 would be approached. His officials have implied earlier that Middle Eastern nations, most obviously Saudi Arabia, would be asked to come forward. On the domestic political side, the spokesman also announced that Congressmen Richard Gephardt and Robert Michel, Democratic and Republican leaders in the House of Representatives, would go to Moscow this week for their own look at the state of Russian reform. Even though the US bilateral assistance proposals are supposed to include no 'new money', the congressional debate about an appropriate US response is gathering steam. Also the Russian side has raised one issue, in particular, which falls within congressional competence - its discontent with the 20-year-old Jackson-Vanik amendment that explicitly linked US trade and aid to emigration policies, especially as they affect Jews. Russia, claiming emigration has been liberalised, would like Mr Clinton to seek a permanent waiver from the amendment, which has been automatically renewed every year. US officials said there were still 'some problems' with the status of a few former political dissidents. The amendment was not the only 'irritant,' as the US spokesman called it, raised by Mr Yeltsin. He also complained about the continuing Cocom restrictions on technology trade with the former Soviet bloc and a recent collision between US and Russian submarines, for which incident Mr Clinton expressed regret.</p>

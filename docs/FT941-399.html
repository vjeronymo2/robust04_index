			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Next It has been a long and rocky road from the sprawl of Gardening Next and Next's neighbourly newsagents to the focused clothing retailer with net cash of Pounds 88m and profits of Pounds 74m. That transformation owes a great deal to the management team led by Lord Wolfson and Mr David Jones. Still, even they acknowledge their good fortune in hitting trouble early in recession, while there was still a market for surplus retail sites. There is also a sparkle of magic about Next's survival. The brand has remained strong, in contrast to would-be competitors like Principles and Richards, where the red ink still flows freely. Next is in the happy position where it can avoid the blight of semi-permanent discounting, maintaining high margins and high sales volumes from limited space. Its rapidly mounting cash pile suggests that the company is about to diversify. Yet if its cautious US experiment is any guide, the money will not burn a hole in management's pocket. Cash gives flexibility and Next can still grow in the UK by moving stores to larger premises. The 120 per cent increase in the dividend also shows that there is still plenty for shareholders to look forward to.</p>

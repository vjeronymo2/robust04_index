			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Car imports surge breaks trend MOTOR industry exports have begun to falter, while imports are again climbing rapidly, according to figures released yesterday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, Kevin Done writes. Export earnings for automotive products stagnated in the second quarter of this year at Pounds 2.87bn following a 6 per cent year-on-year increase in the first quarter. By contrast, the value of imported automotive goods jumped by 18 per cent in the second quarter to Pounds 3.7bn following a 12 per cent year-on-year increase in the first three months. As a result, the overall motor-industry trade deficit in the second quarter more than tripled to Pounds 834m compared with the corresponding period a year ago, while the deficit in the first half more than doubled to Pounds 1.37bn. The rapid deterioration of the motor industry's foreign-trade performance in 1992 reverses the marked improvement of recent years. In the final three months of 1991 the industry achieved the short-lived breakthrough of recording a quarterly trade surplus for the first time since the early 1980s. The value and volume of imports of new cars jumped by 20 per cent in the second quarter from the same period a year ago, in spite of the absence of any recovery in UK demand for new vehicles, with the value of car imports totalling Pounds 1.85bn. The surge in car imports has coincided with a serious reversal in the trend of UK exports of new cars in the second quarter, with a 9 per cent fall in value to Pounds 959m from the same period a year ago. This reversed a 3 per cent year-on-year rise in the first three months. The decline in the volume of car exports in the second quarter was even more acute than the drop in value, with a year-on-year fall of 18 per cent. The volume of car shipments in the first half at 289,833 was 11 per cent lower than a year ago. Figures released by the motor industry yesterday show that Ford, the UK new-car market leader, gained ground modestly in the first 20 days of August, the most important sales month for new cars. Registrations of new Ford cars rose by 2.7 per cent to 68,000, while overall new-car registrations increased by only 0.9 per cent to 290,550. Vauxhall, which is in second place, suffered a 2.4 per cent fall in sales to 45,000. Rover was overtaken by the Peugeot group of France, which includes Citroen, and has fallen into fourth place with a 3.3 per cent drop in sales volume. It captured 11.2 per cent of sales of new cars compared with 12.2 per cent by the Peugeot group. The Citroen marque has emerged as the star performer with a 31.2 per cent jump in sales to capture a share of 4.8 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK MOTOR TRADE (POUNDS M) January - June  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Exports  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                         1992           1991 Cars                                   1,946          2,015 Comm. vehicles                           529            429 Parts and   accessories                          2,568          2,370 Others*                                  596            661  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Imports  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cars                                   3,414          2,925 Comm. vehicles                           396            303 Parts and   accessories                          2,913          2,618 Others*                                  282            244  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Trade balance  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cars                                  -1,468           -910 Comm. vehicles                          +133           +126 Parts and   accessories                           -345           -248 Others*                                 +314           +417  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total balance                         -1,366           -617  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Others includes agricultural tractors, dumpers, trailers, caravans, industrial works trucks and freight containers.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and Customs and Excise  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

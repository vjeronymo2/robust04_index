			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / International Company News: WMC tries to leave the worst of bad weeks behind it - How a judge's ruling in Nova Scotia has affected the company THE THIRD week of December 1987 is one which Western Mining (WMC), the Australian resources group, would prefer to forget. Mr Hugh Morgan, managing director, had a punishing schedule during that week as he pursued several acquisitions aimed at giving WMC a secure foothold in the North American mining industry. None of the assets that WMC bought in its Dollars 450m shopping expedition has turned into a producing mine. A judge in Nova Scotia has severely criticised the 'callous disregard' with which WMC handled one of the takeovers. Mr Justice Merlin Nunn ordered WMC to pay damages and costs, expected to exceed CDollars 10m (USDollars 7.7m), to the president and six former directors of Seabright Resources, one of the targets of the 1987 acquisition spree. WMC will appeal. Seabright was an ambitious Nova Scotia exploration company, boasting in mid-1987 that it was becoming 'one of Canada's greatest gold producers'. It aimed to have four mines in operation by 1989. A promising area appeared to be a deposit known as Beaver Dam. Studies pointed to large reserves and a high grade. But in the months leading up to WMC's takeover offer in December 1987, doubts began to surface. News of these doubts reached WMC after the CDollars 92m deal to buy Seabright was completed in February 1988. Within three weeks, a WMC official was describing Beaver Dam as 'just bloody hopeless'. A year later, WMC halted Seabright's operations and wrote off its investment. WMC sued Seabright's president, Mr Terence Coughlan, for fraud, negligence and insider trading. It levelled similar allegations against the other directors. However, Mr Coughlan and his colleagues counter-sued the Australian company with allegations ranging from abuse of process, to a malicious conspiracy to deprive them of indemnity insurance coverage. Upholding the directors' claims, the Nova Scotia court ruled in essence that WMC failed to do adequate homework on Seabright in its eagerness to cloak its intentions and to shut out competitive bids. According to the judge, the WMC team 'cannot deny there was public information to alert them that there were problems, as they were aware of sampling problems, they were aware that Beaver Dam had suffered a setback and that Seabright, through Coughlan, was over-promotional and lacking the technical skills necessary'. He said there was no evidence to suggest any intention among the Seabright directors to commit fraud. They gave the impression of being reluctant sellers. The judge was scathing about WMC's conduct after it discovered it had made a disappointing investment. He said the Australian company acted 'with callous disregard of the rights of (Mr Coughlan and the other Seabright directors) and a determination to cause them injury'. Although Mr Coughlan and a Seabright vice-president remained on the payroll for some time after the takeover, WMC never asked about nor confronted them with any of the information offered as evidence during the trial. The judge also criticised WMC for serving its original claim on the directors one day after the expiry of their indemnity insurance, without providing advance warning to the insurer. 'The intention to sue was known, the existence of the policy was known, and copies of the policy were in hand,' he said. Noting that 'the predominant purpose of (WMC's) litigation was to injure (Mr Coughlan and his colleagues),' the judge said that they 'have been grievously injured in their reputation at large in the business community and in their personal lives.' Hence his decision to award substantial damages. The judgment raises wider questions about the secrecy and single-mindedness with which such deals are pursued. The judge dismissed much of Mr Morgan's evidence as unreliable, but noted that his lapses were perhaps understandable in view of his hectic travel schedule that week and his failure to keep notes. The money involved is relatively small, but the judgment is a blow to WMC, not least because it draws attention to a period described by Mr Morgan as one in which the group's 'toe was stubbed'. When it embarked on its North American spending spree, WMC had cash reserves of ADollars 370m (USDollars 264.3m), backed by ADollars 840m from a successful rights issue. The gold market was rising and the global stock markets' collapse in October 1987 left the group well-placed to pick up bargains for cash. The collapse of its North American strategy was a blow to WMC. It has begun to flex its muscles again, notably through the USDollars 240m purchase from BP of the 49 per cent of the Olympic Dam copper/uranium/gold/silver mine it did not own. The group's share price has risen since the Canadian judgment, suggesting the Seabright debacle is regarded by investors as old news. Mr Morgan will be hoping it stays that way.</p>

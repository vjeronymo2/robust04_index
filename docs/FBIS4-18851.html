			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed LVE (CET): "Crisis -- Emergency Aid for </F> Rwanda"]    [Excerpt] Brussels, 11 Apr (BELGA) -- "The European  Commission (EC) unblocked emergency aid worth ECU500,000 (20  million Belgian francs) to help the victims of the fresh wave of  interethnic violence that is sweeping through the country,"  announced a EC spokesman on Monday [11 April].    This aid would go toward the dispatching of medical and  surgical equipment to be placed at the disposal of teams of  Belgian "Medecins Sans Frontieres" [Doctors Wtihout Borders] who  are already there on the ground.    "This equipment was already sent on its way Saturday from  Rotterdam airport," specified the spokesman. "In fact, it would  be the first of several consignments of emergency aid which  would follow in the days or weeks to come," he added. [passage  omitted]</p>

Also the pipeline  that will carry the natural gas from that country to Europe will  pass through Turkey.    BOTAS [Pipeline and Petroleum Transport Corporation]  Director  General Hayrettin Uzun held a news conference in Ankara where he  said that with the contract, Turkey will no longer be dependent  on only one source for its natural gas. Also, he said, the  contract will supply our demand for natural gas.    Uzun said that BOTAS wants to be included in the consortium  that is being set up to build the pipeline that will deliver the  natural gas from Turkmenistan to Western Europe. An agreement  will be signed on our participation in the committee, he said.    Also, talks are under way to increase the 6 billion cubic  meters of natural gas Turkey buys from Russia per year to 10.5  billion cubic meters.</p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / East Germans warned strike could cost 100,000 jobs UP TO 100,000 workers could lose their jobs in eastern Germany if IG Metall, Germany's engineering union, calls an all-out strike in support of large pay increases in the region, Mr Klaus Murmann, president of the country's employers' association, warned yesterday. At the same time, he asked IG Metall to return, without preconditions, to negotiations because a strike 'now would be at the wrong time, inappropriate, and destructive'. However, IG Metall, which has already held warning strikes in eastern Germany's steel, metal and electrical sectors, wants the employers' associations to rescind a decision which ended a contract equalising eastern and western German wages by April 1994. Under the terms of that contract, eastern German steel employees were due this year a 21 per cent pay increase and the metal and electrical sectors 26 per cent. The union, unsure about the extent of its support for an all-out strike in eastern Germany, has accused the employers of illegally breaking the contract. It claims the employers want to destroy the principle of collective wage bargaining which has shaped industrial relations in Germany for five decades. Mr Murmann yesterday denied both charges, saying 'we uphold the principle of collective wage bargaining.' He also stressed that employers were entitled to invoke a revision clause in the March 1991 agreement, allowing them to end the contract because of changed economic circumstances in eastern and western Germany. He said heavy pay increases, apart from economic reasons, could not be sustained in view of the fact that other sectors of the eastern German economy have settled for pay increases of around 9 per cent, in line with the annual inflation rate in the five eastern German states.</p>

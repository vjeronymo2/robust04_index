			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Budget cuts will probably not force elimination of the ranger horse patrol in  Yosemite National Park, Rep. Richard H. Lehman (D-Sanger) said. But in a letter  to park officials, Lehman, whose district includes a part of the park, said he  believes the park can use entrance fees to finance the ranger horse patrol.  Park officials said earlier they would have to disband the ranger horse patrol  because of funding problems. At that time, park officials said a new law  prohibited park entrance fees from being used to fund the horse patrol.  However, Lehman said in his letter that he believes park officials  misinterpreted the new law.  </P></p>

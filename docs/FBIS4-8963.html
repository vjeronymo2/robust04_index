			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lajos Horvath, cochairman of the Hungarian </F> Justice and Life Party, and Ferenc Kulin, parliamentary group  leader and campaign chief of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, by  Janos Bercsi; place and date not given: "According to Kulin,  the MIEP is After the MDF's Voters -- The MDF Would Not Govern  Together With Csurka"]    [Text] If the largest government party is indeed able to  break with [former Prime Minister] Jozsef Antall's former  policies, then we can again talk about a possible coalition  cooperation, Lajos Horvath says. Serious political forces do  not enter into coalition agreements with parties that profess  extremist principles, Ferenc Kulin says on the other hand.    Istvan Csurka, co-chairman of the Hungarian Justice and Life  Party [MIEP], said at a recent political rally that, in a given  situation, he also considers a coalition with the Hungarian  Democratic Forum [MDF] possible, provided that the MDF changes  its political views. However, up to now, MDF Chairman Lajos Fur  and MDF Managing Chairman Sandor Lezsak have both distanced  themselves from the MIEP, because of Csurka's outbursts and  extreme political views. We interviewed Lajos Horvath on the  MIEP's coalition intentions.    [Bercsi] The MIEP has recognized that the MDF-liberal bloc  that came to power in 1990 is still holding out, but in the  current situation the MDF is still less of an opponent because  we have nothing to talk about with the liberals. The core of  the popular-national tendency that was once grouped around  Csurka is still present in the MDF. If the largest government  party is indeed able to break with the former policies of Jozsef  Antall, then we can again talk about possible coalition  cooperation.    [Bercsi] Lezsak denied that he and Csurka had conducted  lengthy talks at the apartment of Sandor Csoori [chairman of the  World Federation of Hungarians] on two occasions in recent weeks.    [Horvath] I also asked Csurka and he denied news of these  meetings. We have not held any kind of coordination talks with  MDF leaders.    [Bercsi] On what conditions would the MIEP be willing to  work with the MDF?    [Horvath] The Ministry of International Economic Relations  should be turned into some kind of top ministry, which would  also carry out the work of the Foreign Affairs Ministry. The  MIEP does not agree with [Foreign Minister] Geza Jeszenszky's  statements or the Hungarian foreign policy represented by him.  In our view, the foreign minister should take our economic  interests into consideration in our foreign relations. In  addition to this, we would give much more freedom to the future  representatives of Hungarian foreign policy. It is  indispensable to change privatization fundamentally in Hungary,  for which Minister Without Portfolio Tamas Szabo is unsuitable.  We consider it important to change education because the  awareness of being Hungarian has virtually been erased from the  country's young people.    [Kulin] I can only see Csurka's "offer" as a campaign trick.  The MIEP has no other possibility to build its party but to win  as many members from the MDF as it can. This intention has been  foiled, so Csurka is now forced to try to blur the boundaries  that he himself set up! It is clear that Csurka is still trying  to win the less determined MDF sympathizers over, people who are  not clear about relations between the MDF and the MIEP. These  people might as well believe, listening to Csurka's statements  that, if the MDF and the MEIP join in a coalition in the future,  then why not vote for Csurka? The only unfortunate factor is  that the votes cast for the MIEP will probably be wasted because  there seems to be little chance for the MIEP to reach the 5  percent necessary to get into Parliament.    [Bercsi] Would the MDF accept the MIEP's approach if it got  into Parliament?    [Kulin] The foreign policy programs of the leading Hungarian  political parties -- including, naturally, the MDF -- all intend  to form optimal relations with the Eastern Central European  countries and, in addition to this, integration into Western  Europe is the primary goal. However, the MIEP is a political  obstacle and a drawback to this, so I believe that truly serious  political forces will not enter into coalition agreements with  parties that profess extremist principles. At the same time,  Csurka is ignoring all written and verbal rules of political  ethics in all respects: For a whole year, in a most merciless  fashion, he has been attacking the MDF's foreign and domestic  policies that had been formed by Antall.</p>

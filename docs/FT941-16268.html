			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / UK Company News: US behind rise at Ellis &amp; Everard Ellis &amp; Everard, the chemicals distributor, yesterday reversed the downward trend of recent years with a better than expected 31 per cent jump in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.5m to Pounds 8.5m. From earnings per share for the six months to October 31 ahead by 31 per cent to 7.2p (5.5p) the interim dividend is being raised by 9 per cent to 2.45p (2.25p). The profits rise was fuelled by a stronger dollar and an underlying recovery in volume and margins, particularly in the US. Group turnover was 11 per cent higher at Pounds 211.5m (Pounds 190.1m). Mr Peter Wood, chief executive, said Ellis, which has suffered in the last two years due to recession and unsuccessful diversification, had spent the last 12 months sorting out 'a lot of problem areas'. These included the previously lossmaking Spanish operation which had been merged with a separate company in March, leaving Ellis with an 11 per cent stake, and the pools chemicals distributor, acquired in 1990. The pools business suffered a Pounds 100,000 loss, but Mr Wood said rationalisation left him hopeful of an improvement next year. The Spanish activity, now included as an associate, contributed profits of Pounds 100,000. The good news came from the US, where operating profits rose by 27 per cent in dollar terms to Dollars 7.1m (Dollars 5.6m) on sales 3 per cent ahead to Dollars 182.9m (Dollars 177.5m). Exchange rates contributed Pounds 500,000 to pre-tax profits. Mr Wood said the US businesses had benefited from improved buying power and rationalisation. This helped overcome weak chemical prices, down by about 8 per cent. In the UK operating profits were 13 per cent higher to Pounds 5.3m (Pounds 4.7m) on sales 6.5 per cent up to Pounds 77.1m (Pounds 72.4m). Ellis also announced the Pounds 1.2m acquisition of Ronmar Plastics, a distributor of polymers for Du Pont. Mr Wood said that the purchase, along with two long-term distribution and packaging contracts also announced yesterday, would be 'producing meaningful numbers' by 1994-95. COMMENT The shares rose just 4p on the results to 241p, reflecting the company's determination to rein in any over-excitement. Mr Wood warned that while the second half gave no cause for concern so far, the first half's success did not imply any departure from the normal trading pattern of 55 per cent of the year's profits in the first six months and 45 per cent in the second. Nevertheless these were good results, and the deals announced yesterday show Ellis is following a sensible longer-term strategy. Full-year forecasts are for between Pounds 15.5m and Pounds 16m. The prospective p/e of 18 leaves Ellis with events looking up in the short term. However, longer-term punters are likely to be tempted by the yield and a substantially more attractive outlook next year.</p>

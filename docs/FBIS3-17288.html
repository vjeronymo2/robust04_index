			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze by </F> unidentified correspondent on 22 March; place not given --  recorded]    [Text] [The interview follows a news item on Butrus Ghali's  report submitted to the UN Security Council on the inexpediency  of sending peacekeeping forces to Abkhazia]    [Announcer] In this connection Eduard Shevardnadze yesterday  gave an interview to Georgian television. Here is the recording.    [Shevardnadze] I do not think that we are talking about the  Security Council here, I mean the document that was circulated  by the secretary general in the Security Council. As for the  Security Council, it has not convened and has not discussed the  report.    Now, about the document itself. I read it this evening [22  March], and to be absolutely honest, I did not want to comment  in detail because the forecast is such that...[Shevardnadze  pauses]...there are some clauses and regulations that do not  quite inspire hope but there are some promising ones too.  Therefore, I am for studying every possibility and weighing up  every word and only then should we assess this document. Thus,  we must not be guided by the first impression. This document is  more profound than it seems to be, although, as I said, it is  not hope inspiring.    [Correspondent] Did parliament's recent decision on Abkhazia  influence this document? Why do you think this document was  drawn up at all?    [Shevardnadze] I would say that there was no immediate  influence but the fact remains that the Abkhaz side used this  instance for wrecking negotiations. Adopting a decision  according to clause 6 at the Security Council, there must be,  first, consent from both sides, and second, some progress during  negotiations. The delegations were about to reach this point,  and if not in New York, then at the next round, some progress  would probably be reached either in connection with the return  of refugees or any other issue. But they [the Abkhaz side] used  it [parliament's decision] and it had a considerable influence  [on wrecking negotiations].    I said after my arrival from New York that a U.S.  representative in the Security Council told me that this  decision was wrong. According to the contents, everything is  correct, but when the negotiations were being held and the issue  was being discussed in the Security Council, it played a serious  and negative role.    [Correspondent] Lastly, do you think that after [words  indistinct] time come to refuse a peaceful settlement of this  conflict, to be more accurate, has it turned out that the course  for a peaceful settlement of the conflict is fruitless?    [Shevardnadze] It is a very difficult question. The answer  will probably be the following: In order to come to the  conclusion that the course -- with the interference of the  United Nations, the United Nation's participation, and Russia's  mediation to settle the conflict in a political manner -- turned  out to be unsuccessful and failed, it is premature and hasty to  draw such a conclusion. Neither does this report give grounds  for drawing such a conclusion. All the more so, it is good that  we recorded it [the UN Security Council session] and television  viewers could see and listen to every speech by the members of  the Security Council; there was total unanimity for the  viewpoint that Georgia needs help and that the peacekeeping  forces must be sent in. Therefore, we must wait for the  Security Council session before we jump to serious conclusions.  Maybe one session will not be enough.    Those who know the principle of how the UN works, they will  agree with me that it fails to adopt operational decisions --  that the United Nations finds it difficult. I think that  Georgia did everything it could, that is, using ways for a  peaceful settlement in every possible way and every channel. I  said in my Monday interview that there are three ways of sending  in peacekeeping troops; classical ways; [words indistinct] the  second variant is the Russian contingent under the UN banner,  which is a bit doubtful although Yeltsin and I agree on this  variant in principle. Another variant is [word indistinct] and  Russian contingent on the basis of a bilateral agreement. These  are the variants and probably it will take some time. I stress  that UN participation and Russian mediation -- this course has  not yet been fully exhausted.</p>

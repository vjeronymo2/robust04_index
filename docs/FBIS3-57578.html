			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On Wednesday night [26 January], the second unit of  Lithuania's Ignalina nuclear power plant was shut down.    This nuclear power plant's information department told  Interfax that after the first unit was switched off on January  18 following a water leek, the second unit worked at a capacity  of 1300 megawatts.    The same source announced that the second unit had been shut  down following the failure of the manual control system for the  reactor's stages (a button on the control board went out of  operation).    The administration of the nuclear power plant stated that  despite those malfunctions, the system of automatic control and  the safety equipment remained in a working condition.    The reactor was shut down according to the safety  regulations. The radiation situation did not change, says the  administration's official press release.    Repair work has been done already and preparations are  underway for putting the reactor back into operation, presumably  on Friday.    In view of the 2nd unit's stoppage, Lithuania experienced a  shortage of energy on Thursday, Lithuania's Deputy Minister for  Energy Saulius Kutas told Interfax.</p>

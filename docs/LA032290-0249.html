			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 2 METAL RODS PUT IN BACK OF GLORIA ESTEFAN  </P> <P> Surgeons today implanted metal rods in pop singer Gloria Estefan's back, broken  when a tractor-trailer rig plowed into her tour bus.  </P> <P> The operation on the lead singer of the Miami Sound Machine was expected to  last three or four hours.  </P> <P> Before the operation began about 8:30 a.m., doctors at the Hospital for Joint  Diseases in Manhattan said that the 32-year-old singer's chances of recovery  are "excellent," and that the risk of paralysis is "exceedingly rare."  </P> <P> Surgeons explained that the surgery was designed to correct "subluxation," an  instability of the spine between her middle and lower back that can include  fractures.  </P> <P> Estefan, who was injured Tuesday when the tractor-trailer rig hit her tour bus  on snowy Interstate 380 in the Pocono Mountains in Tobyhanna, Pa., was flown  Wednesday by helicopter to New York from a hospital in Scranton, Pa., where she  was taken after the crash.  </P> <P> Dr. Michael Neuwirth, the New York hospital's chief of spinal surgery, who will  implant the two 8-inch rods at the junction between Estefan's middle and lower  back, said Wednesday that her prognosis was "excellent."  </P> <P> "The risk of paralysis is exceedingly rare," Neuwirth said.  </P></p>

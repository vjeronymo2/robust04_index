			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLIPPERS TAKE STEP BACKWARD;  </P> <P> PRO BASKETBALL: AFTER OPENING WITH TWO IMPRESSIVE VICTORIES AT HOME, THEY GET  BLOWN OUT BY THE WARRIORS AT OAKLAND, 130-109.  </P> <P> The Clippers found the other side of the mountain Tuesday night, the flip side  to the emotional summit they had reached with their 20-point comeback victory  two nights earlier.  </P> <P> This time, they played Golden State tough for the first half and then took a  header. Being outscored by 11 in the third quarter was a start, and this time  the Warriors made sure they finished it, cruising to a 130-109 victory before  15,015 at the Oakland Coliseum Arena.  </P> <P> "Sunday's game was in the back of all our minds," said Tim Hardaway, who had 12  points, 13 assists and six steals for the Warriors. "If we were up by 20 this  time, we were going to keep the pressure on. We were just doing things tonight  that we should have done in L.A."  </P> <P> It didn't help, of course, that the Warriors were adding by threes -- four  consecutive possessions midway through the final quarter that resulted in  either a three-point basket (by Rod Higgins) or a three-point play (by Tom  Tolbert, Sarunas Marciulionis and Tyrone Hill).  </P> <P> That might have been more spectacular had it really mattered, but they already  led, 106-85, when the string started. When it ended, the Clippers were 2-1,  with the Detroit Pistons up tonight at the Sports Arena.  </P> <P> The Clippers got Danny Manning back after two games on the sidelines, and he  contributed 15 points. But they were without Benoit Benjamin and Charles Smith,  and this time, more than in Sunday's 109-107 victory, missed a defensive  presence inside, especially during the second half.  </P> <P> "(The Warriors) came out in the third quarter and were aggressive, no getting  around that," Clipper Coach Mike Schuler said. "They elevated their play."  </P> <P> The Clippers could not reach. Ken Norman finished with 30 points and eight  rebounds, Bo Kimble had 20 points, and Gary Grant added 12 assists, his third  game in a row with better than double figures, and it still wasn't enough. Not  against a team that made 58.4% of its shots to increase its season average to  55.7% and 133 points per game.  </P> <P> There was no indication of this early for the Clippers. After getting just 18  and 16 points, respectively in the first quarters of the first two games, they  went for 31 this time with a carry-over of intensity from the come-from-behind  win at home. All that got them, though, was a one-point lead.  </P> <P> Golden State, playing its home opener, started the second period with a 14-2  run over 3:57. That gave the Warriors a 44-33 advantage, which they proceeded  to almost lose, the Clippers drawing to within 51-45 before ending the half  trailing only by 60-55.  </P> <P> Norman had 15 points by then on six-of-10 shooting. Manning and Kimble both  made four of seven attempts for nine points.  </P> <P> Looking to break an eight-game losing streak in Oakland, the Clippers pulled  within four in the third quarter, the last time at 65-61 with 9:28 left, and  then disintegrated. The Warriors went on 13-0 and 15-2 surges, exposing the  Clipper defense with apparent ease.  </P> <P> Early in the charge, Chris Mullin did the damage. A short jumper in the lane.  Following a pair of free throws by Tolbert, a three-point jumper from straight  away. A layup, the first of four successive trips Golden State would rip  through for a layin or dunk, Mitch Richmond getting two in a row.  </P> <P> With 6:32 left, some three minutes after the power surge began, the Warriors'  lead climbed to 80-63 and on the way to 92-69. It was 97-81, heading into the  fourth quarter.  </P> <P> That played out without too much more bleeding, all that remained was for the  Clippers to pack up and head out on a late flight. The Pistons are coming.  </P> <P> "I just told them let's go home," Schuler said. "The expression is, 'Protect  your own crib.' "  </P> <P> The Warriors apparently know it well. With Mullin getting 26 points, and  Richmond and Marciulionis each adding 21, they did it.  </P> <P> Clipper Notes  </P> <P> Benoit Benjamin missed his third consecutive game with a separated shoulder and  Charles Smith also sat out with a badly sprained foot and ankle. Trainer Keith  Jones said Benjamin is "questionable to probable" for tonight's game against  the Detroit Pistons at the Sports Arena and that Smith, who sat out the second  half of Sunday's win over Golden State, is probable. The Clippers are hoping  for a rush order on a foot arch that for Smith, who took a mold Monday for the  process that normally takes four to six days. . . . Danny Manning, Smith and  Benjamin are on the all-star ballot for February's game at Charlotte, N.C.  </P> <P> Mike Schuler wasn't taking added joy in the Clippers' victory Sunday because it  came against the Warriors, the team he was an assistant coach with last season  and whose coach, Don Nelson, has twice hired Schuler for his staff. Coming back  from 20 points down in the second quarter was enough this time. "If that ever  occurred, it was the first time we played, when I was at Portland and he was  still with Milwaukee," Schuler said. "I'll tell you straight up, that was a big  day, coaching against who I consider the best coach in the NBA. I never  admitted that in Portland, but that's what it meant to me, because I respect  Nellie so much."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Clipper update -- The team took a charter flight home from Oakland after  Tuesday night's 130-109 loss to Golden State, rather than get an early wake-up  call today to return to Los Angeles -- a move the Clippers hope will mean a  fresh team tonight. They did the same thing last season from Portland and beat  Detroit at the Sports Arena, 83-79, in one of the Clippers' best showings of  the season. Charles Smith averaged 20 points and 13 rebounds in the two games  against the Pistons in 1989-90.  </P> <P> Piston update -- Isiah Thomas and Bill Laimbeer have been starting despite  injuries. Thomas has been wearing goggles to protect a torn tear duct, and  Laimbeer has been wearing a clear plastic mask over his broken left cheekbone.  Dennis Rodman is still bothered by a chronic sprained left ankle, but he had 10  rebounds in each of the first two games and played typically strong defense.  Before Tuesday night's 100-92 loss at to the SuperSonics at Seattle, the  Pistons had seven players scoring in double figures in a victory over the  Milwaukee Bucks and six in beating the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Pistons have  lost two of their last three games at the Sports Arena.  </P></p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / International Company News: Canadian paper group swings back to profit Canadian pulp and paper producers are expected to report a sharp climb in profits in the final quarter of this year, driven by rising prices for pulp, newsprint, fine paper and packaging. Tembec, a big eastern producer, provided a taste of things to come when it reported a profit of CDollars 72.9m (USDollars 53m), or CDollars 2.24 a share, for the year to September 30, a swing of nearly CDollars 122m from a loss of CDollars 48.6m, or CDollars 1.33, a year earlier. The CDollars 65m proceeds from a financial restructuring accounted for part of the increase and the rest came from higher selling prices, especially in the September quarter. Costs were stable. Since September 30, prices worldwide have risen further for nearly all Tembec's products. The company exports to more than 50 countries. The latest fiscal year showed sales of CDollars 575m, up 32 per cent. Tembec's 50 per cent-owned French pulp mill contributed CDollars 3.9m in operating income and the 41 per cent-owned Ontario newsprint affiliate contributed CDollars 6.9m. Most of Tembec's operations are based in north-western Quebec.</p>

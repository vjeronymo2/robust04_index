			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MELVIN DURLSLAG: WITH ELWAY, THEY HAVE OUTSIDE SHOT AT UPSET  </P> <P> Switching one day to the field of letters, comedian Dick Martin authored the  American masterpiece, titled, "With a Daiquiri and a Beautiful Girl, a Guy Can  Get Romantic in Cleveland."  </P> <P> You reflect on this today since those in Cleveland have ample time for romance,  removed as they are from the tournament to settle the football championship of  earth.  </P> <P> And who was chiefly responsible for removing them? A cad from Stanford named  John Elway.  </P> <P> It used to be that guys went to Stanford to marry for position, winding up  senior partner in their father-in-law's brokerage house.  </P> <P> But this Elway goes into business for himself, a specialist in the science of  scrambling.  </P> <P> "If you want to scramble, you bum, why don't you find work as a fry cook?"  comes the cry from the Cleveland Dawg Pound.  </P> <P> The Dawg Pound is an area in Cleveland Stadium where inhabitants throw dog  biscuits at visiting players, who are sorry to see the throwers give up their  lunch.  </P> <P> But Elway brings to Cleveland immense sadness, especially to the Cleveland  coach, Bud Carson, whose wounds have yet to heal.  </P> <P> "How can San Francisco put a handle on this guy?" Carson is asked, with  reference to the Super Bowl matching the 49ers with Denver.  </P> <P> "You wouldn't know it but we had a plan to contain him," he answers glumly. "We  were going to prevent him from getting outside. We were going to hit him as  frequently as possible. And we were going to play possession football, keeping  the ball out of his hands."  </P> <P> "What worked?" Bud is asked.  </P> <P> "We went zero for three. He got outside. We didn't hit him. And we didn't keep  the ball. It wasn't one of our better days, but the plan we developed going in  is the basic way to stop Elway."  </P> <P> Among clubs facing this unique performer, the fear of his slipping outside the  rush is uppermost.  </P> <P> "Once he gets loose, there is no way to deal with Denver, no way for your  defenders to figure what's coming," Carson explains. "Elway himself doesn't  know what's going to happen. He starts running and looking until he sees  something. And he has the kind of arm that can get the ball to what he sees. In  the defense, meantime, there is total breakdown."  </P> <P> Like most coaches, Carson prefers a tidy game, one in which the attack comes at  you in an orderly way. But once Elway gets around the rush and starts running,  he terrorizes the opposing sideline, aware that its defenders are neutralized,  reduced to guessing.  </P> <P> "Do rushers have instructions on how to keep him in the pocket?" you ask  Carson.  </P> <P> "Studying Elway's habits, you find that a rusher reaching for him has a better  chance nailing him by grabbing at the back of his shoulder, not the front," he  answers. "You grab at the front and he spins out and slips outside. You are not  dealing with a frail creature. This is a very strong man who weighs 215."  </P> <P> Asked to deal at least twice a season with Elway, the Raiders embrace the old  Joe Namath theory on the relativity of sacks.  </P> <P> Sacks make good viewing, Joe always contended. They are pulled off in the open,  fully on camera. But, tactically, they are secondary to the simple, less  dramatic hit, more frequently applied.  </P> <P> A quarterback needn't be sacked to reduce him as a weapon. The cumulative  effect of legal hits that aren't necessarily sacks begins to tell as the game  progresses.  </P> <P> "The brain keeps count," Namath used to say.  </P> <P> The Raiders always attempt to slow down Elway with this stratagem, and it was  Cleveland's aim last Sunday.  </P> <P> "We 'dogged him all day," Carson says. "We not only didn't hit him, but got  burned on passes to undefended receivers."  </P> <P> In the Super Bowl, Carson sees a quarterback match of broadly different breeds.  </P> <P> "For the most part, Joe Montana is a very orderly worker," he says. "He runs a  traditional possession attack. A lot of short passes, blended with runs. The  other guy runs a crapshoot, as unorthodox as any quarterback you ever will  see."  </P> <P> That the Super Bowl is played on neutral grounds is, in Carson's judgment, a  major asset to a championship event.  </P> <P> But he would favor conference championships on neutral fields, too.  </P> <P> "If Denver had come to Cleveland last Sunday, it would have experienced the  same disadvantage we did in Denver," he says. "When you can't hear, you can't  play your game. Conference championships are very important. You would have  fairer games on neutral fields."  </P> <P> One of these days, a rich owner whose forces are in the Super Bowl is going to  buy up, at scalpers' rates, 50,000 or so tickets and disperse them to his  team's fans, creating enough crowd noise to be a factor.  </P> <P> Blowing $25 million, he will shrug, reminding you of the words of Nelson Bunker  Hunt as the banks were closing in: "A billion isn't what it used to be."  </P></p>

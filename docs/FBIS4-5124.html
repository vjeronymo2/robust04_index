			<p>BFN     [Text] A regiment of the invading troops of the communist  Vietnamese puppets and the two-headed government -- backed by  five tanks, artillery, and multiple rocket batteries -- launched  an attack on 5 April to break through our forces surrounding  them in Sala Krau. The enemy was completely routed. Here is  the preliminary result: We killed 15 soldiers and wounded a  large number. Furthermore, we smashed and killed nine division  and regimental officers, including a deputy to Prum Moranak, a  tank commander, and three infantry commanders. We seized some  weapons and war materiel.</p>

			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOTNOTES  </P> <P> Questionable Book Review  </P> <P> There's no shortage of books on the savings and loan debacle, what with three  major books in print and at least six more on the way.  </P> <P> No doubt the unique title award goes to a low-budget paperback by Jess A.  Rodrigues, former owner of the now-defunct Saratoga Savings &amp; Loan in San  Jose. Rodrigues' just-published book, a 204-page tirade against regulators and  his competitors, is titled "Power Above the Law -- S&amp;L Bailout?!?!?!"  </P> <P> The book did get a good review from one prominent person, attorney and former  San Francisco Mayor Joseph L. Alioto, who on the book jacket is quoted as  calling Rodrigues' tale "a story of a 25-year-old successful business that was  destroyed by abusive S&amp;L regulators at the instigation of their  competitors."  </P> <P> What isn't mentioned is that Alioto represents Rodrigues.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nice Car, Prince  </P> <P> The guest of honor wore dark gray and arrived unfashionably early with a  menacing growl, but sat passively enough while a few dozen guests ogled.  </P> <P> The occasion was a recent bon voyage party for the very first Vector, a  high-priced, high-performance super car that is finally being shipped to its  first buyer after more than a decade on the drawing board. The price of the  car, which is built in Wilmington by Vector Aeromotive, starts at $250,000.  </P> <P> The buyer of Vector 1 is a Saudi Arabian prince whom Vector Aeromotive Chief  Executive Jerry Wiegert declined to identify. Given current Middle East  tensions -- not to mention that glaring Saudi sun -- the prince is taking  delivery of the exotic car in Switzerland.  </P> <P> A glance inside the Vector's trunk revealed a going-away gift that every prince  needs: a complementary kit of Snap-on Tools.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not the Best Place to Keep It  </P> <P> Some Robinson's credit card holders may have received an offer this month for a  Hot-Line 24 Card. For a $12 annual fee, the Hot-Line Credit Card Bureau will  cancel all the credit cards you've registered with them, should those cards get  stolen.  </P> <P> There's even a nifty plastic card with a 24-hour 800 number to call if your  cards are stolen. Robinson's encourages clients to "carry the enclosed Hot-Line  24 Card in your wallet or billfold . . . along with your credit cards."  </P> <P> Probably would be a good idea to memorize that 800 number first.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FINDING THE MONEY TO BUY A CANYON;  </P> <P> * LAGUNA MUST LOOK HIGH AND LOW FOR NEEDED MILLIONS  </P> <P> Laguna Beach Mayor Lida Lenney said that the morning after Election Day, she  awoke with a "$58-million headache." The euphoria of her city's astonishing 80%  passage of a $20-million bond issue to help purchase Laguna Canyon was  subsiding. In its place was the sobering realization that the bond sale would  provide about a fourth of the $78 million needed over the next five years to  buy the 2,150-acre canyon from the Irvine Co. That's a great deal of money for  a city with a population of 25,000 and an annual budget of only $25 million.  </P> <P> What now?  </P> <P> There is no single answer, nor any easy one. To complete the purchase, the city  needs to put together a patchwork of city, county, state and federal money,  donations and fees aimed at meeting payments due between now and 1995, when a  final $33-million payment will finalize the deal. That's going to take a  complex and imaginative package of different strategies.  </P> <P> The thought of a 3,200-unit housing development in Laguna Canyon -- no matter  how tastefully or discreetly done -- seemed so intolerable that it sparked a  protest by 8,000 residents that led the Irvine Co. to the bargaining table. The  result: an historic agreement for the city to purchase the canyon from the  developer on very favorable terms.  </P> <P> But here comes the next set of hurdles: For example, the city must work with  Supervisor Thomas F. Riley to resolve a dispute over construction of the San  Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor through the northern portion of the  canyon. Riley has threatened to withhold $10 million in county money earmarked  for purchase of the canyon over the next five years unless the city promises  not to sue to block the corridor.  </P> <P> Working its way out of this dilemma may prove nearly as challenging for the  city as the delicate negotiations that resulted in the pact to preserve Laguna  Canyon. The two sides must try to find common ground, but Riley hardly can be  surprised to learn that the city still opposes the roadway, given its reasons  for wanting county help in keeping housing development out of the canyon.  </P> <P> There are other tough assignments, such as the need to bring in grants and  donations. Soon, the City Council will decide whether to hire a fund-raiser.  That won't be cheap -- it could cost $5,000 a month -- but a professional can  help find the money needed to meet future payments.  </P> <P> The city should also pursue money from the county's new half-cent sales tax for  transportation, which passed Nov. 6, that could be used to widen Laguna Canyon  Road. While the Irvine Co. already has agreed to pay for the widening, any  money it doesn't have to use for that project could be credited directly to the  city for the canyon's purchase. But to be eligible for sales tax money, the  city will have to do some serious negotiating with the county over the specific  plans for widening the canyon road.  </P> <P> As if all that were not enough, the city must move quickly to compete for  open-space, wetlands-preservation and wildlife-habitat money. It probably will  need to propose a modest countywide open-space measure that clearly would  provide money for projects in other areas of the county. And it should  encourage formation of benefit-assessment districts in other nearby communities  that also have a strong interest in preserving the canyon.  </P> <P> At one time, saving Laguna Canyon from development seemed like a crazy idea.  Now, it's a happy headache for Lenney, Laguna Beach and the rest of Orange  County -- but there can be no illusions about how tough a job lies ahead.  </P></p>

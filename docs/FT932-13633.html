			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: Bentalls ends year Pounds 1m in the red A FLAT second six months' trading combined with a poor Christmas left Bentalls, the department store group, Pounds 986,000 in the red at the pre-tax level for the year to January 30. The total dividend is cut from 3.85p to 1.9p via a reduced final of 1.3p. The shares closed 9p down at 108p. The deficit, which compared with previous profits of Pounds 1.4m, came from turnover of Pounds 72.4m (Pounds 71m). Losses per share emerged at 0.28p (earnings 2.21p). Mr Edward Bentall, chairman, said that retail conditions were now more favourable than a year ago. At January 31 the total value of the group's property interests amounted to Pounds 68.6m. Largely as a result of the reduction in the revaluation surplus, shareholders' funds decreased from Pounds 69.7m to Pounds 56.8m and net asset value per share from 166p to 135p.</p>

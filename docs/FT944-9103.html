			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Vietnam gets Dollars 2bn in new assistance: Achievement boosting growth to 8.5% warmly endorsed Vietnam was yesterday promised Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.26bn) in new assistance at a foreign aid donors conference in Paris which warmly endorsed the country's achievement in boosting economic growth this year to 8.5 per cent while keeping inflation low. The new aid comes on top of Dollars 1.8bn pledged last year to Vietnam, whose development efforts 'deserved large-scale support from the international community,' according to a communique issued at the end of the two day conference which was chaired by the World Bank. 'Vietnam is on the right track,' Mr Callisto Modava, a regional director of the World Bank, said of Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's economic reform policies. 'It has the right vision and is producing results,' he said. 'This country clearly has the potential to be a real success story.' However, the Vietnamese delegation led by Mr Do Quoc Sam, chairman of the state planning committee, admitted that it had some problems in using some of the aid it received last year, and it promised to streamline its bureaucracy dealing with development aid and project implementation. Of the aid pledged last year, about Dollars 400m had been disbursed. Mr Madavo said said the disbursement difficulties stemmed from Vietnam's unfamiliarity with identifying suitable projects for receiving aid and the different procedures among individual donor nations for releasing cash. It was not surprising there had been delays as this had been Vietnam's first year of dealing with donor nations, he added. Vietnamese officials emphasised their government's 1995 priorities of reforming state enterprises and the budget, boosting private industry and agriculture, modernising the financial system and further opening the economy to foreign investment and trade. The meeting concluded with agreement that alleviating poverty, protecting the environment and reforming public administration should be aid priorities. In absolute terms Vietnamese remain very poor, despite rapid recent improvement. Ten European countries plus Canada, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Australia attended the Paris meeting as donors, while the US participated as an observer and made no bilateral pledges. However, Republican Senator Christopher Bond of Missouri was reported during a visit to Hanoi as promising Vietnamese leaders that the new Republican majorities in both houses of the US Congress would continue efforts to improve relations between the two countries. The US only lifted its trade embargo last year, 18 years after US troops quit Vietnam.</p>

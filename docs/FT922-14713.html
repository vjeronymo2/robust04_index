			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / How To Spend It: How your phone reflects you - Paul Keers looks at the sophisticated equipment now available for home and office it could be telling us more about you than you really want us to know. Here, power and status is, literally, at your fingertips. Once, the complexity of your telephone was a matter of office politics, its sophistication another sign of your position in the corporate hierarchy. But, like so many symbols of business success, the complex, multi-function telephone has now moved on from the office to the home. When the British Telecom monopoly on telephones ended in 1983, there was a rush for domestic novelty phones that looked like anything from a car to a cartoon character. At the other extreme of the style dial, there was a trend among the designer set for refurbished black Bakelite instruments from the 1930s. Clearly, both of these fashions were more concerned with a phone's appearance than its performance. Gradually, though, the home has become a place to start or complete the day's business - an extension of the office in more ways than one. Indeed, some executives no longer confine their endeavours to office hours; doing business globally can mean making calls at all sorts of unattractive hours. Talking, say, to New Zealand can be done more comfortably from the study at home than the desk at work, simply because of the time difference. So, many of us now need to equip our homes with office-standard communications. As a result, electronic retailers are selling telephones designed originally for companies but bought increasingly for domestic use. In conjunction with the new exchange services offered by BT, they are effectively removing the distinction between home and office telephones. The sophisticated equipment marketed by Panasonic epitomises the advanced functions people are demanding for their homes. Like most modern phones, all Panasonic's have musical touch-tone dialling which is faster than old-fashioned pulse dialling. Tone dialling means you can conduct many of the new phone-in services - such as NatWest's ActionLine home banking - directly from a keypad, And on modern BT exchanges, tone-diallers can also subscribe to facilities like Call Waiting (which puts incoming calls on hold) and Call Divert (which re-routes them to another number). You cannot do this with old-fashioned phones: 1930s equipment often means 1930s services. Many of the new phones offer hands-free operation where you can talk without picking up the receiver - the so-called speakerphones. And there is a memo function which allows you to tap-in a number while someone is dictating it over the phone instead of writing it down with a pen. When you make a call using a number in your telephone's memory, an LSD display will show what you have just retrieved and then time the duration. Then, there are the memory functions. pHones now routinely offer between 18 and 48 'stations' - ie, numbers held in the memory which can be retrieved either by pushing a single one-touch button, or by speed-dialling two digits which retrieve a much longer number. And they offer not just last-number redial but also chain dialling, which will re-try engaged numbers automatically until you get through. Why should you need such things at home? Well, Essex Man can use his to get through on radio phone-in shows (no one with a traditional telephone can possibly dial-in faster than Barry in Basildon with Capital Radio's number programmed into his phone's memory). By the same token, you can use them for such things as calling theatre box offices (which are always engaged when you ring). This way, you can hit just one button and call them back effortlessly until you are connected. (Of course, a real prestidigitator has no need of speed-dialling. Hollywood star Warren Beatty is famous for using all five fingers to push the buttons, like somebody drumming their fingers on the tone pad, and he is said to be able to dial a 10-digit number accurately in exactly one second). You can probably remember your relatives' phone numbers and have little need of speed-dialling from home. But a multi-function home telephone also communicates in terms of image. It suggests you are the kind of person who needs to communicate and keep in touch at all times; a person whose calls cannot be restricted to the nine-to-five routine. And your real status is suggested by the ease with which you make those calls. Your status is proportional inversely to the amount of work you must do in order to communicate. At the top of the tree is the executive who simply calls to his assistant: 'Get me Jones in New York' - and picks up the receiver only when Jones is on the line. At the bottom is the minion who has to look up the number, dial the 16-or-so international digits, dial them all again if he gets a busy signal, and must then wait to be connected and put through. The less work involved in making the call, the more powerful the caller. Thus, the telephone equipped with single buttons to dial and re-dial numbers, take memos or hold calls has become a symbol of success only a notch below employing the secretary herself. (The only function that the manufacturers have got wrong in this sense is the speaker-phone. In terms of status, you should not be using one yourself but forcing others to use them. Ideally, you are in a position to make five other people pull up their chairs and gather around a speaker-phone in order to hear your words. If, as the American publisher Michael Korda said, the true measure of success is the number of people you can inconvenience, then the speaker-phone is the best way of demonstrating your status.) A home telephone is for making business calls, not for receiving them. None of the modern facilities improves reception but all of them help in dialling out. Which is just as it should be, because the only people who have the right to call you on business at home are people in a more powerful position. You do not call the boss over the weekend - he calls you. And so, your ability to make calls reflects your significance - your availability to take them indicates inferiority. Returning calls in your own time reverses the equation. Mark McCormack, head of the International Management Group, says: 'I seldom accept any phone call. I would rather deal with it in my own time and when I can focus my attention on the call, rather than on what it is interrupting. Initiating a phone call also gives me more control and time to plan what I want to say.' These telephones are no longer expensive. At branches of Dixon's, you can pick up an Audioline Tel-45 speaker-phone with a 20-number memory for Pounds 24.95. The Panasonic range starts at under Pounds 30 for an Easaphone model with a 26-number memory. For Pounds 120, there is a Panasonic that can handle two separate lines, holds 40 numbers in memory, has an LSD display - and makes you feel you are ringing the takeaway from Houston Control. Retail chains like Dixon's, Ryness and Lasky's all carry ranges of advanced phones but they tend to concentrate on cordless models and answerphones. For serious desktop equipment - and the Panasonic range, in particular - visit the electronics stores on Tottenham Court Road and haggle for the best price. Remember that what you are looking for combines the greatest degree of sophistication with the least amount of effort. That's right folks - don't touch that dial]</p>

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nymex submits a Dollars 50m takeover offer for Comex THE NEW York Mercantile Exchange has submitted a Dollars 50m offer for the New York commodity exchange in a deal that could merge the world's largest energy market with the largest precious metals exchange. The deal would distribute Dollars 30m to the Comex's 772 members at closing and Dollars 20m to be paid in Dollars 5m tranches over four years. To placate its own 785 members Nymex directors are also proposing to distribute Dollars 15m among them if the Comex deal is completed. Another Dollars 4,000 per lease or Dollars 1m will be paid to traders who rent Nymex memberships. The Nymex, with its highly successful oil contracts, has accumulated retained earnings estimated in excess of Dollars 80m. Comex first entertained takeover bids in January after its seat prices faded to Dollars 42,500 following three years of declining volume. The Chicago Board of Trade offered to pick up the flagging exchange for free in January, in exchange for administrative cost-cutting. The 1993 gold rally has since made the Comex a more glittering prize. Seat prices have rocketed to Dollars 90,000 and volume in July topped 2m contracts. July gold futures volume at the Comex was 1.171m contracts, compared with 734,643 in 1992. July silver turnover more than doubled to 503,935 compared to 197,946 a year ago. If the Comex accepts the Nymex as a cash offer the exchange will become a subsidiary of Nymex, with its own governing committee. Nymex members would gain personal trading rights to any of the new metals contracts, while Comex members would be able to trade Nymex's platinum and palladium futures and gain limited rights to trade any new energy contracts. Comex's contracts are expected to be added to the Nymex's electronic trading system, Access. The exchange's clearing and trade processing systems would be integrated under the plan, with cost savings to both exchanges. If the Comex board approves the deal, it would be brought to a vote of the full memberships in late October or early November.</p>

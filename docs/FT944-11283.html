			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / International Company News: Domtar returns to the black in third quarter Domtar, the Canadian forest products, packaging and building materials group which last month replaced its president and chief executive after a boardroom policy dispute, has returned to profitability in its third quarter, with net profit of CDollars 22m or 16 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 22m or 18 cents a share a year earlier. Operating profit was CDollars 64m (USDollars 47.2m) against a loss of CDollars 2m, and sales were up 31 per cent to CDollars 573m. Nine-month net profit was CDollars 41m or 30 cents a share against a loss of CDollars 85m or 69 cents a share. Sales were CDollars 1.5bn, against CDollars 1.25bn. Domtar, which is 42 per cent owned by two Quebec government agencies, was restructured in 1992-93 after heavy losses due to the long north American recession. Its two newsprint mills were sold in a CDollars 280m public offer last spring. The pulp and fine paper and packaging divisions posted a 21 per cent third-quarter gain in sales, benefiting from higher product prices and a weaker Canadian dollar. Most production is exported in US dollars. Linerboard prices passed the 1989 peak. The building materials division, which includes timber, wallboard and decorative panels and has plants in Canada and the US, improved operating results. Plans to sell the wallboard business have been deferred. 'We are now well positioned to make substantial gains during this economic cycle,' said Mr Stephen Larson, who has taken over as president. Domtar also plans capital outlays of about CDollars 350m in the next two years to raise efficiency and meet new pollution standards. Investors Group, a financial services subsidiary of Power Corp of Canada, posted a net profit of CDollars 61.4m or 58 cents a share for the nine months to September on revenues of CDollars 414m, up from CDollars 48.7m or 46 cents a share on revenues of CDollars 468m. Sales of mutual funds were firm at CDollars 3.4bn.</p>

			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> JUDGE DENIES CONSERVATOR FOR COLEMAN, SAYS HE SEEMS SOUND  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge today denied a request to have a conservator appointed  for actor Gary Coleman in a case involving allegations of failing mental  health, parental greed and stolen money.  </P> <P> Coleman's mother, Edmonia Sue Coleman, sought to have a conservator take over  the estate and personal affairs of her son, the diminutive former star of  "Diff'rent Strokes."  </P> <P> But based on Coleman's court appearances, the investigation of a  court-appointed attorney and her own 30-minute interview in chambers, Judge  Martha Goldin denied the request, ruling the 21-year-old actor "does not come  close" to requiring a conservator to look after his affairs.  </P></p>

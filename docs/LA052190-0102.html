			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> RAPPER DEF JEF WAS FUN, FUNKY, BUT AFTER THAT IT WAS DOWNHILL  </P> <P> The rap show Friday night at the Celebrity Theatre started at the pinnacle and  wound up in the pits.  </P> <P> The long, delay-filled evening of steadily diminishing returns ended with  teen-aged headliners Wrecks-N-Effect grinding to a wretchedly amateurish  embarrassment of a finish. Another New York rap crew, Redhead Kingpin &amp; the  F.B.I., turned in a mediocre middle set. But Def Jef, a more experienced rapper  based in Los Angeles, made it all worthwhile with a near-perfect opening set  that was fun, funky, and politically focused -- a textbook example of all  that's good in rap music.  </P> <P> For 35 deftly paced minutes, Def Jef (real name: Jeffrey Fortson), disc jockey  Erick Vaan and a trio of wonderful dancers called the Soul Brothers offered a  cornucopia of rhyme, rhythm and eye-popping motion. Throughout his show, Def  Jef expertly interwove his key themes: rap as a call to party, rap as a  foundation for friendship and rap as a vehicle for expressing black pride and  black protest.  </P> <P> A lot of rap acts offer impressive dance acrobatics. But Jef and his crew used  a dance sequence to make a point about black heritage and aspirations. As the  three Soul Brothers showed off their moves in dance solos, they departed from  the usual herky-jerky, robotic pattern of contemporary hip-hop dance and  reached back into their cultural tradition. The routines featured loose-limbed  moves derived from Africa and funky but urbane steps that recalled  Vaudeville-era tap-dancing. To drive home the point, the dance sequence ended  with a ceremonial passage in which the dancers moved with interlocked arms  while the soundtrack carried segments of a Black Muslim speech and a Bob Marley  song extolling the racial heritage of blacks.  </P> <P> Def Jef conveyed the same message in his concluding rap, "Black to the Future."  While taking a controversial stand on what tactics are acceptable for effecting  change ("Through violence or nonviolence, I don't care -- as long as we get  there"), the song's tone, like Jef's attitude, was clearly positive.  </P> <P> Jef's motto for rap -- "It's a black thing, but everybody's invited" --  exemplified his call for racial pride while skirting exclusionary racial  chauvinism.  </P> <P> In his headband, short dreadlocks, and semi-military garb, the bearded,  chunkily built Def Jef looked as if he might have been a member of Che  Guevarra's revolutionary band. But Jef's delivery, though pointed, was never  strident, and the show never became annoyingly preachy. The rapper was no stiff  polemicist but an exceptionally confident and charming entertainer with a  self-deprecating sense of humor and a capacity for enjoying himself immensely.  Funky numbers such as "Droppin' Rhymes on Drums" reached dance-party nirvana;  the show reached the right balance between the jukebox and the soapbox.  </P> <P> Def Jef was a natural performer. Like a rap Sinatra, he was able to use deft  hand motions and effective body English to underscore his lyrics. He also was a  capable dancer and a supple, clear-voiced rhymer.  </P> <P> Far from bogging the show down, some of the fast-moving set's nicest moments  came when Jef and the tall, lanky Vaan engaged in easy, back-and-forth banter  about what song they would perform next. This Mutt and Jeff pair's ribbing  revealed a warm mutual affection -- and when they switched places for a while,  Def Jef proved himself a flash record scratcher as well as a sharp rapper. This  crew made a well-planned performance seem like casual, happy play. It was a  pleasure hanging out with them.  </P> <P> The only blemish on Def Jef's set was a passing comment that contained  gratuitous homophobia and insensitivity about AIDS -- a common but unforgivable  blind spot among rappers that undermines the genre with its hypocrisy and  prejudice.  </P> <P> Redhead Kingpin (real name: David Guppy) came off as an energetic but  lightweight rap dandy. Mugging and strutting through his 22-minute set, he  seemed like a smug frat boy who shows off a lot but knows very little. The most  memorable thing this New Jersey rapper with the red Eraserhead hairstyle did  was drop his trousers and dance in his shorts, drawing squeals from his female  fans.  </P> <P> His entourage included a dancer, introduced as Guppy's younger brother, who  spent the entire show with an infant's rubber pacifier in his mouth. That was  fitting in a way, since most of Redhead Kingpin's raps were puerile boasts and  sexual fantasies. One more mature number, the Spike Lee-inspired social  commentary "Do the Right Thing," was punchy enough, but Guppy's poor  enunciation robbed it of bite. On the other raps, it didn't really matter that  the words were hard to make out.  </P> <P> Wrecks-N-Effect, a trio that often collaborates with Redhead Kingpin on record,  shared his fixation with sexy songs and bump-and-grind moves. But while Kingpin  at least kept his show moving, Wrecks-N-Effect's half-hour set was a fumbling  affair with long gaps in which the members resembled aimless adolescents  hanging out on a playground with no idea what to do next.  </P> <P> The trio came close to committing child abuse when it lifted a boy toddler out  of the audience, apparently with the aim of prodding him to make advances to a  girl of about 8 who had also come on stage. Wrecks-N-Effect let this  frightened, bewildered tot stand alone on stage sucking a finger for what  seemed an eternity, apparently in hopes he would make some sort of cute whoopee  with the little girl. It was the brainless prank of rank amateurs, teen-agers  without the slightest instinct for performance.  </P> <P> Wrecks-N-Effect also showed a complete lack of integrity toward the art of  rapping. Throughout the show, the trio worked with an aural net: While they  mouthed the words to their raps, a prerecorded backing track of the vocal parts  boomed with far greater volume than the real-time rapping.  </P> <P> It's in the nature of rap music to use canned rhythm tracks and instrumental  bits. But the point of live rapping is to dominate a stage with a real voice  and a real personality. While Def Jef employed some electronic vocal  embellishments during his set, there was no question that his performance was  real. As for the fakers in Wrecks-N-Effect, they might as well have stayed home  and mailed in a tape. That way, they would have been spared the scattered  booing that greeted the end of their pathetic show.  </P></p>

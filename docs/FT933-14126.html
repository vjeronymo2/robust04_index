			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC proposes to extend ban on BST hormone THE European Commission yesterday presented plans to extend its four-year-old ban on the dairy hormone bovine somatrophin (BST) by a further seven years - mainly because the hormone's use would drive smaller dairy farmers out of business. The commission's predominantly economic rationale for seeking a ban on the productivity-boosting hormone is based on fears that its use could disrupt finely balanced calculations for the beef and dairy sector, under last year's reform of the EC's common agricultural policy. The commission admitted it could not fault BST conclusively on veterinary, health or ethical grounds, although it pointed out that monitoring the effects of a hormone used on such a large scale could not be properly enforced. It argued, however, that BST, which delivers milk productivity increases of 6-20 per cent, would have the effect of concentrating milk output on larger holdings, driving smaller farmers out of business and leading to the more intensive farming that the CAP reform seeks to discourage. Such a development would lead to increased slaughtering of dairy cows - 4-6 per cent of the EC herd, the commission said - adding to the already chronic oversupply of beef. Moreover, the commission argued, consumer reaction against hormones was now so pronounced that authorisation of BST would lead to further declines in beef and dairy product consumption, adding to market imbalances. Mr Rene Steichen, EC agriculture commissioner, said it would 'tarnish the image of a product now considered natural and wholesome'. BST was developed largely by US multinatonals like Monanto and Eli Lilly. The US Senate has recently voted for a 15-month moratorium on its use. Extending the EC ban on the hormone will have to gain the approval of the council of agricultural ministers.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The treasurer, Ralph Willis, says budget forecasts  will be met despite a slump in quarterly figures. His comments  follow the release of statistics showing a drop of 5 percent in  the March quarter.    Mr. Willis said budget predictions for business investment  growth are on target and expectations of investment in 1993-94  are virtually unchanged. Mr. Willis said all that has happened  is that investment is happening in the June quarter rather than  the March quarter.    [Begin Willis recording] Capital expenditure figures showing  a 5 percent fall in the March quarter have produced predictably  alarmist headlines, and fear-mongering comments from the  perennial pessimists and political opportunists. We do not  accept these figures warrant such interpretation. [end recording]</p>

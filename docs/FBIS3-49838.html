			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Madeleine Albright, special envoy of U.S.  President Bill Clinton and America's ambassador to the United  Nations, paid a visit to Bucharest today. Her visit included  talks at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a meeting with  Romania's President Ion Iliescu at Cotroceni Palace, a working  lunch, and a news conference held upon departure at Otopeni  Airport. [passage omitted]    In a statement made to journalists after the talks at  Cotroceni, President Ion Iliescu said that he views most  favorably the presence in Bucharest of the American ambassador  to the United Nations, the message delivered on behalf of  President Bill Clinton, and the information received in  connection with the Brussels decisions and the Partnership for  Peace.    Ion Iliescu said that even before the Brussels meeting,  Romania believed that this is perhaps one of the wisest  decisions aimed at eliminating any discrimination in relations  with the countries in this part of Europe and at ensuring a  favorable framework of equal security for all European states  and preparations for an evolutionary process for integration in  NATO. We, said President Ion Iliescu, have expressed our choice  and hope for future integration in NATO structures, and we see  the Partnership for Peace as the most favorable framework for a  normal evolution of this process. We have discussed real  political and military preparation for these measures, which  will be examined by the Supreme Council for the country's  defense to develop contacts and finalize the framework for  integration in the Partnership for Peace process.    In his statement Mr. Iliescu noted that other issues  connected with peace and security in Europe as well as aspects  of bilateral relations were also broached. On economic  relations, we, the president mentioned, emphasized the need to  develop a new economic partnership plan, as a new philosophy and  political concept of economic relations both on the European  continent, between equal partners, as well as a concept designed  to govern international economic relations.    This is required because the world economy faces a systemic  crisis and discrepancies between the rich and poor worlds risk  turning into the most dangerous and explosive source for  destabilization and insecurity in the world. This is also an  imperative issue at the European level, in the context of  difficulties presented by the transition to a market economy in  the countries neighboring Romania.    Ion Iliescu expressed his view that the issue of developing  a  concept of economic partnership and cooperation is part of a  common fate and common opportunity. He stated that during the  talks with the American ambassador to the United Nations he  discovered that they shared almost identical views on security  and economic cooperation issues. The Romanian president added  that during the talks the sides emphasized prospects for  developing the Romanian-American dialogue at the highest level  and he reiterated the invitation extended to President Bill  Clinton and Vice President Al Gore to visit Romania.</p>

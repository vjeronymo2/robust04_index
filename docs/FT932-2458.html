			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Cater Allen at Pounds 11.7m and has good start to year CATER ALLEN, the financial services company which owns London's second biggest discount house, yesterday reported net profits of Pounds 11.7m for the year ended April, against Pounds 8.13m a year earlier. It also disclosed for the first time full details of profits and reserves at its discount house and Jersey bank, anticipating compliance with the European Community's second banking directive this year. On the new basis, pro-forma pre-tax profits were Pounds 18.78m (Pounds 13.44m). Shareholders' funds of Pounds 83.3m were boosted by the transfer of previously hidden reserves of Pounds 2.15m and of Pounds 5.41m 'rebate' representing the excess of market value over carrying cost of its trading assets. On the old accounting basis, the discount house, about half the group's business, had profits after tax and rebate of Pounds 5.33m (Pounds 3.5m). The discount house did not make or lose 'a great deal' following Britain's withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism last autumn and subsequent falls in exchange rates. Losses at Lloyd's agencies deepened from Pounds 473,000 to Pounds 1.26m due to the lack of profit commission on the 1990 year of account and to the reduction in its agencies' fee income for the current year. The board, which said trading had started well this year, proposed a maintained final dividend of 20p, giving a total for the year of 27p (26p). Directors currently intend to raise the next interim dividend by 1p to 8p.</p>

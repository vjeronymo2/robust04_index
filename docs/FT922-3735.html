			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Impasse in N-arms talks RUSSIA and the US yesterday failed to reach agreement on a pact for further steep cuts in their nuclear arsenals, but said they still hoped to bridge the gap in time for next week's summit meeting between Presidents George Bush and Boris Yeltsin, writes George Graham. Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, said he had been unable to agree with Mr Andrei Kozyrev, his Russian counterpart, on either the number or the types of nuclear weapons that should be cut, or on the timing of these cuts.</p>

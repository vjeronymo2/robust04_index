			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Coats/Tootal The best bit of the Coats/Tootal battle is possibly yet to come. Once the bidder improves its offer and adds a little paper, the gloves are likely to be well and truly off. Attacking Coats's own rather dismal acquisition record is really Tootal's best hope. Certainly, its claim to continued independence as set out in yesterday's second defence document still looks quite thin. Granted, the management axe is finally being wielded; and indeed, there is a danger that customers like Marks and Spencer will look for alternative suppliers to reduce their dependence on the combined group. On the other hand, action to reduce costs should have been taken earlier; inconvenient as it may be for Tootal, its gushing enthusiasm for the idea of the merger is set out in black and white in the Office of Fair Trading report of 18 months ago. The game is still Coats's if it wants it.</p>

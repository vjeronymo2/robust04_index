			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Outdoors: The aphid that made millions - The Dutch are celebrating 400 years of tulips / Garden history According to an opinion poll, most Americans do not know where Holland is but they can easily tell you where tulips come from. Perhaps fewer Americans know the extraordinary history of this bloom, once prized above the riches of princes, now produced for the millions, yet still touched by the magic of its exotic past. Tulip bulbs saved many of the Dutch from death in the darkest years of Nazi occupation, and they have helped to keep them prosperous ever since. It is understandable that the Netherlands wants to celebrate; it has chosen 1994 as the 400th anniversary of the flowering of tulips flowered in the Dutch province of Holland (no matter that the date is doubtful) and is marking the event with pageants, tours, an exhibition at the Frans Hals Museum in Haarlem and one in the autumn at Amsterdam's Nieuwe Kirche, adorned with unseasonal 'ice tulips'. The identification of tulips with Holland goes back to the epidemic of 'tulip mania' between 1635 and the crash in 1637 (which showed remarkable parallels with more modern commodity and price spirals). However, some say that the warm sentiment inspired by tulips arose relatively recently. This year is the 50th anniversary of the Hunger Winter of 1944, when the Dutch starved under German occupation and people were reduced to grubbing up bulbs from the tulip fields. Some restaurants are putting tulip dishes on the menu, a gimmick which may say as much about residual anti-German feeling as about sentimentality towards tulips. The first recorded tulip flowerings in Holland were at Leiden, in neatly hedged beds in the hortus botanicus in autumn 1593. They belonged to the botanist Charles de l'Ecluse. Clusius, as he was known, was by then an old man, head-hunted for the new university. For more than 30 years he had been at the imperial court in Vienna, growing and studying tulips brought from Turkey. By 1594 tulips were being grown in grand gardens in the German-speaking lands, in France, and England. Indeed, it is recorded that many years before he moved to the Netherlands, Clusius sent a present of bulbs to a Dutch gentleman. No doubt they flowered . . . Pedantry aside, Leiden can claim to be the cradle of the Dutch bulb industry. Clusius and his head-gardener, quaintly called Clutius, settled down to propagating the priceless tulip collection. They sold bulbs at exorbitant prices to courtiers and country gentlemen. The breakthrough came only after a break-in, when thieves smashed their way into the hortus botanicus, stole the tulip collection, and dispersed it to the nursery trade. Tulip growing and breeding became a passionate pursuit of rich amateur gardeners throughout northern Europe. Because they hybridise easily and produce 'sports' or mutations, tulips were soon being produced in an extraordinary range of sizes, colours, shapes, and in the case of the most expensive, with the most fabulously patterned blooms. Vividly striped, blotched and flamed tulips (much later called 'Rembrandt' type) were the most expensive. By the 1620s, tulip bulbs had become plentiful enough for at least the lowly varieties to be widely available. But the extraordinary thing about tulips was their propensity to change dazzlingly from one season to the next. Unique among flowers, they will spontaneously 'break' or 'rectify', reappearing the next spring with gorgeously patterned petals. These tulips took their place among the costliest luxuries of the day. Grow just a few bulbs, and you could find you had the lucky break, which made tulips ripe for an investment gamble. Without the breaking, there would not have been the kind of interest which led to a speculative mania notorious in the annals of capitalism. A rampant futures markets developed, tulips changing hands many times but only on paper. Men made and lost fortunes. In 1623, a Semper Augustus bulb, red and white, fetched Fl 1,000 - around Pounds 350. Average income was around Fl 150. Next year, the price was Fl 1,200; by 1635, the price was Fl 5,500. Then the massive inflation began and in 1637, at the height of the market, a Semper August fetched the equivalent of Pounds 3,300. One bulb cost as much as a house on Amsterdam's smartest canal, with a coach-house and garden. Why did tulips break? There were many theories, ranging from the influence of the planets to insect infestation. The answer was found only in 1919. It was a virus, TBV, commonly spread by aphids, which by breaking up the anthocyanin pigment causes the exceptionally intense hues and patterns. The discovery was the death-knell of the Rembrandt. The flower of the Dutch Golden Age was merely sickly, diseased and horribly contagious. As Stanley Killingback, a modern tulip expert remarks: 'The beauty of such flowers is the beauty of death.' Clusius, too, noted that a broken tulip fizzles out within a season or two. He thought the breaking was a floral equivalent of a swansong, to reward its owner. Tulip mania remains an astonishing tribute to the appeal of flowers that were valued as if they were gold plate or pearls. Today, tulip prices are at an historic low, and sales are declining. Tulip 400 celebrates a passion which has long been waning among gardeners. In the last 20 years, the number of growers has dropped from 15,000 to 3,510. Yet even after four centuries of breeding, the hybridisers see a chink ahead. Extraordinary things may yet emerge from the bulb-sheds. Tissue culture has reduced the time it takes to bring a new variety to market - from 20 years to around seven. In the 1930s, they used radiation to make weird new varieties. Frans Roozen, head of the technical section of the International Bulb Centre talk of using colchicine, a poison favoured by Dutch witches, to cross tulips with narcissi and make 'a purple daffodil'. Genetic engineering is a better bet for the rainbow tulips of the future. According to hybridiser Piet Koopman of Pico Bello, the true blue tulip is a possibility if scientists can identify the purple chromasome in the iris family and inject it into tulip bulbs. Four centuries have taken the tulip a long way from the small, highly priced flower which Clusius named, 'A lovely tulip of a most elegant colour'.</p>

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar surges in late trade THE dollar surged in London late yesterday after initially showing great restraint in the face of better than expected unemployment figures, writes Peggy Hollinger. The US currency - which has been remarkably blase all week, in spite of a string of encouraging statistics - made little effort to react to news that non-farm payrolls rose by 105,000 in November, far greater than economists' forecasts of 55,000. Although the currency was marked up slightly, little actual trading appeared to have been done after the announcement. Traders said the dollar had been partially dragged down by the discovery that the figures included 45,000 temporary workers roped in for the presidential election campaigns. Within an hour, however, dealers had digested the details showing a drop in the umemployment rate from 7.4 per cent to 7.2 per cent, and a rise in manufacturing output, hourly wages and the working week. The dollar then managed to break decisively through the DM1.58 barrier, to close at DM1.5970, against DM1.5805 on Thursday. The US currency also climbed against the Swiss franc, from SFr1.4135 to SFr1.4317, helped in part by market caution over Sunday's referendum in Switzerland. The dollar's gains against the D-Mark were also put down to growing pessimism over the German economy. The sharper than expected 5.1 per cent decline in industrial orders during October, against a forecast drop of just 0.4 per cent, offered solace to most of the D-Mark's fellow European currencies. The French franc was steady against the D-Mark, closing at FFr3.39, almost the same levels it held at the start of the week. French Finance Minister Michel Sapin and German Finance Minster Theo Waigel reiterated their support for the parity between the two currencies within the exchange rate mechanism, further bolstering the franc. Sterling continued its strong showing with a sharp jump in the early hours of the morning to DM2.4966 from Thursday's close of DM2.4750. Dealers and economists suggested a variety of reasons for the rise. Some speculated that UK institutions, underweight in sterling, were repositioning ahead of the year-end. Other analysts said that US institutions had been buying sterling for the same reasons. The rumour which fuelled the market for most of the day - that Hong Kong investors were shifting into sterling - was dismissed by a Far East currency analyst. Sterling finished the week in London almost 8 pfennigs higher at DM2.4875.</p>

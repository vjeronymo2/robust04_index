			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pursuant to the proposal, there will be two means of exercising an expiring equity option: (1) Take no action and allow exercise determinations to be made in accordance with OCC Rule 805; or (2) the market maker, floor broker, or clearing member, as applicable, must submit a contrary exercise advice (i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , a notice committing an option holder either to exercise an option that would not otherwise be exercised automatically pursuant to OCC Rule 805, or not exercise an option that otherwise would be exercised automatically pursuant to OCC Rule 805) (``Contrary Exercise Advice''). Contrary Exercise Advices would be submitted by a market maker, floor broker, or clearing member either: (1) In such form or manner prescribed by the Exchange to a place designated by the Exchange; or (2) to the Exchange via the OCC in a format prescribed by the OCC. The proposal also provides that subsequent to the delivery of a Contrary Exercise Advice, should the market maker, floor broker, customer, or firm determine to act other than as reflected on the original contrary Exercise Advice, an ``advice cancel'' must also be delivered in such form or manner prescribed by the Exchange to a place designated by the Exchange no later than the Exercise Cut-Off Time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsection (c) to Commentary .04 would also be amended to provide that all of the procedures of Commentary .04 are in full force and effect whether or not the OCC waives the exercise-by-exception provisions of OCC Rule 805. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  In the event of such waiver, the procedures of Commentary .04 shall be followed as if such provisions of OCC Rule 805 were in full force and effect. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission notes that this could occur where an underlying security is not traded on its primary market on the trading day immediately preceding an expiration date and, as a result, the OCC determines not to fix a closing price for that security. See OCC Rule 805(l). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> When the OCC waives the exercise-by-exception procedure, the OCC's rules require submission of an affirmative exercise notice for all exercises even in circumstances where a Contrary Exercise Advice is not required to be submitted to the Exchange. See Amendment No. 3,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subsection (e) to Commentary .04 provides that the failure of any member to follow the procedures set forth in Commentary .04 may be referred to the Ethics and Business Conduct Committee and result in the assessment of a fine, which may include, but is not limited to, disgorgement of potential economic gain obtained or loss avoided by the subject exercise, as determined by the Ethics and Business Conduct Committee. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> If any member relies on one of the exceptions to Rule 6.24(b) as the basis for the failure of the member to comply with the procedures set forth in new Commentary .04, the burden shall be on the member to establish the grounds for the exception. Telephone conversation between Michael Pierson, Senior Attorney, Market Regulation, PSE, and Brad Ritter, Senior Counsel, OMS, Division, Commission, on October 6, 1994. The only exceptions to Rule 6.24 are: (1) To remedy mistakes or errors made in good faith; (2) to take appropriate action as the result of a failure to reconcile unmatched Exchange transactions; and (3) where exceptional circumstances relating to a customer's or member's ability to communicate exercise instructions to a member organization (or a member organization's ability to receive such exercise instructions) prior to the Exercise Cut-Off Time warrant such action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / What to do when Chaps can't cope: Reform of UK bank settlements procedures aims to reduce risk to the financial system It is lunchtime on Friday October 13 1995, and a large UK bank is failing. Its capital has been wiped out by the collapse of several big companies and catastrophic falls in markets. As rumours spread through London money markets, its credit dries up, and it starts to lose deposits. At an emergency meeting attended by the governor of the Bank of England, the bank's board agrees to close the bank at the end of the day so that it can be recapitalised in an orderly way. But Mr Eddie George, the governor, knows that an even larger problem is looming. He phones Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board, to warn him that London's payment systems are about to grind to a halt. The difficulty stems from the bank's status as a clearer, one of a privileged breed which has existed in the UK since the 1770s. It is one of 16 which pass Pounds 100bn - in large electronic payments and cheques - through the clearing system each day. As well as big UK banks, Citibank, Deutsche Bank and Credit Lyonnais also have such status. By lunch the bank owes billions of pounds to other banks in the Clearing House Automated Payment System (Chaps). It has sent them thousands of computer messages authorising immediate payments on behalf of large customers such as quoted companies and financial institutions. But although the other banks have credited cash to customers' accounts immediately, they have not received the money. That should happen late in the afternoon, when promises are totted up. At that moment, if Bank A owes Bank B Pounds 8.1bn and is in turn owed Pounds 7.8bn by Bank B, it should pay Bank B Pounds 300m. Mr George has been warned that Bank A is about to refuse to settle. It intends to retain the Pounds 8bn it is likely to promise today, until it has received an injection of public money and is certain it can pay. This could not only cripple another clearer - the nine largest UK banks have only Pounds 24bn in equity and reserves - but force suspension of the Chaps system. Currency markets would halt, because 45 per cent of the money passed through Chaps is the sterling half of foreign exchange contracts. Mr George curses his luck at having come close to avoiding catastrophe, but failing at the last . . . This nightmare has two years left to come true. After that, the Bank of England hopes to have banished it to the realm of fantasy. 'There is a real but avoidable risk to the financial system, and we could not just sit back and tolerate it,' says Ms Merlyn Lowther, the Bank's deputy chief cashier. The solution which clearing banks have agreed with the Bank involves abolishing net settlement at the end of the day. Banks will instead settle their big payments to each other in full as accounts are credited, so eliminating the hours during which they pile up obligations. Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) should allow regulatory authorities to take a troubled bank out of the system without disrupting others. If it was settling its accounts instantly, it would not owe anything when it was shut down. 'It means that when you stop the clock, you can make a clean break. The whole payments system does not have to seize up while you sort out the mess,' says Ms Lowther. Real-time cash settlement could also allow instant settlement of securities contracts. In addition, if all countries achieved real-time settlement, the systems could be linked to eliminate delays in settlement of foreign exchange contracts across time zones. The latter is a long-held ambition of central bankers since the 1974 collapse of Herstatt, a German bank. Because of different time zones, customers who bought the D-Mark halves of thousands of foreign exchange contracts were left unpaid when the bank collapsed before they were paid the corresponding amounts in dollars through US banks. For central bankers concerned with payment systems, RTGS sounds like a perfect world. But it is not a one-way bet for the UK clearing banks. They not only face paying more for a service which has been cheap until now, but could have to alter balance sheets in a way that squeezes profit margins. Further, some central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, operate real-time settlement commercially, charging banks for providing cash to oil the system. Others, such as the Bank of France, have created resentment by trying to impose their blueprint of real-time settlement on commercial banks. When faced in 1992 with the possibility of being strong-armed into an expensive and difficult new world, some UK bankers argued that settlement was only one of many risks. Thus it was illogical to single it out for attack. A bank takes risks every time it lends cash, or enters a securities contract. But settlement risk is unlike other forms of banking risk for two reasons. The first is that it is virtually impossible to control who participates in the system. When they lend money, banks can probe the strength of those they are dealing with, either by checking the credit record of a person, or looking up the rating of a company. But when they clear payments from other banks, it is impossible in practice to carry out such vetting. They must honour instructions from all companies which are customers of a fellow bank. They can impose overall limits on their indebtedness to other banks - a method introduced in Chaps in 1992 - but this is a crude method of limiting risk. The second unique characteristic of settlement risk is that it is hard to charge appropriately for it. A bank covers the higher risk of lending to a bad borrower by charging more. But when it clears payments from other banks, it is impractical to levy anything other than a flat transaction charge. These two factors were instrumental in persuading banks to adopt a real-time system in stages from the end of 1995. 'Once you establish that real-time settlement is cost-effective, the argument against it is very weak,' says Mr Eric Sepkes, a Citibank vice-president who headed negotiations with the Bank of England on behalf of the commercial banks. Having agreed the principle of RTGS, the UK banks and the Bank of England have only one big issue to resolve. This is how much the Bank will charge participants to cover the running costs of a real-time system. It has promised a charge of 'pence rather than pounds' for each of the 40,000 daily Chaps transactions. Instead of building another system, the banks have adapted Chaps. When it switches to real-time, each payment message between banks will be forwarded electronically to the Bank's computer. This will send back authorisation for the transfer providing that the paying bank has money to cover it. Rather than the Bank providing this liquidity and charging for it - as in the US - banks will provide it themselves. They will deposit liquid assets such as Treasury bills with the Bank, which will take them as collateral for cash payments made across the system. They will have to have enough collateral to cover settlements at any point in the day. This has potentially far-reaching consequences for banks because the liquid assets they will deposit with the Bank earn them less interest than do loans to companies or individuals. If the real-time settlement system forces them to buy more liquid assets, it could squeeze their margins. But the system will give banks an incentive to keep their payment flows even during the day in order to minimise holdings of liquid assets. All banks are working on computerised financial models to ensure that they can manage flows of liquid assets in a real-time system as cheaply as possible. 'At the margin, it may affect banks' profits, but in a sense they have escaped lightly until now because they have not had to provide liquidity,' says Mr Charles Bryant, a consultant to the banks' Association for Payment Clearing Services who has co-ordinated development work on RTGS. By 1996, the Bank of England should thus have eliminated a catastrophic risk to the UK financial system. It would be unlucky to have an accident in the meanwhile. But bankers may at least pause for thought on the four Friday the 13ths before then.</p>

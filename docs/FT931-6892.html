			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (7): Be sure it's your tune the piper plays - Fees v Commission NO FINANCIAL advice comes free. One way or another, you will have to pay for it. This may grate, but advisers need to earn a living. The problem is how they should do this. There are two basic methods of remuneration: fees, where you pay the adviser according to time and effort spent; and commissions, where the product provider pays the adviser a proportion of the money spent on the product. Theoretically, as far as the consumer is concerned, there is no contest. An adviser paid by fee is your agent, with no incentive to offer any particular product or any particular company. Thus, he or she can offer genuinely 'independent' advice. A commission-charging adviser, on the other hand, is being paid by the product provider, and has a natural bias to be its agent, and not yours. Such advisers may not suggest non-commission products such as National Savings or investment trusts to their clients. What makes this worse is that commissions vary from product to product and from company to company. Until 1989 they were capped by the Maximum Commissions Agreement, but this was abolished, in a move which the industry bitterly opposed, and commissions have risen since. Also, when buying from direct sales forces, or from tied agents of insurance companies, such as most building societies, the system of incentives for sales staff can be camouflaged in the figures. You have the right to ask an independent adviser how much commission he is receiving, but this does not, unfortunately, apply to those who can only sell the products of one company. In practice, however, the commission-charging system has survived intact because many consumers will not write out a cheque to an intermediary. They are certainly unlikely to write out cheques for amounts equivalent to the sums the insurance companies are paying advisers in commission. Fee-charging advisers have a market among better-off people who are used to paying fees for lawyers and accountants, but their chances of expanding must await a change in attitude by the British public. How much commission do you pay on the standard investment products? Endowment Policies: According to a survey conducted last year by Lautro, the life assurance regulator, the average commission on a 25-year mortgage-linked endowment with Pounds 50 monthly premiums in 1991 was Pounds 570 to a tied agent (a category which includes most building societies) and Pounds 498 to an independent adviser. Total premiums in the first year would be Pounds 600. Total range was, for tied agents, from Pounds 435.60 to Pounds 641.52, and for independents from Pounds 419.76 to Pounds 578.16. This tempts advisers both to sell an endowment, when a repayment mortgage on its own will usually not yield any commission at all, and to recommend one high commission company rather than another. The law does not allow an adviser to recommend one company rather than another solely because it pays a higher commission, but it is hard to believe that life offices would offer more commission unless it had an effect. Personal Pensions: Commissions again reach high levels. Lautro's survey found that the commission on the average 25-year individual personal pension is 62 per cent of the first year's premium. For 10-year pensions it would take a bite of 29 per cent. Again, commissions are higher if you go to a tied agent, such as most building society - 69 per cent of first year's premiums were taken from 25-year pensions, and 34 per cent from 10-year plans. Facilities for rebating commission, or reinvesting it in the contract, tend to be more advanced than they are for endowments. Single-premium Bonds: The Lautro survey revealed that, out of Pounds 1,000, Pounds 52 would probably go to an appointed agent and Pounds 52 to an independent adviser. Unit Trusts: Three percentage points of the front-end charge are meant as commission for the adviser. Lautro found that the average commission out of an investment of Pounds 1000 was Pounds 32 for tied agents and Pounds 31 for independents. The same norm applies to unit trust Peps. This is a steady industry standard, although Lazards and Murray Johnstone have cut their front-end charge by removing the commissions. Note the hefty incentive this provides to offer single premium bonds, life assurance element and all, rather than unit trusts, and endowments, rather than Peps, for mortgage repayment. Investment Trusts: Normally you would only pay a brokers fee for making the transaction. However, several investment trust managers have taken to offering 3 per cent commission to independent advisers. This has helped them in the race against unit trusts in recent years. Gilts: You can buy them through the National Savings Stock Register at the post office, and no commission as such is payable. The administration charge is Pounds 1 for the first Pounds 250 you buy, and 50p for each subsequent Pounds 125 on top of this. National Savings: No commission is payable. You can buy them from a post office, for no charge. Tessas: No commission is payable - they are normally bought direct from a building society, whose expenses have been taken into account in the rate of interest on offer. Arm yourself with this information when going to an adviser. But there are also can be dangers in the 'fee-charging' system. If someone charges you a fee, make sure you know the exact basis on which fees will be charged in advance. If they advise you to buy a commission-charging product, make sure that commission is accounted for  - there is certainly no merit in paying both fees and commission. Also, commission is only one of the factors behind your choice of investment. It may be worth paying high commissions for performance, but you should have strong evidence of good performance before paying over-the-odds; other things being equal, low charges should boost the performance of your investment in the long run.</p>

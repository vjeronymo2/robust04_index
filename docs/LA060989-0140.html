			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> The Major League Players Assn. filed a grievance on behalf of Albert Hall,  former outfielder for the Atlanta Braves, who was released this spring after  voluntarily seeking treatment for alcohol abuse.  </P> <P> Upon completion of a 28-day program, Hall, 31, rejoined the team March 22,  appeared in two spring training games as a pinch-runner and never got an at-bat  before being unconditionally released March 31.  </P> <P> Eugene Orza, assistant general counsel for the players' union, said, "They  didn't give him a chance to make the team."  </P> <P> Hall signed a minor league contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates May 23 and has  since played for their triple-A affiliate in Buffalo.  </P> <P> The union argued that Hall should have been sent to the Braves' triple-A  affiliate in Richmond, Va., as part of his rehabilitation, thereby allowing him  to continue drawing his major league salary.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 4-AA GIRLS;  </P> <P> ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL, COUNTY TEAMS FACE UPHILL ROAD  </P> <P> The nine Orange County teams in the Southern Section girls' 4-AA basketball  playoffs differ in many ways, but nearly all share one attribute: Hope.  </P> <P> Of course, it will take more than hope to knock off Muir, the top-seeded team.  Muir (22-5) is led by Rose Jung, an all-Southern Section point guard who's  extremely quick, and 5-foot 10-inch forward Karen Banks.  </P> <P> "Muir probably has as much talent as anyone," Woodbridge Coach Eric Bangs said.  "They're loaded with talent. But they seemed to play up and down this season  too."  </P> <P> Woodbridge (20-4), the second-seeded team, and Tustin (21-5) are generally  regarded as the county's best hopes.  </P> <P> Leslie Rathbun, a 5-7 guard, leads Woodbridge, the county's 10th-ranked team,  with 13.5 points and 5.7 steals a game.  </P> <P> The Warriors have a first-round bye, then play the winner of Loara (13-10) and  California(16-6) in Saturday's second round.  </P> <P> Tustin, the Sea View League champion, is young, with junior point guard Wanda  Sequeira (12 points, eight assists), 5-11 sophomore forward Christine Garner  (16 points, 11 rebounds), and 5-10 sophomore forward Sheri Needham as the core  of an offense-oriented team.  </P> <P> "We don't play a lot of defense," Coach Rick Falk said.  </P> <P> That could certainly hurt the Tillers if they make it to their probable  second-round matchup against Mission Viejo. The Diablos (18-8) feature 6-3  center Jennifer Rohrig, who leads the county with 19.5 rebounds and 19.9 points  a game.  </P> <P> Edison, an at-large team at 15-8, is considered a dark horse favorite.  Especially with 5-6 guard Debbie Fischer, who last week scored a school-record  49 points that included 10 three-pointers, tying her own Southern Section  record for three-pointers in a game.  </P> <P> Although Edison, which plays at Arlington (16-7) in tonight's first round,  suffered from streaky play through the season, most of that could be attributed  to a knee injury to Fischer, who is now healthy.  </P> <P> And although the Chargers might still be without 5-8 junior forward Laura Vinch  -- she cut her finger while working at a sandwich shop and has missed the past  two games -- Edison has been gaining momentum.  </P> <P> "Coming out of the Sunset League, I feel that's a strength in itself,"  first-year coach Philip Abraham said. "It's like playing a tournament every  game."  </P> <P> Valencia (14-10), the defending champion, might not be as strong as last  season, but most coaches say the Tigers always improve at playoff time.  </P> <P> One of the best first-round games tonight should be San Clemente (15-10) at  University (18-5). The two teams met in a scrimmage last summer, and then again  in the final of the Santa Ana Valley tournament. University, which is led by  5-8 senior forward Denise Gandara, won both games by close scores.  </P> <P> DEFENDING CHAMPION -- Valencia.  </P> <P> TOP TEAMS -- Muir (22-5), Westlake (20-4), Woodbridge (21-4).  </P> <P> DARK HORSES -- Tustin (21-5), Edison (15-8), Valencia (14-10).  </P> <P> BEST DRAW -- Tustin, will open with at-large Torrance (15-10), then the winner  of Claremont (9-11)/Mission Viejo (18-8).  </P> <P> WORST DRAW -- University (17-5) must meet San Clemente (15-10), a team that it  narrowly beat in a summer scrimmage and as well as in the Santa Ana Valley  tournament. A game later, it probably will meet top-seeded Muir.  </P> <P> KEY PLAYERS -- Karen Banks (Muir), Tracy Titus (Loara), Alisa Stevenson (J.W.  North) and Debbie Fischer (Edison).  </P> <P> NOTEWORTHY -- Of the 27 teams, only four have records under .500, making it one  of the strongest divisions in the playoffs.  </P></p>

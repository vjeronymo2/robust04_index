			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mirza Sadikovic] </F>   [Text] Today, the joint aggressors stepped up their attacks  on the Bihac region [words indistinct]. As regards their  furious assaults, the initiative was taken by the members of the  treacherous Kladusa paramilitaries [Fikret Abdic's forces], who  in the early hours of this morning started pounding the  demarcation lines with all their artillery and other weapons.  There were also very heavy attacks in Cazin's border areas  [words indistinct].    In addition to this they are trying to infiltrate commando  groups. The attacks are being spearheaded by gangs of hardened  criminals and mercenaries who leave devastation in their wake.  There is a considerable number of casualties, fatalities, and  seriously wounded people, in the wake of today's murderous  attacks. Abdic's mercenaries continue to launch artillery  attacks in other areas. [passage indistinct]</p>

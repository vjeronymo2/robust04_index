The meeting, which ends tonight, was called by Costa Rica.  However, Ecuador, the world's top banana-producing country;  Panama; Honduras; and Guatemala were not present, and only the  host country, Colombia, Venezuela, and Nicaragua showed up for  the meeting.    Prior to the meeting, which got under way after an hour's  delay, Costa Rican Foreign Trade Minister Roberto Rojas said the  countries that had not attended the meeting "do not agree" on  presenting a counterproposal to the EU's 14 December offer,  which is now being studied in San Jose.</p>

			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KID BEAT: UNEVEN START AT SERENDIPITY WITH '4TH GRADE NOTHING'  </P> <P> Three-year-old Farley Drexel Hatcher, Fudge for short -- is driving 10-year-old  brother Peter bonkers. He is noisy, messes up Peter's homework, sends Peter's  pet turtle Dribble to a dark fate that no turtle deserves, and his birthday  party is the stuff of parental nightmares.  </P> <P> Worst of all, everyone thinks he is so cute. Poor Peter.  </P> <P> The new Serendipity Theatre Company at the Coronet, Los Angeles' only  full-time, Equity-contract children's theater, is off to a rambunctiously  funny, but uneven start with its version of the comic "Tales of a Fourth Grade  Nothing," based on Judy Blume's super children's book.  </P> <P> If W.C. Fields were around, he would avoid this show like the plague. On  opening night, tiny, 6-year-old Klee Bragger, a natural as Fudge, captivated a  delighted audience every time he appeared. Breathy audience Awwwws greeted him  throughout. (L. R. Davidson alternates in some performances.)  </P> <P> Josh Wheeler as Peter, and professionals Lauren Cole and Tim Kahle as Mom and  Dad, along with Joyce Guy, Katy Henk and David Nathan Schwartz in multiple  roles, bowed to the inevitable and provided enthusiastic backup.  </P> <P> The glitch is in the staging. Some timing lags and uncertain light cues are  correctable, but two of co-directors Jody Johnston-Davidson's and Scott  Davidson's choices are more problematic. They have given their cast an obstacle  course of black-and-white cartoon-style sets and props. The look is appealing,  but the clutter blocks audience sight lines and gives the actors too much  maneuvering to think about.  </P> <P> And, although they get laughs, the adults playing secondary child roles loom  over the diminutive Klee and look and sound out of place next to the real  thing. This makes Blume's famous tinkle scene appear unnecessarily coy.  </P> <P> Crisper staging would do justice to Bruce Mason's hoot of a script. Even so,  parents can be prepared for frequent repetitions of dialogue; this fatherly  riposte was gleefully repeated by young theatergoers: "Eat it or wear it!"  </P> <P>  At 366 N. La Cienega Blvd., West Hollywood, through Nov. 25, Fridays-Saturdays  at 7:30 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 p.m., Sundays at 1 and 4 p.m. $6 per child (13 and  younger); $10 per adult. (213) 652-9199.  </P></p>

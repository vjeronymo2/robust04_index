			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Adnan al-Lughani] </F>   [Text] The ministers of defense and health have stated that  Kuwait, in the aftermath of the Kuwait liberation war, is free  of any abnormal diseases.    This came in remarks made after taking part in a meeting of  the Environment Committee of the National Assembly. Minister of  Defense Shaykh 'Ali Sabah al-Salim has dismissed as utterly  groundless foreign press reports, as carried in local press,  that chemical materials were used in the war for the liberation  of Kuwait. He regretted that the press has carried such news  reports, which only aim to shake the citizens' confidence and  make them believe that the earth and climate in our country are  polluted with bacteriological germs. This is untrue, he noted.    In a related development, Minister of Health Dr.  'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Fawzan, who, along with several Health  Ministry officials, took part in the meeting, has stated that  official statistics and studies conducted in the country are  reassuring. These statistics and studies showed that the  figures for birth deformities, miscarriages, cancer, and  dermatological diseases reported before the Iraqi invasion of  the country remained unchanged in the aftermath of this invasion.    The minister added that the amount of radiation in the  atmosphere in the State of Kuwait is within normal ranges. He  went on to say that the reported infection of some U.S. troops  serving in the Gulf with a certain disease was caused by a skin  rash precipitated by cutaneous leishmaniasis and the so-called  oriental sore. This, in turn, was caused by sandflies, which  are very common in the Arabian Peninsula and Iran. These  infections are limited and natural, the health minister noted.    Dr. al-Fawzan maintained that the ministry does not agree  with the reports published in newspapers in this regard. The  ministry regards such reports as unreliable. The ministry only  trusts the WHO releases, which have dismissed as groundless  reports that abnormal diseases surfaced in Kuwait in the  aftermath of the liberation war. He added that the WHO had  taken part in several of the studies the Health Ministry  conducted in Kuwait.    The minister noted that the local news media must play a  great role in enlightening citizens and assuring them about the  health situation in the country. These media must also contact  Ministry of Health officials when they receive any pertinent  reports from foreign sources, he added.    For his part, Dr. Nasir Sirkhuh, rapporteur of the  Environment Committee of the National Assembly, said that the  committee raised this issue with the Ministry of Defense and the  Ministry of Health after international news reports surfaced  that some strange diseases spread in the region in the aftermath  of the Kuwait liberation war, and that U.S. troops caught these  diseases. He added that meetings with officials of the two  ministries confirmed that these press reports are groundless,  and that the health situation in the country is sound. Contrary  to these reports, he noted, statistics have shown an improvement  in many areas of the health situation in Kuwait, compared to the  situation before the occupation.    Dr. Sirkhuh concluded by saying that he is not aware of the  motives behind these tendentious press reports.</p>

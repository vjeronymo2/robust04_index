			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "US-Malaysia: A Better Future"] </F>   [Text] "When the United States sneezes, the rest of the  world catches the flu," is one of those rare pieces of wit that  reveals far more than it presumes to laugh off. Countries feel  uncomfortable enough about their vulnerability to American  cultural contagion when it is inadvertent. But when the  American bug is set forth as an outbreak of deliberate policy,  they feel more than entitled to expostulate.    The expostulations can often seem like rabid  anti-Americanism, but for many, particularly among the smaller  countries, it evinces a helpless inability to resist the on-rush  of American dogma and its policy consequences. This is where  Washington so often gets it wrong. America asserts the right to  spread its own gospel simply because it has the best means for  doing so; while the "flu-prone" nations see their political  sovereignty and cultural independence threatened by the  corrosion of the worst incidental and side effects of that  gospel.    It is where America's preaching of its gospel is  contradicted  by the cynicism of its own national interests that expostulation  rises to protest. Nowhere else is that more telling than in  Asia and Bosnia. In this continent, America's broader aims from  "engagement", through ramifying trade and business ties, may be  turned round for the narrow purposes of retaliation. In trade,  for example, America encourages imports from Asian countries  only to hold their export market positions hostage to an  extraneous agenda, such as on democracy, human rights and labour  standards. It reserves the legislative right in the so-called  super 301 provision to employ this trade-war option in defiance  of its GATT avowals.    Much of Washington's insensivitiy and dogmatism, however,  arises from its distance, both literally and metaphorically,  from those affected by its policies. The meeting between  President Clinton and Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir  Mohamed on Saturday showed that when much of this distance is  physically bridged, considerable space can be found for common  ground. Part of the reason why that space appears so narrow is  a matter of attitude and perception. The latter two are too  often infused by the hubris that comes from America's  pre-eminent power and position in the global order.    "One should try to convince by pointing out right and wrong  rather than anything which might be interpreted as  arm-twisting," Dr. Mahathir told Clinton. Developing nations'  nervousness to American bullying is more than justified by  recent history. The US, no doubt, would insist that it means  well and that it is often mispercieved. Misperceptions are the  first to be brushed away by the cordial and candid meeting of  leaderships. On Bosnia, for example, Clinton was disscovered to  be highly sympathetic but added that nations were constrained in  their power to act. This admission, however, only extenuates  America's culpability.    Clinton has also shown himself to be a considerable  departure  from the yankee conservatism of the Bush and Reagan years.  Responsive rather than antagonistic to the concerns of countries  such as Malaysia for greater intra-regional economic relations,  the president has softened the previous hard line on APEC and  the EAEC. Above all, Clinton has shown that he takes Malaysia  and its leader seriously. He has respected the right of small  nations facing the "flu" to berate the sniffling political and  economic levia than to take some medicine of its own first.</p>

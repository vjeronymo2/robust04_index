			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with HCR President Monsignor Laurent Monsengwo by </F> Didier Grogna in Brussels; date not given: "Monsengwo Still  Believes in Political Dialogue"]    [Text] Last week, at the end of fierce debates, the High  Council of the Republic [HCR]-Zairian Transitional Parliament  [PT] finally adopted the constitutional law, the veritable  reference for the transition to democracy. On Saturday [9  April], the law was promulgated. In particular, it offers the  opposition a 10-day period in which to present a consensus prime  minister accepted by presidential circles. Etienne Tshisekedi,  the prime minister elected by the National Conference, will not  necessarily be reelected to his post because the text adopted  does not refer to that National Conference. However, the latter  considered that the prime minister is an institution on the same  basis as the president of the Republic, the president of the  HCR, the courts and tribunals. For Tshisekedi's supporters, the  adopted text betrays the spirit of the former CNS [Sovereign  National Conference] and gives too prominent a role to  presidential circles and hence to Mobutu himself. According to  these people, the responsibility for this betrayal rests mainly  with HCR President Monsignor Laurent Monsengwo. On his way to  Rome, where he will spend a month taking part in the first synod  of African bishops, he made a brief stopover in Brussels. This  provided an opportunity to ask him for some clarifications on  the latest political developments in Zaire.    [Grogna] The HCR-PT has just ended its work and the text has  been promulgated. Has the best solution been found?    [Monsengwo] We needed a transitional constitution that  satisfied the whole political class. The first constitution,  stemming from the CNS and adopted by the whole political class,  experienced some difficulties. That led to consultations. The  agreement reached in the past few days on a constitutional law  based on the same fundamental principles and the same  institutional order as the CNS is a very important event. This  document, accepted by all, will make it possible to put the  country back on track.    [Grogna] You say "accepted by all." However a section of the  opposition does not seem to support it....    [Monsengwo] As far as I know, the document has been adopted  in an entirely valid way from the legal viewpoint and according  to the parliamentary customs. The famous Article 76 with the  formula that gives the opposition the initiative in choosing the  prime minister and requires it to inform presidential circles of  this, was voted on in the normal way. That left a minor point  of disagreement on the fact that the HCR takes control of the  issue if there is disagreement within the political class; it  has been removed because we found a compromise wording which  satisfied the concerns of all sides. The disputed phrase has  become: "Once this period is over (10 days -- L'ECHO editor's  note), the HCR takes control of the issue."    This document has therefore been adopted in an absolutely  proper way. I think that there is not the slightest doubt and  that the document will not be resubmitted to the plenary session  because the latter has given full powers to the office to verify  that the text is in order. That has been done.    The document has therefore been adopted by everybody and  even  the USORAS [Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition], which left  during the vote, came back for the closing ceremony.    [Grogna] You spoke of difficulties encountered by the  transitional document adopted by the CNS. Some importants  points from that document seem to have been excluded, like the  one making provision for the prime minister to be one of the  transitional institutions....    [Monsengwo] Certain points were not excluded. We simply left  it to those who refer to the CNS institutional order to act  accordingly. It is for them to say what they believe.    [Grogna] Knowing very well that, if they continue to support  Tshisekedi, there will be deadlock....    [Monsengwo] I do not see why there should be deadlock. The  question is why some people express reservations about  Tshisekedi. They must have a motive and the opposition can try  to find a solution to this problem. The opposition should  respond to the reasoned views of the various sides to reassure  them.    Dialogue is vital. We aim to create a government of national  unity. It cannot be formed without consultation and dialogue.  This dialogue must start at the level of the appointment of the  prime minister in order to encourage the formation of the  government. It is not enough to impose a prime minister, those  who are appointed to work with him must agree to join his  government. The problems connected with the formation of such a  government can be cleared up during discussions relating to the  prime minister. We must succeed in reassuring each other.    I do not see things in terms of deadlock but in terms of  consultation during which each expresses his viewpoint and  reassures the others. Zaire's real problem is a problem of  mutual guarantee. It serves no purpose to try to impose things.    [Grogna] The scenario therefore makes provision for the  opposition to present a candidate accepted by presidential  circles. Does that rule out Etienne Tshisekedi?    [Monsengwo] It does not automatically rule him out. But it  is important to understand what has happened. We were faced  with two camps which were based on a different institutional  order. For some, there was a power vacuum at the top and it was  therefore necessary to elect a prime minister; for the others,  there was no vacuum. We wanted to prevent this problem of the  power vacuum handicapping the work of the HCR. Indeed, the  power vacuum is a constitutional problem which falls within the  scope of the Supreme Court of Justice. Resorting to it would  have taken time because of the legal procedures. That is why we  asked each side to withdraw its demands.    Some were asked to stop talking about electing the prime  minister; others to stop referring to election during the CNS  which was no longer vital. The constitutional problem of the  power vacuum was therefore left to one side and it was left to  the opposition, which invokes the CNS' institutional order, to  act accordingly and appoint the prime minister. This order  makes provision for the prime minister to be able to leave his  office. This means in general that the opposition can confirm  him or change him according to the situation.    [Grogna] Has the president given you guarantees? This is not  the first time that he has announced his involvement but has  done nothing.    [Monsengwo] The president is an institution on the same  basis  as the HCR-PT, the government, the courts and tribunals. Each  of us must shoulder his responsibilities, in accordance with the  constitutional text which governs us. The head of state is a  participant in the dialogue. He has no special guarantee to  give, other than those stemming from the constitutional text.    [Grogna] Do you have assurances that he will adhere to that  text?    [Monsengwo] I do not see why he should not. He has followed  the discussions relating to this text and the principles which  underlie the texts have been accepted by his political family.    [Grogna] This would not be the first time that he had failed  to follow the recommendations of his political family. There  have been precedents in recent years and especially during the  CNS....    [Monsengwo] I do not think there have been precedents aside  from the institutional order which has not been accepted because  presidential circles had left the CNS debating hall. It is  important to know whether or not it left at the president's  behest.    [Grogna] Your theme has always been "no winners or losers."  Have you succeeded in ensuring that?    [Monsengwo] Yes, I think so. We have arrived at a series of  points of agreement which have been drawn up into an  institutional system accepted by everybody, because even those  who left the hall returned.    We hope that the appointment of the prime minister will take  place in the same spirit of cooperation with a great degree of  concessions on all sides.    [Grogna] Do you think that the political class will succeed  in appointing a prime minister in 10 days?    [Monsengwo] I do not see why it should not succeed. If it is  not possible, we will assess the situation in the HCR and ask  the question of how a solution can be found.    [Grogna] If Etienne Tshisekedi is not the opposition's  candidate, who is now likely to resist the president's pressures?    [Monsengwo] I do not want to concern myself with this  question of candidates. I am dealing with principles, not  individuals. I have never had anybody in mind.    [Grogna] The press is accusing you of betrayal....    [Monsengwo] There are two possibilities. Either these people  who are saying that do not understand the subtlety of the  approaches or they are insincere. Or perhaps they have never  read the mechanisms of the institutional system which we have  just set up. Anybody who knows these texts cannot claim that the  CNS' institutional system has been betrayed.    [Grogna] You are going to spend one month in Rome; Joseph  Ileo, the HCR first vice president is very ill and is receiving  treatment in Belgium. This therefore means that the HCR will be  chaired by the second vice president who is a member of  presidential circles....    [Monsengwo] First, I think that the HCR settlement is fairly  clear. I do not have to be there for the prime minister's  appointment. The office is organized in such a way that my  absence does not present any problem. With regard to the second  vice president acting as chairman, I think that everybody must  realize that the HCR office is everybody's office and not just a  bipolar body.    [Grogna] What are your thoughts on the events in Rwanda?    [Monsengwo] These are very painful events. I hope that the  situation can return to normal as quickly as possible in the  framework of a democratic system.    [Grogna] Could the Rwandan lesson benefit the Zairians?    [Monsengwo] I think that we have always avoided violence. I  hope that the Zairians will continue to rely on nonviolence for  the solution to the problems facing us because our country must  get back to work.</p>

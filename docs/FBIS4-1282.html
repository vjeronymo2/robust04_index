			<p>BFN     [Text] In Rwanda the unilateral cease-fire declared by the  Patriotic Front [RPF] is due to come into force at 2200 GMT.  However, this end to the fighting is conditional on an end to  the massacres. Meanwhile, massacres and fighting are continuing  in the capital, Kigali.    On the diplomatic and military fronts the situation is  deadlocked between the two warring factions. The interim  government has announced its own cease-fire from Zaire. Any  dialogue seems more and more unlikely. Here is the foreign  minister of the transitional government, Jerome Bicamumpaka:    [Begin recording] [Bicamumpaka] If the RPF wants to talk  with  the Rwandan army over the heads of the government, this is not  possible. On the other hand, if the RPF wants to negotiate with  soldiers under the authority of the Rwandan government, I  believe that we can take the necessary steps to enable such a  dialogue. The RPF cannot hope to dictate anything by refusing  to recognize our government. I believe that the RPF is not  sincere when it speaks of a cease-fire; had it been sincere it  would not have started the hostilities on 6 and 7 April. This  time, however, if the RPF, taking note of developments in the  military sphere, in the political sphere, is changing its mind,  if it wants a genuine cease-fire with proper guarantees, then we  are ready to negotiate with the RPF, but we do not trust its  statements.    [Correspondent Dominique de Courcelles] You, the government,  have for your part declared a unilateral cease-fire, too. What  is the situation regarding this cease-fire?    [Bicamumpaka] [Words indistinct] of the Zairean president,  we  proposed a cease-fire. We hope that the Zairean president will  forward this proposal to the RPF and that the latter will accept  it. Either we negotiate and we have peace, or, if we do not want  peace, if the RPF wants war, we hope to defeat it militarily.  [end recording]</p>

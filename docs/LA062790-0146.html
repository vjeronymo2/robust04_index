			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TRADE, NOT AID, WILL CURE LATIN ILLS, BUSH SAYS  </P> <P> President Bush today said he wants to bolster Latin American economies with a  new partnership that includes a free trade zone encompassing the American  hemisphere.  </P> <P> "The prosperity of our hemisphere depends on trade, not aid," Bush said in an  address to Latin American diplomats in the White House East Room.  </P> <P> "We must forge a genuine partnership for free-market reform," he said.  </P> <P> Seeking to allay the fears of regional leaders that their problems have been  overshadowed by the move toward democracy and market economies in most of  Eastern Europe, Bush declared:  </P> <P> "We look forward to the day when not only are the Americas the first fully free  democratic hemisphere -- but when all are equal partners in a free trade zone  stretching from the port of Anchorage to Tierra del Fuego."  </P> <P> He said that barriers to free trade won't fall overnight, but that Washington  is prepared to enter free trade agreements with countries in Latin America.  </P> <P> Bush also said the Latin American "investment climate remains clouded by the  heavy burden of debt" and announced "a major initiative to reduce Latin  American and the Caribbean's official debt to the United States."  </P> <P> The new approach represents an implicit admission that the so-called Brady Plan  for debt relief has fallen short of its goals.  </P> <P> That plan, unveiled by U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady in March,  1989, was intended to free funds for new investment by reducing the debt load  of Latin American and other debtor nations through negotiations with creditor  banks.  </P></p>

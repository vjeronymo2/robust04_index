			<p>BFN     [Text] Five domestic semiconductor wafer makers plan to  drastically increase production of 8-inch silicon wafers during  the current fiscal year. Shin-Etsu Semiconductor Co. Ltd., the  largest among the five companies, plans to begin operating a new  plant in Malaysia in July. In addition, the company plans to  enlarge its facilities in both Japan and the United States in  order to double its current production to 200,000 units monthly.  Sumitomo Shichikkusu Co. [name as published] plans to invest a  total of 10 billion yen in plants and equipment to double its  monthly output to 140,000 units by the first half of fiscal year  1995. The other three major silicon wafer makers are Komatsu  Electronic Metals Co. (located in Hiratsuka, Kanagawa  Prefecture); Mitsubishi Material Silicon Co. (located in Noda,  Chiba Prefecture); and Toshiba Ceramics Co.; together, the five  wafer makers will double their current total output to  450,000-500,000 units monthly. Wafer makers plan to step up  their output sharply because domestic semiconductor makers have  successively indicated plans to use 8-inch wafers for their  products.    Shin-Etsu, which supplies nearly 50 percent of the required  amount of 8-inch wafers in Japan, plans to double its current  monthly output of 100,000 units to 200,000 units during the  current fiscal year. The first phase has been completed in the  construction of an 8-inch wafer manufacturing plant in Malaysia  for which the company plans to spend a total of 20 billion yen.  The new plant will start operating in July with a capacity to  produce 65,000 units monthly. The company also plans to step up  8-inch wafer production at the Shirakawa factory (located in  Fukushima Prefecture), its principal factory, and the "SEH  America," its subsidiary manufacturing company in the United  States.    Sumitomo Shichikkusu plans to gradually build up its  facilities at the Imari factory (located in Saga Prefecture) and  increase its current monthly output of 70,000 units to 100,000  units during the current fiscal year. It then plans to increase  monthly output to 140,000 units in the first half of fiscal year  1995. It expects to spend a total of 10 billion yen in the  process.    Komatsu Electronic Metals Co. plans to build up its  principle  factory in Nagasaki to increase its current monthly output of  30,000-40,000 units to 60,000-70,000 units during the current  fiscal year.    Mitsubishi Material Silicon Co. also plans to double its  current monthly output of 40,000 units to 80,000 units during  the current fiscal year. In addition to building up its Ikuno  factory (located in Hyogo Prefecture), the company now plans to  start manufacturing 8-inch wafers at "Syntech," its U.S.  subsidiary.    Toshiba Ceramics Co. plans to increase its current monthly  output of several thousand units to 10,000 units during the  current fiscal year. The company supplies silicon wafers mainly  to Toshiba Corporation.    In view of a shift to full-fledged production of 16-megabit  dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips, semiconductor makers,  such as the NEC Corporation and Hitachi Ltd., plan to use 8-inch  wafers since these yield 200 chips, while 6-inch wafers yield  only 100 chips.</p>

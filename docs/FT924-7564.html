			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Arts: Wexford Trilogy - Theatre On the first three Saturdays in December it is possible to see all three plays in Billy Roche's Wexford Trilogy performed on the same day. Since London's tiny Bush Theatre will be almost certainly booked out, it may be wise to try to catch any one of them while they appear separately on week nights. The order does not greatly matter. Each play stands on its own. What they have in common, apart from the authorship, is a huge amount of insight into life in a small Irish town and a marvellous cast directed by Robert Lefevre. The first, A Handful of Stars, is set in a billiard parlour, the second, Poor Beast in the Rain, in a betting shop, while the third, Belfry, moves as its title suggests close to the church. Until last Saturday I thought Belfry was the best, largely because it shows Roche continuing to mature as a writer. Yet Poor Beast is at the heart of the trilogy, for here we come up most sharply against the tragedy of small town Ireland and perhaps of Ireland as a whole: the desire of some of its brightest people to leave. The key example in Poor Beast is 'Danger' Doyle, played by Liam Cunningham. By any normal standards, he is not a big figure; by Wexford standards, he is part of the mythology. Everyone remembers that he was in trouble with the police, and left for England with a woman whose daughter remained behind. Having lost his job in a British tobacco factory for stealing cigarettes, he now works in a car plant. When he returns to Wexford to pick up the daughter, he is in a smart suit and stays at the County Hotel. In other words, he has made it to the big time. Poor Beast works by juxtaposing those who leave, those who wish to go but do not have the will, and those who stay. It also makes great play of the differences between generations. Steven, the father of the girl, claims never to have packed a bag in his life: Wexford is enough for him. Joe, from the middle generation, says Wexford is 'the greatest little town in Ireland', but still hankers after his boyhood days with Danger, when the pair of them would raid the betting shop. The background to Poor Beast is the All Ireland Final, the game being hurling. It is the excitement of the year, partly because Wexford is involved in little else except everyday life. Yet it is in the details of this humdrum existence that Roche is so skilled: there are dramas beneath the surface, like the girl Molly whom Danger has abandoned. Molly is wonderfully played by Ingrid Craigie. She is not alone. Dervla Kirwan as the daughter sheds real tears. Des McAleer, as Joe, will come into his own in a bigger part in Belfry, which starts tomorrow. My only reservation about the trilogy is whether it would work on a larger stage. At the Bush it is close to perfection. Wexford Trilogy, Bush Theatre, London W12, (081) 743 3388</p>

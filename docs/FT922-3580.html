			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / International Company News: Hungary insurer hit by car thefts and 'inexperience' HUNGARIA Biztosito, the Hungarian insurer in which Allianz, the German insurance group, has acquired a majority stake, lost Ft8.5bn (Dollars 108m) on its car insurance business in the last financial year. The company blamed the worse-than-expected results on a sharp rise in crime in Budapest, where car thefts have increased to between 60 and 100 a day. 'We were not pessimistic enough,' said Mr Ferenc Kiss, a Hungaria director. However, insurance industry officials said the loss was due to the company's inexperience in Western underwriting practices. Hungaria had taken on business at premium levels well below the cost of reinsurance on the international market, they said. Mr Christopher Gore, director of MAI Biztositokozvetito, a leading independent broker, said that insurance had attracted the largest foreign capital inflow of any sector in Hungary. The combined lack of expertise and the risks of the business have resulted in 'disaster', he said. Foreign investment in Hungarian insurance stands at over Dollars 500m. Twelve western companies have acquired former state insurers or set up new subsidiaries. Most recently, Aegon, the second-largest Dutch insurer, took a 75 per cent stake in state-owned Allami Biztosito for a reported Dollars 50m.</p>

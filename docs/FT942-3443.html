			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Berlusconi acts on pension fear Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, yesterday held a special meeting of economic ministers to discuss the impact of the constitutional court decision ordering payment of arrears on minimum pensions. The cost of making the payments in line with the court's decision was estimated to be L30,000bn (Pounds 12.36bn) by Mr Clemente Mastella, the labour minister. Mr Lamberto Dini, the treasury minister, said before the meeting he had no details of how the estimated L30,000bn cost had been reached, but admitted the pensions issue was a 'major problem'. Mr Gino Giugni, a former labour minister, said yesterday the Berlusconi government had no alternative but to make the payments. However, he voiced surprise at the estimated cost. The previous Ciampi government, he said, had been aware of the impending court decision and had considered L16,000bn the upper limit. Both the stock market and the government bond market reflected continued nervousness because of the uncertain effect of funding the court decision on the public sector deficit.

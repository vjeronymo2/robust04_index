Cityfed was a savings and loan holding company that conducted its savings and loan operations through its wholly-owned subsidiary, City Federal Savings Bank (``City Federal''). City Federal was the source of substantially all of Cityfed's revenues and income. As a result of substantial losses in its mortgage banking and real estate operations, City Federal was unable to meet its regulatory capital requirements. Accordingly, on December 7, 1989, the Office of Thrift Supervision (the ``OTS'') placed City Federal into receivership and appointed the Resolution Trust Corporation (the ``RTC'') as City Federal's receiver. City Federal's deposits and substantially all of its assets and liabilities were acquired by a newly created federal mutual savings bank, City Savings Bank, F.S.B., whose deposits, assets, and liabilities in turn were acquired by City Savings, F.S.B. (``City Savings''). The OTS appointed the RTC as receiver of City Savings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Once City Federal was placed into receivership, Cityfed no longer conducted savings and loan operations through any subsidiary and substantially all of its assets consisted of cash that has been invested in money market instruments with a maturity of one year or less and money market mutual funds. On September 30, 1993, Cityfed held cash and securities of approximately $9.7 million. Because of Cityfed's asset composition, it may be an investment company under the Act. Rule 3a-2 under the Act provides a one-year safe harbor to issuers that meet the definition of an investment company but intend to engage in a business other than investing in securities. Because of various claims against Cityfed and certain Cityfed officers and directors, Cityfed could not acquire an operating company within the one year safe harbor. The expiration of the safe harbor period necessitated the filing of an application for exemption from all provisions of the Act, with certain exceptions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

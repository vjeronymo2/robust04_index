			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 11 (CTK) -- The Foreign Ministry  expressed the hope today that the next Hungarian Government  would assume a more accommodating approach to resolving problems  existing between the two countries. "It is in Slovakia's  interest that the government which will emerge from the  parliamentary elections in Hungary be communicative, ready for  constructive dialogue, with a realistic approach to resolving  bilateral questions and to developing relations between the two  countries," the press release says.    "The Slovak Foreign Ministry believes that the new Hungarian  Government will continue in the political and social changes it  has started and its foreign policy will stem from rational  positions," the release concludes.    The tension in the Bratislava-Budapest relations has eased  somewhat after Jozef Moravcik's new government was appointed on  March 16. He acknowledged his willingness to conduct a dialogue  with his counterpart Peter Boross, and Boross's rivals Gyula  Horn and Gabor Kuncze. Bratislava hopes that it will conclude  with the new Hungarian Government the basic state treaty on  inviolability of border which Budapest has so far refused,  making the treaty conditional on extending the rights of ethnic  Hungarians.</p>

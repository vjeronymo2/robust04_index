According to the aforementioned experts, both the decree and  the letter are invalid as official documents from the legal  point of view. This applies to the decree because it has not  been published, which the Constitution requires, while the  letter has not been classified as an official document.    According to the Constitution, a military cabinet attached  to  the President's Office does not exist. As supreme commander in  chief, the president chairs the Consultative Council for  National Security that should act as an interdepartmental body  rather than being subordinate to the Presidency. According to  the Constitution, the status of the Consultative Council should  be determined by an act of Parliament, which the deputies have  so far been too busy to pass, rather than by the president  himself.    Nevertheless, it does not mean that the president is  entitled  to establish a duplicate body which neither the Constitution nor  the law have provided for.    The Presidency is an auxiliary service attached to the  President's Office that has no independent state functions  whatsoever. Relations between the advisers serving in the  Presidency and the head of state are based on internal  organizational principles. The status of the president's  advisers is strictly confined to the activities of consulting  experts and the president is not entitled to entrust them with  any state functions whatsoever. There is even more: The  president is not authorized to instruct official departments in  connection with assuming any obligations whatsoever regarding  his advisers.    The president's only prerogatives are those granted to him  by  the Constitution. Any other initiatives on his part are  self-styled.</p>

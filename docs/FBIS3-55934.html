			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Stepashin, first deputy director of </F> the Federal Counterintelligence Service, by Boris Sopelnyak;  place and date not given: "Things Will Get No Easier for Spies"]    [Text] [Sopelnyak] The time that the president set aside  for elaborating the statute on the Federal Counterintelligence  Service [FCS] has expired. What has this period been like for  you? Have the former Security Ministry apparatus and its  directorates been working or have they all been waiting for the  decision on their fate? Have things become easier for  terrorists, the corrupt, spies, and other of your "clients"?  After all, for almost three weeks there have been just two  officials at the Federal Counterintelligence Service -- the  director of the new service and yourself.    [Stepashin] As is well-known, during this period B.N.  Yeltsin signed three edicts relating to our service -- two open  edicts and one classified edict. I had a personal meeting with  the president lasting more than an hour on 5 January. That  meeting resulted in the signing of the edict setting up the FCS.    To be frank, there was a certain element of panic among my  colleagues -- after all, they are all waiting for  recertification of their jobs. But we reassured people that  there would be no purge and that those who fail to come through  the recertification could resign or be dismissed but would not  be left jobless -- some would go to the MVD [Ministry of  Internal Affairs], others to the Prosecutor's Office, others to  the Tax Police, and so forth. Foreign special services have not  relaxed their efforts during this period, our former brothers  from the Baltic and Georgia are making their presence felt,  corruption is still prevalent, and terrorists have been active.  So we have no time to sigh and feel sorry for ourselves -- we  have to do our job. Twenty people have been arrested for  espionage alone, and several dozen such cases are in the  pipeline. The entire country was shaken by the abduction of the  Rostov schoolchildren. The highly complex operation to free  them was carried out brilliantly and, most important, without a  single drop of blood being shed -- our operatives definitely  deserve praise for that.    [Sopelnyak] At a 10 January press conference you said that  the edict of 21 December last year was an expected surprise.  What do you mean by that? Or did you have wind that an edict  to abolish the Security Ministry was in the offing?    [Stepashin] Of course, I knew nothing about it. But I  realized that our department needed radical restructuring and  that we were often doing things that were alien to the security  service. So the edict was timely.    [Sopelnyak] You were given two weeks to draw up the statute  on the FCS. Is this document ready, and, if so, could you  comment on its main points?    [Stepashin] As far as the statute on the FCS is concerned,  it is ready and has been ratified by the Russian president.    The Russian Federation FCS is a central federal executive  organ. Its mission includes the exposure, prevention, and  curtailment of subversive intelligence activity by foreign  special services and organizations, and of illegal attacks on  Russia's constitutional system, sovereignty, territorial  integrity, and defense capability. In its activity the FCS  should be guided by the Constitution, laws, and other legal acts  issued by organs of state power, as well as by international  treaties.    [Sopelnyak] To whom will the FCS be subordinate -- the  Federal Assembly, the government, or the president?    [Stepashin] The president. And to him directly, rather than  any intermediate authorities.    [Sopelnyak] Does that mean that your assignments will be set  by the president?    [Stepashin] Our assignments, as I have already said, are  defined by the Constitution, laws, and the statute on the FCS.  Our main mission is to obtain intelligence information on  threats to Russia's security; to combat terrorism, illegal armed  formations, and illegally created or prohibited associations  attacking Russia's constitutional system; to expose, prevent,  and curtail subversive intelligence activity by foreign special  services against our country; to safeguard the security of state  secrets and, of course, to provide the president with  information on threats to the Russian Federation's security.    [Sopelnyak] That is a lot of assignments, and you will need  people to carry them out. At the same time, the president's  edict states that the size of the FCS' administrative apparatus  should not exceed 1,500 people, and the total number of service  and civilian personnel has been set at 75,000. We know another  figure, too -- the number of FCS staffers will be 46 percent  fewer than the former Security Ministry staff. Who will you be  working with? Is it realistic to carry out the aforesaid  mission with the number of staffers that the FCS will have  available?    [Stepashin] Yes, it is. The personnel cut will be  substantial, but we have worked out an entire system for  carrying out this operation without affecting our performance.  Some directorates will be disbanded, others will be merged --  we will be trying to avoid any duplication or overlapping in the  work of certain subunits. Ultimately we will be left with the  most necessary directorates. The most important of these are  the Directorate for Counterintelligence Operations, the  Directorate for Counterintelligence Provision for Strategic  Installations, the Directorate for Military Counterintelligence,  the Directorate for Economic Counterintelligence, the  Directorate for Combating Terrorism, and a number of others.  There will be virtually no staff cuts to these subunits either  centrally or at the local level. But, for instance, there will  have to be cuts to the Secretariat, the Material and Technical  Services Directorate, or the Military Organizational Development  Directorate. Moreover, certain subunits -- including the famous  "Lefortovo" -- will be transferred to the MVD.    [Sopelnyak] Does this mean, to use the words of the  presidential edict abolishing the Security Ministry, that  counterintelligence work will not be relaxed?    [Stepashin] Under no circumstances! Moreover, our effort  will be focused in precisely this area.    [Sopelnyak] What can you say about the "system of political  investigation, which has been mothballed but could easily be  reactivated"?    [Stepashin] There can be no question of any political  investigation -- except, of course, for those cases when we are  talking about illegally formed or prohibited associations of an  extremist nature setting up armed formations and attacking the  Russian constitutional system.    [Sopelnyak] The director is now leader of the FCS. Could  you tell us about his rights and duties?    [Stepashin] First and foremost, the director heads the FCS  and leads its 11-man collegium. Moreover, the director has one  first deputy and five deputies. The president appoints the  director and relieves him of his duties personally. The  president also monitors the activity of the entire Russian FCS.  As for the director, his rights and duties are not much  different from those of the head of any other ministry.    [Sopelnyak] And, last, perhaps the most important question  -- has Russia benefited from these transformations and will we  ordinary Russian citizens benefit from them?    [Stepashin] First and foremost, I would like everyone to  realize that the need to set up the FCS was dictated not by some  kind of whim but by life itself. I am sure that the FCS, in  taking what was best from its predecessors and avoiding what was  "negative," will become a reliable shield for both Russia and  all Russian citizens.</p>

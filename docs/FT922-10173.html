			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / International Company News: Nicholas wins Dollars 15.8m severance and stays on the payroll MR Nicholas Nicholas, the former co-chief executive of Time Warner whose forced resignation was engineered in February by Mr Steve Ross, the company's chairman, received a Dollars 15.8m severance payment in addition to Dollars 2.9m of salary, deferred income and bonuses in 1991. According to a new filing by Time Warner with the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC), the company agreed not to cancel a 1989 employment contract with Mr Nicholas. This will allow him to remain on the company's payroll - at an annual salary of Dollars 250,000 - until 1999. Mr Nicholas holds options to buy 500,000 shares in Time Warner at an average of Dollars 90 per share. Yesterday's share price was Dollars 106 7/8 8, up by  7/8 . The size of executive compensation packages at Time Warner has been a controversial issue for the company, mainly because Mr Ross is the recipient of a Dollars 196m package related to payments for his stock interests in Warner. Last year Mr Ross received Dollars 4.06m in base pay, deferred income and a bonus. In 1990 the total of Mr Ross's compensation - including a part of the payment of Dollars 196m over eight years - was Dollars 78.2m. Mr Jerry Levin, the former Time man who was elevated by Mr Ross to take the place of Mr Nicholas as co-chief executive, was paid Dollars 2.8m in 1991.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 12 (XINHUA) -- State Councillor Chen  Junsheng said recently that the major tasks of agriculture this  year are to stabilize the output of grain, increase the output  of cotton and enrich the vegetable basket.    He called on officials at all levels to actively mobilize  departments in charge of funds, materials and technology to  provide the farmers with good service throughout the process of  production to strive for a good harvest of grain and cotton.    Chen, who has special responsibilities for agriculture, made  these remarks during a survey tour of the provinces of Hebei,  Shandong and Henan from April 6 to 12.    Chen pointed out that the three provinces are China's major  producers of grain, cotton and vegetables, adding that the grain  output of the provinces accounts for one fifth of the national  total, while that of cotton accounts for half of the national  total.    He stressed that at present, it is necessary to fight  against  the serious drought in Hebei and Henan Provinces and to increase  the cotton-growing acreage. Attention should also be paid to  the use of seeds from the best strains and to field management,  including prevention and control of plant diseases and  elimination of pests.    While concentrating on the production of grain and cotton,  Chen Junsheng said, it is also important to provide more for the  vegetable basket. Efforts should be made to use stalks to raise  more cattle and other herbivorous animals and to grow more  vegetables to enrich the supply of non-staple food.</p>

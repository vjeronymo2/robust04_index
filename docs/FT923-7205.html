			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: UK institutional investors warned of risks in foreign exchange THE Association of Corporate Treasurers has warned UK institutional investors of the need to assess the implications of foreign exchange management in non-financial companies. 'The risk is that the value of the firm will vary with exchange rates,' according to Mr John Grout, director of treasury at Cadbury Schweppes, and Mr Derek Ross, a partner in Touche Ross, who have compiled a checklist for institutional investors. The project was undertaken following discussions between the ACT and the Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension Funds. The issue became a subject of concern among investors after Allied Lyons, the UK food and drinks group, lost Pounds 150m (Dollars 286m) in foreign exchange dealings early last year. The guidelines highlight four main types of exposure to foreign exchange risk: strategic exposure, affecting customers or suppliers, or decisions such as plant location; pre-transactional exposure, arising before entering into a commercial contract; transactional exposure, created by purchase, sales and financing transactions; and translation exposure which arises from translation for accounting purposes from one currency to another. The nature and degree of hedging foreign exchange risk is 'a vital element of shareholder value,' Mr Ross said. An investor might, for example buy shares in a UK company with large US operations expecting the company to benefit from a stronger dollar. However, if the company's exposure to the dollar was already hedged, the investor's intended strategy would be thrown off course. However, investors should be able to get a clear idea of the company's practices 'even in a short meeting with company management,' according to Mr Grout and Mr Ross. While certain types of hedging are advisable, it is hazardous to undertake translation hedging in order to protect a book-keeping item, according to Mr Ross. He believes it is only valid if a company has come up against borrowing covenants or has to protect a profits forecast. A survey of institutional investors undertaken last year by Touche Ross showed that 63 per cent of respondents would prefer companies not to hedge translation exposures since it is likely to give results different to those expected by investors. *Foreign Exchange Management in Non-Financial Corporations, by John Grout and Derek Ross, published by the Association of Corporate Treasurers, 12 Devereux Court, London WC2</p>

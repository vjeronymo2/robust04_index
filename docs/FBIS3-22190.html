			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Khasan Iskandarov: </F> ``Ecology: Will Tashkent Become Port City? Idea of Diverting  Siberian Rivers Seems To Have Captured Masses' Imagination  Again'']    [Text] The intensive contacts among the presidents of the  former Central Asian republics that have characterized the start  of the year, for all the seeming diversity of the problems  raised and proposed for solutions, have one common thread. Every  meeting has discussed the question of saving the Aral Sea. It is  a truly important question and one that requires a prompt and  effective solution. The ecological disaster zone that the Aral  region has been declared is inhabited by people, and life is  hard for them. But the remarkable thing is this: All the  presidents want to solve the water supply problem not using  their own funds and resources, but by diverting northern rivers  to Central Asia.    No one is talking about this openly, but just such an option  is continually being implied. But why now, in winter? The time  is not far off when it will be necessary to begin irrigating  crops, a sizable place among which is held by cotton, and the  meager water resources will start being divided. This year,  judging from specialists' forecasts, will be just as dry as  previous ones. And water has always been valued especially  highly in the East: It has caused conflicts and strife, and  things have often reached the point of using force. The Tajiks  have fought with the Uzbeks and the Uzbeks have fought with the  Kirgiz; this is true of not only ancient times, but also the  very recent past. Today the new states of Central Asia are to  some extent being saved by the continuing war in Afghanistan.  It's terrible to say, but true. If the war were to stop and the  Afghan tribes to begin raising crops, a very difficult situation  would ensue. Four countries would immediately find themselves on  dry rations.    This is what accounts for the flurry of activity.    One would think that the insane idea of diverting part of  the  flow of Siberian rivers to Central Asia had been buried once and  for all. But this is not the case, and increasingly persistent  efforts are being in Uzbekistan to sway public opinion in favor  of a positive resolution of the erstwhile ``project of the  century.''    It is being actively suggested to the people who are  suffering from a water shortage and poor water quality that only  the postponed diversion of Siberian rivers can save them from  disease and utter extinction.    But the devil is not so black as he is painted; in other  words, what is the actual water situation in the republic? In  the rayons of the Aral region, it is truly catastrophic. The  waters of the Syrdarya essentially stopped reaching the area in  1976. Only up to three cubic kilometers of water a year flow  into the Aral from the Amudarya. Yet both rivers initially carry  almost 20 times that much. Is all the water being diverted by  continually developing agriculture? Hardly, although this is  true in the sense that farmers take as much as they can, not as  much as they need. Irrigation norms in Uzbekistan are overstated  by a factor of 1.6. A similar picture obtains in Kazakhstan and  Turkmenia. And let us ponder the following fact: In just over  the past 10 years, 84 billion cubic meters of water have been  used for irrigation in the Aral basin, while discharges of water  after irrigation into undrained valleys and losses in the  much-touted Karakum canal exceed 100 billion cubic meters. An  entire system of large lakes with no commercial purpose has  formed in Central Asia and Kazakhstan. Waters that once could  have fed the Aral Sea have now flooded vast tracts of land and  farmland. On the one hand, we have a dying sea, and on the other  hand, we have lifeless lakes that stretch for hundreds of  kilometers.    When the decision to drop the idea of diverting part of the  flow of Siberian rivers somewhat sobered the most adventuristic  heads, a great many alternative solutions to the problem were  proposed in Uzbekistan--effective and serious proposals.  Specifically, one plan called for diverting drainage waters that  are currently being discharged into undrained steppe depressions  (Aydarkul and Sarykamysh) along a natural channel into the Aral.  Another proposal called for dividing the Aral's water up with  earthen dams, thereby making it possible to manage its cycles.  Yet another called for carrying out large-scale  phyto-amelioration and forest-conservation projects, treating  the drying sea bottom with cementitious material, building a  right-bank discharge drain along the entire length of the  Amudarya, and so forth. All these projects would require  enormous capital investments, which Uzbekistan simply cannot  come up with on its own. But the problem is not so much the  money (it could ultimately be scraped together with Russia's  help), as people. There is no one to implement the project in a  republic burdened with surplus labor resources. A paradox? It's  really more of a logically consistent pattern. The nearly 3  million people who currently live in the lower reaches of the  Amudarya from Khorezm to the Aral do not want and will not build  either a discharge drain or dams, despite the fact that they are  the ones who are currently forced to use water contaminated with  pesticides and other chemicals.    Readers, believe this author, for he is hardly indifferent  to  the fate of millions of fellow citizens who live in the  ecological disaster zone. But there is only one possible  solution to this problem--to conserve the water already  available in the republic.    Writer P. Shermukhammedov, chairman of the committee for  saving the Aral, believes that without large financial and other  outlays, just by taking water conservation steps, the sea could  receive 30 to 35 cubic kilometers of water annually, and that  would stabilize the Aral at the existing mark.    There is one other aspect of the problem that, if  unremarked,  makes it hard to explain just why the republic leadership is  inclined to insist on the option rejected eight years ago.  People in Uzbekistan try not to talk about it, for it is fraught  with certain extremely negative consequences. The birth rate in  Uzbekistan currently exceeds the average world level. Scientists  call it a demographic explosion that could very likely become a  social explosion. This is no joke, and the prognosis is not all  that unrealistic. Suffice it to recall the events in the  overpopulated Fergana Valley. Uzbekistan has more than 22  million people today, but as Karimov has said, that figure will  double in 10 years.    Meanwhile, Eastern-style democracy has revived previously  suppressed Islamic religious forces that oppose any attempts to  control the birth rate, something they say is at odds with true  Muslim traditions.    And one final point. Methods of saving the Aral are still in  the theoretical stage. Despite the practical recommendations  devised by a number of specialized institutes, their  implementation remains highly problematical. I will venture to  express what is perhaps a trenchant but, in my opinion, the sole  possible explanation for what is going on. Impeding the  implementation of the existing projects is a kind of Eastern  stratagem whose aim is to exacerbate the situation in the  ecological disaster zone so much as to make a diversion of  Siberian rivers the only likely solution to the crisis.    I hope I am wrong, but I fear that this is indeed the case.</p>

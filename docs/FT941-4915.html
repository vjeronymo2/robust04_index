			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / People: NatWest Markets NatWest Markets, the corporate and investment banking arm of National Westminster Bank, has moved to strengthen an area in which UK commercial banks have traditionally been weak: providing financial advice to British companies. NatWest Markets has appointed Andrew Cartwright, a JP Morgan investment banker, as a managing director and head of its UK corporate advisory work. He will work alongside Gerbrand Hop, who concentrates on continental European business. The two men will report directly to John Howland-Jackson, deputy chief executive of NatWest Markets, who said yesterday that the appointment marked 'a significant strengthening' of the senior executive team.</p>

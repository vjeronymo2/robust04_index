			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 4 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb leaders  warned the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] on Monday [4 April]  against sending more military observers to Gorazde as Sarajevo  radio reported "bitter fighting" around the besieged Moslem-held  enclave in eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Spokesman Rob Annink said the Serbs had advised UNPROFOR to  put off the dispatch of a team of UN military observers (UNMO)  to Gorazde because of what they described as a Bosnian army  offensive carried out from Gorazde both towards Zepa to the  north and towards Sarajevo, further west.    Sarajevo radio said fighting was continuing around Gorazde  for the seventh straight day. Since besieging Serb forces  launched shelling attacks on the enclave last Tuesday, according  to the Bosnian authorities, 47 civilians have been killed with  207 others wounded.    The radio said around 30 troop transporters had arrived  bringing reinforcements to the Serb side.    Sarajevo has called on the international community to take  action to protect the enclave, designated by the United Nations  last year as a "safe area."    Only four UNMO members are currently stationed in the  enclave, so that UNPROFOR is able to obtain only limited  information about the situation there.    Annink moreover said a convoy of three light armoured  vehicles, three tanks, three trucks and three mortars had been  seen crossing the military exclusion zone, travelling towards  Gorazde, in clear violation of the February ceasefire accord  between Bosnians and Serb separatists.    The Serb authorities in Pale, the separatist stronghold,  have  refused to allow a convoy of aid provided by the UH High  Commissioner for Refugees to make its way to Gorazde, giving no  reason, UNHCR spokesman Kris Janowski said.    Meanwhile the situation in Prijedor in western Bosnia, where  last week 18 Moslems and two Croats were murdered by local  Serbs, was calm Monday as Red Cross spokeswoman Vanya Kewley  said talks were beginning at Pale to organise the evacuation of  up to 6,000 people from the region.    Janowski, citing a UNHCR official in Prijedor, said there  were no Serb police patrolling the streets of the town.    The police chief in the town, Bogdan Delic, had asked  Moslems  to stay, offering them security guarantees. However this had  not been enough to reassure the Moslem population, Janowksi said.    Kewley said Andreas Kuhn, head of the International  Committee  of the Red Cross (ICRC) delegation in Zagreb, was to meet the  Bosnian Serb authorities to work out details of the operation,  which would be the largest organised movement of civilians since  the fighting began in April 1992.    The operation to be carried out by ICRC and UN personnel is  to begin on Tuesday.    Bosnian authorities have given their assent to the operation  after the killing of the 20 non-Serbs heightened the insecurity  of Moslems and Croats remaining in the area around Banja Luka, a  Serb-controlled territory. UN and ICRC officials have denied  that this is tantamount to aiding the Serbs in their campaign of  ethnic cleansing.</p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Offer was too good to miss THE CHANCE to replace some 5,000 BT2 shares with around 16,000 BT3 shares (after scaling down) looked too good to miss. I duly succumbed to the temptation. Can you advise me of the CGT position with regard to the switch part of the operation? 2. Two thousand shares of the above allocation were purchased via the Pep tender. On transferring these into Peps, I noticed that the transfer price is calculated at 160p a share. Who benefits from the difference between this and the present price, which is significantly higher? You have a chargeable gain (or allowable loss) on the sale of your existing holding of 5,000 shares. (The BT3 purchase does not affect that calculation.) You are deemed to have paid for your new holding of 14,000 shares in full; if you sell them before you have, in fact, paid for them in full, you will be deemed to have sold them for the actual sale price plus the unpaid calls. (This does not apply to the 2,000 shares held in your Pep). Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet CGT-13 (The indexation allowance for quoted shares). 2. The difference in prices benefits you (provided that the price does not effectively fall by the time you eventually sell the shares, of course). Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet IR-89 (Personal equity plans). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

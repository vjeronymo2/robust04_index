			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: McIlwraith attracts ADollars 82.3m bid MCILWRAITH McEacharn, the Australian transport and resources group, yesterday welcomed a ADollars 1.95-per-share takeover offer from Cyprus Australia Coal, a subsidiary of Cyprus Minerals of the US. Mr Tony Lawrence, chairman, advised shareholders to take no immediate action, but said Cyprus would be 'a suitable parent company for McIlwraith'. The bid values the group at ADollars 82.3m (USDollars 59.2m). Cyprus said its aim was to secure control of McIlwraith's 40 per cent stake in Oakbridge, a New South Wales coal producer co-owned by Tomen Corporation and Nippon Oil of Japan. An agreement between the shareholders gives McIlwraith a majority on the board of Oakbridge and the right to appoint the chairman. Oakbridge, which has a market capitalisation of about ADollars 220m, made a net profit of ADollars 5m last year. Analysts said the bid was likely to prove attractive to TNT, the troubled Australian transport group which owns 46 per cent of McIlwraith. TNT has been seeking a buyer for its McIlwraith stake. The offer is pitched at a premium of 25 per cent to McIlwraith's pre-bid share price of ADollars 1.55. However, the shares were trading at ADollars 1.40 before bid speculation pushed up the price on Monday. The bid depends on 90 per cent acceptance by shareholders and approval by the Foreign Investment Review Board, which vets most takeover offers involving overseas companies. Other conditions require the Oakbridge share agreement to remain unchanged, and the retention by Oakbridge of all assets valued at more than ADollars 2m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 15 (CNA) -- Navy Commander-in-Chief  Adm. Chuang Ming-yao will resign Saturday [16 April] to take  responsibility for a cash-for-secrets scandal sweeping the  Navy's top ranks, Defense Minister Sun Chen said Friday.    Vice Defense Minister Adm. Ku Chung-lien, 62, will succeed  Chuang, who will become a strategy advisor to the president, Sun  added.    "Chuang, whose resignation comes only two weeks before his  two-year tenure expires, will step down to take responsibility  for a major arms procurement scandal involving many of the  Navy's top brass," Sun explained. Investigation into the  scandal was sparked last December by the murder of Navy Captain  Yin Ching-feng.    Chuang, 65, is the first senior naval officer to step down  since the body of Captain Yin was found floating in the sea off  Taiwan's northeastern coast December 10, 1993.    Meanwhile, Chang Chen-ya, director of the Navy's Political  Warfare Department, will also leave his post Saturday, Sun said.    "The personnel changes are the first step the government has  taken to assume responsibility for the Yin case," Sun noted,  adding more military officers will be disciplined for the arms  purchase scandal which includes bribe-taking and leaking of  military secrets in addition to the death of Yin.    Disciplinary measures will be announced after judicial  authorities make a final judgment on those involved, Sun added.    On Thursday, military prosecutors indicted Captain Kuo  Li-heng, a Navy weapons procurement officer who has been in  custody since late last year, for corruption and leaking  military secrets.    Kuo allegedly took bribes totaling NT$12 million  (us$452,830)  offered by civilian arms dealers in exchange for military  secrets, the Ministry of National Defense said.    The ministry did not detail what secrets were leaked and  whom  the information went to, but the local media said earlier that  Kuo gave the information to an arms dealer who worked for a  foreign arms supplier.    Kuo will be tried by a military court and if convicted, he  will face either the death penalty or life in prison.    Kuo faces a separate trial by a civilian court for his  alleged role in the Yin murder case. A Taipei prosecutor has  promised to issue indictments for Kuo and three other suspects  before the end of April.    Yin, whose killers have not yet been identified, is believed  to have been murdered as he was about to disclose irregularities  in the awarding of lucrative military contracts, the local media  said. The Defense Ministry and police have offered cash rewards  totaling NT$7 million for information leading to the arrest of  Yin's killers.    At least eight other military officers and six local arms  dealers have been detained for the case.</p>

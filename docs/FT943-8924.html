			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Israel and Palestinians settle customs accord Israel and the Palestinians agreed customs and indirect tax measures yesterday and said they were close to finalising an accord on the next phase of their peace process - transfer of administrative powers from Israeli to Palestinian hands in the occupied West Bank. The peace moves came as one Israeli was killed and six were hurt in two separate ambushes in the Gaza Strip by gunmen of the Hamas Islamic Resistance movement, which opposes the peace process between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Israeli customs officials said they had completed customs and VAT agreements with the PLO - a critical step in the delayed implementation of the Israeli-PLO economic protocol. The move will ease the financial constraints of the cash-strapped Palestinian treasury. Next Sunday the Palestinians will establish their own customs and immigration channels at the Rafah and Allenby bridge crossings into Gaza and Jericho removing one of the soorest points of friction between the two sides. Under the economic accord Israel will collect customs on Palestinian imports through Israeli ports, airports and land terminals and transfer the duties to the Palestinian treasury. Ms Edit Lev, customs spokeswoman, said Israel had paid the Palestinians Shk7m (Pounds 1.49m) in customs duties last week and was preparing a further transfer of Shk6.5m in coming days. In future, however, the customs transfer would be made on a day-to-day basis rather than in irregular lump sum payments. Mr Uri Savir, the head of Israel's foreign ministry, said Israel and the PLO were close to concluding an agreement on 'early empowerment' - the transfer of power from Israeli to Palestinian hands over West Bank education, health, social welfare, direct taxation and tourism. Mr Savir said the only big obstacle left for a flurry of intensive talks starting today at the Israeli-Gaza border was direct taxation of the West Bank's nearly 1m people. Israel, which will keep troops in the West Bank until the eve of Palestinian elections due in mid-December, fears that the Palestinians will ease tax collection, causing a fall in the level of services and the possible eruption of social discontent. Mr Oded Eran, a senior foreign ministry official, said Israel and the PLO were making a joint effort to raise money abroad to meet a possible gap in revenue collection. The worst-case being discussed with donors involves providing budgetary assistance of Dollars 9.5m (Pounds 6.1m) a month for six months to bridge the expected shortfall. Outraged PLO officials say Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin last week demanded the PLO prove its revenue collection abilities as a pre-condition for early empowerment - a condition not agreed in any accords. The Palestinians dismiss Israeli concerns about tax collection, describing the matter as an 'internal Palestinian issue'. They are also pressing to levy direct taxation on the up to 120,000 Jewish settlers resident in the West Bank - a move Israel firmly opposes. Despite the differences substantial progress on early empowerment is expected when Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister and Mr Nabil Shaath, senior PLO negotiator, meet in Egypt on Wednesday. At the meeting the PLO will also present its plans for elections and demand that Israeli troops in the West Bank complete redeployment out of Palestinian population centres several months before election day to allow a free election campaign. Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO Chairman, is expected in Egypt today to brief President Hosni Mubarak ahead of the talks.</p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: System is still under pressure despite action PRESSURE for more changes in the European exchange mechanism seems unlikely to disappear, in spite of the lira's devaluation and the cut in interest rates in Germany. Speculation about other currencies that could be affected by future devaluations centred yesterday on sterling, the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo, all of which have traded weakly in recent weeks. Much depends on next Sunday's referendum in France on the Maastricht treaty. If that delivers a No vote, holding up moves to economic and monetary union, investors may step up selling of the weaker ERM currencies, causing new strains in the mechanism. There are two ways of assessing how the ERM realignment will affect the outlook for the mechanism. The more sanguine view stresses the special nature of the lira's problems, stemming from a weakening of international confidence in the Rome government. According to this view, the 7 per cent devaluation of the Italian currency has demonstrated the capability of Europe's leaders to adjust the ERM to take into account unique circumstances of member countries. The fact that European politicians collectively persuaded the Bundesbank to cut borrowing rates is also seen as a hopeful sign. The move led yesterday to a weakening in the D-Mark against the dollar, and so eased pressures in the ERM on the weaker currencies. Even though the easing in German monetary policy was slight, the important factor, according to this school of thought, is that it almost certainly marks the start of further reductions in Bundesbank rates over the coming months, as the German economy starts to slow. Mr David Cocker, chief currency economist at Chemical Bank in London, said: 'The ERM will stay intact, whatever the result of the Maastricht vote. There will be no further realignment after next week.' The second way of analysing the realignment inclines to the view that the ERM has deep- seated problems which cannot be solved by one quick fix. Mr David Owen, UK economist at Kleinwort Benson, the London merchant bank, said: 'The lira devaluation has raised questions about whether the ERM can be sustained in its present form.' Sterling, so this argument runs, is a candidate for a devaluation on the grounds that, without one, the UK will be unable to institute the large cuts in domestic borrowing rates that are needed to revive its battered economy. That would be especially the case if - as seems likely - the Bundesbank takes its time over further cuts in interest rates. Meanwhile, the position in the system of the peseta and the escudo can be maintained only with the help of high Spanish and Portuguese credit rates which cannot be sustained in the long run. As for the lira, some believe the devaluation may not have been sufficient to stop further weakening. Perhaps the strongest argument for further realignments is a psychological one. Last month, the European Community's finance ministers ruled out a devaluation of any of the 10 currencies in the grid, on the grounds that a change in rates would not be 'the appropriate response'. With this promise having lasted just two weeks in the case of the lira, the financial markets cannot be blamed for wondering whether the commitment to keep other weak ERM currencies at their central rates may turn out to be less than total.</p>

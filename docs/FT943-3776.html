			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Nato begins exercise in Poland Nato began its first exercises on ex-Warsaw Pact territory yesterday on a sports field near Poznan in Poland, as much a public relations reassurance for eastern Europe and Russia as serious military training. Forces from the US, Ukraine, Britain and Bulgaria took part in the exercise, part of the Nato 'Partnership for Peace' initiative designed to involve eastern European countries in western security structures without granting them full Nato membership. Some 600 troops from six Nato and seven PFP countries are involved in the exercise, codenamed Co-operative Bridge 94. Its main thrust is to develop peacekeeping skills among small groups, rather than co-ordinate large movements of armour. While Nato's focus is increasingly on peacekeeping, this type of exercise is less provocative to Russian sensibilities, still jangled by the thought of Nato forces training on old Warsaw Pact ground. The Russians were conspicuously absent from the ragged band of soldiers at attention on Biedrusko field as Polish military bands played the anthems of the 13 participants. General George Joulwan, Nato's supreme allied commander in Europe, called it 'a truly historic occasion, as five years ago you were parted by the Iron Curtain and today you come to train together'. Partnership for Peace aims to increase east European and Nato forces' ability to work alongside one another, but falls short of offering the mutual defence guarantees Nato members enjoy and many east European states want. Such tensions showed in official statements at the exercise. 'The PFP leads straight to an independent decision to full integration and membership in Nato,' Mr Piotr Kolodziejczyk, a former Warsaw Pact officer and now Poland's defence minister, said yesterday. This is a position which Nato has yet fully to accept. The Russians, despite joining PFP, remain afraid it will dilute their special power status in relations with the US. Equally, the exercise is less than the Poles had wanted in initial talks about a scenario aimed at having Nato forces coming to aid a country attacked by a foreign power. Instead, the exercises involve the more everyday tasks peace-keeping forces might have to perform. For the next four days, young men (and women in the US contingent) communicating in English, will practise searching vehicles at control points, crossing rivers while escorting refugees, and patrolling disputed areas. Partnership for Peace has been criticised by leading Polish politicians as unsatisfactory, providing no real security guarantee. Poland's complaints that PFP does not go far enough have produced varying reactions in Germany, the main west European advocate of forming links with the east. Led by Mr Volker Ruhe, Germany's defence minister, one school has argued that Poland must be granted full Nato membership by the end of the decade. Others, mainly in the German Foreign Ministry, think it would be provocative to Moscow if such a deadline were set while Russia is still absorbing the effects of its withdrawal from east Europe. Still, the splits over how far west Europe should guarantee eastern security seemed far from the minds of onlookers in Poznan.</p>

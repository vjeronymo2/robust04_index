			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Small business package aims to tackle late payers LATE PAYMENT of debts has become such an important issue for small businesses that Lloyds Bank has made advice on dealing with delayed payments a key feature of its package for new business clients. The package, which will be launched today, includes a free subscription to the Dun and Bradstreet business development service. This element, worth up to Pounds 1,500, offers information on assessing the credit-worthiness of potential trading clients, and a fast invoice collection service, including payment reminder letters and a debtor-tracing service. The package launch is the second move by Lloyds in the small business market recently. In October it announced that it was cutting the charges on its standard tariff for small businesses. However, small organisations believe that banks are more interested in attracting new clients than in giving a better deal to their existing small business customers who have survived the recession. New clients with Lloyds-approved business plans will also have access to a two-year fixed rate starter loan of 9.5 per cent. Those in credit or within a Pounds 100 overdraft will receive a year's free banking. 'Young businesses are often so keen to make sales that they do not stop to consider the risks. All too often these only become apparent when it is too late,' said Mr Mike Shaw, the bank's head of business banking. Lloyds recognises that the new offer means there may be some new clients on more favourable arrangements than existing customers, but says it wants to give new companies a better chance of survival. Dun and Bradstreet says that on average UK companies wait 20 days longer after the due payment date than their French counterparts the next-worst payers in Europe.</p>

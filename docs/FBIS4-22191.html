			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Captain 2nd Rank Nikolay Litkovets: "Fleet in </F> Financial Squeeze"]    [Text] After failing to pay off the Pacific Fleet last  year, the government continues to "experiment" this year as  well. In January the financial requirements of the Fleet were  met only to the level of 25.3 percent, in February only by 36.5  percent, and at the end of March, only by 18 percent.    As was noted by the Chief of the Financial and Economic  Directorate of the Pacific Fleet, Colonel N. Sheremetyev, the  Fleet cannot even pay for bread for the table of  compulsory-service seamen, not to mention paying plants for ship  repairs. In the near future complete disconnection of naval  forces from energy supplies is expected.</p>

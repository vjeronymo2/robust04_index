			<p>BFN     [Text] This morning in Madrid, Spain's King Juan Carlos  received Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and  minister of foreign affairs. Our minister also met Apolonio  Ruiz Ligero, the state secretary for foreign trade. We have a  phone report from Madrid by Andjelko Perincic:    The reception at the residence of the Spanish royal family  Zarzuela, 20 kilometers from the center of Madrid, was also  attended by Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana and Croatian  Ambassador to Spain Sergey Morsan, and Spanish Ambassador to  Croatia Felipe Luis de la Pena.    Sources of the Croat delegation said that the atmosphere was  very friendly and the meeting lasted twice as long as is  customary. Minister Granic informed the Spanish king about  attempts to reintegrate Croatia's occupied areas in a peaceful  way, and noted problems and obstructions by the Serbs in the  implementation of the Zagreb agreements. He also spoke about  the problems relating to the implementation of the agreement on  the Croat-Bosnian Federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and praised  the Spanish blue helmets.    They also discussed cooperation between the two countries,  in  which respect the Spanish king lent support, particularly to the  development of economic relations. The Spanish sovereign also  sent greetings to Croatian President Dr. Franjo Tudjman and the  Republic of Croatia and wished our country speedy admission into  the European circle of countries.    At the Ministry of Trade and Tourism the two sides discussed  exclusively economic cooperation and Spanish support for Croatia  to receive financial aid as soon as possible. The Spanish side  lent its full support to our initiative to be admitted to GATT  as soon as possible, to obtain credits from the European Union  [EU] PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary]  program, and to be admitted, with the credits obtained, into the  EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development], IMF,  and the World Bank. Everything is ready for the signing of  bilateral Croatian-Spanish treaties: On mutual protection of  investments and avoidance of double taxation, while agreements  on road traffic and tourism are to be signed today. While I am  reporting this, talks between Croatian and Spanish ministers of  foreign affairs, Mate Granic and Javier Solana respectively, are  in progress.</p>

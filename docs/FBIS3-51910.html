			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico, 25 Jan (AFP) -- The Simon Bolivar National  Guerrilla Coordinating Board [CNG] issued a communique on 25  January in Mexico City denying any responsibility for the  killings in Uraba, northeast Colombia, and blaming the  "(regular) Army and its offspring, the paramilitary."    The guerrillas accused the Colombian Government of  "irresponsibly and deceitfully" blaming the Revolutionary Armed  Forces of Colombia, a member of the CNG, for the 35 deaths on 23  January.    In a text entitled "Infamy or Cynicism?", the CNG said this  is not the first time there has been killing in that area,  "which has become the center of a dirty war and state-sponsored  terrorism."    The CNG adds: "It has been proven that violence is being  promoted by the Army and paramilitary groups working for Fidel  Castano, a drug trafficker who donates land for military bases  and the founder of the deadly `Persecuted by Pablo Escobar.'"    The guerrillas noted that the Colombian Government's  expressed goal is "to isolate the guerrillas politically through  lies and slander and by blaming them for actions linked to the  dirty war."    The CNG concluded: "We know the people of Uraba will  overcome this night of terror caused by the government through  the Army and its offspring, the paramilitary. The people will  punish the culprits for the blood shed by their children."</p>

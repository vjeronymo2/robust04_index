			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aluf Ben and Yosi Torpstein] </F>   [Excerpts] [passage omitted] During his meeting with  Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin, Russian envoy Viktor  Posuvalyuk recounted that he had met in Damascus with Syrian  Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' and with the representatives of  the 10 rejectionist Palestinian organizations. In Jordan he met  with Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali.    The Russian envoy said that the representatives of the  rejectionist groups had clarified that they would continue to  oppose the agreement between the PLO and Israel and not  participate in the autonomy council.    In his talks in Damascus, Posuvalyuk received the impression  that the Syrians were attempting to portray themselves as being  in no rush to make progress in the peace process. Syria's large  debts to Russia were also discussed in the envoy's meetings with  the Syrian foreign minister; however, no agreement was reached  on the rescheduling of these debts.    Posuvalyuk said that although his government, as well as  himself personally, would like to deepen their involvement in  the peace process, Russia was currently preoccupied with its own  domestic problems and its relations with its close neighbors.    The Russian envoy noted that Prime Minister Rabin's visit to  Russia had been "very successful" and that his current tour of  Israel would help imbue the framework established during the  previous visit with additional content.    After his meeting with Beilin, Posuvalyuk explained: "I have  not come to intervene in the negotiations but rather to discuss  their details with my interlocutors." Beilin noted that  Russia's involvement in the negotiations between Israel and the  Arab countries was very important.    After the meeting, Posuvalyuk toured Jericho. At al-Aqsa  camp, formerly known as the Hanan camp and headquarters for the  Palestinian police in the Jericho area, Posuvalyuk met with  Brigadier General 'Isma'il al-Hajj Jabr, the police commander  and with Jibril al-Rujub, head of Palestinian preemptive  security (a parallel body to the Israeli Shin Bet). The meeting  was arranged and coordinated by officials at Orient House, the  Palestinian headquarters in East Jerusalem.    At their meeting, which was conducted in Arabic due to the  fact that the Russian envoy has a doctorate in Arabic studies,  the Palestinians expressed their hope that Russia, as in the  past, would continue to support them. The Palestinians also  reviewed the situation in Jerusalem and the difficulties in  implementing the Gaza-Jericho First agreement, especially the  issue of the Israeli settlements and the Shalom 'Al Yisra'el  Synagogue affair.    The Palestinians noted that they had to rebuild the  infrastructure and institutions in the autonomous areas and  train a professional work force. Russia agreed to train  Palestinian security personnel, including members of the  preemptive security forces. These issues will be discussed in  detail in the meeting that will take place today at the Orient  House between Posuvalyuk and Palestinian politicians, including  Faysal al-Husayni, who returned from Tunis yesterday after being  appointed minister without portfolio in the Palestinian  authority.    Posuvalyuk said that after meeting representatives of all  the  regional parties, he had come to "feel we have all managed to  overcome the results of the Hebron massacre and must now move  forward. I am convinced that both the Arab states and Israel  aspire to promote the process.    The Russian envoy expressed the hope that the Palestinians  "will continue the negotiations and not get bogged down in  internal disputes. This is the first chance the Palestinians  have ever had to manage their own affairs and they should  exploit this opportunity and pursue the peace process."    Posuvalyuk expressed the assessment that the peace process  would not slow down following the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces]  withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho. He said he was  optimistic about the process, especially after visiting Jericho.  The Russian envoy opined that the process had reached a stage  from which there was no turning back.

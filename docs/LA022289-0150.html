			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HIGH COURT GIVES CREDITORS OF BANKRUPT FIRMS A BREAK  </P> <P> The Supreme Court, in a victory for the federal government, today made it  easier for some creditors to collect more money from companies that declare  bankruptcy.  </P> <P> The court, by a 5-4 ruling in a case from Detroit, said the government is  entitled to certain interest payments on taxes owed by a bankrupt company.  </P> <P> The case stems from a petition filed by Ron Pair Enterprises before a  bankruptcy judge in Detroit in 1984.  </P> <P> The government said the company owed it $53,278 in taxes, penalties and  interest accrued before the filing of the bankruptcy petition.  </P> <P> The company agreed to pay the amount but refused to pay additional interest  accrued after the filing of the petition.  </P> <P> The government said the company should pay the post-filing interest because the  collateral, tax liens on company property, that secure the debt owed the  government exceed the amount of the original debt.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court today agreed, and overturned a ruling by the U.S. 6th Circuit  Court of Appeals against the government.  </P> <P> Justice Harry A. Blackmun, in his opinion for the court, said the bankruptcy  code, which was revised by Congress in 1978, permits post-filing interest  payments in such cases.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 26 (CNS)--The China State  Capabilities Report written by Doctor Wang Shaoguang and  Doctor Hu Angang and considered the foundation for policy-making  in the fields of reform of finance and taxation to be carried  out this year has been published by the Liaoning People's  Publishing House.    The 200,000-word article originally titled "Strengthening  the  Dominant Role Played by the Central Government in the Change to  a Market Economy" was completed last June and drew the immediate  attention of the Chinese leadership including the Central  Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council,  the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the  Chinese People's Poltical Consultative Conference, all of which  circulated the full text while major mass media across the world  gave it a prominent coverage.    The report on the national situation aroused great interest  at home and abroad mainly because of its exposure of certain  problems facing China including its weakening capabilities. The  report suggested that reform did not amount to the releasing of  power to lower levels and the getting rid of profit, and opening  the country to the outside world did not account for the general  practice of preferential policies being given to foreign  businessmen. The report also put forward some concrete  proposals on the upgrading of national strength and the building  up of a stable relationship between the central authorities and  local ones and many of these proposals were accepted by the  leadership in the country. The proposals called for a  continuous increase of financial revenue put at 25 percent for  the short term, 30 percent for the middle term and over 35  percent for the long term. The proportion of financial revenue  for the central authorities in the overall financial income will  reach 50 percent in the short term, 60 percent for the middle  term and over 65 percent for the long term.    Some important revisions were made to the report before its  publication including into its concluding part three  prerequisites for the strengthening of the dominant role played  by the central government and five items required of the  establishment of the market economy system. As China is now  undertaking the 16th financial restructuring since 1949, Mr Hu  incorporated material regarding the previous 15 financial  changes and his comments on them into the appendix of the  report. The article also put forward nine main policies to be  applied to maintain the relationship between the central  authorities and regions because the handling of the relationship  between the central government and regions had become a hot  issue.</p>

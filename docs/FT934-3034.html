			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Overseas side holds North West back North West Water, the privatised utility, yesterday announced a 6 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 138.2m and a slightly higher than expected dividend. But its share price slipped 17p to 567p as the company reported a sharp drop in profits from non-regulated businesses, in which it has invested some Pounds 140m since privatisation. In particular the group's process engineering operation in the US saw operating profits plummet from Pounds 7.3m to Pounds 3m. The shares may also have been hit by North West's decision to delay paying the interim dividend until April 6. This will save the company advance corporation tax, but result in a lower tax credit for pension funds. Mr Bob Ferguson, finance director, said the company had sought to compensate for the delayed dividend by increasing the payout from 7.13p to 7.67, against an expected 7.65p. Earnings per share rose 16 per cent to 39.3p. Group sales were 7.5 per cent ahead at Pounds 455.3m. Analysts also said the group was suffering from uncertainty over management succession following the abrupt departure last month of Mr Bob Thian, the chief executive linked to the group's international expansion. 'The shares are likely to underperform because there seems to be a lack of senior management at the top,' said one analyst. North West suffered a 54 per cent decline in profits from non-regulated businesses to Pounds 3.2m on sales 10 per cent higher at Pounds 85.4m. Mr Ferguson said exchange rate movements had contributed about Pounds 9m. The division had been hit by recession in the US. Mr Ferguson said the outlook was encouraging, however, with order books 27 per cent ahead of last year at Pounds 70m. North West has also been successful in winning international contracts, and yesterday announced the signing of its latest joint venture to extend and operate Malaysia's sewerage system. The international contracts were expected to begin to contribute to earnings next year, said Mr Ferguson. The UK regulated water business showed a 16 per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 168.3m. Turnover rose by 7 per cent to Pounds 369.6m. There was a Pounds 4.6m decline in industrial and commercial volumes. North West also announced the appointment of its seventh non-executive director, Sir Peter Middleton, deputy chairman of Barclays Bank. Lex, Page 18</p>

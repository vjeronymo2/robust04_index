			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Liu Xiaojun (0491 1420 6511): "What Are the U.S. </F> Motivations in Promoting a New Pacific Community?"]    [Text] In his speech at Waseda University in Japan in July  of 1993, Clinton raised the concept of a new Pacific Community.  The Clinton government believes that the future of the United  States lies in broader, deeper and more focused participation in  the affairs of the Pacific rim region and that there is a need  for a "community based on a foundation of shared strength,  shared prosperity and joint responsibility for democratic  values." Ultimately, this community would include all the  members of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum [APEC]  and of NAFTA. The strong U.S. support for the informal meeting  of APEC leaders in Seattle was one step in the pursuit of this  plan. What is the ultimate motivation behind the U.S. enthusiasm  for a new Pacific Community?    1. Hitting Two Targets With One Arrow on the Economic Front.    The two economic goals considered by the U.S. in promoting a  New Pacific Community are obtaining economic advantages and  exerting influence.    The concept of a New Pacific Community is an important  strategic step in the implementation of an adjustment in U.S.  policy towards the Asian Pacific. From the point of view of  obtaining economic advantages: 1) It could rejuvenate the  domestic economy. The United States has a large trade deficit,  and economic recovery has been slow. Clinton entered the White  House on the banner of solving domestic economic problems. He  feels that one method of solving this thorny problem is to  increase foreign exports, because American prosperity depends to  a large degree on international trade which constitutes one  fourth of the U.S. GNP. Stagnated export markets increase the  difficulty of domestic economic recovery, and it is the Asian  Pacific region which can expand the scope of American foreign  trade. Clinton says that the Asian Pacific region is "an  unlimited source of employment, income, partner relationships,  and economic growth." The Asian Pacific region has rapid  economic growth and great development potential. Maintaining and  expanding relations with this region can open new markets for  American products and capital and provide hope for U.S.  employment opportunities and labor exports and thus allow the  U.S. to cast off these economic difficulties. 2) It can create a  foundation for entering the Pacific century. U.S. leaders and  experts recognize that the 21st century will be the "Pacific  century." It will be more challenging and more prosperous than  the Atlantic century. If the U.S. clings to "Eurocentrism," it  will be excluded from the tide of development in the Asian  Pacific. Christopher said, "As we approach the next century, the  U.S. must keep its sights turned to Asia, on the future of the  Pacific." The Asian Pacific has 40 percent of the world's  population and a 70 billion U.S. dollar GNP, or 25 percent of  the world GNP, and a 7 percent annual growth rate. U.S. trade  with this region is up to 344 billion U.S. dollars, or one third  of U.S. foreign trade. Every one percent increase in exports  from the U.S. to the Asian Pacific region adds 53,300 job  opportunities to the U.S. economy. Five of the United States'  ten most important trading partners are members of APEC. The  proposal to establish a new Pacific Community is an important  step for the U.S. in entering the Asian Pacific market. An essay  by the U.S. Heritage Foundation said that Clinton's concept of a  Community would, after 30 years, allow for APEC and NAFTA to  combine into a unified, broad-based, Asia-America free trade  alliance which would be the largest free trade zone in the  world. The task to be done at this phase is to transform APEC  into an economically integrated regional framework which would  establish a foundation for links between the U.S. and Asia. 3)  It could facilitate the signing of a Pacific free trade  agreement. Beginning with the Bush administration, an important  strategic concept underlying the U.S. proposals for a Pacific  community, later expanded to the New Pacific Community, has been  the eventual signing of a Pacific free trade agreement. The Asia  Pacific economic community proposal suggested by Clinton at the  Seattle meeting is a specific step towards a New Pacific  Community, the goal being to transform APEC into a regional  organization for multilateral trade negotiations. With this as a  lever to promote liberalized investment, eliminate trade  barriers, and use liberalized trade to expand investment  opportunities for U.S. enterprise, the Asian Pacific region is  to be transformed into a free market with strong U.S.  involvement. With trade barriers eliminated, the United States  will then use every means possible, leading with aircraft,  electronic communications, finance and other areas where the  United States has competitive confidence, to allow U.S.  enterprise to penetrate the Pacific market. By strengthening  close economic ties with Asian Pacific countries within the  scope of a community, the United States can then rely on its own  superiorities and the standards and systems of multilateral  structures to exert influence on other countries. The United  States is accustomed to using relevant legal provisions to exert  pressure on other countries. The United States is attempting to  use APEC as a springboard to reaffirm the influence of the  United States in this region. Another aspect is that, after the  end of the cold war, U.S. influence in the Asian Pacific  declined. The economic power of Japan, the ASEAN countries, and  other Asian Pacific countries strengthened. The United States  is concerned that Japan will use economic methods to establish  the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" that military  methods failed earlier to achieve. To maintain the leadership  role and influence of the United States in the Asian Pacific  region after the end of the cold war, the United States has  emphasized the need to create a new mechanism for cooperation  and to develop a new policy towards the Asian Pacific region  which is consistent with the new reality and has "coalescing  power." The U.S. Assistant Trade Negotiator stated, "if we are  to continue to have competitive leadership in the Asian Pacific  region, we must bring together a constructive alliance with the  Asian Pacific countries."    2. Killing Two Birds With One Stone on the Security Front    The two security goals of the United States in promoting a  New Pacific Community are to maintain stability in the Asian  Pacific region, thus protecting the security of the United  States, and to urge other countries to share some of the defense  burden.    The U.S. view is that, after the end of the cold war, the  factors most contributing to instabaility in Asia have been the  widespread military buildup in many Asian Pacific countries, the  suspicion that North Korea and other countries have developed  nulear weapons, and the possibility of regional conflict among  the coastal countries due to the lack of clearly defined borders  and economic waters. Of the five remaining Communist-controlled  countries in the world, four are in Asia. In order to establish  a stable situation in the Asian Pacific region, the New Pacific  Community should perform a security function, the focal points  of which would be to continue stationing troops in Asia to  project a threat and achieve victory in any conflict; prevent  nuclear proliferation, and conduct new regional dialogue. The  United States believes that maintaining appropriate military  strength in the Asian Pacific region will contribute to  stability and economic growth in the region. The United States  will continue to maintain military alliances with Japan, South  Korea, Singapore, the Phillipines, and Australia and strengthen  strategic relations with ASEAN so that the U.S. can use  Southeast Asian military facilities at any time. Decreases in  the U.S. defense budget will be mainly in Europe rather than in  Asia. The United States continues to maintain 15 percent of its  military strength in Asia to prevent the emergence of a power  vacuum and a new hegemonist force. The U.S. military believes  that the establishment of a multilateral military framework in  the Asian Pacific is still a matter for the rather distant  future, because this can only be brought about after the  "process of establishing a community" is carried out. Currently  only APEC can exercise a security function. The United States  will be able to perform a positive function in an organization  for multilateral dialogue like APEC.    The United States sees the discussion of a joint approach to  the challenges of defense in the region as a priority issue,  because the Americans feel that it is a difficult burden to  maintain the region's stability single-handed. President Clinton  has called for cooperation in establishing joint defense, joint  prosperity and democratic values in the Pacific region. The  United States intends to link the provision of a security  function in the Asian Pacific market with the bilateral security  treaties maintained between the United States and Pacific region  countries. With regard to security strategy in the Asian Pacific  region, the United States will no longer put its efforts into  seeking new military bases but on conducting regional security  dialogue. Utilizing the forum of a community and establishing  bilateral and multilateral dialoque mechanisms will cause more  countries to be concerned and share the responsibility for  regional defense. U.S. defense authorities have indicated  clearly that Japan should assume greater responsibility in the  joint defense of the Asian Pacific region and has also urged  South Korea to make greater contributions to defense.    3. Two for One on the Political Front    The political motives behind the U.S. enthusiasm for a New  Pacific Community are to promote American values and also to  provide for the strategic containment of certain countries.    The countries of Southeast Asia and some other countries in  Asia still have differences with the United States on Western  democracy and human rights concepts . The United States has  always wanted to conduct "open dialogue" with Asian countries on  the issue of human rights but also does not want the human  rights issue to damage relations with the countries of this  region. The establishment of a type of community would create an  ideal forum for carrying out this task. The United States also  wants to use APEC to exert pressure on North Korea on the  nuclear issue. Another important motive for the U.S. promotion  of a New Pacific Community is the containment of Asian countries  especially China as well as to make the activities of APEC serve  U.S. strategy. The U.S. view is that China presents the greatest  current and future threat to the United States in the Asian  Pacific region. Hence the Clinton government wants to adopt a  more subtle policy towards China than that of the Bush  government. They wish to use the context of a community to bind  the hands and feet of China and eliminate this potential  "threat." Their method is to urge China to develop towards a  free market economy and get China to participate in an  integrated economic and security mechanism to prevent the  possibility of China conducting "outward expansion." The U.S.  also hopes to use the Asia Pacific community to contain the  divergent tendencies of Japan and the ASEAN countries.    4. Future Prospects    The U.S. plans to implement the New Pacific Community in  three phases. The first phase is to sign a communique promoting  the elimination of trade barriers. The second phase will be to  discuss and delineate long-term goals at a summit meeting. The  third phase will be to establish a community. The U.S. thinking  is to first make APEC into an organization for multilateral  negotiations and then, in one set of successful negotiations,  make APEC and NAFTA into one combined unit.    Although the United States has spared no effort in promoting  the New Pacific Community, the future prospects are not  optimistic. There are differences in values between the U.S. and  Asian countries. There are serious gaps in economic, security  and human rights issues. Several Asian countries, especially the  ASEAN countries, have expressed unhappiness with U.S. attempts  to control APEC and do not approve of making APEC into a  negotiating organization. The Malaysian premier did not  participate in the Seattle meeting because of this. Thus it will  be very difficult for the United States to manifest its concept.  A New Pacific Community will not emerge in the Asian Pacific in  the near future. The United States will, however, become more  and more agressive surrounding the question of a New Pacific  Community as well as in protecting U.S. national interests and  grasping for leadership in the economic development of the Asian  Pacific region.</p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MCMAHON WOULD APPROVE TRADE TO CHARGERS: AGENT  </P> <P> The agent for Jim McMahon says the controversial quarterback is unhappy with  the way the Bears treated him in 1988 and that the Chargers are one of two  teams McMahon would consider playing for if the Bears trade him.  </P> <P> "San Diego would be an interesting place for Jim," agent Steve Zucker said. "If  we had to pick a spot, we'd probably pick San Diego."  </P> <P> McMahon's season ended Sunday in Chicago when the Bears lost, 28-3, to the San  Francisco 49ers in the NFC championship game. McMahon, starting for the first  time in 10 weeks because of a sprained knee, completed 14 of 29 passes for 121  yards and had 1 pass intercepted. Bear Coach Mike Ditka removed McMahon with  6:53 remaining and replaced him with Mike Tomczak.  </P> <P> Thus ended a frustrating season for the former Brigham Young quarterback who  injured his knee in Week 9 and missed 7 games. McMahon said he was ready to  return and was miffed when Ditka started Tomczak the last regular season game  and the first playoff game.  </P> <P> "The Bears treated him (McMahon) so bad, you have no idea," Zucker said. "It's  been a very rough year the way the Bears treated him."  </P> <P> It was also a year in which the Bears saw enough improvement in Tomczak to  consider him a starter. More and more, it begins to look as if McMahon is the  quarterback of somebody else's future.  </P> <P> Zucker said he was unaware of any trade talks under way between the Bears and  the Chargers. There were unsubstantiated reports Tuesday in two Chicago  newspapers suggesting a deal between the Chargers and the Bears for McMahon was  imminent.  </P> <P> But no official for either team has confirmed any such talks. Steve Ortmayer,  the Chargers' director of football operations, and Alex Spanos, the team's  owner, did not return phone calls from The Times Wednesday.  </P> <P> Earlier in the week, Bear president Michael McCaskey said: "You think that (a  trade) is happening. It's not. You guys (the media) are talking about that and  nobody else is. We just haven't had time to talk about it."  </P> <P> The Bears traditionally spend the first week after the season evaluating their  personnel and trying to decide what direction they want to head during the  off-season.  </P> <P> "We have not spent much time thinking about those things (trades) yet,"  McCaskey said.  </P> <P> But it's no secret the Bears have grown increasingly weary of McMahon's  outlandish behavior and continual public potshots at McCaskey, Ditka and  others. At one point this season, McMahon said team trainer Fred Caito couldn't  tell "the difference between a blister and a compound fracture."  </P> <P> The injury-prone McMahon will turn 30 in August. The most games he has started  for the Bears in his 7-year NFL career was 13 in 1983. In 1985, he returned  from shoulder, neck, leg and buttocks injuries to lead the Bears to a 46-10  victory over New England in Super Bowl XX.  </P> <P> "Jim's mobility is still good," Zucker said. "His knees are fine and he can  still move."  </P> <P> But most regular observers of the Bears this season did not share Zucker's  opinion of McMahon's skills.  </P> <P> A news columnist with the Chicago Sun-Times reported Tuesday that the Chargers  would have to give up a No. 1 and a No. 3 pick in the 1991 draft for McMahon.  However, word around the league is that many teams wouldn't take McMahon off  the Bears' hands for free: Too little discipline; too many injuries.  </P> <P> McMahon has 1 more year remaining on a contract that will pay him a base salary  of $800,000 in 1989. The other West Coast team he has talked about playing for  in the past is the Raiders.  </P> <P> "But the Raiders just spent a lot of money on Jay Schroeder," Zucker said.  "Besides, Jim feels like San Diego (Jack Murphy Stadium) is his lucky stadium.  It's grass and it's good weather."  </P> <P> In the 1980 Holiday Bowl, McMahon led BYU to a thrilling 46-45 victory over  Southern Methodist when he hit receiver Clay Brown with a 41-yard touchdown  pass as time expired. In that game, McMahon completed 32 of 49 passes for 446  yards and 4 touchdowns.  </P> <P> He returned to the Holiday Bowl with the Cougars the following year to complete  27 of 43 passes for 342 yards and 3 touchdowns in a 38-36 victory over  Washington State.  </P> <P> There's no question the Chargers need a quarterback, a point former Cleveland  Coach Marty Schottenheimer reportedly emphasized to them over the weekend in  his talks with Ortmayer and Spanos about the team's vacant head coaching job.  </P> <P> The incumbent Charger starter is Mark Malone, who finished last among AFC  quarterbacks in 1988 with a rating of 58.8. Malone played behind an offensive  line that improved dramatically during the season, but one that was made up of  four free agents and a fourth-round rookie.  </P></p>

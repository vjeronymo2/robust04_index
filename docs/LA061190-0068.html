			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY DIGEST: CAMARILLO;  </P> <P> PROTEST STALLS RADIO ANTENNA ORDINANCE  </P> <P> An attempt by the Camarillo Planning Commission to write an ordinance  controlling the installation of amateur radio antennas has been stalled because  radio operators protested.  </P> <P> After receiving complaints from at least one resident about the appearance of  some shortwave radio antennas and support towers, the City Council asked the  Planning Department to draft a zoning ordinance controlling them.  </P> <P> The aim was to limit the overall height of antennas to 75 feet when in use and  35 feet when collapsed and not being used. All parts of the support tower and  antenna would be required to be in the rear or side yard of a home and no  closer than five feet from any property line.  </P> <P> The rules would not apply to existing units. But about two dozen amateur radio  operators protested, saying the restrictions might limit the ability of new  towers to transmit and receive signals.  </P> <P> Several offered to work with planners on an acceptable ordinance. The  commission continued the public hearing and debate until July 17.  </P> <P> Planning commissioners also approved the development of three land parcels for  the eventual construction of residential units.  </P> <P> Churchman Corp., owned by local developer Glenn Churchman, will be allowed to  divide a 4.68-acre vacant lot in the Las Posas Estates neighborhood into four  lots to build single-family houses.  </P> <P> Chuck Smith of Newbury Park got permission to build three houses on a vacant  lot on Fulton Street between Barry and Lomita streets. Because the lot is  narrow, a city requirement for a recreational vehicle parking space was  deleted.  </P> <P> The division of a 1.25-acre parcel into two lots was granted to Giovanni  Tromba. It will enable him to build a house on one lot and sell the other. The  property, which was annexed by the city in 1978, is east of Terra Bella Lane  and north of Upland Road.  </P> <P> Planning commissioners agreed to consider allowing a recreational-vehicle sales  and services complex within the city's limited-manufacturing zone, where retail  sales are generally prohibited.  </P> <P> Commissioners also modified landscaping requirements for commercial, industrial  and large residential developments in an effort to cut water use.  </P> <P> The new guidelines limit the amount of lawn used on a project to a maximum of  30% of the landscaped area and spell out what type of watering systems should  be used. The modifications require that irrigation systems include an automatic  shut-off device for rain periods, and that drip or micro-spray systems be used  when appropriate, such as in flower boxes or around shrubs.

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Pay restraint and the ERM THE UK government, like the economy, is stuck. There is no shortage of advice from business and the City, peddling pet schemes for reviving growth and closing the budget deficit. Some are half-cocked; others are precluded by European commitments. None offers a release from the current stranglehold of high interest rates and heavy debts. But one idea, floated by Mr Howard Davies, the new director general of the Confederation of British Industry, deserves scrutiny. Rather than cut infrastructure spending next year in order to meet its spending target, Mr Davies says that the government should freeze the public wage bill. Squeezing public sector pay is a tried and tested method for reducing public spending when the government's budget is in a mess. Mrs Thatcher tried it in the first half of the 1980s with some success. But the strategy failed the test of good governance. The consequent fall in the wages of public employees relative to their private sector counterparts led directly to the problems of recruitment, retention and motivation which plagued the public services in the latter part of the decade. Mr Davies is right to urge the government not to savage its already meagre capital spending budget; but freezing public sector wages could be an equally short-term solution. In some areas, there may be scope for wage increases offset by efficiency gains, although now is not the best time to cut public employment. But imposing zero increases on the bulk of the public sector will only cause severe problems when the economy recovers. Yet the government should not dismiss Mr Davies's suggestion out of hand. The budget deficit is only one of the economy's current problems. At least as important is the effect of excessively high wage inflation, in both the traded and non-traded sectors, on the competitiveness of British industry. With sterling fixed in the exchange rate mechanism, higher wage inflation than in other European countries means squeezed profits, fewer exports and probably higher interest rates too. UK wage inflation is still too high, even after eight quarters of recession and a rise in unemployment in excess of 1 million. Over the past six months, earnings have risen at an annual rate of 4.7 per cent, while pay settlements are running at below 4 per cent. But these rates must fall to 3 and 2 per cent respectively if the UK is to hold its own in Europe, let alone regain some of the lost competitiveness of the past three years. The public sector must adjust to a low inflation life in the ERM. The pay review bodies set up since the mid 1980s in response to the recruitment problems caused by lagging public sector pay have served many public employees well over the past year: public sector wages increases were 2.5 percentage points above private sector settlements in 1991-92, clawing back much of the ground lost in the late 1980s. They must now turn their sights to the future. The government should state categorically that it will not accept settlements in excess of 2 per cent next year and stick to its guns. The onus, then, will be on British businesses and their representatives likewise to adjust to the realities of ERM life. Mr Davies's advice is welcome; but he is no longer the public sector's auditor. He should now attend to the inflationary tendencies of his new constituency.</p>

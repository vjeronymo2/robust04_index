			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Daoud M. Mir, Afghan charge d'affaires in Paris </F> and minister counsellor: "The Battle for Kabul"]    [Text] The battle for Kabul which is now being fought is  no longer a simple manifestation of struggles among ethnic  groups or factions: Instead it is an attempt to seize power by  Babrak Karmal's former Communists and Golboddin Hekmatyar's  extremists openly supported by Iran, Arab terrorists, and  extreme nationalist circles in Moscow opposed to President  Yeltsin.    Why this alliance of extremes and against whom is it really  directed? The coalition which wants to overthrow President  Rabbani brings together the losers of the end of the Cold War,  former Communists and fanatics who have taken up the torch of  the "anti-imperialist" struggle. This coalition is in step with  the alliance of extreme nationalists and Communists which is  developing in Russia. Today these extremists, convinced of the  insurmountable opposition among cultures, tend to smile on  Islamic radicalism in the Muslim world.    What is also new is Iran's direct intervention in Afghan  affairs. Util now it was Pakistan, supported by private Saudi  networks, which had tried to impose its favorite in Kabul and we  condemned it for that. But Pakistani policy has now changed;  similarly, the Saudi Government has made a clear break with the  extremists. Unfortunately, these positive gestures did not mark  the end of foreign interference: Iran openly supports General  Dostam, former head of the Communist militia, and Golboddin  Hekmatyar, head of Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan],  who have been shelling Kabul for 18 months, and Babrak Karmal  who was placed in power by the 1979 Soviet invasion.  <H5>  Why? </H5>   But why are the Iranians and the former Communists  interested  in Afghanistan? Do they want to turn it into a base for action  against the moderate Muslim countries and Western interests in  the world? The armed extremists of the FIS [Islamic Salvation  Front], who are perpetrating one outrage after another in  Algeria, were trained in Hekmatyar's camps; it is from these  same camps that the armed groups now active in Azerbaijan come.  It was immediately after President Rabbani's visit to Egypt  that the decision to attempt a coup d'etat against him was made.  The president was launching a rapprochement with the moderate  Muslim countries and trying to build a stable, neutral, and  moderate Afghanistan. After 15 years of jihad against the  Communists, we do not need to prove our Muslim loyalty and we  think that dialogue can be established between the Muslim world  and the West: We are being made to pay for it.    Today, the defense forces under the command of Ahmad Shah  Masud are the last bastion of peace in a tolerant Afghanistan.  Many commanders from different ethnic groups have mobilized  their troops to defend the state. So far the Wahdat Shi'ites  have refused to bow to Iran's orders urging them to join the  conflict.    A victory by the Communist-Islamic coalition would make  Afghanistan an inviolable base for world terrorism, because who  would envisage action against Kabul? That would enable Iran to  pursue its policy of destabilization using others as  intermediaries. The United States, which supported Hekmatyar  until the last minute, is now losing interest in Afghanistan.  But the specter of the Cold War is still there with its  procession of dead and injured, and its destruction amid the  snow and cold. We urge the European countries to condemn the  attempted coup d'etat in Kabul before it is too late.</p>

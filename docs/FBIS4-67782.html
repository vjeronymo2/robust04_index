			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: ``U.S. and Indian Concerns''] </F>   [Text] To articulate the outcome of U.S.-India talks held  by Mr. Talbott in New Delhi, India used not Dinesh Singh, its  Foreign Minister, but its Minister of State, Salman Khursheed.  Not because Dinesh Singh is less competent but that is India's  way to telling the world that despite the massacre of Muslims in  Kashmir and elsewhere in India (the latest was Bombay), it has  no animus against the Muslim. For one thing, having a few  Muslim quislings on its side keeps the facade of Indian  secularism alive and for another, people like Khursheed and  Farooq Abdullah can always be relied upon to be more loyal than  the king. After having shot down every proposal that Mr.  Talbott made for peace in the Subcontinent, the Indians it seems  used the opportunity to convey to the U.S. their desire to be  recognised as a mini-superpower with all its concomitants --  nuclear weapons, large army, etc. That Mr. Talbott was  predisposed to buy that can be gleaned by some of the  observations he made. Referring to India's ``strong democratic  tradition, its size, its growing economic strength,'' he said  that it ``is a leader well beyond the confines of this region.''  Let us compare that with what Mr. Khursheed said. He said that  a fresh ``geographic definition of the region,'' was called for  because India's ``concerns go beyond Pakistan.'' Having  accepted that premise, Mr. Talbott went on to place India at par  with Germany and Japan in their claims for a permanent seat in  the UN Security Council [SC]. Yet neither Germany nor Japan is,  as of now, in occupation of a disputed territory, nor has either  been accused of massive human rights abuses, nor has either  waged a war against a weaker neighbour. Both are in favour of  nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament. India's claim to  eminence rests on its refusal to accept UN Resolutions or any  mediation in its disputes with neighbours, has a well-documented  record of human rights violations and is opposed to disarmament  and NPT. And yet such is the allure that its potential market  has for the United States that the United States arm-twist  Pakistan to give up its major security concerns because these  could come in the way of India's march to a mini-superpower  status. So far as a permanent SC seat to anyone other than the  big five is concerned, the claim of the Muslim bloc of over 50  countries is as good as anyone else's.    The American case, it seems, is that Pakistan should give up  its nuclear plans while the Indians retain their, Pakistan  should not get the warplanes it has already paid for, or the  missiles to counter the Indian stockpile, because it would  slightly reduce the advantage that India has against everyone in  the region and to regain that advantage India will have to  divert its precious economic resources. Mr. Talbott presumably  did not get the opportunity to ask Mr. Khursheed how much of its  precious resources it is already diverting in order to keep an  overwhelming advantage against its much smaller and weaker  neighbours. The highly persuasive point that Mr. Khursheed  makes is: ``Sophisticated weapons acquired by Pakistan have been  used only against India.'' True, but where has India used its  highly sophisticated weapons, of which it has far more? Logic,  unfortunately, is not India's strongest forte, where its  hegemonic ambitions are concerned. The United States too has,  it seems, to address concerns of realpolitik and not political  morality.</p>

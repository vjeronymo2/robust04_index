			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Former communists win power in Hungary Former communists returned to power in Hungary yesterday after winning an absolute majority in the second and decisive round of parliamentary elections. The Hungarian Socialist party - the revamped communists - won 209 of the 386 seats in the new parliament. That enables the party to govern alone, if it chooses, without the moderating influence of the coalition partner that the diplomatic and business community had hoped for. Hungary joins Poland and other east European countries where hardship has pushed voters back into the embrace of revamped communists. In yesterday's vote, the Socialists relegated the Hungarian Democratic Forum, at present the largest party in the parliament, to a humiliating third place with an estimated 37 seats, down from 165 in 1990. The Socialists said earlier they would invite the Alliance of Free Democrats, the liberals placed second with a 70 seats, to join a coalition government. However, the Free Democrats have said that an absolute Socialist majority would all but preclude their participation in a coalition government in which they would be dispensable. Nor, liberal leaders said, would they take ministerial positions under Mr Gyula Horn, the 61-year-old Socialist leader, a former foreign minister and long-time communist. One-party government carries connotations of the monopoly of power exercised by the communist regime and few even in the Socialist party favour the option. Mr Laszlo Bekesi, the Socialists' free-marketeer economic spokesman and a possible compromise prime minister, said last week that only a broad and solid coalition could implement the austerity programme necessary to contain twin current account and budget deficits.</p>

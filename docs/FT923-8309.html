			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets: South African equities fall as De Beers loses 6 per cent DE BEERS's warning of a substantial cut in its final dividends saw over R3.2bn wiped off the market capitalisation of the diamond giant and its associated companies, Anglos, Anamint and JCI. De Beers, which reported its half-year results at midday, dropped R4.50, or 6.2 per cent to R68.50 in active trade after a R2 fall on Monday, while Anglos fell R3 to R109.75 and Anamint, which has an effective 25 per cent share of De Beers linked units, fell R6 or 7.2 per cent to R77. JCI lost R1 to R57. For the Johannesburg market, this helped outweigh a relatively flat performance in industrials, only 9 lower at 4,158, and the overall index dropped 37 to 3,309. The gold index, depressed by the weak bullion price, was off 10 at 994.</p>

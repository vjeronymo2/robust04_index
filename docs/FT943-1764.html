			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Aerostructures shares dive 50p after warning Shares in Aerostructures Hamble, the former British Aerospace aircraft components subsidiary floated last May, nosedived yesterday after a trading statement warned of difficulties with several contracts. The shares, issued at 120p, fell by 50p to close at 73p. At the time of the float, four of the directors involved in the 1990 management buy-out from BAe sold 2.9m shares worth almost Pounds 3.5m. Mr Andy Barr, the chief executive, who retained a 5.93 per cent stake, sold 1.45m shares. Yesterday's statement - described by one City analyst as 'nebulous' - opened with a bald statement that British Aerospace, Aerostructure's biggest customer, had 'published its interim results this morning.' Aerostructures - chaired by Lord King - has been working to reduce its dependency on its former owner, which accounted for 93 per cent of its business in 1990 and 78 per cent last year. However, the statement did not refer to any particular British Aerospace contract. The company said that, while trading in the first half was broadly in line with expectations, 'operational difficulties encountered recently have led to margins on a number of contracts being placed under pressure,' adversely affecting the full-year result. British Aerospace said yesterday that costs were being cut at the Jetstream and Avro regional passenger aircraft businesses. The intention was to stem losses caused by reduced production volumes because of poor demand. It added that suppliers had agreed to price cuts. Aerostructures has contracts to build parts for both the Avro RJ/146 regional jet and the Jetstream 61/ATP. Aerostructures, which will report its interim results early next month, said the board was 'acting to rectify the operational problems.' It was also 'examining the need for further action in the light of the continuing unfavourable conditions in the aerospace sector.' The prospectus, in which the directors described the long-term outlook for the civil aircraft market as 'positive,' showed that operating profit margins had been lifted from 8.9 per cent in 1991 to 11.3 per cent last year. One analyst suggested yesterday that if BAe were losing money on its aircraft, it would not be pleased by such high margins at its subcontractors.</p>

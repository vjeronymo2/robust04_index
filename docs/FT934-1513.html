			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Rift opens over 'going concern' A damaging rift has opened in the accountancy profession over how far ahead accounts should provide any assurance that a company will survive. Two bodies responsible for drafting guidelines cannot agree on the period covered by the 'going concern' assumption. This is a central issue in audited accounts, providing confidence that a company is not about to collapse. A working group was established this year by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, on behalf of the Cadbury committee, to consider guidance for directors. It wants no change. The institute says that accounts should only provide reassurance that the company will survive as far as the end of the financial year. It says that projections beyond that are not reliable. A group from the Auditing Practices Board, which is drafting guidelines for auditors, this week recommended that the period should be extended to provide greater assurance. The board says that many of the companies in most difficulty would delay issuing accounts until well into the next year, so the institute's assurance would last a very short time. The board wants to extend the period for 12 months from the signing of the accounts. The institute's working party is believed to have pressed the board to withhold its proposals until the issue had been further debated. Now that the board has taken an independent line the institute may produce its own draft early next year.</p>

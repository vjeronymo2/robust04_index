			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / International Company News: The Equitable forms link with disability insurer THE EQUITABLE, the large but troubled US life insurance company in which France's Axa has a 49 per cent stake, said yesterday it was forming a 'strategic alliance' with UNUM, a medium-sized insurance company which specialises in disability insur-ance. The Equitable, which turned itself from a mutual insurance operation into a shareholder-owned company earlier this year to boost capital, said the tie-up was part of a general strategy of concentrating on 'core life insurance and annuity business'. Equitable's 8,300-strong agency sales force will sell individual disability products 'based on product designs, administrative systems and claims management capabilities developed by UNUM'. The smaller, Maine-based insurer will reinsure a significant portion of the insurance risk on these policies. It will also reinsure part of the insurance risk on Equitable's existing individual disability business. This arrangement will not include Equitable's open disability claims, but in these cases UNUM will provide claims management services on a fee-for-service basis.</p>

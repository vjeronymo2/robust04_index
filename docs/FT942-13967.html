			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Fresh as the day it was picked Apple growing is a competitive business. English growers, facing tough foreign competition, need to be sure that storing fruit does not harm its quality, Andrew Fisher writes. To improve storage of fresh produce, Eastern Electricity, the UK power company, is pioneering a technique which uses nitrogen to help establish the right atmosphere. It will work with Domnick Hunter, the water and gas filter specialist, to produce generators for this market. The portable nitrogen generator was designed by Eastern Electricity and developed at the Industrial Energy Efficiency Centre, partly funded by the company. In the controlled atmosphere of a refrigerated warehouse, fruit continues to ripen if the building is less than air tight; if it has to be opened, the sudden rise in oxygen content accelerates deterioration. The nitrogen prevents this. Eastern Electricity: UK, 0473 553416</p>

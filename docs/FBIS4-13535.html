			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special to the JORDAN TIMES" by Natashah Bukhari] </F>   [Text]--The Islamic Action Front (IAF) and the National  Action Front (NAF) Saturday urged all Egyptian, Arab and Islamic  parties to end their "passive attitude" towards the ongoing  violence in Egypt.    "What's going on in Egypt is very danagerous because  violence  breeds more violence and deprives people of their stability and  deepens feelings of hatred among citizens of the same country,"  warned the IAF and the NAF in an open statement to the people of  Egypt and Egyptian political parties and unions.    The two parties agreed that the "destructive" violent crimes  committed by extremists in Egypt will lead to the destruction of  Egypt's economy and freeze any development plans in that  country, rendering it vulnerable and prey to "opportunists'  claws."    "We as Islamists are pained by what is going on, and we call  upon the Egyptian Government to deny the current situation and  initiate negotiations with the parties concerned to try and  contain this problem," said Hamzah Mansur, AIF Lower House  spokesman in a telephone interview with the Jordan times on  Sunday.    The deputy added that it was the responsibility of all  Egyptian nationalists to exercise pressure on their government  to seek the best interest of the people. The Egyptian  Government, he added, "should have enough common sense to  realise that it is time to talk to citizens," in order to  pinpoint the reasons behind these "daily massacres" and study  the circumstances that prompted the outbreak of violence.    In the joint statement, the IAF and NAF accused the Egyptian  Government of dictatorship. It said the Cairo government does  not give other parties the freedom to express their opinion or  move under the country's legal umbrella, which, added the  statement, causes frustration among the masses.    The two parties also accused the U.S. and Israel of  escalating the violence in Egypt by steering away from that  country's attempts at reform because they (the U.S. and Israel)  realise that Egypt is the heart of the Arab World, and  instability there would obstruct developments in the Arab World.    Mr. Mansur said that the IAF and NAF are using the media as  their means of communication with Egypt's people as, he  explained, the Egyptian's political parties' situation does not  allow for immediate contact.    He added that if their Saturday statement causes a positive  response from nationalists and Islamists in Egypt, the IAF and  NAF will be "more than glad" to offer help by sending a  delegation to Egypt to assist in establishing bridges of  communication between conflicting parties there.    The IAF and the NAF warned of the seriousness of the  situation in Egypt and said that it could be "contagious."    "Therefore, it is the duty of every devout Muslim and Arab  to  do whatever possible to help end this bloodshed in order to  secure a decent living for the next generations," concluded the  joint statement.</p>

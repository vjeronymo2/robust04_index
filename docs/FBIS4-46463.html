			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lt. Col. Mykola Hnidenko, chief of the </F> Department of Science and Informatization of the Main  Directorate of Military Education of the Ministry of Defense of  Ukraine, candidate of technical sciences, docent, under the  rubric "Building the Armed Forces of Ukraine: Experience,  Problems, Prospects": "Military Science Should Already Be at  Work" -- first paragraph is NARONA ARMIYA introduction]    [Text] On 23 March, NARODNA ARMIYA published an  interview with Colonel Oleksandr Safronov, head of the  scientific center of the Kiev Air Force Institute, who holds a  doctorate in technical sciences and the title of professor. The  interview dealt with the difficult problems involved in  organizing the work of the scientific center's scientists, as  well as in developing military science in general to enable it  to provide for the needs of the Armed Forces and the  military-industrial complex of Ukraine. In an afterword  following the interview, we invited all those interested in  these issues to join in the discussion. As part of this  discussion, the editors have received an article from the Main  Directorate of Military Education of the Ministry of Defense,  which contains answers to some of the questions that were posed  in the March interview. We offer this material to all interested  specialists.    Military science in Ukraine is currently in a difficult  situation. The result of historical circumstances has been such  that now that Ukraine has become independent, 95 percent of her  military-scientific potential is comprised of scientists at  military educational institutions (vnz). Meanwhile, the system  of organizing military-scientific research, which we inherited  from the former Soviet Union, was focused mostly at military  scientific-research institutions, almost all of which are  located in Russia. Unfortunately, the military educational  institutions played a secondary role in this system.    As a consequence of this kind of scientific-technical policy  in the Armed Forces of the USSR, the normative documents that  regulated the organization of scientific work did not provide  for scientific research to be done by military educational  institutions under direct contract from the Ministry of Defense,  the branches [vydy] of the Armed Forces, and the component  services [rody viysk]. Essentially, the educational institutions  were barred from participating directly in developing new types  of weapons, military equipment, etc. These were the prerogative  of scientific-research institutes, test ranges [polihony], and  the military-industrial complex.    The military educational institutions, including those that  remained in Ukraine, lacked scientific subdivisions that could  perform, if only partially, the functions of military  scientific-research institutes. With some exceptions, the  scientific potential of the military educational institutions  was underutilized by the Ministry of Defense. As a result, the  professors and instructors and the auditors and students  [slukhachi ta kursanty], having had no opportunity to be  directly involved in scientific research, proved (as our  "Soviet" experience demonstrates) unprepared to master new types  of weapons quickly and at minimum cost. Unfortunately, they lack  the tools for achieving new scientific results independently  [vony ne volodiyut instrumentom samostiynoho zdobutku novykh  naukovykh rezultativ], which makes their training [pidhotovka  --preparation ?] economically unprofitable and thereby unable to  meet today's needs.    This was one of the main reason why the level of training of  a large portion of the graduates of the USSR's military schools  failed to meet the standards with respect to the professional  qualifications that their diplomas should have guaranteed. Small  wonder that as a result of this circumstance military  educational institutions were often accused of being too remote  from military issues and that the dissertations and diploma  projects of their graduates had little practical orientation and  their practical application was slow.    Of course, this situation did not hold true for all military  educational institutions. There were and still are among them  academies and schools, at which the level of scientific work is  high. These include, for example, the Military Engineering  Radiotechnical Academy of the Air Defense Forces [PPO], the  Kharkiv Higher Military Command Engineering School of Missile  Troops, the Kiev Higher Engineering Radiotechnical School of the  Air Defense Forces [PPO], the communications school, the  aviation school, the Sevastopol Naval Engineering School. It was  not by chance that these military educational institutions were  chosen to serve as the foundation for establishing Ukraine's  system of military education. But we should underscore once  again that these institutions were exceptions to the rule. Even  these "elite" military educational institutions had the  shortcoming described above. The scientific-research  subdivisions at these institutions were focused on narrow,  primarily exploratory and theoretical research.    We should also draw attention to the legal status of  military  scientists. The normative-legal basis governing scientific work  inherited by the Armed Forces of Ukraine prohibits military  personnel from performing scientific research and teaching for  additional pay by holding more than one job [vklyuchayuchy  sumisnytstvo posad]. It thus limits the rights of military  scientists which are guaranteed by Ukraine's laws and deprives  them of equal status with civilian specialists. These conditions  have forced many military scientists, especially in our  difficult times, to look for ways to apply their skills and  talents outside the Armed Forces of Ukraine -- in other  ministries, departments, and in commercial structures...    In other words, it is necessary to work out fundamentally  new  documents to regulate scientific work in the Armed Forces of  Ukraine. This need is dictated not only by the special features  of the structure of the scientific-research institutions that  remained in Ukraine after the division of the Armed Forces of  the USSR, but also by the need to bring these features into  conformity with the laws of Ukraine.    It is worth noting that the situation that exists in the  field of scientific-technical work in other ministries and  departments, as well as in Ukraine as a whole, is not much  better. One of the main reasons for this is inadequate funding  of science. So far, the Law of Ukraine "On the Fundamental  Principles of State Policy in the Sphere of Science and  cientific-Technical Activity..." has also not produced results.    There are thus two key tasks that need to be performed in  the  realm of building military science in Ukraine. The first is to  create a scientifically well-founded, rational system of  scientific-research institutions and organizations within the  Ministry of Defense, which would include the scientific centers  of military educational institutions, so that the needs of the  Armed Forces and the military-industrial complex of Ukraine can  be provided for in the shortest possible time. The second is to  prepare a new normative-legal foundation for scientific work in  the Armed Forces of Ukraine.    It should be recalled that as early as at the end of 1991,  the concept for creating a system of military education of  Ukraine stipulated the need for creating scientific centers  within military educational institutions to assume some of the  functions of the scientific-research institutes of the different  branches of service. Thus their primary purpose would be to work  together with the scientific-research institutions of the  Ministry of Defense and other ministries and departments, as  well as the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, to solve  military-theoretical and military-technical problems as required  by the branches of the Armed Forces and the component services.    A second and no less important task of the scientific  centers, which is dictated by the state national program for  "Education" ("Ukraine in the 21st Century"), is to promote the  integration of science and education in military educational  institutions.    The Main Directorate of Military Education is also  developing  a normative-legal base for scientific research. Thus, in order  to provide the Armed Forces of Ukraine with a mechanism for  realizing state guarantees for military personnel carrying out  contracted work to produce scientific-technical output  [naukovo-tekhnichna produktsiya], retaining and making wide use  of the military's scientific potential in scientific research to  serve the needs of the Ministry of Defense, and providing  material incentives for those engaged in this research, the  Department of Science and Informatization of the Main  Directorate of Military Education has worked out a new Statute  on the Procedure for Creating (Transferring)  Scientific-Technical Output According to Contracts in the Armed  Forces of Ukraine. This statute has been put into effect by an  order of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.    What does this document provide for that is fundamentally  new?    First of all, the statute provides for both a directive and  a  contractual approach to the organization of scientific-technical  work [NDR] in the Armed Forces of Ukraine and grants the right  to military educational institutions, scientific centers, and  other institutions and organizations of the Armed Forces that  have the capacity for carrying out scientific-technical work to  be the principal contractors to perform scientific-technical  work for the Ministry of Defense.    Second, the commanders of military units and heads of  institutions and organizations of the Ministry of Defense are  granted the right to:    create temporary creative collectives with the participation  of military personnel to perform contracted work to create  (transmit) scientific-technical output;    permit military personnel to engage in scientific and  creative activity to create scientific-technical output in  military units and institutions and organizations of the  Ministry of Defense, as well as in the institutions and  organizations of Ukraine's other ministries and departments on  terms that involve the combining of staffs [na umovakh shtatnoho  sumisnytstva];    pay military personnel and other personnel  [viyskovosluzhbovtsi i sluzhbovtsi] who take part in creating  scientific-technical output on their own time [u pozasluzhbovyy  chas];    establish bonuses for military personnel and other  personnel,  taking into account their individual creative contribution, for  top-quality performance in creating scientific-technical output  delivered to the client; there are to be no set limits in the  amounts of individual bonuses;    pay military personnel and other personnel in accordance  with  effective legislation in Ukraine for providing expert opinions  and consultation in military-scientific and military-technical  research and development and on projects in the process of  creating scientific-technical output.    At the same time, the statute provides an appropriate  mechanism for supervising the activity of officials who are  members of temporary creative collectives and engage in  scientific work at more than one job [za sumisnytstvom].    Thus, military personnel in the Armed Forces of Ukraine are  being provided with wide-ranging opportunities to realize their  scientific and creative potential. It should be noted that the  Armed Forces of Ukraine were the first among the armed forces of  the former Union to take decisive steps in this direction.    We would like to note that this important document was  worked  out with the direct assistance of officers from the Department  of Science and Informatization of the Main Directorate of  Military Education Lt. Col. O. Babenko, Capt. third grade I.  Dolhov, and Docent V. Tkachenko, chief specialist of the  department and candidate of technical sciences, as well as  specialists from military educational institutions, scientific  centers, and the Armaments Staff [shtab ozbroyennya] of the  Armed Forces of Ukraine. The latter include Lt. Gen. I.  Olenovych, Maj. Gen. O. Kovtunenko, colonels O. Matov, A.  Dorovskyy, O. Safronov, M. Lukhanin, V. Kasatkin, V. Sereda, and  others.    But the sphere of activity involved in creating a system of  scientific-research institutions in the Armed Forces of Ukraine  is much broader and its problems go well beyond those raised in  this article. Therefore, all specialists and scientists, all  those who are involved in this work, must make a great effort  and exhibit enough will, wisdom, and patience to realize the  goal that has been set to develop military science in Ukraine.</p>

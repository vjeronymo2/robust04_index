			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Businessman charged with loan deception A BUSINESSMAN was last night charged with fraud by officers investigating the multi-billion pound losses at the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Mr Mohammed Abdul Baqi, former managing director of Attock Oil, is the first man to be arrested in Britain in connection with the investigation. He was detained by the Serious Fraud Office and City of London police on Monday. Mr Baqi, 66, of Kings Langley, Hertfordshire, is charged with conspiring with BCCI to deceive BCCI (Overseas) auditors Price Waterhouse. The charges say that between November 1987 and January 1990, Mr Baqi and a man called Mr Basheer Chowdry, along with BCCI senior managers, told Price Waterhouse that Attock Oil owed sums totalling more than Dollars 76m, or about Pounds 40m, to BCCI. It is alleged Mr Baqi knew the sums were not owed to BCCI, and would not therefore have formed part of the bank's assets. Mr Baqi is due to appear at City of London magistrates' court today charged with the offence under Section One of the Criminal Law Act 1977. A Florida judge yesterday sharply reduced the jail sentences of three former BCCI executives convicted in 1990. The sentences were reduced by Judge William Hodges at the request of US prosecutors who said the three had given them information leading to higher ranking bank officers. The three are Mr Akbar Bilgrami, whose 12-year sentence was cut to 6 1/2 years; Mr Syed Hussain, whose 7 1/4 -year sentence was cut to three years; and Mr Sibte Hassan, whose sentence was reduced from three to two years.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / The Lex Column: ICI That ICI is faring better than its European competitors is due in large part to the devaluation of sterling. Yesterday's first-quarter figures benefit to the tune of Pounds 50m from improved competitiveness and the translation of overseas earnings at a favourable rate. ICI's policy of buying currency forward should help earnings later this year even if sterling appreciates. By this time next year, though, exchange rates could be working against it. Firmer prices seen in bulk chemicals might also evaporate if customers de-stock through the summer and three months of strong sales in pharmaceuticals does not constitute a trend. The cautious tone of the chairman's statement and dire results from DSM and BASF yesterday should stop the bulls getting too carried away about the cyclical upside in chemicals. The Germans and Dutch are some way behind in restructuring. The benefit from ICI's 1991 reshaping is around Pounds 100m a quarter, with the promise of more to come from last year's exceptional charge. But with Europe in such bad shape, ICI is running to stand still. There is little in the figures, then, to alter the valuation of the group ahead of demerger. If sentiment towards the drugs industry does not deteriorate, the grey market price for Zeneca of around 700p quoted by Salomon Brothers looks about right. At that price, the bioscience shares would yield a shade more than the market average. Institutions may demand a heavy discount to the share price in order to get Zeneca's rights issue away.</p>

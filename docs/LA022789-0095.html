			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TOWER'S PLEDGE LEAVES 2 SENATORS UNMOVED  </P> <P> John Tower's pledge to swear off alcohol if approved as defense secretary left  two undecided Senate Democrats unmoved today and pledging they will go over all  evidence on the nominee's character before deciding how to vote.  </P> <P> A third Democratic senator considered by some a swing vote, Bob Graham of  Florida, said he is leaning against the nomination despite Tower's pledge.  </P> <P> "I think it (the pledge) helps, but it's not just the drinking which is a  problem to me," Graham said in Miami.  </P> <P> "It's a pattern of bad judgment -- bad judgment in the 1970s in drinking, bad  judgment by placing himself in compromising positions as the U.S. arms  negotiator in Geneva in the mid-80s, bad judgment in accepting large sums from  the defense industry in the late 1980s."  </P> <P> Sen. Howell Heflin of Alabama, one of several Southern Democrats still  considered open to the White House lobbying effort for Tower, said on ABC's  "Good Morning America" that he has "to review all the evidence. I'm trying to  be open-minded, judicial and fair about it."  </P> <P> Sen. John B. Breaux (D-La.) said on the same program that he would vote against  Tower if the vote were today despite the embattled nominee's extraordinary  public pledge on Sunday.  </P> <P> "I think that if we have a serious doubt, if any senator has a serious doubt  about the competence of a candidate, that he should err on the side of safety,"  said Breaux. "In that case, it indicates voting negatively."  </P> <P> Asked whether Tower's promise to refrain from drinking had swayed him, Heflin  said he plans to read the classified FBI report on Tower today and "will review  the evidence of the drinking problem."  </P> <P> Heflin said he will consider "does he have a drinking problem that might be a  detriment to the United States national security" and "does he have a  temptation propensity that might return to drink?"  </P></p>

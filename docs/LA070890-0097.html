			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH BEAT: CHECK RAIL DISCOUNTS BEFORE GOING ON TRIP  </P> <P> If you are going to attend school overseas, with plans to travel afterward, you  may be eligible for special discounts on train transportation, particularly  those discounts that are not promoted and sold in North America. For your own  benefit, do a little research.  </P> <P> Europe-bound travelers under 26, for example, who will be residents in a  country for more than six months, are eligible to buy one-month Inter-Rail  tickets.  </P> <P> The passes offer a 50% reduction in the country of purchase, and unlimited free  second-class transportation in 20 other countries from Britain to Morocco.  Inquire at rail stations and travel agencies throughout Europe. They are now  being sold for about $297 U.S. in France.  </P> <P> An Inter-Rail card is also honored for reductions on some private Swiss  railroads and several shipping services, in such areas as the North Sea, Irish  Sea, across the English Channel, from Spain to Morocco, France to Corsica and  Italy to Sardinia.  </P> <P> It's also possible to purchase a version of the pass that includes some free  sea travel, and one that includes some free sea travel and is also valid for  any 10 days of travel within a single calendar month. The price is presently  1,500 francs, about $285 U.S.  </P> <P> Here's how to research the deals available in foreign countries.  </P> <P>  -- Check with the tourist information office of the countries you intend to  visit. Most have representatives in North America. You can find them in your  telephone directory or travel agents may have their addresses and phone  numbers.  </P> <P>  -- Inquire at student travel agencies. They often have information about  special point-to-point youth and student fares that are available through their  affiliates in foreign countries.  </P> <P>  -- Check the guidebooks that are researched for independent, budget travelers.  In a bookstore that specializes in travel publications, look for series such  as: "Let's Go" (by Harvard Student Agencies); "Lonely Planet" (Moon  Publications) or the 1990 (20th) edition of "Eurail Guide: How to Travel Europe  and All the World by Train," by Kathryn and Marvin Saltzman.  </P> <P> Although the bulk of information in the "Eurail Guide" is dedicated to Europe,  it contains information on services and tickets in 141 countries.  </P> <P> "The Eurail Guide" is also helpful with advice on popular sightseeing routes  for train travelers, and warnings of potential problems.  </P> <P> The "Eurail Guide: How to Travel Europe and the World by Train" is available in  book stores for $12.95.  </P> <P> It can also be ordered from the publisher for $14.45, which includes postage  and handling.

			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> MUSIC FALTERS AT LONG BEACH FEST  </P> <P> What a pleasure it was Saturday afternoon and evening at the second annual Long  Beach Jazz Festival. With a cool breeze blowing across the harbor, the sound  properly balanced for jazz, and brisk, no-delay stage work, the setting left  little to be desired.  </P> <P> The music, however, was not quite so flawless. After typically energetic  opening sets by Kevin Eubanks, Ernie Andrews &amp; the Capp-Pierce Juggernaut  and Fattburger, vibist Roy Ayers finally brought the crowd to its feet with a  non-stop tour through his uniquely entertaining approach to jazz.  </P> <P> Ayers is one of perhaps four or five vibes players in the world who can almost  instantly be recognized on the basis of style alone. The brisk, dancing lines  of his improvisations were brilliant examples of contemporary improvisation.  But Ayers clearly enjoyed contrasting his pure jazz with several long funk  tunes -- "Poo-Poo La-La Means I Love You" was one -- that he sang and performed  with theatrical fervor (he climbed on top of his vibes to make one story  point). The high-energy flashpoint came during a mock argument between Ayers  and percussionist/vibist Dwight Gassoway that turned into a whirlwind duel  across the bars of the vibes.  </P> <P> Ayers' long set traced in part to the typically late arrival of Freddie  Hubbard. The trumpeter's fabled undependability didn't sit well with at least  one member of the audience. When Hubbard tried to explain away his lateness by  announcing that he'd just gotten off a plane from Japan, a voice rang out of  the darkness shouting, "Yeah, man, and the check's in the mail!"  </P> <P> Whatever the real circumstances, the music which followed was disjointed and  unsteady. Hubbard, of course, can rip off a powerful solo almost any time he  wants to, and there were indeed moments of sheer brilliance. But they were only  moments, with the bulk of his efforts coming across with the fatigue of  recycled glory. The real Hubbard essence must have been left behind on the  plane from Japan.  </P> <P> Singer Diane Schuur worked more effectively with her own piano accompaniment  than she has in recent outings as a stand-up singer. The addition of  keyboardist Rob Mullins -- who provided an enormous array of synthesized sounds  and crackerjack solos -- also helped balance Schuur's frequently monochromatic  style.  </P> <P> Sticking mostly to standards like "You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To" and "Teach  Me Tonight," along with an occasional blues, she flashed occasional moments of  excellence. But Schuur continued to mistake shrillness for energy and shouting  for intensity.  </P> <P> Tenor saxophonist Stanley Turrentine, closing the evening, brought things back  into equilibrium with just the right mix. Winging comfortably through such  pop-based pieces as Marvin Gaye's "Don't Mess With Mr. T.," he contrasted  strong, blues-based improvising with easily accessible funk rhythms. It was,  finally, the perfect ending for a beautifully staged, but musically unsteady  festival performance.  </P> <P> The festival was scheduled to continue through Sunday with performances by  Alphonse Mouzon, Chick Corea, Dianne Reeves and others.

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Chile changes the rules for conversion - The central bank has responded to pressure from investors CHILE'S central bank, under pressure from foreign and Chilean investors, has relaxed the rules of its debt-equity conversion programme. Foreign companies who used debt swaps to invest in Chile can now repatriate capital after three years, instead of the 10 years stipulated in the original debt-conversion contracts. But those who wish to unlock their investments before 10 years will have to pay a penalty. The central bank says it will charge an exit fee based on the length of time the company has been in Chile, and on the bonus the company gained through the purchase of Chilean debt at a discount on the secondary markets. The central bank says the exit fee will put companies who invested through debt swaps, otherwise known as Chapter XIX of the Compendium of Foreign Exchange Regulations, on an equal footing with foreign investors who brought their own capital into Chile. The central bank adopted these more flexible rules due to the difficulties two large foreign investors are having in trying to pull out of Chile. Carter Holt Harvey, the New Zealand forestry group, is seeking a buyer for its Dollars 500m stake in Copec, Chile's largest private industrial group, and Security Pacific, the US bank, has been unable to sell 60 per cent of its Chilean bank. Both companies were among the first to take advantage of the incentives offered by Chile's debt swap programme. Carter Holt bought into Copec in 1987 with a Dollars 161m debt swap. It later expanded its Chilean holdings in forestry, cellulose production and fishing with Dollars 135m of its own resources. It also launched a Dollars 1.2bn investment programme with Chile's Angelini group, the other main shareholder in Copec. Given that the bulk of these investments will begin to bear fruit next year, when Copec's Dollars 600m Arauco II cellulose plant comes on stream, Carter Holt's plans to sell its Chilean assets came as a surprise. The New Zealand group said in February that the sale would ease the company's debt burden following a series of acquisitions in Australia and at home. But under the old Chapter XIX rules, Carter Holt's divestment plans hit a snag: it had signed a pact with Mr Anacleto Angelini in 1987 giving his group the first option to purchase Carter Holt's Copec shares if the New Zealanders ever decided to pull out of Chile. And by selling to a Chilean group, the proceeds would remain tied in Chile until 1997. So Copec joined the growing chorus of corporate critics against the central bank. 'It is grossly unfair to forbid Chileans from taking over these investments,' says Mr Jose Antonio Guzman Dumas, Copec's vice-president. Security Pacific says it is in a different boat. It set up operations in Santiago in 1987, converting Dollars 68m of Chilean debt that it held in its own books. 'The subsidy issue therefore does not arise,' argues Mr Rodrigo Munoz, the general manager at Security Pacific Valores. The US bank, which has closed operations in several European capitals in order to strengthen reserves at home, says it would not be pulling out of Chile completely. It wants to sell 60 per cent of its Chilean assets to the bank's local employees. This has already been approved by Chile's banking regulators. With the new Chapter XIX rules, both Security Pacific and Carter Holt will be able to unlock their investments in Chile, subject to the central bank's exit fee. The new rules effectively spell the end of Chile's debt-conversion programme, which has retired Dollars 3.6bn of debt over the past six years. For the past year, critics have argued that the usefulness of the scheme had run its course and that the central bank was deliberately blocking Chileans from participating in the country's investment bonanza. With Chilean debt now trading at close to 85 per cent of par value in the secondary markets, there is very little to gain from Chapter XIX swaps. They have all but ceased. Direct foreign investment, however, totalled over Dollars 1.4bn last year. The critics argued that with so much money pouring into the country, the central bank could afford to be more flexible in its foreign investment rules. By easing restrictions now, at a time when the country's net international reserves total a record Dollars 5.73bn, the central bank will be averting a sudden swell of capital repatriation in the second half of the decade.</p>

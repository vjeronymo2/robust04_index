			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Chambers to raise voices in Brussels - In a Nutshell Eurochambres, the Brussels-based organisation which represents 1,200 chambers of commerce in 23 European countries, is taking steps to increase its effectiveness. In the past it has been short of funds and has frequently been overshadowed by the Brussels offices of the different national chamber organisations. A new, three-strong management team has been appointed; member chamber organisations have been persuaded to double their subscriptions; and fresh thought has gone into its future role. The catalyst for the changes has been Sir Thomas Macpherson, a 'company doctor,' who became president a year ago. Eurochambres plans to strengthen its policy teams to be able to lobby more effectively at the European Commission. It will also provide a valuable mouthpiece for national chambers which do not have a Brussels office, including the Association of British Chambers of Commerce. Eurochambres, Rue Archimede 5, bte 4, 1040 Bruxelles, Belgium. Tel 010 322 231 0715.</p>

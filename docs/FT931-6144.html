			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / PM backs lobby to promote industry A TORY MP's attempt to re-establish manufacturing as a 'national adventure' won backing yesterday from Mr John Major and the Corporation of London. Sir Francis McWilliams, lord mayor of London, said at the launch of the Manufacturing and Construction Industries' Alliance: 'Industry has not articulated itself well enough, and often the City has not quite understood what industry is about.' In September Sir Francis is to launch a Foundation for Manufacturing and Industry, a charity intended to research the problems of industry. The prime minister sent a message of support to the alliance, launched by Mr Nicholas Winterton, Conservative MP for Macclesfield. Mr Winterton also received backing from the Labour party, trade unions and some other backbench Tories. The results of a Mori survey, released to coincide with the alliance's launch, show that 49 per cent of the students surveyed were very or fairly interested in a career in broadcasting or journalism, 39 per cent in public relations and 38 per cent in teaching. Only 16 per cent were interested in careers in motor manufacturing and only 10 per cent in textiles. Ten points to recovery, Page 19</p>

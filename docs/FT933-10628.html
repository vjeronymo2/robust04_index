			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Jumping through the credit ratings hoop: Derivatives business squeezed Of all the risks involved in derivatives trading, the one that troubles market participants most is credit risk. They are worried about taking on exposure to companies that are financially weaker than themselves, and even more worried that other dealers may not want to trade with them. In the past 10 years, there has been a decline in the financial strength of banks and their credit ratings have dropped accordingly. This decline in credit quality has a greater impact in the Dollars 4,000bn (Pounds 2,700bn) over-the-counter market in swaps and options, where contracts typically last between three and 10 years, than in the foreign exchange market, for example, where exposure to a counterparty is brief. The crunch for banks and securities houses comes when their ratings fall to single-A, as many firms are limited by internal restrictions to dealing with credits rated double-A and above. Banks with less than top credit ratings are being squeezed out of the market because their clients prefer to deal with better credits. The result is that, although the market is expanding rapidly, business is becoming increasingly concentrated among a handful of banks. Mr David Mullins, vice-chairman of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve, estimates that about 90 per cent of business is conducted by just six US banks. As many banks now believe that a strong derivatives operation is vital to international banking business, they have not taken the threat lying down. 'The swaps business is so important to our underwriting business that we would never allow ourselves to be squeezed out of the market,' said one US banker. One remedy is for lower-rated companies to set up separately capitalised subsidiaries with top ratings, through which to channel derivatives business. So far, only two, Merrill Lynch and Salomon Brothers, have taken this route. The setting up of a derivatives unit backed by fully committed capital, with the prerequisite credit rating, restores an institution's access to clients previously unwilling to accept the parent company's credit rating. But if the subsidiary fails to generate fresh business, then the parent will have used up scarce and expensive capital to no avail. Currently, analysts at Moody's, the US credit rating agency, have 18 proposals for separately capitalised derivatives units on their desks, but it is unlikely that all of these will go ahead. Some firms have met with opposition from their parent companies or the regulators, while others are not yet convinced the plan represents the best use of capital. Citibank, which in any case faced opposition from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, one of its US regulators, has abandoned plans for a swaps unit and is concentrating instead on improving the credit rating of the bank (currently rated A2 by Moody's and A by Standard &amp; Poor's). Kidder Peabody, which is unrated, is considering seeking a rating in its own right. Kidder's parent, General Electric of the US, has a triple-A rating. Others - such as Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers - are still looking at setting up separately capitalised units. Some Japanese banks, such as Tokai Bank, are considering following suit. But even those keen to go ahead have some reservations. 'This could be nothing more than a high stakes poker game,' said one US banker. The market is finding other solutions. Many weaker financial institutions have started setting aside a portion of the value of the contract as collateral against swap agreements, imitating the practice in the futures market. This substantially reduces credit exposure for counterparties, but many market participants still find it easier to deal with a triple-A rated counterparty than to bother with collateral. A survey conducted as part of the recent G30 report on derivatives found that two-thirds of dealers were prepared to accept cash or securities as collateral, and more than three-quarters would accept a third-party guarantee. The most radical solution - which would effectively eradicate the issue of credit - is to set up a clearing house through which all over-the-counter derivatives could be settled. However, there are enormous technical difficulties in designing a system that could deal with such diverse instruments. Further, the vested interests of individual firms would not necessarily be served. For example, triple-A rated firms, and those firms that have set up separately capitalised subsidiaries, would lose their competitive advantage. As a result, it may prove difficult to gain sufficient backing for such a concept. Several organisations are researching the creation of derivatives clearing houses, including the Chicago Board of Trade, which already clears its own futures and options contracts. It is still not clear which direction the market will ultimately take. Another crop of new subsidiaries would increase the pressure on lower-rated banks to follow suit. 'We did it because our clients wanted us to,' said Mr Dennis Keagan, co-head of Salomon Brothers in London. But some market participants may not be able to afford to inject large amounts of capital into their businesses, even if they risk finding themselves excluded from the market. 'It is only worthwhile if your rating is bad enough and your business flow is large enough to justify the commitment of capital,' said Mr Nick Burge, head of swaps at Nomura International in London.</p>

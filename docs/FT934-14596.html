			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Paper groups' losses trimmed GEORGIA-PACIFIC and Boise Cascade, two of the largest North American forest products groups, narrowed their third-quarter losses in spite of the continued weakness of the paper and pulp market. Georgia-Pacific, the world's largest manufacturer of paper and wood products, yesterday said it had reduced its third-quarter deficit to Dollars 36m, or 42 cents a share, from Dollars 174m, or Dollars 2.01, in the same period of 1992. Sales were flat at Dollars 3bn. Progress was also made by Boise Cascade. The Idaho-based group posted a loss of Dollars 24.2m, or 91 cents a share, compared with a deficit of Dollars 35.7m, or Dollars 1.13, in the year-earlier quarter. Revenues climbed 7 per cent to Dollars 1bn. The improvement at Georgia-Pacific partly reflected a record performance by the building products business, which lifted operating profits to Dollars 210m, against Dollars 200m. Prices for lumber harvested in southern US states were well above 1992 levels, while the volume of sales was also higher. However, the paper and pulp business, hard hit by an industry-wide slump which began in 1989, showed little sign of rebounding. The segment's operating loss was Dollars 10m, against Dollars 7m last time. The results included an after-tax gain of Dollars 10m on an asset sale and Dollars 53m in charges , bonus payments and early retirement of debt. If these items were excluded, the company would have realised Dollars 7m in net income. Although the overall improvement at Boise Cascade was more modest than Georgia-Pacific's, the Pacific north-west group had more reason to be optimistic about its paper and pulp business. In the paper segment, Boise Cascade made 'good progress in the areas it can control, such as reduced costs and improved product mix,' the company said. The division's operating loss was less than last year's figure, even though weighted-average prices for its products were flat. The company does not issue specific figures for its divisions.</p>

However, there are two deficiencies that current government's  Tax Commission should overcome.    In August 1993, 38 years of monopolistic one-party rule  ended  and the Hosokawa cabinet, which is based on coalition of  parties, was born. Corresponding to this great change in the  political world, the policy determination process was also  changed fundamentally. The debate over reform of the tax system  is no exception. The LDP's Tax Commission, which had exercised  strong decisionmaking authority, backed by the activities of  Diet members connected to the tax issue, has also retreated from  front stage. Taking as its slogan, "correct the direct and  indirect taxe rates," deliberations on reform of the tax system  are vying for center stage. Prime Minister Hosokawa has  entrusted everything to the government's Tax Commission, but I  would like to examine how the discussion should proceed in the  future on this issue of change.    Currently, in our personal lives, interest in reform of the  tax system is greatly rising centered on lowering income tax  rates and on increasing consumption tax rates. Along with  political reform, this issue is an important problem to be faced  by the Hosokawa cabinet. The issue of which body takes what  measures with regard to tax system reform is an extremely  important question with respect to the formation of the  country's economic policy. Examining how other developed  nations are dealing with this problem, I would like to examine  how deliberation on the reform of the tax system should take  place.  <H5>  Japan's Unique Deliberation Method </H5>   Generally, there are two different ways in which tax reform  is carried out; the so-called Japanese method and the Western  method. These two methods are shown in the chart below [not  translated]. In both of these methods, once the need for tax  reform is recognized, the prime minister or president first  submits an inquiry to the appropriate body. Normally, Europe and  the United States do not use this system of submission of  inquiries for policy matters in other areas, such as foreign  relations, national defense, or industrial policy. Why do they  use this inquiry system for only tax reform? Two reasons come to  mind. First, the tax problem is closely tied to the people's  standard of living, and second, it is a problem which requires  professional study. Japan, which has established consultative  bodies to study inquiries for all policy matters, not just tax  reform, is an exception to the rule.    After the submission of an inquiry, there are two routes  that  deliberations on tax system reform can take. The particular  characteristic of the Japanese system is that the prime minister  submits an inquiry to the permanently established consultative  body, in other words, the government's Tax Commission, and once  this body receives an inquiry, the deliberation over tax system  reform begins. Under this system, instead of preparing a  comprehensive tax report which is based on detailed analysis,  the commission issues a report, compiling the views of the  majority of the commission members. The foundation for any  reform of the tax system is based on this report.    In the Western system, however, a task force, which is  generally composed of experts, is assembled. Usually after two  to five years of study and repeated discussions, the task force,  which is led by a well-known researcher, will formulate and  publish a tax report. Contained in this report, along with a  statement of the ideals of and goals for tax system reform as  well as supporting documentation, is a recommendation for  proposed reform. This document becomes the plan for a revision  of the tax system which will represent the country in question.    This is the method that the Western countries use with tax  system reform. The tax report plays a very important role in  this process. In fact, there have been many well-known tax  reports prepared, such as Canada's "Carter Report" (1966),  Sweden's "Rodin [as transliterated] Report" (1976), and the U.S.  "Treasury Department Report" (1984), all of which have been  highly praised by academia. The Reagan tax system reform of the  1980's was another such reform that was carried out in this  manner. It is interesting to note that the "Shoup  Recommendation" (1949), which established Japan's tax system  following the war, was also carried out in this western manner.  This is very easy to understand if one considers the situation  that existed back then.    Therefore, we call the Japanese system the "deliberative  body  system," and the Western system the "tax report system."  Although these tax reports are extremely important documents  because they cast light on the basic nature of tax system  reform, they are mere materials on which to start deliberation  of tax system reform in the national assembly.  <H5>  The Government Tax Commission Versus the LDP Tax Commission </H5>   Currently, in Japan, discussions on the tax system are  carried out by the government's Tax Commission. This Tax  Commission was formally established in 1962 as an advisory body  to the prime minister. Since that time, this commission has been  given the most authority among the numerous other deliberative  bodies. In addition to 30 formal members drawn from various  sectors of society, this commission is comprised of some 10 odd  specialists and about 20 experts (group of scholars).    We can say that, during the nearly 20 years since its  inception, Japan's tax deliberation mechanism, which is centered  on the government's Tax Commission, has functioned well. The  government's Tax Commission proceeds with its discussions by  making adjustments to proposed tax system reform while hearing  the opinions of officials from organizations which would benefit  or be damaged because of changes to that system. For that  reason, the Tax Commission is comprised of representatives from  various industrial groups, labor unions, consumer organizations,  etc. As a result of compromise, unlike the Western tax reports,  the reports proffered by the Tax Commission tend to become  theoretically ambiguous.    However, when one considers the final step in the tax  deliberation process, namely the step from deliberation in the  legislature to execution of reform, Japan's deliberative body  system has performed well, resulting in a clearly higher number  of proposals being implemented than are adopted under the  Western tax report system. This means that, during the process  of preparing their report, the work of making adjustments to the  plan, balancing the advantages and disadvantages of all of the  groups affected, including the various ministries and agencies,  has already been completed. On the other hand, in the Western  system, things can become confused in the legislature, and  often, tax reform proposals have a tendency to become  politically buried without achieving any political results.    However, the Japanese practice of giving high esteem to the  reports from the government's Tax Commission and implementing  their recommendations within the tax system started to change in  the 1980's. Of course this is not unrelated to the rise in  power of the LDP Tax Commission. The situation developed where  the actual power to create change in the tax system was shifted  from the government Tax Commission to the LDP Tax Commission.  Because of the LDP's long run in power, Diet members often  formed connections with industry and became tied to the creation  and/or expansion of special tax measures. One famous example of  these connection is the existence of the "telephone book," a  list of petitions submitted asking for tax reductions.    The specific content of tax system reform, in other words  the  determining of the tax rate and the final numerical value of the  deduction levels, fell under the scope of authority of the LDP's  Tax Commission. The tax system is surely politics itself.  Instead of following a logical course based on taxation theory,  gradually, tax system reform was politicized by the LDP Tax  Commission, and tied to the advantages and disadvantages of  special interest groups. The venue for important tax  deliberations was shifted from the government's Tax Commission  to the LDP's Tax Commission.    The government's Tax Commission's basic philosophy toward  the  tax system was to keep its implementation fair, neutral, and  simple. Subsequently, it generally had the tendency not to  support measures that would give special treatment under the tax  system to special sectors. Therefore, the government's Tax  Commission was often opposed to the expansion or extension of  special tax measures, and therefore, special interest groups  would bypass the government's Tax Commission and would take  their proposed items directly to the LDP's Tax Commission. This  route was used not only by private groups, but was also  actively used by various agencies and ministries that were  trying to use the tax system to attain specific objectives (such  as increasing savings or social welfare). Indeed, in the world  of the tax system, adhesion among "politicians, bureaucrats, and  the private sector" was gradually beginning to develop. Thus,  the hollowing out of the government's Tax Commission had begun.    What promoted this trend was that Japan entered a period of  restricted finance in the 1980's, which was aimed at financial  reconstruction, out of a policy of lowered tax rates during the  high-growth years. The benefits from the expenditures side  disappeared, but there was an upswing in the demands for "hidden  subsidies" (special tax measures) on the taxation side.  Therefore, the LDP's Tax Commission clearly had more  understanding of this process than did the logical government's  Tax Commission. It was an era in which officials seeking sweet  benefits under the tax system turned to the LDP's Tax Commission.    Originally, when the proposal for the coming year's tax  system reform was drawn up at the end of each year, both tax  commissions frequently made public the reports which contained  differing views on specific measures. The government's Tax  Commission would issue a report, and a few days after that, the  LDP's Tax Commission would issue its report with a differing  point of view. Under the system of party politics in Japan, it  is the party in power that pushes bills through the Diet.  Therefore, it was the LDP's Tax Commission proposals that were  adopted. However, in the latter half of the 1980's, a kind of  division of effort was established between the two tax  commissions. The government's Tax Commission would issue reports  proposing changes to the basic foundations of the tax system,  without any detailed information such as tax rates, and the  LDP's Tax Commission would fill out the specifics of the tax  policy based on the government's Tax Commission report. It can  be said that the era of "conflict" was replaced by an era of  "coordination." It was indeed humiliating for the government's  Tax Commission, which is a prime minister's advisory organ, to  be under the policy formulating organ of a single political  party even though the party in question is the party in power.  The consumption tax and land price tax were adopted under this  division of effort.  <H5>  Tax System Deliberations; Where Do We Go From Here? </H5>   As mentioned at the beginning of this text, in the midst of  the political change which is sweeping the nation, the  competitive relationship between the government's Tax Commission  and the LDP's Tax Commission has ended. It would be difficult  for the current coalition government to establish a body such as  the LDP's Tax Commission. Tax Commission like the LDP's Tax  Commission cannot be built overnight because the nucleus of  human resources in that commission is composed of many tax  system experts who were nurtured by the party in power for many  years and Diet members who were former officials of Ministry of  Finance.    Prime Minister Hosokawa has said on many occasions that, "I  want to wait for the deliberation of the government's Tax  Commission," and "I will honor their report" to the letter. The  deliberation on tax system reform has again moved to the  government's Tax Commission. I am hearing from Diet members who  used to belong to the LDP's Tax Commission with whom I am  personally close, that it had become truly distasteful for them  to work for the establishment of special exceptions because of  the prodding of specific industries. Ostensibly, the retreat of  the LDP's Tax Commission was brought about by political  confusion; however, it was perhaps a matter of inevitable  consequences.    The problem is, "Where do we go from here?" In the future,  should Japan maintain its unique "deliberative body system" and  continue to use the government's Tax Commission as the venue for  discussions on this issue? The following two deficiencies exist  in the "deliberative body system."    First, it has been difficult to clearly hammer out a basic  philosophy and vision for reform of the tax system. Furthermore,  it has also been difficult to formulate a specific reform  proposal based on this foundation.    Because the Tax Commission prepares its report while  adjusting advantages and disadvantages to various groups, reform  proposals tend to become a patchwork document that can exist  only within that environment of compromise. It is nealy  impossible for the government's Tax Commission to design a  comprehensive tax system reform proposal that would look across  the entire tax system. In fact, since the inception of the Shoup  tax system, it has been difficult to explain on what basic  posture subsequent reforms to the tax system had been based.    Second, the evil practice of back-room decisionmaking is  inexorably tied to the deliberative body system. Often, not only  is the amount of information provided to the average citizen  insufficient because only the results of the discussions are  included in the published report, but no pipeline exists  through which the public can press their requests for further  information. There are no channels available other than petition  and protest.    In the future, it seems that the deliberations of the Tax  Commission, which will take up issues such as "revision of  direct and indirect tax rates," will become an issue of great  interest to the public. Given these developments, is it enough  to just continue along with the deliberative body system that we  have had under the government's Tax Commission? However, in a  society like ours which differs so much from Western nations in  the area of consensus-building, there would probably be little  effect if we adopted a tax report system like that of the  countries of Europe and the United States. It is also  inconceivable that our politicians would authorize a group of  experts to formulate a tax report because the politicians would  not like it if an authorized tax report were published that  called for reform of the tax system that would be  disadvantageous for the politicians, or that would contain a  reform proposal that would be difficult to implement.    To promote future tax system reform, however, we should  incorporate as many elements of the tax report system as  possible.    Specifically, the final report of the government's Tax  Commission should have the same level of weight and substance as  those reports had in the 1960's. I think that what is wanted are  reports such as those prepared during the term in office of the  first head of the government's Tax Commission, Ichiro Tanaka.  These reports contained the results of the analysis of all of  the extended discussions within the Tax Commission, as well as  all of the data used. This type of document could become the tax  report for our country. In order to do this, it would be  desirable that we increase the number of researchers on the  commission who can view the the tax system as a whole instead of  representing various interest groups as members.    In order to make tax system reform truly a more democratic  issue, we must make the dissemination and gathering of  information more open, and we must pursue it more positively.  One way to do this would be for the Tax Commission to discuss  all of the tax system reform proposals drawn up and published by  the various sectors. One result of this would be that the  proposals raised by various groups could be effectively  utilized. This would also aid in making the discussions on tax  system reform within the Tax Commission more constructive.    Chairman Hiroshi Kato has repeatedly emphasized that he  wants  to open the deliberations of the Tax Commission as much as  possible to the public. We should also consider ways to make  materials submitted to the Tax Commission more readily available  to those who want to utilize them. We should also open "one-day  Tax Commission meetings" throughout the various regions of the  country, and positively adopt ways so that we can directly hear  the views of the taxpayer, the average citizen.</p>

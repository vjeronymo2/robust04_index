			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / International Company News: Asarco benefits from higher metals prices HIGHER base metals prices and expanded copper production helped Asarco, the US integrated mining company, post earnings of Dollars 18.6m, or 45 cents per share, in the third quarter, from Dollars 10.3m, or 25 cents, in the corresponding 1991 quarter. Sales dipped to Dollars 489.6m, compared with Dollars 493.4m in the third quarter of 1991. Third-quarter earnings included a dividend of Dollars 2.1m from Asarco's 52.3 per cent ownership of Southern Peru Copper Corporation. For the first nine months of the year, Asarco reported earnings of Dollars 30.4m, or 74 cents, on sales of Dollars 1.435bn. That compares with Dollars 33.7m, or 82 cents, on sales of Dollars 1.417bm for the 1991 period. Asarco's average realised price for copper rose 9 cents in the third quarter to Dollars 1.13 per pound. Lead prices gained 6 cents to 31 cents per pound, and zinc prices rose 14 cents to 61 cents per pound. The company said it saw declines in its average prices for gold and silver. The company indicated that fourth-quarter results could weaken since prices for copper, lead, zinc, and silver had declined since the end of the third quarter.</p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / The Clinton Inauguration: Reform is vital to health of the economy - Healthcare OF Mr Bill Clinton's dozens of pledges made during last year's campaign, the one that arguably matters most was a promise to reform the healthcare system. His performance here may decide the success or failure of his presidency. Healthcare matters for its own sake. About 33m Americans (more than the population of California) are currently without insurance. At a minimum Mr Clinton must sharply reduce infant mortality rates (at present among the highest in developed countries) and increase the miserably low proportion of inner-city children being immunised against common diseases. But healthcare is more than the most pressing social problem. The extraordinary escalation of costs - what the OECD calls the 'worsening paradox of excess and deprivation' has turned healthcare into one of the US's most intractable economic problems. For three decades, healthcare spending has grown at an annual rate of 6 per cent in real terms, more than doubling its share of gross domestic product to about 14 per cent, far above the international norm of about 8 per cent. The galloping inflation of health costs is putting intolerable strains on state and federal budgets. Federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid, the public sector programmes for the elderly and the poor, is expected to rise by 87 per cent over the next five years to Dollars 392bn (Pounds 258bn), thus accounting for half of the total projected increase in federal outlays. It will be impossible to reduce the Dollars 300bn budget deficit significantly unless health care spending can be brought under control. And if the deficit is not reduced, there is little hope of raising savings and investment rates, which are among the lowest in the industrialised world. Yet in the longer term, the rate of economic growth can be raised only by increasing savings and investment. Mr Clinton's hopes of improving the living standards of the 'forgotten middle class' thus depend on the successful reform of healthcare. There is also a 'micro-economic' link between healthcare and economic performance. Mr Clinton has hinted he may experiment with a European-style 'industrial policy' as a means of improving the US competitiveness. Yet as Mr Henry Poling, chairman of Ford Motor, told him at last month's economic conference in Little Rock, the quickest way to help many businesses would be to lift the crippling burden imposed by their healthcare obligations to employees and pensioners - a burden without parallel in other industrial countries. Ford's healthcare costs have tripled as a percentage of payroll from 6 per cent in 1970 to nearly 20 per cent today. It spends as much on medical care as on steel. The US faces more intractable problems than other countries for two main reasons. In the first place, it relies on employers as the principal (yet voluntary) source of health insurance for the non-elderly population. Since increasing numbers of small and medium-sized companies are unable to afford the cost of insurance premiums, this, in effect, guarantees gaps in healthcare coverage. Four-fifths of uninsured Americans are employed or dependents of employees. The other unique characteristic of US healthcare is the dogged belief that costs can somehow be controlled by normal 'market forces'. In every other advanced country, the government has stepped into the health market, either to set an overall expenditure limit (as in Britain's National Health Service) or to regulate the volume and price of services that doctors and hospitals can charge. In the US such controls are being imposed on Medicare and Medicaid spending, but this accounts for only about 40 per cent of the market. Ms Donna Shalala, the university administrator named as health secretary, has signalled that the incoming administration intends to tackle both of these fundamental problems. She wants to set a national budget for both public and private health care spending. At the same time, gaps in coverage would be plugged by introducing a form of 'managed competition'. Everybody - uninsured individuals as well as members of corporate plans - would be enrolled in regional healthcare purchasing co-operatives which would buy care from competing providers in the private sector. In theory, the co-operatives' market clout will ensure that members receive high-quality care at the lowest possible price. The managed competition route looks promising. But efforts to control costs will succeed only if strict limits are set on the use of expensive new technology and drugs, on the prospective incomes of physicians (which are far higher than in other countries) and on the hugely inefficient private insurance industry. Yet this requires a direct confrontation will some of the nation's most powerful interest groups.</p>

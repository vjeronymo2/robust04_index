			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Travel boss files for bankruptcy MR VALERE TJOLLE, chairman of the Land Travel coach company that collapsed last month, filed for personal bankruptcy yesterday, removing any lingering hope that creditors would be able to recover their money. Grant Thornton, the liquidators, are holding a creditors' meeting at a Bristol hotel today. Customers who made bookings with Land Travel have been advised to stay away as there is no prospect of receiving any payment. Mr Tjolle attributed his bankruptcy to the Land Travel collapse, in which he lost more than Pounds 400,000, and to failed property investments made in 1988 and 1989. The property investments were funded by bank loans made on the strength of shares Mr Tjolle held in the Granada Group. The rise in interest rates and a drop in Granada's share price had made it impossible to repay the loans, Mr Tjolle said. Granada owned Land Travel's holding company, Beau Nash Enterprises, from 1987 to 1990, when it was sold to Mr Tjolle. Mr Robert Buller, the Grant Thornton liquidator, said: 'From our appointment it was clear that liquidators were unlikely to receive any payment from Land Travel. The only real hope for creditors would have been to mount a successful claim against Mr Tjolle. Now that he has filed for personal bankruptcy, this last hope has been removed.' General Accident, underwriters of Land Travel's holiday insurance scheme, said policies did not cover the loss of holidays through liquidation.</p>

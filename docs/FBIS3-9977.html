			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Some 30 U.S. congressmen have expressed their  support for a bill to lift the blockade of Cuba, which will be  discussed next month at the initiative of U.S. Representative  Charles Rangel. In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Rangel's  spokesman, [name indistinct], said that hearings will begin on  17 March in two House of Representatives committees, and  although the bill will not be submitted to a vote, these  hearings will serve to broach the subject.    The document was sent to the capitol in May 1993, bearing  the  title, "Bill for Free Trade With Cuba," and although it did not  receive the support of the entire Congress, it became an  important point of discussion both inside and outside the  Legislative Branch.    In a letter to the U.S. Government, (?Congressman) Rangel  asked why the United States trades with Vietnam, China, and  Russia, yet cannot do so with Cuba.    Rangel's bill -- Rangel is one of the U.S. Legislature's  black leaders -- is supported by another 30 legislators who  argue that it is the population of Cuba that has suffered the  damages caused by the embargo. According to spokesman [name  indistinct], Rangel gets calls from people all over the United  States who wish to show their support for lifting the blockade  against Cuba, people who also inform the government of their  interest in a change of policy toward Havana.    He pointed out that the legislator has also received strong  support from large groups within the Cuban community who live  not only in Miami, but in, among other places, New York, New  Jersey, and Chicago. He said there has been a recent increase in  the number of voices from various parts of the United States who  are calling for the lifting of the embargo against Cuba,  including those who were formerly in favor of the embargo.</p>

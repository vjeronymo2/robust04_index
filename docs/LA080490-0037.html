			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KID BEAT: SONG SET AFFIRMS BLACK CULTURAL TRADITIONS  </P> <P> A bountiful new entry into the increasingly sophisticated children's music  market is "Shake It to the One That You Love the Best, Play Songs and Lullabies  from Black Musical Traditions."  </P> <P> This sleek boxed set with audio cassette and full color songbook, distributed  by Berkeley-based Lancaster Productions, offers a cornucopia of familiar and  unfamiliar children's songs, illustrated by two leading black women artists and  arranged in jazz, reggae, R&amp;B, blues, gospel and classical styles.  </P> <P> Reached at her Northern California home, creator/producer Cheryl Warren Mattox  said the package was designed to "offer an awareness of black music and art  from a child's perspective," and to supply a missing component in the  children's music market: black-oriented product.  </P> <P> "When my son was born, I wanted something for him, part of my tradition,"  Mattox said.  </P> <P> As a musician, and music programmer, producer and host at classical music  station KQED-FM in San Francisco, Mattox planned "a special radio segment on  kids' music from the perspective of black traditions," and then found nothing  available in the stores.  </P> <P> Mattox decided to try to fill the void herself.  </P> <P> She began with songs fondly remembered from her own musical childhood -- her  mother was her first piano teacher and there were 11 children in her family who  "played musical games under the tree in the front yard." She canvassed friends  and researched African, Creole and Caribbean songs.  </P> <P> The vividly illustrated songbook contains the place of origin, historical  context and/or game instructions for each song.  </P> <P> "Some of the songs, such as 'Little Sally Walker' and 'Mary Mack,' are familiar  to many different cultures, (so) some song origins might be questionable,"  Mattox acknowledged. "I included songs known outside the black tradition  because they have become part of the black community -- part of the tradition  that parents pass down to their children."  </P> <P> Mattox said her musical arrangements emphasize the diversity of the black  musical experience. "In 'Little Sally Walker,' for example, I use a jazz  quartet, keyboards, saxophone, piano and percussion. In 'Jump Shamador,' a West  Indies song, I use a reggae beat."  </P> <P> She contrasts her classically based arrangements by using "a voice that has a  more distinctly quote, unquote 'black sound' -- what most people associate with  an R&amp;B sound."  </P> <P> The vocalists are as diverse as the musical styles. Among them, folk/blues  veteran Taj Mahal serves up a funky "Hambone" and velvet-voiced Linda Tillery  sings lullabies, from "All the Pretty Little Horses" to "Ya, Ya, Ya," a lilting  caress from the Congo.  </P> <P> Mattox's appreciation of black art is reflected in the songbook's decorative  borders -- photographs of African textile patterns -- and in the collage and  pastel song illustrations, done by contemporary artists Varnette P. Honeywood  and Brenda Joysmith. Mattox chose the artists, whose works can be seen "The  Cosby Show" "Amen" and "227," "because they portray black family life and  children at play in a way that captures the essence of the black experience."  </P> <P> Mattox stresses that, while it is meant to affirm black culture, "Shake It to  the One that You Love the Best" has no racial barriers. "It is something all  kids can have fun with," she said. "My hope is that it may stimulate an  interest in something bigger -- that it will encourage families to enjoy and  learn about black art and black music."  </P></p>

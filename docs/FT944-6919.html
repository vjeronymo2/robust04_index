			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Budget expected to deliver sharp cuts in spending Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was making the final adjustments yesterday to tomorrow's Budget that is expected to cut government spending plans sharply and make tax and benefit changes to help the long-term unemployed back to work. Although the government is suffering from lack of a 'feel-good factor' among the electorate, Mr Clarke is expected to stick by his judgment, made in September, that tax cuts would be 'hopelessly premature'. An indication that the chancellor will seek to strengthen his budding reputation for prudence in financial markets came yesterday from Mr Jonathan Aitken, the Treasury secretary. In an interview with BBC radio's The World this Weekend, Mr Aitken intimated that Mr Clarke would resist pressure to withdraw next April's planned increase in value added tax on domestic fuel and power to 17.5 per cent from 8 per cent. Although some ministers fear a backbench revolt against the tax plans if the Labour party succeeds in forcing a parliamentary vote on the issue, Mr Aitken pointed out that the Commons had already voted four times for VAT on fuel and power. If the chancellor were to make an announcement, he would be 'doing something very radical indeed', Mr Aitken said. Instead, Mr Clarke will build on Britain's better-than-expected economic performance since his first Budget last November to cut public spending. He may bring forward the date when the government finances may move from deficit to broad balance. The City expects the chancellor will cut the 1995-96 'control total' of departmental expenditures by Pounds 5bn or Pounds 6bn from Pounds 263bn. He may announce bigger cuts of up to Pounds 8bn or Pounds 9bn in overall government spending planned at Pounds 313bn. Although consensus predictions suggest that the government will lower its forecast of the public-sector borrowing requirement to Pounds 25bn in 1995-96 from Pounds 28bn, there is speculation that Mr Clarke will announced a sharper drop. A PSBR closer to Pounds 20bn next year might enable the Treasury to project a budget in 'broad balance' by 1997-98, keeping alive hopes of income tax cuts nearer to the general election that must be fought by the spring of 1997. The Treasury has put heavy pressure on government departments to cut spending this year. Mr Clarke has also long supported changes to the tax and benefits system to help the jobless obtain work. That has encouraged speculation that the Budget will include improved family credit and housing benefit rules and possibly a 'holiday' from National Insurance contributions for employers offering work to the long-term jobless.

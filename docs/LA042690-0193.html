			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO PLANS TO SPLIT UP TELEDYNE, CHIEF SAYS  </P> <P> Teledyne Inc. shareholders Wednesday were promised a "great rebirth" of the  conglomerate in the 1990s, but management again ruled out dismantling the firm  to raise stockholder value.  </P> <P> At the company's annual meeting at the Beverly Hilton, Teledyne Chief Executive  George Roberts used the term "great rebirth" to describe Teledyne's future. But  asked by a shareholder to elaborate, the 71-year-old Roberts said: "I was  merely trying to emphasize that this management team has an opportunity to do a  fine job."  </P> <P> Teledyne stock has been a poor performer in recent years, after soaring for  most of the 1980s. The Los Angeles-based company, a far-flung collection of  businesses assembled by Chairman Henry Singleton, has been hurt by weak  earnings at its defense and electronics subsidiaries.  </P> <P> On Monday, Teledyne spun off its Unitrin insurance subsidiary to shareholders.  The move was viewed by some analysts as a sign that the 73-year-old Singleton  may be ready to break up the company. Many of Teledyne's businesses, in theory  at least, could be sold for hefty sums.  </P> <P> But after the meeting Wednesday, Singleton said that while Teledyne gets offers  for some of its divisions "all the time," he has "no desire to sell a  significant amount of assets."  </P> <P> Singleton said his philosophy of building Teledyne's assets over time is  intact. "The quick buck is for a different citizen," he said. And shareholders  with that attitude "ought to buy something else," not Teledyne, he said.  </P> <P> Singleton also said the company is in no hurry to launch another major stock  buyback program despite the stock's slump. "My feeling is we shouldn't be too  aggressive until we see how things work," he said, referring to Teledyne's  status now without Unitrin.  </P> <P> Teledyne stock fell 62.5 cents to $28 on Wednesday, a 52-week low.  </P> <P> As expected, William Rutledge, 48, was named president of the company and a  director. He had been executive vice president. Roberts remains CEO and was  named vice chairman as well.  </P></p>

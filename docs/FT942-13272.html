			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Scheme for big spenders Baronsmead, the venture capital group, has launched a scheme to let wealthier individuals invest alongside institutional investors in unquoted companies. The pilot scheme aims at investors with at least Pounds 100,000 to invest in companies requiring finance for early-stage development capital, small management buy-outs or buy-ins. They will not be asked to invest in start-funds. Baronsmead believes the scheme is the first to offer private individuals the opportunity to co-invest with institutions. The private investors will decide whether or not to participate in a company on a case-by-case basis. Baronsmead undertakes to offer the private investors deals on the terms negotiated by the institutional investors. But the investors will not know the precise terms of the deal. In order not to fall foul of the Financial Services Act, the private investors will only receive a one-page description of the business, its record and its prospects, rather than a business plan and a copy of any due-diligence carried out. The 'angels', as Baronsmead is calling its private investors, will be passive and will not be able to participate as non-executive directors. Richard Hargreaves, managing director of Baronsmead, says he is looking for investors aware of the risks of investing in unquoted companies. Investors will be need to have a minimum of Pounds 100,000 to put into a number of investments. Once they have invested they will pay a 5 per cent, one-off fee and 20 per cent of any income - whether in the form of dividends or capital gain. Baronsmead, which has funding ties with Barclays Bank, has Pounds 100m under management. Historically, the group has averaged a running yield of 9 per cent gross before any capital gains; it makes on average 70 per cent of its investments in redeemable shares.</p>

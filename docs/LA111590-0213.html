			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS;  </P> <P> ACTION ON TESTING OF PLUMBERS DELAYED  </P> <P> Plans for a controversial ordinance requiring plumbers working in the city to  get special certification were delayed again by the City Council this week to  allow more time for study.  </P> <P> The council refused on Tuesday to take action after opponents charged that the  proposed ordiance was a ploy by the plumbers' union to recruit members.  Supporters of the measure countered that it was merely a way to protect  consumers.  </P> <P> Although the exact terms have not been worked out, the proposal calls for  plumbers working in Cypress to pass a competence test. Currently, only the  contractor is required to be certified.  </P> <P> Because of the amount of work involved, city staff recommended that an outside  organization be hired to do the actual testing. According to a city report,  several organizations exist that handle the administration of the testing for a  fee to the city, which is then passed on to plumbers in the form of a licensing  charge.  </P> <P> The Plumbing Industry Progress and Education Assn., a professional organization  that has loose ties to plumbing unions, was recommended as a possible  organization to administer the tests.  </P> <P> "I don't want a union coming into this city and telling people what the  standards are," said Councilwoman Margaret Arnold, who was the only council  member to take a position on the proposal. "I am strongly opposed to this."  </P> <P> Proponents denied that the proposal was a ruse to increase the membership of  plumbers' unions.  </P> <P> "This is not a union," said Robert Payne, who is a member of several  professional plumbing organizations. "We just want to upgrade the profession."  </P> <P> Payne said that everyone is allowed to take the test and study classes  regardless of union membership.  </P> <P> Councilman John Kanel suggested the ordinance last month as a possible way to  protect homeowners. Several cities in California now require extra testing for  plumbers. LYNDA NATALI  </P></p>

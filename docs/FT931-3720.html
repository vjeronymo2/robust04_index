			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Jobseekers over the hill at 45, says survey of advertisements that is the message from UK employers to jobseekers, according to an analysis of more than 4,000 job advertisements. Almost a third of advertisers specified an age bar, an increase from a quarter four years ago when the independent research group, Industrial Relations Services, last monitored job advertisements. Four out of five employers giving an age preference wanted someone under 45. Even companies describing themselves as 'equal opportunity' employers in job advertisements appeared willing to exclude some candidates on the grounds of age. IRS cites a Nissan Motor (GB) advertisement for a personnel controller and a management development controller where the 'successful candidates will be aged about 25', Pearl Assurance wanted a training manager 'in their early to mid-thirties' and Group Four Total Security was looking for a 'personnel professional aged 25-40'. The Institute of Personnel Management strongly discourages members from imposing age bars. In a guidance note it states: 'It does not make good business sense deliberately to exclude suitably qualified candidates on the basis of age.' Although 1993 is the European Year of Older People, a recent European Commission advertisement spotted by IRS insisted that candidates for the job of administrative assistant should 'have been born after October 9 1956'. The Commission's justification is that it wants to hold on to employees for several years. Age discrimination: no change, Equal Opportunities Review No. 48, March/April 1993.

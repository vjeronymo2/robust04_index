			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / BAe offered GEC talks on defence merger British Aerospace has told GEC that it would be prepared to resume talks on merging the two companies' defence interests, which were abandoned a year ago, if GEC does not attempt to stymie its Pounds 497m bid for VSEL, the shipbuilding company. According to businessmen close to both companies, the offer was made at a secret meeting on Tuesday between Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, and Lord Weinstock, GEC's managing director. It is understood that GEC was unimpressed and there was no agreement between the two companies. 'It's a Mandy Rice-Davies situation,' said a financier close to GEC. 'They would say that, wouldn't they.' He was doubtful that the offer of defence merger talks would have been carried through. The meeting was held at BAe's request, following reports that GEC was considering both a bid for VSEL and for BAe itself. Mr Bob Bauman, BAe's chairman, said yesterday that he had a policy of 'never commenting' on confidential meetings. Last week, BAe made a recommended takeover offer for VSEL. BAe said last night that it remained 'totally committed' to this bid. GEC will decide in the coming week whether to make a cash offer for VSEL. A hostile takeover bid by GEC for BAe, which Lord Weinstock was considering last week, has become extremely remote, after the rise in BAe's share price from 454p a week ago to 478p yesterday. A financier with a close knowledge of the company said: 'GEC has decided not to go for a hostile bid.' GEC will make no statement on the issue, because Takeover Panel rules would prevent it from making a hostile bid for 12 months following any such statement. GEC cannot decide whether to go for VSEL until it has reviewed confidential information on the shipbuilder's finances, which was given to Lazard Brothers, GEC's merchant bank, earlier this week. Lord Weinstock's main ambition is to engineer the merger of GEC's and BAe's defence interests, to create a super-contractor to rival any defence company. 'This is the longest game of corporate cat and mouse that I can remember,' said a financier. If BAe were to buy VSEL, its balance sheet would be strengthened and that might make it more difficult for GEC to prize out BAe's defence interests. On the other hand, GEC is concerned that any bid by it for VSEL could be frustrated by a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, as GEC already owns shipyards. GEC may decide to give BAe a free run and then make a very low bid for the Pounds 2.5bn UK government contract to build the next generation of five Trafalgar class nuclear submarines, which VSEL is hoping to win.

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Black Bob bows out on a sombre note: The swan-song of Sir Robert Scholey, British Steel's retiring chairman, made for gloomy listening Sir Robert Scholey's nickname 'Black Bob' seemed more than usually appropriate yesterday as the chairman of British Steel rose to present the privatised UK steelmaker's results for the last time before retirement. The occasional shaft of deadpan humour is all that Sir Robert will allow to disturb the sombreness of a British Steel press conference. And yesterday, Sir Robert's swan-song before he hands over next month to Sir Alastair Frame, was no exception. The atmosphere was appropriately gloomy. British Steel plunged from a Pounds 254m pre-tax profit in 1990-91 to a pre-tax loss of Pounds 55m in the year ended March 28. British Steel has a mountain to climb if it is again to reach the record profits of Pounds 733m achieved in 1989-90. The share price, at 60 1/2 p, is 64 per cent below its peak and 45 per cent below the price at which it was first traded after privatisation in 1988. The outlook, coming less than a week after British Steel ended steelmaking at its Ravenscraig plant in Scotland, appears just as depressing as the recent past. The steel industry is in the middle of its worst recession in at least 50 years; prices in the European Community have fallen nearly 20 per cent since late 1989; concern is growing about subsidised exports of east European steel to the EC; and a US trade row is simmering. The immediate future is uncertain, and has prompted Sir Robert to cut British Steel's dividend for 1991-92 from 8.75p to 4.5p. Yet the Ravenscraig closure, painful though it is for the 1,200 workers who are losing their jobs, comes just a few days after two lesser-noticed events. Taken together, these suggest a slightly more hopeful future for British Steel. Last Tuesday, British Steel announced that its Llanwern works in South Wales had set a new world record for operating performance in the continuous casting of steel slabs, beating a previous Japanese-held record. The achievement was a milestone in efficiency at Llanwern, and reflects British Steel's continuing drive for improved performance and quality. Two days later, the steel consultancy Meps Europe suggested that east European companies should take British Steel as their model for rationalisation. 'British Steel were successful in doubling the output per man from 1981 to 1991,' said Meps in a report on the prospects for the east European steelmakers. It is a backhanded compliment of which Sir Robert can be proud. The rationalisation carried out in the six years he has been chairman may have made him a monster in the eyes of workers who lost their jobs, but it is fundamental to British Steel's future. In an industry that is rapidly globalising, and where external factors are largely beyond an individual company's control, Sir Robert's approach has been to press ahead with action in those areas that can be tackled at company level. UK employment at British Steel has fallen from 53,900 before Sir Robert's fresh push for rationalisation in the autumn of 1990 to 44,800 at the end of March. It will drop below 42,000 by the end of the current year, a 17 per cent drop in two years. Across the company, man hours per ton have fallen from 6.3 to 4.4 during Sir Robert's tenure. 'We've done our whack,' said Sir Robert yesterday, adding his now traditional pleas for continental European producers to follow suit. It is in this context that yesterday's deal with Avesta of Sweden, to create a strong competitor in the European stainless steel industry, should be seen. 'It is the sort of move that needs to be repeated in Europe to achieve, through restructuring and profitability, the stability that is required,' says Sir Robert. But the essential problem for British Steel is that much of the pace of restructuring in Europe, as with many of the factors affecting steel prices, is out of its hands. When so many of Eur-ope's steel companies are struggling, where will the money come from to finance restructuring?

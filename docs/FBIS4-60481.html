			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi, May 23 (AFP) -- Jyoti Basu, chief  minister of the Indian state of West Bengal, denied on Monday  [24 May] press reports that North Korea had requested food aid  during his recent visit to Pyongyang. Basu, a member of the  politburo of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), said in a  statement that the reports that North Korean officials had asked  him to arrange emergency shipments of rice from India were  "absolutely baseless."    "I had talks with several leaders of (North Korea),  including  the prime minister," said Basu, who visited North Korea from May  7-14. "But no one made such a request to me.    "On the contrary, I was impressed by their economic  development, construction work and their confidence to meet any  situation," he said. "The news item is obviously intended to  show (North Korea) in a bad light."    Basu, who heads India's sole communist state government, has  been in power in West Bengal for 17 years.</p>

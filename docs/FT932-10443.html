			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: C&amp;J Clark/Berisford With the showdown in Shepton Mallett resolved in favour of Clark's continuing independence, the venerable family shoe business will not, after all, be dragged kicking and screaming into the modern corporate world. The decision is a boot in the ribs to Clark's managers and must bruise their motivation. Sadly, shareholders' hopes for a harmonious future look optimistic given Clark's unhappy history. It will be an extraordinary achievement if Clark can rejuvenate itself sufficiently to stage a flotation within five years. As for Berisford International, the failure of its bid proposal must come as a bitter blow - especially given that Clark's management had sought the offer in the first place. But it scarcely ranks as a calamity. The company has four other UK manufacturing businesses in the frame and hopes to firm up one of these deals. Berisford's institutional shareholders, who were supportive of the Clark proposal, will at least make allowance for the extraordinary circumstances surrounding its collapse. Sentiment may knock Berisford's shares when trading resumes on Monday, but it would be churlish to hit them too hard.</p>

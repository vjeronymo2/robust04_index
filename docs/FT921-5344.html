			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Arts: A Hard Heart - Almeida Theatre Howard Barker's new play is very well acted, has the odd touch of Barker's direct use of language, but is otherwise totally, relentlessly, almost rivetingly boring - not a word I normally use of the theatre. It is tempting to say that A Hard Heart is about Mrs Thatcher out of office, though a programme note is even more pretentious. Here is a walled European city under siege - it could, the note suggests, be the Peloponnesian War. A woman architect, mysteriously called Riddler, is called in to save the city and its queen. Even more mysteriously, the woman has a son called Attila - the product, she says, of a 'single night of love'. Attila is a bit of a mummy's boy, not at all what the name suggests, and constantly responds to his mother's desire to kiss her. Riddler, played by Anna Massey, thinks that she is a genius, even a god, and can do no wrong. However, she does not succeed in her plans to protect the city and the queen commits suicide. 'I never failed,' says Riddler towards the end, which is where the analogy with Mrs Thatcher comes in, 'I was ever perfect.' She admits to loving the crisis and could not bear to be around during a period of peace and reconstruction. It is far from clear by this time what has happened to Attila. Riddler seems set to go off with a man she has described a 'bald idiot', who has declared his love for her with lines like 'My fingers want to run amok in all your garments', and has cut off a bit of her skirt which he wears first as a cod-piece and then on his head. You might think that, in a plot like that, there must be some redeeming sense of humour. Not a bit of it. So far as one can tell it is intended to be desperately serious - all 100 minutes of it, played without an interval. Ms Massey is a very fine actress. I also like the way Angela Down plays the queen, and it is true that Barker has written some interesting works in the past. Yet you must wonder what can be conceivably going through the Massey/Down heads while appearing in a piece like this. Surely they cannot believe in it, though I suppose that the director, Ian McDiarmid, must do. A Hard Heart was commissioned by BBC Radio 3 and first broadcast last month. I made the mistake of listening to a tape of the broadcast version, also starring Ms Massey - though the rest of the cast is different - before going to the theatre. Twice in one day is close to torture. The play does not improve by being on stage; if anything, it seems even more pointless and is not enhanced by the endless up and down movements of a scale map of the walled city. Anyone who disbelieves me should listen to Radio 3 on April 21 when it will be rebroadcast. It would be going too far to go to the Almeida to see it.</p>

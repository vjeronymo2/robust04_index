			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Jammu, Feb 11--Top Kashmiri secessionist leader  Shabir Ahmed Shah has warned that India and Pakistan could meet  the same fate which befell the Soviet Union if they do not seek  a negotiated settlement to the 46-year-old Kashmir imbroglio in  harmony with the people of Kashmir.    "Soviet Union was a superpower and India and Pakistan are  just developing countries--no match for erstwhile Soviet Union  even as India mistakenly claims to be a superpower," he told  newspersons after he came out of a special court in Jammu trying  cases under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention)  Act (Tada).    The Kashmiri leader, recognised as a prisoner of conscience  who had spent a total of 21 years in jail, recalled telling  India: "We have not (sic) enemity with Indians but we are  opposed (sic) usurption of Kashmir by Indian Government."    Shah, who heads the powerful Peoples League Party of  Kashmir,  said the present armed movement would continue until India  "honestly" came forward for talks with the Kashmiris and  Pakistan to solve the dispute in accordance with the wishes of  the Kashmiris. "We are even prepared for talks and invite all  parties to the dispute namely Kashmirs, India and Pakistan  besides international observers and some friendly countries (to)  settle the problem."    Earlier, at the first hearing of the Tada case field against  him by the State Government, Shah, in a statement presented to  the court, denied the charge made when he was arrested in 1989  that he was going to Pakistan, and that Pakistani currency notes  had been recovered from him.    He said he wanted the implementation of a UN resolution on  Kashmir, which he said Hari Singh, the former Kashmir Maharaja,  and Nehru, too, had accepted.    Asked whether he stood by two options of India and Pakistan  declared in the UN resolution, he said ultimately the people of  Kashmir had to decide, and if they wanted "independence nobody  can prevent them."    Shah spoke of the destruction caused in Kashmir in the past  four years and said: "Hundreds of people were killed and  hundreds of women were molested as hundreds of human settlements  were destroyed." "Thousands of people had been arrested and many  of them (were) subjected to torture at interrogation centres."    Shah said the accession to India was "illegitimate and  unlawful," arguing: "If saying so is a crime (I am) prepared  (to) confess my guilt."    Outside the court, Shah's 75-year-old mother told  newspersons  that she was proud of her son. "He is a great  mujhahid (freedom fighter) and even if he is hanged  (I) will have no regrets because he has been fighting for the  cause for last 21 years."    Meanwhile, an official spokesman said four militants,  including a self-styled company commander of the pro-Pakistan  Hizbul-Mujahidin, were killed in two separate encounters with  security forces during search operations in Baramulla district  last evening. A militant was apprehended and four AK 47 rifles,  five magazines and 30 rounds were recovered during the searches.    The spokesman said security forces averted a major disaster  when they detected and defused three powerful improvised  explosive devices (IED) and an anti-personnel mine at Anantnag  last night. Some unidentified gunmen shot at and seriously  wounded a person at Alichabag in the district.    The spokesman said security forces apprehended six militants  during search operations and recovered a large quantity of arms  and ammunition in the Valley during the past 24 hours.    Pakistan-trained militants fired four rockets fitted with  mines in the Manjakote area of Rajouri district last evening.  Two rockets exploded at a deserted place without causing any  damage, while two others did not explode and were recovered by  security forces during searches, official sources said.    The said earlier militants and Pakistani troops had fired  several rockets fitted with time bombs in Poonch and Rajouri  districts during last month. This is the first time the rockets  were fitted with mines.  *</p>

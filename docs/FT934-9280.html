			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Book Review: Left behind in Latin America UTOPIA UNARMED: THE LATIN AMERICAN LEFT AFTER THE COLD WAR By Jorge G. Castaneda Knopf Dollars 27.50 For 30 years until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the left in Latin America was transfixed by Fidel Castro's Cuban revolution. Now the Soviet regime that subsidised him is history and Castro looks like an old Latin caudillo clinging desperately to power. Since the end of the cold war it has been the rightwing advocates of market-oriented reforms, and not the left, that have been offering change in Latin America. Governments across the region have been squeezing the size of the state, deregulating and opening up protected markets to foreign competition. For many on the left, these policies have failed to stimulate sustainable growth. Worse, they have widened divisions between rich and poor. But what is the left's alternative? This is the question the leftwing Mexican academic, Jorge Castaneda, addresses in Utopia Unarmed. He says revolution - except for extreme groups such as Peru's Shining Path - is no longer on the left's agenda. Indeed, in contrast with its past equivocation, the left as envisaged by Castaneda views representative democracy and human rights as priorities. Democracy requires more than elections, however. What is needed is reform of existing democratic institutions, including increasing accountability, and a fair judicial system. The left in the 1990s must continue to be nationalistic, he says, in part because the process of nation-building is incomplete. But its nationalism must take a new shape. The left should recognise that developments in the global economy constrain this nationalism. It should reject foreign interference in domestic issues, such as narcotics policy. However, the left should embrace the notion that international influence on other issues - human rights, the environment, fair elections - can enhance nationalist objectives. The left should build alliances with groups in the west - to seek, for example, to influence US policy on specific issues. Castaneda and others of the Mexican left have already begun the process, co-operating with labour groups in the US to oppose the North American Free Trade Agreement between Mexico, the US and Canada. Within the nation, governments should decentralise power to regions. Outside, they should seek regional economic integration, but only among equals. This rules out Nafta, but includes accords among developing countries. In the Castaneda vision, state ownership is no longer an end in itself, but he still advocates a central role for the state in the economy. He accepts market capitalism - but not the Anglo-Saxon variety. Instead, he looks to continental Europe and its system of social welfare, and to the Far East for its model of industrial policy and export-led growth. Castaneda, however, fails to resolve some crucial problems for the left. How much of the free-market agenda would left-leaning governments have to adopt not to scare off investment? Though he calls this a false dilemma, he agrees that 'the business community in most of Latin America has a choice today . . . when faced with the unpleasant prospect of a reformist government - pack up and go elsewhere'. Castaneda fails to pursue some of the more interesting ideas from the right that could have an impact on poverty. For example, giving people in Latin America's slums legal title to their homes - currently owned by nobody - could alleviate the plight of the urban poor. His vision may ultimately be unworkable. But if the left does shape up in the way Castaneda suggests, it would end up embracing many of the social democratic traditions of west Europe. That can only be good news for Latin America's still shaky democracies.</p>

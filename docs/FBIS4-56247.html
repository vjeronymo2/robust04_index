			<p>BFN     [Text] The street clashes that took place yesterday have  ended and there will be no demonstrations in La Paz today.  Moreover, the hunger strike sponsored by the COB [Bolivian Labor  Federation] is beginning to lose strength.    Health workers reached an agreement with the government  yesterday for a 12 percent salary increase for this sector.  Thus, their hunger strike has ended. Approximately 600 people  throughout the country returned home happy after several days on  a voluntary hunger strike. This will cause difficulties for the  COB in view of the possibility that other sectors follow suit,  thus weakening the united struggle. Right now the COB is holding  a nationwide meeting to assess the situation.    [Begin unidentified COB representative recording] The  nationwide meeting will assess the current state of events and  decide what course the conflict will follow in view of the  prospects of a solution. I want to point out that during last  night's meeting, the COB reiterated its willingness to  negotiate. We are aware that this conflict must be solved for  the country's sake. The solution is in the government's hands.  [end recording]    It is quite likely that during today's meeting, the COB  might  decide to suspend street demonstrations as a sign of its  willingness to negotiate.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] President Alberto Fujimori said the United States  has no moral authority to criticize Peruvian judicial  legislation because injustice is also committed in that country.    Regarding the report released by the commission headed by  well-known jurist Robert Goldman, President Fujimori said the  commission's criticisms do not match the real Peruvian situation.    Fujimori said: "Injustice also is committed against ethnic  minorities in the United States; therefore, that country has no  moral authority to criticize us."    Fujimori added that the Peruvian Government's position  regarding the Goldman report is established in the letter signed  by Justice Minister Fernando Vega Santa Gadea, which considers  the criticisms of the Peruvian judicial system unfounded.    According to the Goldman report, the Peruvian judicial  system  is not independent and many innocent people remain in prison due  to the excesses of the antiterrorist legislation approved by the  government.    Fujimori also said on 6 April that the antiterrorist  legislation already has been changed four times and no more  changes will be made.    He noted: "The antiterrorist legislation was necessary in  the  struggle against terrorism. It is logical to make mistakes when  enforcing the law."    "What I am convinced of is that we should not allow violence  to take over the country," said Fujimori in ratifying his  support for the antisubversive regulations.    He admitted there are cases in which innocent people are  accused but he said this does not mean they are the majority of  those accused or arrested for terrorism.    Fujimori also expressed satisfaction with the release of  eight reporters accused of praising terrorism and he regretted  they had to remain in prison.    He blamed the judicial branch for this problem, and  indicated  that the branch is still slow in clearing charges against  innocent people.    In an effort to defend himself from criticism, Fujimori said  there is a clear intention to do justice, which was shown with  the reporters' release.    "This shows that freedom of expression is respected here,"  said Fujimori to the reporters who asked him about this issue.    Asked how many innocent people are still in prison, Fujimori  said he did not want to talk about percentage but that there are  not too many.    He added: "But there are flagrant cases that should be  corrected."    Fujimori indicated, however, that the fact that the accused  are doctors or reporters does not give them impunity if they are  linked to subversive activities.    He added: "There are cases in which some doctors appear  committed in Shining Path military operations or in support of  the People's Aid of Peru." [passage omitted]</p>

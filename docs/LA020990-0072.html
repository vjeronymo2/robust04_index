			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE BEAT: AN AMUSING TAKE ON FLAG BURNING BY THE ZETA COLLECTIVE  </P> <P> What is it now? Burn a flag, go to jail? To some, that sounds reasonable. To  others, that sounds like latent totalitarianism. It's also a little bit funny,  as most things are when you think about them long enough. Mime artist William  Fisher has thought about flag burning, and the result is an amusing piece,  "Ready? Begin!," the better half of the Zeta Collective's "Half Life Bis" at  the Zeta Theatre.  </P> <P> Fisher's man is a lonely figure buffeted by the winds of patriotism and gusts  of blowhard rhetoric projected through the boom box of mass media. (Bush and  Reagan are heard on the sometimes muddy sound track, and so is a  gentle-sounding German voice -- Hitler's "Mein Kampf.") He is twisted, pulled,  tugged and cajoled, and it's no surprise that he gives in to join the army.  Besides being a fine display of corporeal mime influenced by Etienne Decroux  and made doubly fine by Ellen Schimmel's music, "Ready? Begin!" tells a story  with a comic accent and ends on a funny, chilling image.  </P> <P> The startling aspect of the second piece, "Crowd Work" by Paul Jones, is seeing  performer Fanny de Sousa appear as Jones' proper City of London man. It works  because this corporate soldier is having a major problem with enlarging breasts  -- tumescences, as he calls them. An apt term, because he's a clinical fellow  who gives an account of his problems as if they were someone else's.  </P> <P> But once the shock wears off, the piece itself becomes clinical (director  Fisher pushes this approach by placing a transparent scrim between us and De  Sousa). Jones' writing never gets below the fascinating surface, and De Sousa's  success with the role is strictly technical -- the male behavior tics, for  instance, are dead on. This is an anatomy of a body, not a person.  </P> <P>  At 929 East 2nd St., on Saturdays, 8:30 p.m., through Feb. 24. Tickets: $10;  (213) 617-8259.  </P> <P> Scattershot 'Riding Club' at West Coast Ensemble  </P> <P> Plays that try to please everyone usually end up pleasing no one. In Avner  Garbi's production at West Coast Ensemble, Kerry Kennedy's "The Riding Club"  wants to be, simultaneously, a light sitcom, a New Age meta-tale, a Southern  comedy of manners and a feel-good morality story.  </P> <P> This isn't the route to dramatic success, unless you have a first-class  imagination. Kennedy doesn't show it here, and her attempts at crowd-pleasing  cancel out each other, all at the service of a pat moral: Life is here to be  lived, so live it. She prods and manipulates her five female characters --  chummy in school, now atomized in their '30s -- so they fit the message. The  puppet strings show.  </P> <P> The terminally ill Addy (Cynthia Steele), for example, is too blatantly the  symbol of human sacrifice as she leaves the hospital for a more spiritual  death. Her pal Christmas (Jeanine Jackson) is too obviously the voice of  flawed, likable Everywoman. Mary Louise (Nancy Boykin) is too stolidly the  Bourgeois Wife -- even her human slips feel manipulated. Jan Sheldrick's Bobby  Joe and Lisa Denke's Patty Lynn are too clearly puppets in Kennedy's hands.  </P> <P> The actresses can't escape this aura of manipulation, though they're all good  at playing types. Types, though, are for TV; Kennedy is a young playwright, and  she needs to let her characters dictate their own terms.  </P> <P>  At 6240 Hollywood Blvd., Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m.;  until Feb. 25. Tickets: $12.50; (213) 871-1052.  </P> <P> Afro-American Musical at Inglewood Civic  </P> <P> Poet Robert Bly has talked about the need for boys and men to develop relations  with male mentors. The lack of them in African-American communities, for  example, is a cause for the gang culture. Writer-director Cepheus Jaxon has  this in mind with his musical history, "The African American," at Inglewood  Civic Theatre.  </P> <P> An elderly man on the bus bench whips some young punks into shape by telling  them the story of how African people, forced into slavery across the ocean,  have been fighting their way to freedom ever since. It's a hackneyed narrative  conceit on which to hang two acts worth of musical numbers. Some hang better  than others.  </P> <P> The African sections (especially the artful slave ship sequence), along with  those in the city and during the Roaring '20s, crackle and buzz because of  Jaxon's hugely energetic ensemble. In the singing and dancing departments,  involvement rules over precision: The heat is on, while the pacing is cold.  "The African American" is best as an entertaining history lesson for the young,  so the chapters not in the show -- Marcus Garvey's pan-Africanism, civil rights  battles in the '50s and Malcolm X, for example -- are glaring by their absence.  </P> <P>  At 151 Grevillea, Inglewood, Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m.;  indefinitely. Tickets: $20; (213) 671-1123.  </P> <P> Send-Up of Male Paranoia at L.A. Art Theatre  </P> <P> On the surface, Carl Miller's "The Feminists" looks like a speculative fiction  playing off of every male sexist's nightmare: Feminist militants take over the  country, ban recreational sex and force men into slavery or prison.  </P> <P> The whole business, though, amounts to nothing more than a hopped-up, R-rated,  ultra-tongue-in-cheek send-up in the tradition of "Saturday Night Live." You  see, the narrator (a mock-stentorian Marcus Smythe) confesses to being the  "author": We're to view "The Feminists" as the fantasy of a paranoid male mind.  </P> <P> It's all fairly mindless, in fact. In Charles Randolph Wright's cast at Los  Angeles Art Theatre, only Paul Satterfield's suitably blank super-hero and  Eileen T'Kaye's cackling henchwoman have the nerve to play their roles to the  needed extreme. Junk-food theater like this should work at least as a guilty  pleasure. The only pleasing thing about "The Feminists" is that it's over in an  hour.  </P> <P>  At 11305 Magnolia Blvd., North Hollywood, Thursdays through Saturdays, 8:30  p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m.; indefinitely. Tickets: $9.99; (818) 763-3101.  </P> <P> Word-Tripping at Alliance's 'Jump Camp'  </P> <P> Larry Blamire's "Jump Camp" exudes promise, from the setting -- a desert ghost  town where an author and her agent are searching out a reclusive intellectual  -- to character names indebted to Thomas Pynchon: Royd Vaugus, Axel Ten Eyck,  Bathsheba Mae Dorn, Finney Stickes.  </P> <P> At the Alliance Theatre under Dean Coleman's direction, though, the bad signs  come early and often: The banter between Peter Fox's agent and Petrea  Burchard's author is deep in sitcom land, and the couple's subsequent encounter  with the town's citizens becomes Blamire's indulgent exercise in linguistic  doodling.  </P> <P> His plot turns (which we won't reveal) posit a reason for the dialogue spew,  which nevertheless doesn't excuse it. "Jump Camp" devolves into an  extraordinary imposition on the listener, since its pointless narrative  contortions and word-tripping become a choke-hold on both our imagination and  the cast's ability to enliven the absurdist goings-on. Choked, too, is  Blamire's point -- that brilliant minds, left unchecked, can cause havoc. A  good point for word-loving playwrights to keep in mind.  </P> <P>  At 3204 Magnolia Blvd., Burbank, Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., until  March 11. Tickets: $12; (818) 566-7935.  </P> <P> A Strange 'Bird' at the Coronet  </P> <P> The Coronet Theatre used to house distinguished plays. Now it houses something  billed as a "theatography" titled "Bird of Passage." Never mind that it doesn't  fly. We're talking crash and burn.  </P> <P> Let's see if we have this right. Manju (Tom Ashworth) is the inventor of an  "organic computer" named Interim. On the other hand, Manju denies that he's a  scientist. He applies for a development grant to "The Council," a black-clad  quintet of rulers (what they rule is unclear). They turn him down, his wife  leaves him for Manju's buddy, and then the Council gets nasty.  </P> <P> Imagine a high school show mixing video, science fiction and ballet, on a  budget, and you might get the idea. Interim is depicted in  director-choreographer Zina Bethune's staging as four little ballerinas,  dressed in leotards with glowing lights.  </P> <P> Playing time is largely consumed with one derivative pas de deux after another.  It's a painfully saving grace, since the cast can't muster one convincing line  delivery. On the other hand, co-authors Linda Pace and Bethune can't muster a  convincing line. The council chants, "Itemize! Categorize! Specify!" Manju  visits his buddy and says, "I came to see you, 'cause I came to see you."  Manju's wife tells him, "Interim may be the future, but I need you now."  </P> <P> We don't need this.  </P> <P>  At 366 N. La Cienega Blvd., tonight and Saturday, 8 p.m.; Sunday, 3:30 and  7:30 p.m. Tickets: $18; (213) 659-2400.  </P> <P> </P></p>

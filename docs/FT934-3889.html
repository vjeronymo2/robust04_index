			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Observer: Sleep tight The British Association of Hotel Accountants has spent two years drawing up new guidelines for surveyors who have to value hotels - it is to be hoped - accurately. But will it do any good? The BAHA committee which drew up the guidelines includes a director of Queens Moat Houses, the heavily indebted hotel chain that commissioned two valuations last year from two different firms which came in nearly Pounds 500m apart. Who else sat on or advised the committee? Representatives from both those firms: Jones Lang Wootton and Weatherall Green &amp; Smith.</p>

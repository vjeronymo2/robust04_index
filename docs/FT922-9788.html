			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / UK Company News: An institution central to Hong Kong's existence - The colony's reaction to HSBC's bid for Midland Bank / The Battle for Midland HONGKONG and Shanghai Bank bestrides the colony in a way few institutions of its type or size could hope to in other parts of the world. It is simply the single most important financial institution in Hong Kong. But Hongkong Bank's bid for Midland has divided the colony of which the bank is uncrowned king. Many of its investors do not like the offer and shudder at the thought of a higher bid; possible confrontation with China also looms if the bank is forced to offer more than the one share plus a Pounds 1 bond for each Midland share it has already offered. Hong Kong without Hongkong Bank is unthinkable; the Hongkong Bank without Hong Kong is even more so. Last year, the bank earned 86 per cent, or Pounds 761m, of its pre-tax profits in Hong Kong; the colony accounts for 45 per cent of its assets. The bank's chairman, Mr William Purves, sits on the governor's executive council, the highest policy-making body in the colony. Moreover, Mr Purves is chairman of the Jockey Club - the focal point for the local Chinese passion for gambling and the expatriate desire for social position. Hongkong Bank is also the centre of the banking system in Hong Kong. As an agent of government it issues banknotes and it also operates the clearing system. It is the government's chief banker and its position within the Hong Kong Bankers' Association - the group that sets interest rates and qualifies new-entrant banks - is pre-eminent. But the bank is the ultimate power broker where it counts most: the ownership of assets in Hong Kong. It delivered Hutchison Whampoa, Hong Kong's first registered company (1866) and oldest 'hong', to Mr Li Ka Shing in 1979; it bailed out the colony's shipping magnates during the world shipping crisis of the mid-1980s; and it is the institution which has done most to support local businessmen such as Mr Gordon Wu, the principle shareholder of Hopewell Holdings, the large developer and builder. Hongkong Bank is a quintessentially management institution. Mr Purves is all-powerful; he dominates the bank's board and senior management. His temper is legendary and few risk challenging him, but he displays an unusual common touch which inspires respect. Last Tuesday, the day Lloyds said it would bid for Midland, and in between meetings that went well into the night, he spent 20 minutes with an executive who was being posted to the Middle East. In Mr Purves, 61, the bank has a man of extraordinary energy and purpose. He and his deputy Mr John Grey are highly rated in Hong Kong for their business acumen. But critics do question whether the bank has the depth in management to pull off the Midland merger. The bank prides itself on running a 'lean' operation; its critics say management is thinly spread. The bank is used to being powerful and it is unaccustomed to having its views questioned. Locally, its conduct during the bid for Midland has been criticised for being lacklustre and complacent. The appointment of former Tory minister, Mr Francis Maude, and a public relations guru, Mr Steven Sherbourne, was welcomed by its supporters in the colony but seen as coming a little late in the day. Given the bank's position in Hong Kong it is not surprising that although many investors in the colony are deeply disappointed with its bid for Midland, none will speak out against it. Unlike London, where investor dissatisfaction with the bid has been aired publicly, no investor who says privately that he will vote his stock against the bid is willing to declare himself publicly. As one long-time head of a large securities and fund management house noted: 'No-one in this town wants to make a permanent enemy of the Hongkong Bank. Hong Kong is a financial village and sooner or later you are going to bump up against the bank.' An FT straw poll of leading fund managers found that about two thirds thought the bank was making a mistake by buying Midland. These investors criticise it for embracing the 'flawed' idea of global banking when the 1980s showed that that strategy failed; and, they also criticise it for diluting high growth north Asia earnings with low growth European earnings. The remaining investors were positive. They see the deal as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make a cheap entry into European banking. Midland is at the bottom of its earnings cycle and due for a big recovery. They believe the bank is also acting in the prudent interests of its shareholders by diluting the 'China' risk inherent in its current business, thereby safeguarding shareholders' future interests. But the bank's restrictions on investors being able to own only 1 per cent of its equity - something which will change if its bid for Midland succeeds  -means that many investors feel impotent in the face of what its management wants to do. Therefore many investors have simply voted with their feet. The bank's share price fell sharply when it announced its bid for Midland and has remained below it's pre-bid high of HKDollars 45.50. On the announcement of its bid terms Hongkong Bank's share price fell to below HKDollars 38. Subsequently it has risen to about HKDollars 42, but mainly, investors say, because the entry of Lloyds into the bidding from Midland has raised shareholders' hopes that Hongkong Bank might fail. By contrast, Hang Seng Bank, its listed subsidiary, has risen sharply since its true financial position was revealed at the same time Hongkong Bank announced the details of its Midland offer. Hang Seng's share price has doubled since the beginning of March - to about HKDollars 44 - as investors have switched to it from Hongkong Bank. All investors were, however, concerned about the possibility that Hongkong Bank might engage in a bidding war with Lloyds. They forecast widespread dissatisfaction with such a move. China could also be a problem, they said. 'If the bank raises its bid for Midland, China will not like it,' says one institutional investor. 'It may speak out against it and it might even encourage people to vote against it.' The importance of China to Hongkong Bank is underlined by the bank's reticence in talking about its dealings with Beijing. It takes pains to keep China abreast of what it is doing. It even tipped off Beijing to the possibility of a bid for Midland before Mr Purves made his presentation to the Midland board on March 13. Mr Purves usually travels to Beijing three or four times a year, each time touching base with the People's Bank, China's central bank, and senior officials of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council - the arm of the Chinese government most centrally involved with the transition of the colony to China's rule. To date China has been neutral-to-positive on the bid for Midland. But it has urged the bank not to pay more for the British clearer and to safeguard the interests of its Hong Kong shareholders and customers.</p>

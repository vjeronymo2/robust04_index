			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> STUDY OF MISUNDERSTOOD WRITER  </P> <P> Reading Weldon Kees' "Fall Quarter," and particularly the 49-page introduction  by James Reidel, I had a very strong reaction. And not a good one. Weldon Kees,  referred to here as "legendary," was a sometime poet and painter and critic and  musician. In 1955, at the age of 37, he parked his car by the Golden Gate  Bridge and either killed himself or changed his identity.  </P> <P> Before the end of this life, Kees had written a number of novels he could never  get published. This one, "Fall Quarter," a satirical novel about a young  assistant professor teaching remedial English at an obscure Midwestern college,  was read by an editor at Alfred A. Knopf two days after Pearl Harbor. Knopf  decided to pass on the book. Now, 50 years later, it's in print.  </P> <P> Here, according to James Reidel, is what Weldon Kees did when the manuscript  was rejected and his agent, Mavis McIntosh, told him to put the book away. Kees  wrote a friend: "Are these people completely humorless and dense, or is the  book really bad?" The friend, an Army lieutenant named Getty, had already said  he liked the book: "I read the whole novel through at one sitting. Under  pleasant conditions too: got up from a nap about 4, showered, got out the  manuscript, and settled down by a west window, with a good view of peacefully  autumnal mountains at my side. . . ." Are you paying attention, gentle reader?  Lt. Getty hasn't actually said one word about the novel. He's talking about his  shower in the mountains! Also, he's a lieutenant in the Army. He's not in the  publishing business.  </P> <P> "Fall Quarter" ought to be required reading in every creative writing program  in the land. As an exercise in humility, James Reidel's introduction ought to  be memorized and recited aloud by every writer who starts playing the  Misunderstood Genius game. Here's another favorite passage of mine from the  introduction: "Kees planned to write novels. Yet not having sold a manuscript  meant supporting himself in some way that would give him existential elbow room  to be a writer. . . . Kees found this in his marriage to his small-town  girlfriend, Ann Swan, whom he had known since senior year at the University of  Nebraska." So . . . Ann worked, and Kees wrote these novels. And complained a  lot.  </P> <P> Reidel thinks that Kees didn't have a "grasping side." To prove this, he quotes  Truman Capote, querying Kees: "Why don't you want to be a success? I can tell  from the way you act that you don't want to be a success."  </P> <P> Let me suggest an alternative interpretation here. People whose work is iffy  play the Misunderstood Genius game hard.  </P> <P> "Fall Quarter" is a madly derivative work: The tone and events come from  Nathanael West, the Graham Brothers, with a tad of Evelyn Waugh thrown in. But  West in particular seems at times to be almost paraphrased. This novel concerns  a young man named William Clay who journeys to an obscure college in the Middle  West to teach English. (We never see him in class, though scholarship is  mercilessly derided.) William falls in love with a woman who treats him badly.  He meets many a disgusting person who says many a stupid thing. He goes to a  brothel but doesn't have sex, and to a succession of parties where he meets  ever more disgusting people, drinks too much, gets mugged by a piano player,  sees married people who hate each other, drinks too much, gets more depressed,  and then gets more depressed.  </P> <P> You can't blame World War II for this book not getting published. You can blame  the fact that Nathanael West had been working for quite a while, and so had  Carroll and Garrett Graham, and so had Mr. Waugh. You can also blame Mr. Kees  for not revising his novel, and taking a good look at his plot, and for keeping  his college sweetheart hard at work supporting a writer who couldn't/wouldn't  publish. I now offer words of wisdom for writers everywhere: When they say  you're "distinguished," that means you're not paid very much. When they say  you're "legendary," that probably means you're a bum.  </P> <P> Next: Bettyann Kevles reviews "Asleep in the Fast Lane: The Impact of Sleep on  Work" by Lydia Dotto (William Morrow &amp; Co.).  </P></p>

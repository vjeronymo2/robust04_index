			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Hu Guohua (5170 0948 5478)] </F>   [Text] Guangzhou, 30 Mar (XINHUA) -- During his recent  inspection of agricultural work in eastern Guangdong Province,  Xie Fei, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau  and secretary of the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee,  stressed on several occasions that, to basically achieve its  modernization goals by the year 2010, Guangdong must ensure good  agricultural work -- a basic industry of the province -- and, to  do this, it must first stabilize grain production.    Xie Fei spent 11 days inspecting six cities and 10 counties  in eastern Guangdong, including Huizhou, Shanwei, Shantou,  Jieyang, Meizhou, and Heyuan. He inspected crop growing bases,  aquatic cultivation bases, and some development zones and  village and town enterprises. He also investigated and studied  the current rural economic situation and future development  trends in eastern Guangdong. On many occasions, Xie Fei  repeatedly stressed the importance of the agricultural issue,  pointing out that Guangdong can quicken the pace of its  modernization drive only if it can ensure good agricultural work.    He said to local cadres: Guangdong's secondary and tertiary  industries have developed rapidly over the last few years, and  the trend has been very good. However, we should realize that  some people in some localities still tend to overlook  agriculture, especially grain production, and this problem is  quite serious in some localities. We must not forget China's  national conditions and the rural areas -- the foundation of the  country. If the rural areas are not developed, Guangdong's  development will be impeded, affecting its plan to achieve set  modernization goals in 20 years. Therefore, this year, while  continuing to develop the secondary and tertiary industries, we  should focus on rural work in some key areas.    Xie Fei was especially concerned about grain production. He  pointed out: The core of the agricultural issue is grain. The  primary issue of Guangdong's agricultural work is to stabilize  grain production; we should not totally rely on grain supplies  from other provinces. Our grain output can surely increase  steadily as long as our guiding thought is clearly set forth and  the policy is correct; and as long as we practice scientific  farming and maintain good efficiency in grain growing. He also  cautioned city, county, township, and town cadres to pay  attention to protecting cultivated land. In Shanwei and Heyuan  cities, he inspected a few typical projects using hilly areas to  develop secondary and tertiary industries, and fully approved  this method. He highly praised the Shantou City New and  High-Technology Industrial Development Zone for planning to  build multi-story factory houses to minimize the use of land.    Xie Fei was extremely concerned about how Guangdong's rural  economy will develop. He inspected several places where both  farming and aquatic cultivation were quite well developed. He  said: Modern agriculture should be an open and export-oriented  one. After Guangdong has stabilized grain production, it should  feel free to develop a diversified economy. As when developing  industry, it can introduce funds, technology, fine strains, and  processing equipment from outside the country to develop new  production work, exploit marine resources, develop mountainous  areas, and develop the farming, aquatic cultivation, and  processing industry on a big scale. Beside grain, for which it  will still need to rely on other provinces, Guangdong will be  able to export large amounts of other agricultural products,  such as vegetables, fruits, poultry, and aquatic products. He  stressed Guangdong has been very successful in opening up its  industry, and that it should also open up agriculture.    During his investigation and study tour of eastern  Guangdong,  Xie Fei also expressed his views on developing village and town  enterprises on a large scale, and on speeding up the shift of  the surplus rural work force to secondary and tertiary  industries.</p>

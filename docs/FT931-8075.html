			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Travel Focus: Tripe soup and Colombus, too - Sebastian Hope treads in the explorer's footsteps as he discovers the Dominican Republic / Cruising IT USED to be said that on the day the Colombus lighthouse was finished, President Balaguer would fall - which goes to show that prophesy in the Dominican Republic is as reliable as the electricity. Colombus Day last year - October 15 - came and went. So did the pope, who turned on the beacon and declared the lighthouse open officially. It was the climax of the celebrations for the 500th anniversary of the discovery of the Americas. Everyone was more surprised that the lighthouse's lasers, visible from space, left the capital's fuses intact than to find the blind Balaguer still in power next day. The lighthouse is a lump of reinforced concrete in the shape of a cross. It houses the 'remains' of Colombus and a museum of colonial history, since it also commemorates the start of evangelisation of the new world. Turning my back on the lighthouse, I headed for the 3,175 metres of Pico Duarte, the highest mountain in the Caribbean. It stands in the Armando Bermudez national park, which contains Hispaniola's last extensiive forest. The drive to La Cienega, the northern gateway to the park, showed what happened to the rest. Every accessible acre was covered with crops and breeds of livestock that thrive in the mountain air. It was a pretty enough rural scene, but the dry gulches opening up in old stream beds showed the underlying fragility of this arrangement with nature. I had fallen in with some young Americans in Manabao, where we engaged a guide and his mules. Juan met us at dawn at the park HQ, and we set off across a rope bridge on the three-day walk to the mountain's top and back. Beyond the river we plunged into forest, palms and hardwoods giving way to open pine woodland as we toiled upwards. It seemed that to climb the highest mountain, we also had to climb the second highest. It took five hours to reach the shoulder, and another hour to the base camp hut. We woke before dawn, shivering on dustbin bags filled with pine needles. Outside, there was a frost on the ground, and golden light was beginning to spread across the peaks. Lone trees poked through the mist in the valleys. The summit, not unusually, was a slight disappointment. There is no tree line and so no feeling of having climbed to a higher, clearer plain. There is even a bust of Duarte, father of the republic, at the very top. In his line of vision, a column of smoke rose from the forest. By the following day, it had become a curtain. The air in the cane cutters' barracks of Magdelena was thick with magic. The moon had not yet risen. I had been brought here to see a holy week festival peculiar to the cane villages. The dancers had red cloths tucked into their waistbands and baseball caps covered in curls of red ribbon. They blew whistles and twirled silver batons. The only sign that this was an Easter occasion was a placard of Jesus, with bleeding heart, on a pole trimmed with more red ribbon. The noise, and the violence of the dancing, was unnerving. When I produced a camera, hands came from everywhere, open for money: hard, cane-cutters' hands. We knocked at a door. Presently, the Haitian obeah woman, very black, appeared, asked for money in a cracked voice, and sent out for rum and cigarettes. Her altar was a magpie's nest: a bell, a long dagger, pictures of the Virgin Mary, St George slaying the dragon. Her actions seemed furious. She slapped some bent playing cards together and banged them one at a time onto the altar. She said she told fortunes and sold lottery numbers for a share of the winnings. We were sent away with potions which looked like shampoo labelled 'luck' and 'life' and 'love'. Sabana de la Mar comes alive only when a ferry is due. Most tourists pass through en route to the secluded beaches of the Samana peninsula, on the country's northern coast. At other times the jetty is dead, and the bay is left to the pelicans and the fishermen who wade its margins. It was the nearby Los Haitises national park that had drawn me. Its caves once were inhabited by the Ciguayo Indians and the shell middens in them looked fresh. The walls held carvings of long faces. There were drawings of birds, fish and figures in sharp black lines, the art of an imagination and way of life long extinct. After this, Santo Domingo's Zona Colonial, the first city of the Americas, came to symbolise only past injustices for me when I returned to it. The first fort, cathedral, university, monastery and courtroom - all built in the early 16th century - appeared to me as the machinery of genocide. It made me more comfortable to know that Drake sacked the place in 1586. Beyond the walls of the old city, there is a low-rise sprawl: apocalyptic, engaging, even charming - a circus of traders with their goods on their heads, a supermarket on the move, the streets filled with vehicles. I found sanctuary at La Llanera Famosa, a bar two streets away from the nightly gauntlet of prostitutes on Avenida Duarte. It was an oasis of light in the frequent blackouts, a generator purring outside. Here, I was introduced to local tastes in food and music, the former including pigs' trotters, beef shins and conch. I discovered that there is nothing more sustaining at 4 am than tripe soup. On my last night, Heracelis, the waitress, arranged for a wandering merengue band to come and play for me. Three men appeared with accordion, drum and scraper: instruments of European, African and Indian origin. The plaintive vocals told of luck, life and love. Heracelis grabbed my arm. Dancing to the impossibly up-tempo rhythms, everything started to make a little more sense.</p>

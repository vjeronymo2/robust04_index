			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 34.23, Locking and relocation of radiographic exposure devices, storage containers, and source changers, is slightly changed from &sect;34.22 of the current rule, as described below. Section 34.23(a) describes locking of radiographic exposure devices. A requirement to remove the key of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> keyed-lock is proposed. Should the key remain in the radiographic exposure device, there is an increased likelihood of the accidental or intentional removal of the sealed source when the radiographic device is unattended. The word ``manually'' is added to clarify what is meant by securing the source assembly for radiographic exposure devices manufactured before January 10, 1992. Section 34.23(b) is added which specifies requirements for ensuring that the sealed source is in the shielded position before moving the device and associated equipment because a number of overexposures have occurred while radiographic devices were being moved from one location to another.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 34.25, Radiation survey instruments, replaces &sect;34.24 in the current rule and has been updated to reflect current calibration standards for different types of survey meters. This is to specify requirements to address the variety of survey instruments currently available. An additional requirement to perform an operability check before use is proposed. While this is routinely part of all survey instrument specifications, a failure to determine whether an instrument was operable before use has been a contributing factor in overexposures during radiographic operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;34.27, Leak testing and replacement of sealed sources, the words ``repair, tagging, opening, and modification'' of sealed sources have been removed because these activities are only approved for individuals specifically licensed to do so. It was never intended that radiographers would be permitted to perform these activities without special authorization from the Commission or an Agreement State. Section 34.31 was modified to include a specific prohibition on the opening, repair, or modification of sealed sources. Most of the language in the proposed rule is the same as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;34.25 of the existing rule. However, the organization has been modified for purposes of clarification. The requirement that performance of a source exchange or a leak test must be done by persons approved by the Commission has been modified to include Agreement States. Recordkeeping requirements have been moved to &sect;34.67.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 34.27(f) is proposed to require surveys for depleted uranium (DU) contamination in the ``S'' tube of radiographic devices at least once every 12 months. Depleted uranium is used as a shielding material in most radiographic devices and replaces the lead shielding that was used in older models. The presence of DU contamination in the ``S'' tube may be an indication that the control cable has worn a groove through the ``S'' tube into the DU shielding. This condition could cause binding of the control cable in the groove with the resultant inability to retract the source, and could result in unwarranted exposures. Recordkeeping requirements may be found in &sect;34.67.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 34.29, Quarterly inventory, is basically unchanged from the existing regulation with the exception of moving all recordkeeping requirements to &sect;34.69.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 34.31, Inspection and maintenance of radiographic exposure devices, storage containers, associated equipment, and source changers, includes several proposed changes from &sect;34.28 in the current rule. The term associated equipment has been included in the proposed rule, and includes various items used for specific tasks which may not be supplied with the radiographic device. Experience has shown that defects in associated equipment can have an effect on safety. Therefore, associated equipment must be included in an inspection and maintenance program. Section 34.31(a) has been revised to clarify the intent of the daily visual check and the required actions if defects are found. In &sect;34.31(b), the term routine maintenance is now used to clarify that licensees are not required to perform all maintenance. Many equipment repairs may require returning the device to the manufacturer. Language has been added to specify that defective equipment must be removed from service until repaired and that a record of the defect, as well as corrective actions taken, must be made. While this appears obvious, there have been numerous instances where the use of defective equipment continued and overexposures of personnel occurred as a direct result of the defects. Recordkeeping requirements have been moved to &sect;34.73. The records required to be kept would now be specified in the rule, and include: Date of check, individual performing check, equipment involved, any defects found, and repairs made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 34.33, Permanent radiographic installations, is basically unchanged from the existing requirements in part 34, with the exceptions noted below. Section 34.33(a) has been revised to clarify which entrance controls are required by incorporating the appropriate language from 10 CFR 20.1601 into part 34. Section 34.33(b) is revised to require an alarm system check at the beginning of each day of use. This is to be performed by checking the warning light and audible alarm with the source exposed before using the room each day. A defective alarm would require repair before radiographic operations could resume. This requirement is included because there have been instances where failures in alarm systems have resulted in personnel overexposures upon entry into a high radiation area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

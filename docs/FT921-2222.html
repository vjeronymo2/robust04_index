			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Management: Blueprint for design supremacy Nine years ago this month, Margaret Thatcher set about trying to help British industrialists fill a yawning gap in their competitive armoury against Japan, Germany and Italy. 'Design your way out of recession' proclaimed the then Department of Industry in a 'design for profit' awareness campaign targeted at managing directors and finance chiefs. The industry minister responsible for design went on to declare that companies should cease their futile practice of calling in designers only as an afterthought, merely to put products in an attractive package. Instead, he said they should be made key members of the product and production team and have as much influence in the boardroom as marketing and finance. Quite so. A month later the government announced it would put its money where its mouth was, by tripling to Pounds 10m its funding of a Design Council advisory service which provided free consultancy to small and medium-sized companies. By the end of that year, the London stock market had begun to wake up to the attractions of design. Through Terence Conran of Habitat-Mothercare and Ralph Halpern of Burton, design was suddenly the 'in' competitive weapon in retailing. Then all sorts of other service organisations caught on, calling in specialist consultants to re-design their 'corporate identities'. British Airways changed livery, the Woolworth group became Kingfisher, and British Rail revamped all its colours. Though product design fared less well than retail or graphic design, fortunes were made all over the design profession as consultancies went public and their shares were snapped up. Across the Atlantic, however, design was still generally seen as a corporate also-ran. It usually operated as a poor relation of more 'professional' disciplines such as marketing or engineering. Now these Anglo-American roles seem almost to have been reversed. Having boomed through the 1980s, the British retail design bubble has burst. Many corporate identity schemes have been frozen, either because of the recession or in the wake of the controversy over the most recent, Pounds 60m revamp at British Telecom, which has scared off many boardrooms. Several consultancies have suffered spectacular crashes, and with a few notable exceptions, only three sectors are doing well: brand identity, packaging and, significantly, product design. That the latter is thriving amid the depressed state of UK manufacturing is a particular tribute to the high standard of its work for a growing number of foreign clients. Some consultancies are doing more than 80 per cent of their work abroad. On the institutional front, government finance for design consultancy has tailed off just when manufacturers most need it - even if they don't realise they do. The Design Council (of which I am a member) has emerged much leaner than before from a period of retrenchment, but continues to be frustrated at the reluctance of many manufacturers to use design to the full, even after a decade of propaganda and education. Far too many still see it as merely a surface activity. In America, things are now a very different story. Despite the recession - or partly because of it - business interest in design is booming after a series of heroic, design-led successes. These include Ford's Taurus and Sable models, a string of Japanese products from Sony and others, and, most recently, Apple's PowerBook laptop computers. While press interest in Britain has faded from its peak, the serious American business press has gone wild about design. What accounts for this transatlantic gulf? Is it just a natural time-lag as corporate America wakes up belatedly to a management fashion which has peaked in Britain? Will its own interest also wane? The answers to these questions lie, above all, in the more professional way in which American companies have gone about using design. First, the American design wave is very much more product-led than was the British, where retail and graphic design left product design very much in the shade. Yet, as the Americans are finding, product design and development is a much deeper and longer process than the surface work of retail and graphic projects, and cannot be stopped so quickly when times turn tough, or management fashions change. So it provides a more solid base on which to build design into the fabric of a company. Second, the American design community, and those Britons and others who export designs to the US, have benefited immeasurably from having come in on the coat tails of the powerful quality movement. In Britain it was the other way round. The 'design message' was promulgated in the early 1980s before the quality fashion arrived from the States - in some companies it swamped their nascent interest in design. In a well run company, quality and design should go hand in hand, two relatively new disciplines - or ways of thinking - which must be integrated into the product development process with the more established ones of marketing, engineering, production and so forth. Such integration within Ford of America is precisely what made the Taurus-Sable project so remarkably successful; in Europe, however, design has fared less well within Ford's management hierarchy, as the lacklustre new Escort demonstrates. The need for design to be integrated as a team player with quality, marketing and so forth is very much the message of a highly influential US research body, the Design Management Institute (DMI). By collaborating with the Harvard Business School, this Boston-based organisation has developed a set of increasingly popular international teaching case studies, some of which are now being taught on Harvard's 'core' courses and elsewhere. In Britain, the London Business School is now also taking the integrated route. LBS was the world's pioneer in teaching design to students and executives, though it is now being challenged by Harvard. Its work is being focused more than in the past on product design and development - a well known Japanese professor of technology management joins its staff next month, when it also hosts the DMI's annual international research forum of design academics. But a few swallows in Regents Park cannot, on their own, create a summer of revolution in the engine rooms of UK industry. There is still far too little evidence in Britain that industrial designers are being taken as seriously as in many US companies, where they really are becoming full team players. One of the few exceptions is the Rover Group, whose chairman, George Simpson, was guest speaker at last week's announcement of the Design Council's British Design Awards. Industry and designers alike will be helped if more companies take a leaf out of the American and LBS book, and make integration a priority. As Simpson argued last week, design is, in every sense, a multi-disciplinary team activity with intimate connections to quality, marketing and production. It should not be seen as an independent cure-all.</p>

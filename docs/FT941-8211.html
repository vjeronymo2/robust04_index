			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / The Markets: No advantage in pseudo-scientific futurology - Economic Eye The willingness of newspapers to report the outpourings of model-based forecasters gives economists a terribly bad name. If manipulating giant and complex statistical models of the world economy delivered reliable results, then all would be fine. But the recent record of the UK Treasury, the International Monetary Fund or the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has been miserable. Anyone who doubts just how bad these models are at predicting cyclical turning points only need glance at the upper chart for a damning confirmation. Economics is just not suited to the kind of pseudo-scientific futurology that these models purport to deliver. Engineering scientists can use theory and the results of controlled experiments to make accurate predictions about, say, the weight a bridge will bear before it falls. But economists do not have the tools, or the information, that the engineer has to work with when they try, for example, to predict with any accuracy when the aggregate consumer savings ratio will fall. Economic theory provides a powerful conceptual framework, but much of it is based on implausible assumptions about the rationality of human responses. Study of the statistical past can indicate plausible causal relationships, but testing an economic inference about aggregate consumer behaviour using controlled experiments is almost always impossible. Not that economists can afford to stop trying to predict the future. But, if economists are useful to have around, it is because of their deeply-ingrained scepticism, their willingness to doubt assumptions or ask whether the conclusions really follow. The best UK City economists, most of whom eschew large-scale models, are successful precisely because they continually doubt whether the future will be like the past. Their value lies in analysis, although it their forecasts which make the headlines. The problem with the OECD and other large-scale forecasters, aside from their ridiculous claims to accuracy, is that their statistical models always require them to look back to the future, finding patterns in the past to predict how tomorrow will be. In this recession, albeit a little late, OECD economists produced some typically good analysis of the historically unprecedented debt burdens facing UK, US or Japanese companies and consumers. But the implications for the pace of recovery were not incorporated into their forecasts, at least not until the OECD's woefully erroneous forecasts had done terrible damage to its forecasting reputation. Yet the danger really starts when macro modellers graduate to policy making and try to elevate past statistical relationships to orthodox policy doctrine. Remember, for example, the UK Treasury's repeated statements during the final months of sterling's membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. In or out for the ERM, the UK could not cut interest rates below those in Germany they said. Even a modest devaluation would inevitably lead to higher inflation, they feared. Neither assertion seemed plausible at the time, given the depressed state of the UK economy. And both have been proved wrong since. But the Treasury has still not cottoned on. Worried about the resurgence of post-devaluation inflation, it has cut rates much more modestly than the US Federal Reserve has done with no apparent inflationary cost. If growth remains sluggish, the Treasury will eventually sanction further cuts, although history suggests they will come too late and stay low too long. The failure of the IMF to engage with Russian reformers or provide funds for a successful stabilisation provides another example of the shortcomings of model-based, rule-bound, apolitical economics. The IMF has doggedly clung to the details of its standard programme, tried and tested in Latin America, which makes any release of funds conditional on the prior closing of the budget deficit, even though state spending cuts and the associated rise in unemployment were politically impossible in Russia. But, as Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University has repeatedly pointed out, there is nothing inherently inflationary about a budget deficit so long as it is financed by external finance rather than printing money. The point of western aid should have been to stabilise the price level before the government started the painful task of cutting state subsidies. To make aid a reward for success has merely made failure inevitable. Prof Sachs criticism of the IMF is a good example of economics at its best, challenging conventional wisdom not with the black box of an econometric model but through a close study of all the available evidence. Economic analysis is most powerful when it pieces together a number of theoretical insights and statistical relations to build a convincing alternative view. Take the Ross Perot charge that import penetration from developing countries is undermining employment in US manufacturing industry. Is he right? No, say Robert Lawrence and Paul Krugman of Harvard and MIT, the decline in manufacturing is much greater than can be explained by trade penetration, as the lower chart shows. Yes, says Adrian Wood of Sussex University, for their alternative explanation - technological change favouring skilled workers - is also driven by the threat of external competition. Whether the question is how to aid Russia, why consumer spending is so sluggish or the case for wage subsidies in east Germany, the same methodology works best. Macro modellers, be they the OECD, the IMF or the Treasury, should put away their crystal balls and get back to economics. This is Edward Balls' last column. He is leaving the FT to become economics adviser to the UK shadow chancellor, Gordon Brown MP.</p>

			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Rates end firmer RATES IN the sterling cash markets ended the day slightly firmer after the Bank of England forecast a large shortage, which was not fully taken up during the day. In the morning, the Bank of England forecast a shortage of around Pounds 1.15bn, much of which was caused by outstanding payments on the recent Pounds 800m gilts issue. However, dealers were reluctant to sell paper to meet the shortage, and a Pounds 200m shortfall remained at the end of trading. With a bank holiday due this weekend, market players will probably wait until Friday to sell paper to the Bank, in the hope of pushing the overnight rate as low as possible over the three-day weekend. As a result, period rates finished slightly firmer. Three-month money, an important indicator of where the market thinks rates are moving, ended the day at 10 1/16 per cent, after closing at 10 per cent the previous night. One-month money also closed a shade higher, at 9 31/32 per cent after a previous 9 15/16 per cent. Trading on the futures markets also reflected firmer rates. The June short sterling contract ended at 89.97, three ticks off from a previous close of 90.00. The September contract ended down two ticks at 90.30. However, volumes in both contracts were extremely low and amounted to little over 10,000 lots for the two contracts combined. In its early operations in the cash markets, the Bank of England purchased Pounds 21m of Band-1 bills at 9 7/8 per cent, and Pounds 225m of bills for resale to the market on June 8 at an interest rate of 9 15/16 per cent. The forecast was later revised to a shortage of Pounds 1.2bn before taking account of the early operations. The Bank later purchased Pounds 199m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 40m of Band-2 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 39m of bills for resale to the market on June 8 at 9 15/16 per cent. In the afternoon, the Bank bought Pounds 346m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. The Bank provided late assistance of around Pounds 80m. In the German money markets, call money was steady but with an easier bias, as relatively high liquidity levels at the banks took pressure off the market. Dealers quoted overnight money at 9.55-60 per cent, compared to Monday's level of 9.55-65 per cent.</p>

Liu Zhixiong, deputy-president of the CGWIC, said that Optus  B3 will be sent into space aboard a Long March 2e launch vehicle  at the Xichang satellite launch center in Sichuan Province in  the second half of this year.    Liu said that the launch services contract was finalized by  both parties after more than one year of discussions and joint  efforts.    In addition, both parties also signed a long-term  co-operation agreement today for the launching of an additional  ten Hughes-built communications satellites in the coming 12  years.    Hughes is a well-known manufacturer of communications  satellites, occupying some 60 percent of the worldwide  commercial communications satellite market. It was one of the  earliest Western satellite manufacturers to do business with the  CGWIC. Its products, Asiasat-1 and an Australian-owned  communications satellite, have already been successfully  launched by the CGWIC.    The two sides have contracted to launch the Hughes-built  Apstar-1 and Apstar-2, as well as the Optus B3 this year, and  hope to extend their co-operation in the space field in the near  future.</p>

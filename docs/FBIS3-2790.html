He told a report meeting on the current situation organized  by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the  Communist Party of China today that the fundamental reason for  the differences on the political system in Hong Kong is that the  British side has changed its policy on the Hong Kong issue and  adopted an uncooperative and even antagonistic stance in an  attempt to maintain its influence after 1997.    He noted that since the very beginning of the talks, the  British side showed no sincerity and stubbornly stuck to its  political reform bill that violates the Sino-British Joint  Declaration, the principle of convergence with the Basic Law of  the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong and the relevant  understanding and agreements reached between the two countries.    Not long ago, the Hong Kong Legislative Council, under the  control of the British side, passed that package, thus shutting  the door to talks, he said.    The British side went on to publish a white paper to  disclose  the detailed contents of last year's Sino-British talks without  notifying the Chinese side, distorting facts and launching a  round of fierce attack against China.    In reply, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman revealed a  large  number of facts to show that the responsibility for the  termination of the talks between the two sides rests totally on  the British side.    On the new airport issue in Hong Kong, Lu Ping said that the  Chinese Government has always supported the Hong Kong  Government's efforts to build a new airport. However, he said,  the British side violated the memorandum of understanding  reached between the two sides and passed a financial bill for  the new airport which means a huge burden for the future Hong  Kong Special Administrative Regional government.    At present, he said, the Chinese Government is negotiating  with the British side on the fourth budget of the bill in a bid  to solve the financial issue of the new airport on the basis of  the memorandum of understanding so that the new airport will be  completed as much as possible before 1997.</p>

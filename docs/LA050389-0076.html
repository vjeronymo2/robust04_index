			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Gov. Mario Cuomo vetoed proposed legislation that would have permitted tuition  increases at the four-year colleges of the City University of New York and the  State University of New York. His action followed student protests that have  all but shut down the City University system, but Cuomo insisted his decision,  which came little more than an hour before a midnight deadline, was not a  response to the protests but was based on what he called his "firm and  long-standing opposition" to increasing tuition. CUNY student protests over the  past week had included the seizure of more than a dozen college buildings in  New York City.  </P></p>

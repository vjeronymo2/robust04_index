			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: Nissan may sell shares to cut losses NISSAN, Japan's second largest manufacturer of cars, may sell shareholdings in an attempt to offset trading losses it is likely to have made in the six months ending this month. The move, which is highly unusual for a Japanese company, reflects the pressures Nissan faces from a sharp downturn in the Japanese car market, which fell nearly 7 per cent in the first half of 1993. If implemented, it could prompt similar action by other Japanese companies suffering from falling revenues and lead to a general unravelling of the web of cross shareholdings linking Japan's corporate giants with financial institutions, sub-contractors and group companies. Nissan is considering selling its stakes in leading banks and life insurance companies in an attempt to cover first half trading losses. In May it warned that pre-tax losses for the period would total around Y40bn (Dollars 379m). The shares are part of cross-shareholdings Japanese companies hold widely in order to cement relationships with their leading banks and corporate clients. Nissan's stock holdings amount to Y391.4bn at book value, the company said. While it is common practice for Japanese companies to sell part of these holdings to realise profits at the end of the year, they normally buy them back straight away. In a first-ever move for the company, however, Nissan will not buy back the shares it sells at the end of the fiscal year. Nissan also said it is likely to sell part of its property holdings as well. With the sharp appreciation of the yen and the increasing possibility that the Japanese economy will remain sluggish for some time, Nissan is uncertain how much of that Y40bn it will be able to recoup in the second half of 1993-94. The Japanese car industry is bracing itself for a third year of falling demand. Exports have suffered both fromthe high yen, which has forced Japanese car makers to raise prices in the competitive US market, and the recession in Europe. Meanwhile, the yen's rise has squeezed profits from overseas sales. Mr Yoshifumi Tsuji, Nissan president, said last month that economic weakness and the yen's rise had forced the company to lower production plans by several percentage points. Nissan has already launched a restructuring programme aimed at cutting Y200bn in costs March 1996. Earlier this year, it announced plans to close a car plant in Zama, on the outskirts of Tokyo.</p>

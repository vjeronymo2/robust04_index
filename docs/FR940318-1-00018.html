			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (i) Repair the leak; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Drain the affected lavatory system and placard the lavatory inoperative until repairs can be accomplished.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) As an alternative to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this AD: Within 180 days after the effective date of this AD, revise the FAA-approved maintenance program to include the requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(5), (b)(6), and (b)(7) of this AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Replace the valve seals in accordance with the applicable schedule specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(ii) of this AD. Any revision to this replacement schedule must be approved by the Manager, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) For each lavatory drain system, forward or aft, that has an in-line drain valve installed, Kaiser Electroprecision part number 2651&hyph;329&hyph;5 (or higher dash number): Replace the seals within 5,000 flight hours after revision of the maintenance program in accordance with paragraph (b) of this AD, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 52 months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) For each lavatory drain system, forward or aft, that has any other type of drain valve: Replace the seals within 5,000 flight hours after revision of the maintenance program in accordance with paragraph (b) of this AD, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 18 months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Conduct periodic leak checks of the lavatory drain systems in accordance with the applicable schedule specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii), (b)(2)(iii), and (b)(2)(iv) of this AD. Any revision to the leak check schedule must be approved by the Manager, Seattle ACO, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) For forward lavatory drain systems modified in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 727&hyph;38&hyph;0021, dated July 30, 1992 [installing an in-line drain valve, Kaiser Electroprecision part number 2651&hyph;329&hyph;5 (or higher dash number)]: Within 5,000 flight hours after revision of the maintenance program in accordance with paragraph (b) of this AD, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 5,000 flight hours, conduct leak checks. The ball valve and cap valve leak checks must be performed with a minimum of 3 pounds per square inch differential pressure (PSID) applied across each valve. If the cap valve has an inner door with a second positive seal, only the inner door must be tested. Additionally, visually inspect the seal on the outer door for wear or damage that may cause leakage; any worn or damaged seal must be replaced, prior to further flight, in accordance with the valve manufacturer's maintenance manual.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) For each lavatory drain system, forward or aft, that has a service panel drain valve installed, Kaiser Electroprecision part number 0218&hyph;0032&hyph;8 (or higher dash number) or Shaw Aero Devices part number 10101000C&hyph;N (or higher dash number): Within 1,000 flight hours after revising the maintenance program in accordance with paragraph (b) of this AD, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 1,000 flight hours, conduct leak checks of the dump valve and drain valve . The drain valve leak check must be performed with a minimum of 3 PSID applied across the valve.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) For each lavatory drain system, forward or aft, that incorporates either ``donut'' valves, Kaiser Electroprecision part number 4259&hyph;20 or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4259&hyph;31; or that incorporates ``taco'' valves, Kaiser Electroprecision part number 2651&hyph;311&hyph;1, &hyph;2, &hyph;3, &hyph;4, &hyph;5, &hyph;6, or &hyph;7: Within 200 flight hours after revising the maintenance program in accordance with paragraph (b) of this AD, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 200 flight hours, conduct leak checks of the dump valve and the drain valve. The drain valve leak check must be performed with a minimum 3 PSID applied across the valve.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) For each lavatory drain system, forward or aft, that incorporates any other type of approved valves: Within 400 flight hours after revising the maintenance program in accordance with paragraph (b) of this AD, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 400 flight hours, conduct leak checks of the dump valve and the drain valve. The drain valve leak check must be performed with a minimum 3 PSID applied across the valve.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) For flush/fill lines: Within 5,000 flight hours after revising the maintenance program in accordance with paragraph (b) of this AD, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 5,000 flight hours, conduct a leak check of the cap on the flush/fill line. This leak check must be made with a minimum of 3 PSID applied across the cap.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Provide procedures for accomplishing visual inspections to detect leakage, to be conducted by maintenance personnel at intervals not to exceed 4 calendar days or 45 flight hours, which ever occurs later.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Provide procedures for reporting leakage. These procedures shall provide that any ``blue streak'' findings must be reported to maintenance and that, prior to further flight, the leaking system shall either be repaired, or be drained and placarded inoperative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) For systems incorporating an in-line drain valve, Kaiser Electroprecision part number 2651&hyph;329&hyph;5 (or higher dash number): The reporting procedures must include provisions for reporting to maintenance any instances of abnormal operating torque of the valve handle for the in-line drain valve, as observed by service personnel during normal servicing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Additionally, these provisions must include procedures for either: prior to further flight, following the in-line drain valve manufacturer's recommended troubleshooting procedures and correction of the discrepancy; or prior to further flight, draining the lavatory system and placarding it inoperative until the correction of the discrepancy can be accomplished.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) If the drain system also includes an additional service panel drain valve, Kaiser Electroprecision part number 0218&hyph;0032&hyph;8 (or higher dash number) or Shaw Aero Devices part number 10101000C&hyph;N (or higher dash number), indications of abnormal operating torque of the valve handle for the in-line drain valve need not be addressed immediately if a leak check of the additional valve indicates no leakage or other discrepancy. In these cases, repair of the in-line drain valve must be accomplished within 1,000 flight hours after the leak check of the additional service panel drain valve.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Provide training programs for maintenance and servicing personnel that include information on ``Blue Ice Awareness'' and the hazards of blue ice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) For operators who elect to comply with paragraph (b) of this AD: Any revision to (i.e., extension of) the leak check intervals required by paragraph (b) of this AD must be approved by the Manager, Seattle ACO, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Requests for such revisions must be submitted to the Manager of the Seattle ACO through the FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector (PMI), and must include the following information:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

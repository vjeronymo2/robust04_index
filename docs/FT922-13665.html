			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / UK Company News: Ramsden's bets on HK biting into its batter HARRY RAMSDEN'S, Yorkshire's premier fish and chip operator, is betting on Hong Kong Chinese taking a liking to its secret batter with the announcement of a new joint venture in the colony. The first overseas Harry Ramsden's is being set up, complete with chandeliers, in Wanchai, formerly known for its Suzie Wong girlie bars but now an up-and-coming business district. Ramsden's has a one third stake in the venture, Bluelane, which also holds the franchise for the Asia-Pacific region. Other partners include Mr Andrew Bull, a concert promoter, and a garment trading company. The UK company has been trying to break into Hong Kong since 1990, but has only now found the right site, a 6,600 sq ft and 200-seat restaurant being leased from Mr Gordon Wu, chairman of Hopewell Holdings and best known for building power stations and roads in southern China. Mr John Barnes, Ramsden's chairman, said haddock will be the main fish on offer. But the company has been experimenting with garoupa and pomfret, which are plentiful in the South China Sea and taste 'really quite good', he said. Bluelane is looking at Singapore next and also has hopes for New Zealand and Japan.</p>

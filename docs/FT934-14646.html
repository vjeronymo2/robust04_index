			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Pravda told to change its name and editor: Moscow sets terms before newspaper can reappear PRAVDA, Russia's best-known Communist newspaper, is to be allowed back on the streets on condition it changes its name and editor, while the ex-KGB, another former pillar of Communist power, is to improve its spying on political parties. Both measures were announced as the Russian authorities prepare to lift emergency rule in Moscow on Monday. The press and information ministry also said 15 newspapers suspended after President Boris Yeltsin crushed the armed parliamentary rebellion on October 4 would be closed permanently. These included the hardline Den (Day) and smaller fascist or nationalist newspapers. The St Petersburg television programme, 600 Seconds, vitriolic in its opposition to the country's rulers, has also been taken off the air for good. Mr Gennady Seleznev, Pravda's editor, dismissed the ultimatum for him to step down as 'crude and arbitrary'. Itar-Tass, the official Russian news agency, said Pravda would 'in all likelihood come out under the name Path of Truth'. The agency did not say whether the government had chosen the new name. Another popular Communist newspaper, Sovietskaya Rossiya, has been given similar instructions as a condition for its reappearance. Its staff rejected the demand for its editor's sacking as 'blackmail and a violation of media laws'. Itar-Tass quoted a ministry official as saying: 'Nobody is asking them to stop their activity as opposition newspapers, but from now on they must act in a civilised manner and not break the law.' Mr Nikolai Golushko, the head of the security ministry, admitted that his organisation had been poorly prepared for the uprising and cited this as justification for 'improved supervision of political parties' in future. At least eight communist and nationalist parties were banned under the state of emergency and are likely to remain so even though some individual party leaders will be allowed to stand in parliamentary elections due on December 12. Mr Sergei Shakhrai, the deputy prime minister and previously close to Mr Yeltsin, announced he would hold a founding meeting of his new Russian Party for Unity and Agreement today. His party will not join Russia's Choice, an electoral bloc set up by leading pro-Yeltsin reformers in Moscow. Mr Shakhrai said his party wanted to avoid radicalism in economic policy and would put up mostly regional leaders, rather than members of Moscow's political elite, as its parliamentary candidates.

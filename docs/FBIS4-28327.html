			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Akihiko Ota; from SANKEI SHIMBUN 8 Jun Morning Edition p </F> 5]    [Text] Bangkok, 7 Jun -- A diplomatic source in Phnom Penh  disclosed 7 June to SANKEI SHIMBUN that it is most likely that  former Cambodian Prime Minister Pol Pot, who once ruled the  country by terror, has been hospitalized in Beijing because of  serious illness. Officially, the former prime minister has  retired from the front line; however, in reality, it is reported  that he still controls the faction as its supreme leader.    The source got the information from a senior foreign  ministry  official through his friend, a French doctor, who says that a  senior leader of the Pol Pot faction has been hospitalized in  Beijing.    The source said: "Judging by the medical history and other  information, there is no question that it is either former Prime  Minister Pol Pot or Noun Chea, ex-chairman of the People's  Representative Assembly."    Another Western diplomatic source says he has information  that "former Prime Minister Pol Pot was first hospitalized in  Thailand," but that, "he was later transferred to Beijing when  his condition became more serious and the hospital was incapable  of treating him."    Pol Pot took power in 1975 and ruled Cambodia till he was  ousted in 1978 by the aggression of the Vietnamese troops. He  has been denounced as the ruler responsible for massacring one  million of his own people through forced labor, torture and  execution.    Pol Pot has made no public appearances since 1979. However,  it is reported he maintains a strong influence in the country.  For example, he constantly plays a decisive role in the  faction's conferences on important policies or operations.    A witness reports seeing Pol Pot during the attack by  government troops on Pailin last March, but no confirmation has  been made of this report. According to a military source in  Bangkok, Pol Pot has reportedly suffered for a long time from  heart disease.</p>

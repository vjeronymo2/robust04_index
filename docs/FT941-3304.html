			<p>940316 FT  16 MAR 94 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (26): The Picasso system AT&amp;T's Picasso still-image phone, above, allows users to send full-colour, TV-quality still pictures, using an ordinary phone line - while simultaneously talking over the same line. The system, priced at Dollars 3,295, takes about ten seconds to transmit a single image. The intended market is for engineers and other professionals needing fast transmission of detailed images. The device looks like an office phone, but contains a data modem and transceiver. To transmit a picture, users plug in a video camera, photo compact disk player or digital still cameras. On the receiving end, a computer monitor or TV set displays the picture.</p>

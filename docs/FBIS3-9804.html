According to this,  privatizations should be suspended from 7 April until the new  parliament is formed, the reason being, among other things, that  the chances of supervision are further reduced during the  election period.    For such a measure to be taken, or at least to deal with  this  proposal, talks should be started as a minimum, but Pongracz is  not aware of any such talks at the moment. In his view,  suspending privatizations would be a catastrophic mistake  because, on one hand, this would completely frighten away  foreign capital -- and it would hardly be possible to lure it  back again -- and, on the other, it would also create  immeasurable domestic political confusion and dissatisfaction.    It must not be forgotten, either, that even in the case of  the left wing's advancement -- which is feared by many -- it  would not be sensible to halt privatizations because both the  Liberals and the Socialists are in favor of privatization, even  if they have different views on the ways of implementing it.  All the parties have returned to the notion of social market  economy and they are emphasizing the small differences.  Privatization is a good battle ground for them and the attacks  can be concentrated on this area. However, it is strange, and  politically unethical before the elections for a coalition  partner to give the impressions that it has not actually been  part of this at all, Pongracz stated.</p>

Members of the Provincial Party Committee  Standing Committee--Yin Kesheng, Cai Zhulin, Sang Jiejia, Tang  Zhengren, Doba, Wang Hanmin, and Yao Xiangcheng--attended the  meeting. Leading cadres from the provincial people's congress,  the provincial government, the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference provincial committee, the provincial  military district, the provincial court, and the provincial  procuratorate attended the meeting as nonvoting delegates.    At the meeting, everyone studied the important instructions  issued by the Central Commission of Politics and Law on paying  attention to the work of maintaining political stability and  conscientiously exchanged views with one another. Comrade Yin  Kesheng made an important speech.    According to the meeting, the current situation of our  province is good, and we have achieved economic development,  political stability, unity among nationalities, and social  progress. Behind the positive situation, however, there are  still some unstable elements. In particular, although a faction  of evildoers who stirred up trouble were punished in accordance  with the law last October, small numbers of evildoers are still  carrying out acts of sabotage. They are fabricating rumors to  confuse and poison people's minds and are using all sorts of  dirty tricks in a vain attempt to sabotage the stable and united  political situation, in which people of various nationalities  throughout the province are engaged in a united struggle which  is not easily won. Regarding these situations, leaders at all  levels, the vast numbers of party members and cadres, and the  broad masses must maintain sharp vigilance and have a clear  understanding. We must firmly and decisively deal with all acts  which disrupt stability.    The meeting stressed that we must uphold the working  principle of following the mass line and must proceed in all  cases from the interests of the people. We must have faith in  the masses, must rely on them, and must arouse their enthusiasm,  which is the basic guarantee for the success of our undertaking.  We must educate the broad masses, enhance the awareness of  maintaining political stability, and educate the public to make  contributions to maintaining stability. Regarding the masses  who were hoodwinked last year when a handful of evildoers  stirred up trouble, we must unswervingly implement the policy of  not laying blame on them, not discriminating against them, and  not investigating or affixing responsibility for the trouble on  them so as to unite the overwhelming majority of the masses.  People of various nationalities must unite and cooperate with  one another, live in harmony, and make joint efforts to maintain  and develop the stable and united political situation, thus  achieving joint development and progress for various  nationalities.    As stressed by the meeting, the key to maintaining political  stability lies in leadership. Leaders at all levels must  further enhance their understanding of the important meaning of  maintaining political stability, must try to reach a common  understanding and pace, must firmly implement all kinds of work  in a down-to-earth manner, and must make unremitting efforts to  work for the perpetual stability of Xining and of the entire  province and for the joint prosperity and progress of various  nationalities.</p>

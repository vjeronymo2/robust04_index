Should the Bidder neglect, refuse or fail to complete construction within the time herein agreed upon, after giving effect to extensions of time, if any herein provided for, then, in that event and in view of the difficulty of estimating with exactness damages caused by such delay, the Owner shall have the right to deduct from and retain out of such moneys which may be then due or which may become due and payable to the Bidder, the sum of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Dollars ($ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=7 f=2 --> XXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ) per day of each and every day that such construction is delayed in its completion beyond the specified time, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty.

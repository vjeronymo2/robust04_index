			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: Lion Nathan rises 64% after Bond purchase LION Nathan, Australia and New Zealand's biggest brewing group, yesterday announced a 64.3 per cent rise in net profits to NZDollars 116.65m (USDollars 61.39m) for the 12 months to August, from NZDollars 70.98m the year before. The result reflected the purchase of the former Bond Brewing assets with effect from March 31. Up to that date, Lion Nathan owned half of the company, which owns the Swan, Tooheys and Castlemaine XXXX brands. Directors said that a significant rise in operating profits was achieved in spite of difficult trading conditions in both Australia and New Zealand. They said the outlook was for a further strong performance in the 1992-93 year helped by the company's portfolio of strong brands. But increased competition and difficult trading conditions in New Zealand and Australia would be a challenge. While the result was slightly above analysts' expectations, there was surprise at the high level of extraordinary losses of NZDollars 95.49m. These included the sale of the former Woolworths New Zealand department store group Deka to Maori interests, resulting in a NZDollars 30.25m loss. Other extraordinary losses included a write-down on property interests of NZDollars 54.41m, a loss of NZDollars 10.39m on discontinuing stopping certain business involvements, and NZDollars 10.34m due to the sale and writing-down of investments associated with the unsuccessful merger with Australian Consolidated Investments (ACIL), the former Bond company. ACIL is now controlled by Brierley Investments, the New Zealand holding company. In a settlement announced to the Australian and New Zealand stock exchanges last night, Lion Nathan said it had reached an agreement with ACIL to end litigation and finalise the price of the brewery purchases. Under this, Lion Nathan will pay ADollars 38.38m to ACIL, which will be settled by the issue of Lion Nathan junior capital stock and ordinary shares. The Australian beer market shrank by 3.5 per cent during the year and there was little growth in the soft drink industry. However, the directors said there were signs that the contraction in the beer markets in both Australia and New Zealand had bottomed out. Lion Nathan Australia saw its national market share rise above 40 per cent. In New Zealand, the group's market share remained at 57 per cent. New Zealand liquor activities produced net profits of NZDollars 97.5m compared with NZDollars 105.03m on lower sales of NZDollars 625.59m against NZDollars 711.49m. Net losses of NZDollars 13.93m were incurred on soft drinks compared with NZDollars 16.48m, on turnover of NZDollars 131.04m against NZDollars 112.35m.</p>

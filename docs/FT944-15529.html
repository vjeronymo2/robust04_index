			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Inward &amp; upward Last week the ex-chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, declared himself 'unable to pinpoint a single concrete economic advantage' that comes to the UK from its membership of the European Union. A trip to Cleveland and Durham ought to make him think again. Samsung and Fujitsu yesterday joined a growing list of foreign companies that have recently decided to invest substantially in their UK sites. Such companies are apparently happier to invest in the UK's economic future than many of their home-grown counterparts have been of late. But Mr Lamont and others should be under no illusions: these foreign direct investors are betting money on a future within the EU, not without it. Not so long ago, yesterday's announcements by Samsung and Fujitsu would have been met with little but complaints. Once the world's leading manufacturer, the UK was said to be becoming merely a site for the 'screwdriver' operations of foreigners eager to escape European import barriers. Why are these complaints not heard today? Some would put it down to a new realism about the UK's economic options. But it is also the fact that Japanese direct investment has yielded considerable benefits to both sides. The latest census data indicates that foreign-owned manufacturing enterprises achieved an average 31 per cent higher net output per employee than domestically-owned enterprises in 1991. This is to be expected: the companies coming to the UK are some of the most successful in the world. But that is merely another argument in favour of such investment. Low-cost labour, the English language and membership in the EU are clearly a large part of the UK's attractiveness. The Nissan plant in Sunderland, for example, was a simple assembly operation for European sales when it was announced in 1984. From such beginnings, however, grew a plant that is now the UK's largest car exporter, employing 4,600, up from an initial 470. With luck, Cleveland and Durham will provide similarly good examples for UK companies to follow. Maybe the latter should also acquire the Asians' quiet trust that the sentiments of Mr Lamont and others will not prevail.</p>

			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Russian forces tighten hold on Chechen capital: Moscow denies continued bombing of Grozny Russian forces and aircraft stepped up their attacks on the Chechen capital of Grozny yesterday in what was reportedly the most bitter fighting so far in the 17-day war. In Moscow, officials denied that the town was bombed after a promise from President Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday of a pause in the air raids. Reports from Grozny, though, said bombing of the outskirts had continued and that an orphanage had been hit, with no casualties. The Russian government's press service said its forces were making 'real advances' towards Grozny's outskirts, 'carrying out the task of closing and tightening the circle round the Chechen capital'. Mr Yeltsin said in his address to the nation on Tuesday that the circle around Grozny had already been tightened. Chechen officials confirmed the increased level of fighting, with the press service reporting that the Russian army 'is trying to storm the city today'. That was denied in Moscow by Mr Oleg Lobov, secretary of the Security Council, which advises the president on security matters. But he admitted that the village of Petropavlovskaya to the east of Grozny, and Khankala airport near the city, had both been taken. The raids and the increased military activity appeared to rule out the slim hope - proposed by Mr Yeltsin - of the resumption of negotiations between Russian and Chechen officials. Mr Yegor Gaidar, leader of the Russia's Choice group and Mr Yeltsin's harshest critic on the liberal wing of politics, said he was 'sorry that President Yeltsin lost this chance of seriously promoting negotiations that could lead to peace'. Mr Gaidar, a long-time supporter of Mr Yeltsin even after most other reformist politicians had given up on the president, gave an exceptionally pessimistic review of the Chechnya crisis to journalists. He said Mr Yeltsin was receiving false information, was 'not in overall control' and had ceded authority to 'those who are against Russian democracy'. The cost of the war would break the budget, rendering any aid from the International Monetary Fund useless and destroying the government's macro-economic policy - designed to attract more than Dollars 12bn (Pounds 7.6bn) in aid from the IMF and the World Bank in the coming year, he said. 'It is inevitable that military expenditure will increase, the powers of the police will increase, human rights won't be honoured, civilian institutions will be marginalised and the press won't be as free as it was,' he added. The signs are that Mr Yeltsin and the forces commanders are now seeking a rapid end to the military operation. The Russian parliament has begun its new year break, depriving deputies of a forum for dissent over the action in Chechnya. However, the leaderships of both houses of parliament, who are ex-officio members of the Security Council, essentially support the continuation of the war. Mr Ivan Rybkin, leader of the State Duma or lower house, said yesterday that he 'supports the president in his actions against the bandit gangs' - although he said a storming of Grozny should be avoided. Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, leader of the Federation Council or upper house, has, with many reservations, taken the same line and is to face a vote of no confidence as a result.

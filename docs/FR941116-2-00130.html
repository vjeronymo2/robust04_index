If it is the applicant's opinion that the project proposed falls within the categorical exclusions, the specific exclusions must be identified. The information submitted shall be identified as ``NEPA Considerations'' and the narrative statement shall be placed after the coversheet of the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Even though a project may fall within the categorical exclusions, CSREES and ARS may determine that an Environmental Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement is necessary for an activity, if substantial controversy on environmental grounds exist or if other extraordinary conditions or circumstances are present which may cause such activity to have a significant environmental effect. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposal Submission <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> What to Submit <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An original and 14 copies of a proposal must be submitted.

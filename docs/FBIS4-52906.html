			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kim Chae-mok] </F>   [Text] The remarks by Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister  and minister of the National Unification Board, about the  "possibility of nullifying the denuclearization declaration" has  invited a strong reaction from the United States. A ROK  Government official concerned said on 14 May that as soon as the  remarks of Deputy Prime Minister Yi had been made public, the  U.S. Government asked the ROK Government for an explanation and  has been trying to find out the true intention of his remarks.    At a meeting of the Korean Newspaper Editors Association  held  on 12 May at the Press Center, Deputy Prime Minister Yi said:  "If it is proven that North Korea has developed even one-half  of a nuclear weapon, the declaration of the denuclearization of  the Korean peninsula would be nullified."    The U.S. Government pays attention to the remarks by Deputy  Prime Minister Yi for two reasons:    First, the remarks by Deputy Prime Minister Yi may be an  attempt to put a brake on the policy of freezing the North  Korean nuclear program, which the U.S. Government has reportedly  been examining positively. It is generally believed that the  U.S. Government has been examining a change of its policy toward  North Korean nuclear weapons from a policy of preventing North  Korea from developing nuclear weapons -- a policy based on the  notion that "North Korea's possession of nuclear weapons cannot  be allowed absolutely" -- to a policy in which "one or two  nuclear weapons can be overlooked."    In particular, U.S. moderates who espouse the policy of  freezing the North Korean nuclear program believe that if North  Korea is urged to remain in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty  [NPT] system and open itself up, North Korea will naturally  collapse in the near future.    Second, the "theory on nuclear sovereignty" that some ROK  academic and political circles had persistently advocated may,  the U.S. Government worries, have infiltrated into even the  government level and that the remarks by the Deputy Prime  Minister Yi may be a good example of this possibility.    This U.S. policy was made clear when it pressured the ROK to  include the provision that the North and South "shall not  possess reprocessing facilities and uranium enrichment  facilities" in the declaration on the denuclearization of the  Korean peninsula, which the North and South agreed on in 1991.  The U.S. strategy was to prevent not only North Korea, but  South Korea from developing nuclear weapons.    When some ROK people still advocated the "theory on nuclear  sovereignty," even after the denuclearization declaration was  effectuated, the U.S. Government examined the possibility of  making the denuclearization declaration an "international  treaty" and asked the ROK Government what it thought of the  idea. The U.S. Government did so because it believed it is  necessary to seek the signing of a denuclearization treaty to  overcome the weakness of the denuclearization declaration, which  can be abrogated by a mere North-South agreement.    The U.S. Government pays special attention to the remarks by  Deputy Prime Minister Yi because it thinks senior ROK Government  officials have made "suspicious remarks" one after another. In  early April Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong said: "Keeping  North Korea in the NPT system is the most important factor in  resolving the North Korean nuclear issue, and North-South mutual  inspections are not an urgent priority." The U.S. Government  expressed its interest in his remarks as well. Even when the  ROK Government decided not to insist on North-South exchange of  special envoys, a precondition for the third round of North  Korean-U.S. talks, the U.S. Government officially welcomed this  overture. However, it still suspected that this may be an  extension of the theory on nuclear sovereignty on the Korean  peninsula.    As the controversy over his remarks escalated, Deputy Prime  Minister Yi explained he intended to stress that "North Korea  must not possess nuclear weapons." Nevertheless, the  speculation that his remarks may have been a message from the  ROK Government to the United States persists in the United  States.    Therefore, it is predicted the difference in views between  the United States and the ROK, which was exposed by the remarks  by Deputy Prime Minister Yi, will be further sharpened when  North Korea returns to the NPT and when, as a result, the  deadlock over the North Korean nuclear issue is resolved to a  certain extent.</p>

			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY SPOTS: CONCERTS AT PARKS FEATURE FOLK TUNES, AIR FORCE BAND  </P> <P> Two Sunday concerts offer old-fashioned family outings that could easily turn  into picnics-in-the-park. Ambitious families might catch a bit of both free  events.  </P> <P> The concert at Peter Strauss Ranch begins at 2 p.m. in the park amphitheater  with Deirdre Mary Gibbons singing Irish songs. She is followed by the Avaz, a  folk music and dance ensemble with a dozen dancers, singers and musicians.  </P> <P> The ranch is at 30000 Mulholland Highway and can be reached by taking U.S. 101  to the Kanan Road exit south. Turn left on Troutdale Road, left again at  Mulholland to the parking lot. Information: (818) 888-3770.  </P> <P> A few miles away, at Warner Park in Woodland Hills, the 15th Air Force Band of  the Golden West will strike up the music at 5:30 p.m. for a sunset concert.  This concert, one in a weekly summer series, is presented by the Valley  Cultural Center and City Councilwoman Joy Picus. Warner Park is at 5800 Topanga  Canyon Blvd., Woodland Hills. Information: (818) 704-1358.  </P></p>

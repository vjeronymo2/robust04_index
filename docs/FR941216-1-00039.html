			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1. Deferred payment sale with contingent interest_(i) Facts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> On January 1, 1996, A sells depreciable personal property to B. As consideration for the sale, B issues to A a debt instrument with a maturity date of December 31, 2000. The debt instrument provides for a principal payment of $200,000 on the maturity date, and a payment of interest on December 31 of each year equal to a percentage of the total gross income derived from the property in that year. However, the total interest payable on the debt instrument over its entire term is limited to a maximum of $50,000. Assume that the short-term applicable Federal rate on January 1, 1996, is 4 percent, compounded annually, and the mid-term applicable Federal rate on January 1, 1996, is 5 percent, compounded annually.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Treatment of noncontingent payment as separate contract.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Each contingent payment of interest is a nonquotable contingent payment (within the meaning of &sect;1.1275&hyph;4(b)(4)(ii)). Accordingly, under paragraph (a) of this section, for purposes of applying section 483 to the debt instrument, the right to the noncontingent payment of $200,000 at maturity is treated as a separate contract. The amount of unstated interest on this separate contract is equal to $43,295, which is the amount by which the amount of this deferred payment under the contract ($200,000) exceeds the present value of the deferred payment ($156,705), calculated using the test rate of 5 percent, compounded annually (the mid-term applicable Federal rate on the date of the sale). The $200,000 payment at maturity is thus treated as consisting of a payment of interest of $43,295 and a payment of principal of $156,705. The interest is includible in A's gross income, and deductible by B, under their respective methods of accounting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Treatment of contingent payments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Assume that the amount of the contingent payment that is paid on December 31, 1996, is $20,000. Under paragraph (a) of this section, the $20,000 payment is treated as a payment of principal of $19,231 (the present value, as of the date of sale, of the $20,000 payment, calculated using a test rate equal to 4 percent, compounded annually) and a payment of interest of $769. The $769 interest payment is includible in A's gross income, and deductible by B, in their respective taxable years in which December 31, 1996 occurs. The amount treated as principal gives B additional basis in the property on December 31, 1996. The remaining contingent payments on the debt instrument are accounted for similarly, using a test rate of 4 percent, compounded annually, for the payments made on December 31, 1997, and December 31, 1998, and a test rate of 5 percent, compounded annually, for the payments made on December 31, 1999, and December 31, 2000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 2. Contingent stock payout_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Facts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> M Corporation and N Corporation each owns one-half of the stock of O Corporation. On January 1, 1996, pursuant to a reorganization qualifying under section 368(a)(1)(B), M contracts to acquire the one-half interest of O held by N for an initial distribution on that date of 30,000 shares of M voting stock, and a non- assignable right to receive up to 10,000 additional shares of M's voting stock during the next 3 years, provided the net profits of O exceed certain amounts specified in the contract. No interest is provided for in the contract. No additional shares are received in 1996 or in 1997. In 1998, the annual earnings of O exceed the specified amount and on December 31, 1998, an additional 3,000 M voting shares are transferred to N. Assume that the fair market value of the 3,000 shares on December 31, 1998, is $300,000 and that the short-term applicable Federal rate on January 1, 1996, is 4 percent, compounded annually. Assume also that M and N are calendar year taxpayers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Allocation of interest.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Assume that the right to receive the additional shares is a nonquotable contingent payment (within the meaning of &sect;1.1275&hyph;4(b)(4)(ii)). Section 1274 does not apply to the right to receive the additional shares because the right is not a debt instrument for federal income tax purposes. As a result, the transfer of the 3,000 M voting shares to N is a deferred payment subject to section 483 and a portion of the shares is treated as unstated interest under that section. The amount of interest allocable to the shares is an amount equal to the excess of $300,000 (the fair market value of the shares on December 31, 1998) over $266,699 (the present value of $300,000, determined by discounting the payment at the test rate of 4 percent, compounded annually, from December 31, 1998, to January 1, 1996). As a result, the amount of interest allocable to the payment of the shares is $33,301 ($300,000 - $266,699). Both M and N take the interest into account in 1998.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Effective date.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section applies to sales and exchanges that occur on or after the date that is 60 days after final regulations are published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1.1001&hyph;1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> [Amended] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Par. 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In &sect;1.1001&hyph;1, the first sentence of paragraph (g) is amended by adding the language ``(other than a debt instrument that provides for one or more contingent payments)'' immediately following the language ``If a debt instrument''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1.1272&hyph;1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> [Amended] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Par. 4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section &sect;1.1272&hyph;1 is amended by:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

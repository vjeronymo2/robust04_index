			<p>930526 FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: L'Oreal restructures its capital L'OREAL, the French cosmetics group, is streamlining its share structure in a deal whereby Gesparal, its holding company, will offer ordinary shares in exchange for the investment and voting right certificates held by other investors. The swap, which involves Gesparal giving four shares for every five investment certificates, and two shares for five voting right certificates, comes amid speculation about the long-term ownership of L'Oreal. Gesparal, which controls L'Oreal with a 55 per cent holding, is majority-owned by Mrs Liliane Bettencourt, daughter of L'Oreal's founder. Nestle, the Swiss foods group, owns the remaining 49 per cent. Yesterday's share swap, which involves Gesparal buying 2.9m investment certificates and 95,000 voting right certificates, is meant to modernise L'Oreal's share structure.</p>

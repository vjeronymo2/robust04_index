			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / NGOs rule OK: Politicians are widely regarded as unrivalled in incompetence What is an NGO? A forest of hands shoots up in one corner of the classroom, where the students doing the special course in 'global governance and humanitarian diplomacy' sit. Elsewhere, blank faces. How about this then: what is a quango? A smile of recognition spreads across the class. Yes, a quango is a 'quasi non-governmental organisation'. Logically there must have been NGOs before there were quangos, but somehow the simulation has become better known than the real thing. Both terms are cumbersome, which is no doubt why both are better known by their acronyms. Why should one need to define an organisation as 'non-governmental'? Surely that must apply to the vast majority of organisations that exist. Can one not take it for granted that organisations are non-governmental unless otherwise specified? It depends on the context. The reason you hear about NGOs mainly in an international context is that until recently international relations was presumed to be exclusively the affair of governments. In a domestic context we think of bodies like Oxfam or Save the Children as simply charities. But when they appear at a UN conference, or distribute western aid in Africa, they become NGOs because in these roles we expect, or would in the past have expected, to find government officials. Conversely the term quango is better known in the domestic context because it refers to bodies set up by governments in areas where they do not feel entitled to act directly - areas which belong in some sense to the private rather than the public domain. Those areas have greatly expanded in the last 20 years or so, with the advance of ideologies that seek to limit the role of the state, and the virtual rout of those that cherish the state as an organ of popular sovereignty and/or social engineering. What the proliferation of quangos tells us is that, in practice, the state does not find it easy to abandon its responsibilities, even when controlled by people whose ideology commits them to 'rolling it back'. It is perhaps a tribute to the success of that ideology that the two terms carry opposite value judgments. NGOs, almost by definition, are good, because government, almost by definition, is bad. Quangos are bad because they are in fact governmental, though hiding behind the benign mask of non-governmentalism. Or, to use another term that has lately become very fashionable, after two centuries on the dusty shelf of political science jargon, NGOs are part of 'civil society'. Quangos wish to be seen as part of civil society, but are not. As Ernest Gellner points out in his recent book on the subject (reviewed by David Goodhart in the FT of September 3), the rise of civil society is directly related to the fall of Marxism. Marxism sought to abolish 'the separation between the social and the political'. It followed the path charted by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in seeking to do away with any autonomous organisation that might come between the citizen and the state. Civil society, which could be defined as the sum of all such organisations, became the key slogan of anti-Marxist intellectuals in the last years of communist eastern Europe. But they were up against an undemocratic regime. Against a government imposed by force, non-governmental groups, formed by the free choice of their members, could claim a superior democratic legitimacy. What is more surprising is that a similar moral hierarchy seems to obtain in democratic societies. One might suppose governments chosen by the people in free elections would be in a quite different category from those imposed by force. Yet apparently they are not. It has become a cliche to say that all the democracies are affected by a crisis of legitimacy; that electorates throughout the world are disillusioned, not just with ruling parties, but with politicians as such. Half a century ago it seemed obvious to JB Priestley - whose English Journey the BBC has been rebroadcasting on Radio Four - that, if an industry was badly run, a state representing the people had a right and duty to take it over and run it better. One scarcely hears that argument now - certainly not from Tony Blair's Labour party. We now assume that, however incompetent capitalists may be, politicians would be worse. We would rather entrust famine relief in Africa to a rock singer than to the minister for overseas development. Yet the minister belongs to a government we chose (even if, in the current British case, the minister herself was rejected by her constituents at the last election and now sits in the House of Lords). No one voted for Bob Geldof: he never asked anyone to. It is as though the very act of asking people to vote for you is so demeaning as to render you unworthy of their support. In the area of humanitarian relief, NGOs have taken such a leading role in some developing countries that they are now becoming unpopular, because they are indeed quangos: armed with western government funds in countries whose own governments are acutely dependent on it, or have collapsed, the NGOs often both decide and implement what should be government policy. But their own ideology is often well to the left of the western governments which give them the money to spend. Not surprisingly those western governments sooner or later find this irritating. Conservative politicians can occasionally be heard to wonder why these unelected do-gooders should be regarded as superior in virtue and wisdom to themselves. But that is a rod conservatives have pickled for their own backs.</p>

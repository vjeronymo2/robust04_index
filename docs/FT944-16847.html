			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Czechs warned on 'xenophobia' Mr Ronald Freeman, deputy head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, yesterday warned Czechs against investment xenophobia after several deals involving foreign investors or management ran into trouble, Reuter reports from Prague. He cited problems at partnerships involving Volkswagen and Air France as creating a negative impression of the Czech Republic. 'If the Czech way is xenophobia, I'm against it,' he told an international conference on the Czech economy. 'It's very tempting to regard the foreigner as a threat.' Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, the trade and industry minister, stressed that the Czech Republic needed more, not less foreign investment and said he believed VW's high-profile investment in Skoda Auto would prove a success. The Czech Republic has been one of the most successful of the former eastern bloc and Soviet states in rebuilding its economy after 40 years of communism. But while the economy is growing after three years of shrinkage, the success has not been without problems. VW has said it would sharply cut its planned investment in Skoda under its policy of belt-tightening after heavy losses. Air France sold its 19.1 per cent stake in national carrier Ceskoslovenske Aerolinie back to the government earlier this year.</p>

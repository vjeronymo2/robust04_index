			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> East German authorities jailed at least 674 people on political charges in the  first half of the year, with twice as many expected to be imprisoned by the  year's end, the West German Justice Ministry reported. It said that most of the  prisoners were accused of "interference with state activity," a charge used to  cover various offenses ranging from attempts to flee to the West to scrawling  graffiti. The ministry added that one East German was sentenced to 18 years in  prison for writing "perestroika will yet free us" on a Soviet monument.  </P></p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: Spin-off to split Control Data in two CONTROL Data, one of the oldest US computer makers, is to be split into two independent entities, separating the company's computer products operations from its computer services businesses. The company will take a Dollars 400m restructuring charge in the current quarter. Control Data's computer systems products operations will be spun off as a new company, to be called Control Data Systems, while the remaining computer services operations will be renamed Ceridian Corporation. Silicon Graphics, a California computer workstation manufacturer, had agreed to buy a 10 per cent stake in Control Data Systems and NEC of Japan was considering taking a 5 per cent stake in the new company, Control Data said. Silicon Graphics and NEC have existing marketing and technology ties with Control Data. The division of the company will complete the transformation of Minneapolis-based Control Data from a computer maker to a services business. The company was once one of the leading makers of supercomputers and mainframe computers. 'The separation of Control Data into Control Data Systems and Ceridian is a major step in the effort to strengthen the businesses and help them grow faster,' said Mr Lawrence Perlman, president and chief executive of Control Data. Mr Perlman will become president and chief executive of Ceridian after the split. 'Control Data Systems will be a significant factor in the expanding worldwide 'open-systems' market, and Ceridian will be a leading services company in business and government markets.' He added that the move should also enhance the ability of Control Data Systems and Ceridian to attract capital. Control Data will capitalise the new Control Data Systems company with Dollars 50m in cash, payable when the spin-off occurs, and an additional Dollars 45m in cash, payable in December 1992. Control Data shareholders will receive one share of Control Data Systems common stock for every four shares of Control Data Corporation they currently hold. There will be no ongoing ownership or management relationship between the two companies after the spin-off, although they will continue to provide products and services to each other over a transition period. Control Data said about Dollars 115m of the charges were associated with Control Data Systems' plans to continue a transition from proprietary products to 'open systems' based on industry standards. The balance of the Dollars 400m charges reflects an anticipated loss and related costs of Dollars 55m in connection with the sale of the company's Automated Wagering business, and provisions of around Dollars 55m for property lease obligations.</p>

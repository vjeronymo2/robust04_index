			<p>BFN     [Text] (Martin Roddin), representative of the Japanese  Mitsubishi Automobile Corporation, has said in Havana that  Mitsubishi is studying the possibility of establishing a  dealership office in Cuba to sell vehicles and spare parts, in  addition to offering maintenance services.    According to (Roddin), the Japanese company intends to sell  a  line of vehicles for tourism and rental service, as well as  trucks for the sugar industry. (Roddin) ruled out an immediate  decision on this project, however, because these are medium- and  long-term prospects.    Today, a Japanese company delegation began a series of  consultations with Cuban economic circles to evaluate the  project. Mitsubishi is the tenth-largest automobile industry in  the world, manufacturing a total of 2 million units annually.</p>

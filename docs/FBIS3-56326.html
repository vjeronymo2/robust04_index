			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Bantin] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, 13 Jan -- "The Kurils do not need Japanese  humanitarian aid in the form it is now being offered, especially  as we have not asked for it, because we believe that it is  degrading for Russian people to turn to Japan for help," said  Nikolay Pokidin, head of administration of the South Kurils  region, in an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent. He is  currently in Japan to attend Russian-Japanese consultations on  the question of visa-free exchange between the inhabitants of  the Kurils and Japan.    Nikolay Pokidin noted that within the framework of Japanese  humanitarian aid, the goods reaching the South Kurils are mainly  those which the region does not need. "For example," he went  on, "we were recently sent a consignment of television sets and  tape recorders that one would hardly describe as an urgent  necessity. At the same time, we cannot get hold of medical  supplies and medical equipment for which we have an acute need.  If Japan herself has declared a desire to assist us she should  listen to our wishes so as not to waste her money." According  to Nikolay Pokidin, over the past year the South Kurils and  Kurils regions have been granted Japanese aid totalling 1.5  million dollars.    Meanwhile, Gennadiy Dolin, the head of administration of the  Kurils region, noted in an interview to an ITAR-TASS  correspondent, well-organized Japanese assistance may help to  solve the many complex problems that exist. Last year, for  example, within the framework of humanitarian aid, Japan  delivered a major consignment of medical supplies for the Kurils  regional hospital, thus rendering invaluable help to the local  people. "However, we are interested not so much in humanitarian  aid as in long-term economic cooperation which so far,  unfortunately, Japan has refrained from doing," Gennadiy Dolin  pointed out.    Both local administration chiefs described the economic  situation on the Kurils as critical. In their words, the  Russian Government only says it cares about this part of Russia  which is remote from Moscow, and is not doing anything practical  at all. Workers at a number of local enterprises have not  received their salaries for several months now, the local  authorities' budget is falling apart, and there are insufficient  funds even to ensure that transport functions normally and that  basic social needs are met. In addition, the crime situation is  deteriorating rapidly on the Kurils -- the number of robberies  and thefts is rising and shots ring out, fired by "fighters"  from opposing groups of the "car Mafia."    In these circumstances more and more people are leaving the  islands. In the past year the population of the "Northern  Territories," as the Japanese call the South Kurils, has fallen  by around 1,500 people. "This spring we are expecting another  surge in the flow of people away from the islands. Many  families have already sold their homes and got ready to leave  for the mainland once the navigation season starts," Gennadiy  Dolin said.    Nikolay Pokidin noted bitterly that the grave economic  situation was making the view that the South Kurils should be  handed over to Japan increasingly widespread among the local  population. The head of administration of the South Kurils area  expressed the view that in the foreseeable future the South  Kurils would not be handed over to Japan. "There is no Russian  politician who would take such a step," he said.</p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUNS FIND CURE FOR WHAT AILS THEM;  </P> <P> NBA PLAYOFFS: KEVIN JOHNSON MAKES A RAPID RECOVERY FROM STOMACH CRAMPS FOR 39  STRONG MINUTES AS PHOENIX ROLLS OVER UTAH AND EVENS FIRST-ROUND SERIES.  </P> <P> The question is whether Kevin Johnson did more good for the Phoenix Suns or the  gelatin industry Sunday night.  </P> <P> One thing is for sure, though. Johnson, returning to full duty from a viral  infection, and the Suns, returning to the series, chewed up the Utah Jazz like  soft food, winning, 105-87, before 12,616 at the Salt Palace to even the  best-of-five first-round matchup at one game each.  </P> <P> It was the first victory by a road team in 16 NBA playoff games.  </P> <P> "A little sore and winded," Johnson said afterward, offering his own medical  update, "but victories cure you in a hurry."  </P> <P> Medically speaking, this was no miracle remedy that enabled him to play 39  minutes after going only nine in the opener Friday. Mothers everywhere would  endorse it, and team doctors obviously did, too, because they headed the search  committee the day before to find the healing potion.  </P> <P> Dr. Paul Steingard tracked down lemon chicken soup at a Greek restaurant. His  son Scott, also a team physician, went to a convenience store to pick up the  Jell-O Johnson wanted for his liquid diet. Strawberry flavor.  </P> <P> At first, the hotel kitchen said they didn't make special requests for guests.  But when one of the workers found out it was for Johnson, Jell-O it was. Next  thing anyone knew, Johnson woke up Sunday feeling much better and hours later  was in the starting lineup.  </P> <P> The Jazz couldn't have seen this coming?  </P> <P> "Probably not," Phoenix Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons said. "But you'd better expect  it. If Kevin's got the ball, you'd better expect the worst for your team."  </P> <P> Utah didn't get the worst -- Johnson had seven turnovers, compared with seven  assists. But opening at about 75% and getting stronger as the game progressed,  he scored a game-high 22 points, and made up for any mistakes he made by simply  playing. It was a better endorsement than Bill Cosby could ever have done,  especially in Arizona.  </P> <P> "We just went out there with more confidence," Phoenix's Kurt Rambis said.  "That's not a knock on the players running the show the other night, but we're  used to a certain routine."  </P> <P> Beating Utah, for one thing, with the Suns holding a 4-2 advantage this season.  The two losses here, Dec. 13 and Friday, came when Johnson, in order, sat out  with a strained hamstring and made only a cameo appearance because of stomach  cramps. Wednesday, the series moves to Phoenix, where the Jazz have lost nine  in a row.  </P> <P> Utah was in this one for all of one quarter. The Jazz was already down, 35-21,  40 seconds into the second quarter, a deficit that would reach 19, 64-45, early  in the second half.  </P> <P> That soon went to 23, 78-55, with 2:17 remaining in the third quarter, and,  finally, 24, 82-58, with 1:18 left when Johnson whipped a pass underneath that  Kenny Battle converted into a layup.  </P> <P> "Psychologically, it was big," Fitzsimmons said of Johnson's play. "But the  important thing was knowing we got kicked every which way but loose (in Game  1)."  </P> <P> In other words, this was about saving face for the Suns after dropping the  opener by 17, and Fitzsimmons made sure they knew that. He asked several  players to look into the mirror in the visitors' locker room before taking the  court.  </P> <P> "We watched the films from Friday night and decided that no matter what  happens, whether we had Kevin or not, we were going to come out and play  tonight," Tom Chambers said.  </P> <P> Chambers wasn't much help on the court, though. Like Utah's star forward, Karl  Malone, Chambers struggled through his second consecutive poor offensive  showing, making only two of 12 shots.  </P> <P> But that was the only real debit on a team that made 49.4% of its attempts,  including 52.5% in the first half, when the game was decided. With Johnson  going seven of 14 and Jeff Hornacek connecting on seven of 12 shots, the Suns'  starting backcourt outscored their Utah counterparts, John Stockton and Bobby  Hansen, 38-23.  </P> <P> In all, six Phoenix players reached double figures. Mark West, who had 14, also  contributed a season-high 21 rebounds.  </P> <P> Malone looked the part of the sick player, or at least his game did: seven of  21, with one-of-six shooting in the second half, 20 points before fouling out  after 39 minutes.  </P> <P> He'll take the two-day layoff and the change of climate.  </P> <P> Johnson and the Suns? Their status has been upgraded, the point guard and the  team. Both recovered nicely together.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 11/6/1994 -- "The Central  Executive Bureau of the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR]  has learned with surprise of the recent statement of the  leadership of the National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party  [PNTCD] regarding the decision to trigger in parliament the  procedure of suspending Mr. Ion Iliescu from his office as  Romania's president, speculating on an imaginary `attempt' by  the head of the state upon the independence of the judiciary in  the matter of nationalized houses," reads a release from the  ruling PDSR's Central Executive Bureau, signed by PDSR Executive  President Adrian Nastase.    "This has to be associated also with the PNTCD leader  Corneliu Coposu's stands taken on a possible amendment of the  Constitution, to the effect of restoring the monarchy in  Romania," the release reads. "As a matter of fact, it is  strange to see justice protected by the leaders of a party that  has so far accused systematically the justice of `obedience to  the power,' while President Ion Iliescu has never uttered such  accusations, his only preoccupation being to see to the  observance of law and human rights, as established by the  Constitution."    "The PDSR assesses that by the above statement the PNTCD is  trying to accumulate political capital in the context of the  street events announced for the period ahead, being also an  attempt of the PNTCD to strengthen its shaken position and  monopoly in the Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR]."    According to the PDSR, "the statement of the PNTCD's  leadership discredits its own party, the more so as it is a  parliamentary party with a certain weight in the political life."    "Under the circumstances created by the statement of the  Steering, Coordination, and Control Bureau of the PNTCD and by  Mr. Corneliu Coposu's statement, the Central Executive Bureau of  the PDSR expresses its hope that the PNTCD will reconsider its  own political strategy and its representatives will focus their  efforts in parliament on the problems under debate, on the major  issues marking now the country's political life."</p>

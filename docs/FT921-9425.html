			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Business and the Environment: Garbage guru wastes no time Garbology is a curious-sounding academic discipline which the uninitiated might think involves the study of Greta Garbo films. Unfortunately for its adherents, garbology lurks at the other end of the glamour spectrum; it is the knowledge of garbage. Its proponents claim that much can be learned from the study of fresh garbage, and Professor Bill Rathje, the field's leading expert, talks about the topic with near-missionary zeal. Whenever more than three people gather to talk about domestic waste, it seems, up pops Rathje to rail against the popular misconceptions and regulatory ignorance that surrounds the topic. A voluble American with greying hair and expressive eyebrows, Rathje has become something of a fixture at environmental conferences amusing delegates with tales of derring-do among the detritus of the modern world. The author of several books on the subject - including Rubbish] and the History of Garbage - Rathje takes his subject seriously. And his studies serve a serious purpose. How can politicians regulate to reduce waste if they do not know what it consists of, he asks. Rathje and his team from the University of Arizona adopt a scientific approach to their subject. They extract a vertical cross-section of a garbage tip by use of an adapted drilling rig, sift and sort the waste and evaluate its composition. They have unearthed some surprising discoveries. 'I am an archaeologist, which means I was trained to look at ancient societies by looking at very old garbage. In 1973 I started looking at fresh garbage. We can learn something new about ourselves,' he told a recent conference. Most people assume that garbage - or rubbish as it's known east of the Atlantic - consists largely of fast food containers, packaging waste and soiled nappies. People make a natural conceptual extrapolation that what looms largest in their own garbage cans must represent the bulk of landfill sites. Many believe polystyrene foam accounts for 25 to 40 per cent of all waste. Not so, according to Rathje. From his studies of 15 North American landfill sites, he has found that all forms of disposable food packaging make up only 0.5 per cent of total waste. The vast bulk is accounted for by paper products and construction waste. Surprisingly, he suggests that it is wrong to see paper as a benign form of waste. A common feature of landfill sites is that the sheer weight of the garbage squeezes out the oxygen and water necessary for micro-organisms to exist and prevents raw materials from degrading. As garbologists are fond of observing: 'Biodegradability is the biggest myth since Santa Claus.' The European Commission would perhaps do well to consider Rathje's conclusions when framing the final draft of its packaging waste direc-tive. His findings may do something to alleviate the pressure on the packaging industry, which is unfairly regarded as one of the great scourges of the modern 'throw-away' society. But no one should underrate the scale of the waste problem. Rathje said that when he was at school he learned that the biggest man-made structure in the New World was the Temple of the Sun in Mexico, built around 2,000 years ago. But he has since calculated that a single landfill site overlooking San Francisco bay is almost five times as big. In spite of his enthusiasm for his subject, Rathje accepts that a career in garbology does have obvious drawbacks. He swears that you do not notice the smell of a landfill site after 10 minutes of breathing in the fumes but admits that the odour stays with you. 'I took my crew to a Pizza Hut for lunch and cleared it out in five minutes. The manager came up to me and said: 'For you guys we'll deliver'.'</p>

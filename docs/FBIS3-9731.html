			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Warsaw, March 27 -- President Lech Walesa is not  afraid of the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) submitting a motion  to the Sejm to restrict his constitutional powers. "They can  accelerate elections and in elections the winner will be obvious  anyway," Walesa told journalists Sunday before his departure  from Gdansk to Warsaw.    Walesa confirmed that the rejection of the candidature of  Dariusz Rosati for the post of finance minister and deputy prime  minister is final and the decision will not be changed even  after a potential meeting on the matter with Prime Minister  Waldemar Pawlak takes place.    "FOZZ (the Foreign Debt Servicing Fund) case was a great  theft and there were people responsible for FOZZ and this  candidate was one of the responsible. I am not saying whether  he was guilty or not but he was on the spot where the crime was  committed," said the president.    "Rosati was absent from the country for three years and  therefore it is difficult to determine whether he has the  knowledge of things and reality in the country," added Walesa.    Asked whether Leslaw Paga, the chairman of the Securities  Commission, would be a good candidate for the post of deputy  prime minister and finance minister, the president said, "I know  this candidature and I would really have nothing against but it  is not me who proposes candidates."    The president expressed his indignation at a statement by  leader of the SLD parliamentary floor group Aleksander  Kwasniewski -- related to him by one of journalists -- who,  during a break in the Sunday meeting of the main council of the  Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland (SDRP), allegedly  said, commenting on the conflict with the Belvedere on Rosati's  nomination, "Enough of this circus."    Walesa said, "We have had enough of the circus with  Kwasniewski and the like for 50 years and this circus will  really not be put on. Mr Kwasniewski will not be putting it on,  he may be sure of that. I will not allow him to do that."    "There was a circus even with the constitution, with my  initiative, which was rejected and now it has been approved. So  that is the circus presented by Mr Kwasniewski and company,"  added the president.    (When one of journalists suggested during the break in the  SDRP meeting that maybe the prime minister is not sure whether  he wants to cooperate with Rosati either, Kwasniewski said, "I  realize we live in the country where every question might be  asked, even the most crazy one. If the prime minister is not  sure and signs the motion (to nominate Rosati as finance  minister), how do you imagine that ... maybe it is not Rosati  but Keynes that is at stake (John Maynard Keynes British  Economist 1883-1946). There are limits to the circus in which  we may participate. You, as journalists, I, as a politician, Mr  President, the prime minister, candidates ... I think that  there is more circus and playing the state than the true state  in this whole affair.")    Lech Walesa did not confirm whether he will sign the 1994  budget law. "I am still collecting opinions, for the time being  I have serious doubts but it is not determined yet what my  decision will be like." According to the president, the decision  might be reached during the coming week.    Asked to comment on the corruption affair in the police,  Walesa said, "There is a great reconstruction in Poland, one has  to blame it (corruption) on reform and on big transformations.  It has to be fought with and I will be doing that."</p>

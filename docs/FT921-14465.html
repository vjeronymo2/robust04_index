			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / Hyundai to close plants temporarily HYUNDAI Motors, South Korea's largest car manufacturer, announced yesterday it will temporarily close its plants in an attempt to resolve a growing industrial dispute. The decision follows a vote by 30,000 company union members to stage a go-slow in support of claims for higher bonus payments, better working conditions and the dropping of charges against union leaders. It will further heighten the stakes in a test of strength between management and the union. The dispute represents an important test case for Korean labour-management relations as a whole. Industrial relations have been improving after three years of widespread dislocation and strikes following the introduction of democracy in 1987. Last year the number of strikes fell to less than 240, against 1,610 in 1989. A spokesman for Hyundai Motors said management had no choice but to shut the plants. 'The go-slow is paralysing production,' he said, adding he expected the union to end the dispute quickly. According to the spokesman, the dispute is likely to cost the company 25,000 cars, worth Dollars 150m (Pounds 83.7m), in January and may cause disruption to exports. A senior North Korean diplomat said yesterday his country wanted national unity through confederation with the south, with both retaining their present social systems, Reuter reports from Geneva.</p>

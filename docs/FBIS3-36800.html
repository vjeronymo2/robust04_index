The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper  carries an interview with the Russian president's assistant  Viktor Ilyushin who notes: "There is a segment of people who  regard themselves democrats and are in a state of constant  struggle.    "When Ryzhkov was cabinet head, they fought Ryzhkov. When  Gorbachev became president, they fought Gorbachev. They are now  fighting Yeltsin. I'm not sure that if another political leader  comes into office in the future, they will stop fighting him.  Although it is hard for us to live through all this, but this is  a disease of our teenage years, I mean teenage years of  democracy."    The same newspaper comments on a visit by Azeri President  Geydar Aliyev to Turkey, noting: "The policy pursued by Geydar  Aliyev completely convinced Ankara of the need for close  cooperation with the new Azeri authorities.    "Besides, a concept put forth by Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev on ensuring Moscow's strategic interests in the  Commonwealth of Independent States, which provides for  conducting peace-keeping operations in 'flash points' by Russian  troops, is evidently not to the liking of Turkey having its own  interests in Azerbaijan."    NEZAVISIMAYA reports in another article that 1,181  emergencies were registered in the Russian Federation in 1993,  with the number of casualties reaching 10,133. Out of the  total, 1,224 people died.    The newspaper claims that "the year 1994 will witness a  possible increase in the number of breakdowns and disasters on  all types of transport, in the extracting and processing  industries, expecially at mines, oil, gas and chemical  enterprises, which will be caused by deteriorating repair work,  delayed replacement of outdated mechanisms, unstable management  of production, low technological and labour discipline and lower  responsibility for labour safety."    The TRUD newspaper features an interview with former First  Vice- Premier Yegor Gaydar who holds that "an amnesty is  inopportune now". Explaining his viewpoint, he notes that "crime  is rampant in the country.    "Moreover, the work on the previous amnesty has just been  completed. The new amnesty has been poorly prepared  organisationally. The declaration of an amnesty decree creates  an illusion of impunity for a number of crimes listed in the  decree."    The ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI newspaper runs an article by prominent  economist Yevgeniy Yasin, director of the expert institute of  the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, who says:  "The process of forming a market economy is progressing,  irrespective of likes or dislikes of the government, the academy  of sciences or anybody else.    "It is connected with the setting of new relative prices and  new price proportions. They are being formed, despite  interferences caused by the structure of our economy.    "An analysis we carried out last autumn shows that prices  approach world ones where they are not regulated. This is a  positive process on the whole. Regrettably, it has negative  aspects, since enterprises feel that while in the past they had  comfortable life and correleration of prices, production costs,  technologies, etc. were balanced, they are upset now.    "However, if there were no disbalances, there would be no  impetus for restructuring."    The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper runs an interview with  Gennadiy  Voronin, deputy chairman of the Russian State Committee on  Munitions Industries, who states that the Russian Navy is now  living through "a stage of delapidation.    "Time is needed for what we should do to overcome this stage  in compliance with the new military doctrine: to do with small  numbers but high quality. Regrettably, the Navy lacks this  quality to acquire new properties that is it has no new high  precision weapons, advanced ships, control systems, etc.    "To tell the truth, we do not have now a programme for  combat  materiel we earlier had for 10 or 15 years ahead. We have been  waiting for it for 18 months. It has been compiled and  initialled.    "However, it is not yet an official document which could be  sent to our factories. I believe that it will be approved in  the first quarter of this year."    The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA newspaper carries an interview with  Pyotr Romanov, member of the Federation Council (upper chamber  of the Russian parliament), in whose opinion "it is a crime to  say, as some politicians do, that we shall live better this year.    "They had no right to extrapolate on our country some or  other programme drafted or tested somewhere in the West. Russia  is neither Germany, nor Poland, nor America, nor still Israel.  Our Russian people handle a situation and appraise it in their  own way."    The same newspaper runs an interview with defence lawyers of  former parliament speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov, saying that "if  the court does not give a political appraisal to this case (eds:  events of September-October 1993 in Moscow), this will be  totally wrong".    The PRAVDA newspaper reports that Russian Procurator-General  Aleksandr Kazannik visited Ruslan Khasbulatov at the Lefortovo  prison in Moscow at the latter's request.    The newspaper claims that "according to leaked information,  the exchange of opinions between the two former associates in  the democratic camp (eds: Khasbulatov was elected parliament  speaker with solid support from Yeltsin) resembled a dialogue  between the deaf and the blind".</p>

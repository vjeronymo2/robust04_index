According to KOMMERSANT UKRAINY, Ukraine's  Derzhkomatom [State Atomic Committee] has placed an order with  Azovmash Concern (Mariupol) for special containers for temporary  storage of spent nuclear fuel.    From 1978 through 1989, Azovmash made 41 containers to  transport spent fuel (starting in 1989, production was stopped  owing to a lack of orders). These containers were the basis for  a model to store spent fuel, TK-13.    As an alternative, a program is being worked out to have the  same combine manufacture Castor WWR-1000 containers using  Germany's Nukem technology. According to Azovmash's people,  implementing the program will take 3.77 billion karbovantsy and  17.9 million German marks. TK-13 will "consume" 13 billion  karbovantsy and 19.5 million U.S. dollars. The production of  Castor containers may start in 1995; TK-13 may start in 1998.  The service life of the former is 50 years; the latter's is five  years.    A special Derzhkomatom appraisal commission is looking at  both proposals. Which will it choose?</p>

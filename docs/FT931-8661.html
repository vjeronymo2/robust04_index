			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / People: Nomura hires Ruland to head German team Nomura, which last October closed its European equity market-making operations and sacked 50 people, has hired Heino Ruland as head of its German equity research and marketing, a new post. Japan's largest securities house denies any inconsistency in its strategy for the Continent, pointing out that Germany is its most important market in Europe after the UK and says that it will continue to provide and expand in areas which it thinks are profitable. Ruland, who will be based in London, lives in Frankfurt and spends a good proportion of his time in Germany, will be responsible for pulling together Nomura's German resources - currently two country analysts in Frankfurt together with the London-based sector analysts. Since the events of last October, the latter look at industries very much on a pan-European basis. Unusually for a German financier, Ruland, who is just 36, has moved about in his 15 years in the securities business. He joined Dresdner Bank straight from school - later doing an economics degree at night school - but has also been at Bank in Liechtenstein, Morgan Stanley and Bank Julius Baer. Then, he had only been at Barings Securities as the co-head of its Frankfurt operations for ten months when the UK merchant bank decided to reorganise its activities in order to concentrate on southern Europe. Nomura says that his depth of experience, his youth, and his 'bicultural' approach, singled him out as the strongest candidate. His penchant for collecting classic Mercedes convertibles as well as for riding Harley Davidson Soft Tails presumably also distinguished him somewhat from the herd.</p>

			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Unigate set to deliver - The week ahead Christian Salvesen reports full-year results on Monday but these are likely to show only a modest increase on the previous year's pre-tax Pounds 75.9m. Following a profits warning by the group in January, the shares have underperformed the market by about 40 per cent, but next week's figures should prove to be a turning point. When Unigate reports annual profits on Tuesday, the growth rate is expected to exceed the modest increase announced last Wednesday by arch-rival Northern Foods. Forecasts for Unigate suggest a rise of about Pounds 10m from the Pounds 97.9m, excluding exceptionals, recorded in 1993. But the gain is more a reflection of Unigate's greater recovery from a lower base and the restructuring of activities it has been pursuing since the arrival of Ross Buckland as chief executive in 1990. Three water companies will be announcing finals next week, with most analysts expecting a reinforcement of the trends seen so far: steady progress in the core utility business and further news on cost-cutting. Severn Trent (Tuesday) is pegged to report profits of between Pounds 280m and Pounds 285m, and an 8.5 per cent increase in the pay-out to 22.9p. Thames (Wednesday) is estimated to come in with a 2 per cent decline in profits to Pounds 245m, and an increase in the dividend of just over 8 per cent to 22.7p. Southern Water (Thursday) is forecast to return profits more than 8 per cent ahead to about Pounds 129m, with an 8.9 per cent dividend rise - at the higher end of increases seen so far - to 23.2p. London Electricity is expected to disclose pre-tax profits of about Pounds 185m, compared with Pounds 145.5m, on Wednesday. A rise of around 14 per cent from last year's 19.5p is on the cards for the dividend. The following day, South Wales Electricity is expected to announce Pounds 100m pre-tax, against Pounds 87m. The City expects a dividend of about 25.3p, against 22.3p. The second quarter is traditionally the weakest for NFC, and comparisons when it reports interim results on Wednesday will be onerous because last time's figures were flattered by a Pounds 50m profit from the sale of the group's waste management arm. Reflecting this, profits on an FRS 3 basis are likely to fall from Pounds 86.6m to Pounds 53m. They should, however, show healthy growth, from Pounds 37.5m to about Pounds 49m, on a normalised basis as the recovery in the US and UK economies begins to pull more consumer goods through the distribution pipeline serviced by NFC's logistics operations. FKI, the electrical engineering group, is expected to turn in annual pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 50m on Thursday, up from Pounds 38m in the preceding year. The main drive of the increase is expected to come from the materials handling division, but good growth also is expected from the automotive division, which has undergone a thorough rationalisation programme in North America. The main interest in Berisford International's interim results on Tuesday will lie in the progress it is making with its acquisition of Magnet. It paid a knockdown Pounds 56m for the kitchen and joinery company in January, the first step in its planned transformation from shell company to conglomerate. Its shares are up from 128p to 212p since the deal but languish far below their late-1980s levels.</p>

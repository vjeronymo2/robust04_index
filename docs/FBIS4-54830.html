			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, May 4 (AFP) -- In a statement released in  Bonn prior to news of the gunshots, German Foreign Minister  Klaus Kinkel described the despatch of the ambassador as "a  further signal of our efforts to bring peace and stability to  Bosnia-Herzegovina". An important aspect of the German  embassy's work in Sarajevo will be the coordination of public  and private humanitarian aid from Germany for the people of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kinkel said. The government of Chancellor  Helmut Kohl has also said it wants to help reconstruction work  here as the war ends.</p>

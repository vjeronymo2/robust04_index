The newspaper wrote that when its  correspondent approached the Kyrgyzstan Defense Ministry for an  explanation, it was unable to either confirm or deny this  report. During his official visit to Moscow, the republican  President Askar Akayev clarified the situation in an interview  with our correspondent.    [Begin Akayev recording] This will never happen, because we  were one of the first co-founders of the collective security  council. We were one of the first five countries in Tashkent to  sign the collective security treaty and the decision to set up  joint CIS Armed Forces. So of course we will rely on the joint  armed forces in the business of defending our security and  ensuring peace in Kyrgyzstan, and indeed in all the countries of  the CIS, on the territory of the whole of the former USSR.

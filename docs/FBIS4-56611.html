			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 5 May (NA) -- Cordoba Governor Eduardo  Angeloz on 5 May denied that Senator Fernando de la Rua had  rejected the proposal to join a UCR [Radical Civic Union]  Political Action Commission, and stated that Raul Alfonsin's  party "is, for the time being, not in a position to attain  power."    Angeloz stated that "nobody has rejected the idea of sitting  down around a table to discuss the UCR's future," although he  acknowledged that "everyone is trying to talk it over with  friends, and with the other members of their faction."    He added: "De la Rua asked for more information, more  details. I told him all I could, and next week we will probably  continue the conversation we started this week." [passage  omitted]    Angeloz also denied having considered the possibility of  becoming the UCR's presidential candidate for next year. He  asked "what is the point of a ticket if the appropriate tool,  that is, the party, has not been sharpened?"    He added that it is "much too early" to talk about an  electoral alliance between the UCR and the Grand Front for the  upcoming presidential elections.    "The Constituent Assembly is the first step that we must  take  to find out when the incumbent president will step down, when  the elections will be held, and what it is that the people  want," he said.    He concluded that he was "absolutely sure" that the people's  interests were "different" from those of the politicians, and  urged the leaders to "understand and grasp" what it is that the  people want.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by R. Levin: ``Eastern Project Begins''] </F>   [Text] An underwater optical fiber communication line  will link Russia, Japan and Korea by early 1995. Agreement was  reached on this in Moscow by 17 international communications  operators who signed a special agreement in June to begin  construction of this telecommunications route.    The new optical fiber communication line will be laid across  the bottom of the Sea of Japan between the cities of Nakhodka  (Russia), Naoetsu (Japan) and Pusan (Korea). The length of the  line will be 1,211 km in the section between Russia and Japan,  1,026 km between Russia and Korea, and 1,196 km between Japan  and Korea. Over 22,000 channels will be organized with modern  digital transmission apparatus designed to work at a speed of  560 Mbits/sec; 15,000 of these channels will begin carrying  international telephone traffic between the Far East, Siberia  and countries of the Asia-Pacific region.    Russia's Intertelekom, Denmark's GNTC and Telecom Denmark,  which are already known for creation of the Denmark-Russia  optical fiber line, and Japan's KDD and Korea's Korea Telecomm  were the initiators of the project and its principal investors.  The outlays to erect the ``Eastern'' optical fiber communication  line are estimated at $80 million U.S., with not a single kopeck  being spent out of the state budget. Nonetheless, the part of  the complex located on our territory and the section of  underwater cable to its branch point will be Russian property.    An international consortium of three Japanese firms--KDD,  Fujitsu and NEC--will lay the cable, install the underwater  branching equipment and built the coastal stations. These firms  obtained this large contract after winning a competition held  not long ago. And Germany's Siemens will help the project's  participants in building the 930-kilometer cable section from  Nakhodka to Khabarovsk and to the international exchange in this  city.    Interest in the new optical fiber communication line is  great. Seventeen international operators, including  Interetelekom (Russia), AT&amp;T and MCI (USA), ITJ and KDD  (Japan),  DACOM and KT (Korea), TELEGLOBE (Canada), Telstra (Australia)  and others, have acquired space in the future optical route, as  was reported to journalists at a press conference held during a  June meeting in Moscow.    The Eastern project will have great significance not only to  our country but also to the entire world community. As we know,  it will become possible to close the ``global communication  ring'' around the world only after Russia is covered by a modern  telecommunications network. The appearance of the Far Eastern  optical fiber communication line will become an important stage  on this path.</p>

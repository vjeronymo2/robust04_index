			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Tunis] </F>   [Text] The PLO leadership in Tunis has taken very seriously  a number of statements issued following the Hebron massacre,  copies of which were dispatched to Yasir 'Arafat. The PLO  leader immediately informed the members of the intifadah higher  central committee, the West Bank committee, and three of his  aides for occupied territory affairs of these statements. These  aides are Ziyad Abu-Ziyad, Mahmud al-'Alul, and Jibril al-Rujub.  The statements were extensively distributed during the three  days that followed the massacre. The issuing side described  itself as the Fatah committee inside the occupied territory.    One of these statements, which carried the heading: "Appeal  to the Fatah Leaders," was addressed to Faruq Qaddumi, 'Abbas  Zaki, Sakhr Habash, Muhammad Jihad, Muhammad Ghunaym, and Khalid  al-Hasan, which the statement described as the Fatah leaders in  the absence of a collective leadership. A copy of the statement  was sent to 'Arafat by one of his aides who said that it was  distributed on a large scale in the al-Baq'ah refugee camp [in  Jordan]. The statement demanded that an emergency leadership be  formed to put reform programs in effect and asked that Fatah  return to the field to carry out all kinds of struggle,  especially the armed struggle.    In conclusion, the statement addressed the abovementioned  Fatah leaders by saying: Your response or lack of response to  this appeal will gauge the extent of our dealing with you.    Another statement addressed to the Fatah leaders described  the negotiations and the peace process as a tool for  circumventing the Palestinian people's struggle and sacrifices.  The statement leveled sharp criticism at the Palestinian  leadership, describing its members as leaders who can only  commit themselves to implementing instructions from the White  House, which did not allow them to react to the Hebron massacre  except with condemnations and denunciations.    In another statement attributed to the Unified National  Leadership of the Intifadah--Qawim [resist], an appeal was made  to reconstitute the intifadah's strike forces in all parts of  the state of Palestine, restore the state of popular Palestinian  unrest and direct it toward the occupation and settlers, and  begin a comprehensive and responsible national dialogue to unify  efforts and confront the current phase.    Other statements of similar import studied by 'Arafat and  his  aides are attributed to the western sector in the Fatah  Movement. One of these statements carried a warning to the  settlers that the time for retribution has come.    Similar statements were also issued attributed to the Fatah  cadres in Jordan and Tunisia, rejecting the negotiations and  calling for a change in the Fatah and PLO readerships, which  'Arafat took very seriously. He demanded information on who  stands behind these statements and the weight they could carry  on the way to creating an organizational coup on the highest  level within the Fatah Movement.</p>

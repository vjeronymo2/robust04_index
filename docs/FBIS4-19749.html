			<p>BFN     [Text] The Martin Posadillo, a ship belonging to the  Spanish Army, left last night with a shipment of armored trucks  and radio equipment for the Cordoba Group deployed in Bosnia.  Over to our studios in Valencia.    [Unidentified correspondent] Last night, the Army cargo ship  Martin Posadillo left the port of Valencia for former  Yugoslavia. It is carrying a shipment of nearly 50 vehicles and  radio equipment to reinforce the Cordoba Group in its mission.  The Cordoba Group is the fourth battalion of the Spanish Army  to participate in the UN peacekeeping mission in Bosnia.    This information stems from the Captaincy General of the  southeast coast military region. Armored personnel carriers,  military engineering vehicles, four-wheel drive trucks,  excavating machines, tows, cranes, and radio equipment make up  the shipment.    This equipment is sent to reinforce what has been used until  now by the three preceding groups in the former Yugoslavia.    The missions for which the new equipment will be used  include  removing rubble and repairing housing destroyed by shelling.</p>

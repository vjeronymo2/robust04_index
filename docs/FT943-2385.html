			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / US warned of health reform need A senior US budget official warned yesterday that, although no healthcare reform bill was likely to pass through Congress this year, the need for reform had not gone away. 'It obviously does not look like we are going to be successful this year,' said Mr Robert Reischauer, head of the Congressional Budget Office, an independent agency which has been charged with checking the arithmetic of all the competing US healthcare reform plans. But Mr Reischauer, speaking at a conference at Boston College, warned that effective reform of the healthcare system remained essential in order to keep the cost of healthcare from continuing to erode US disposable incomes. The chances of completing such a large and controversial piece of legislation in the three weeks before the end of the present congressional session seem - to most observers - to be virtually non-existent. However, Senator George Mitchell, Democratic majority leader in the Senate, and some centrist senators from both parties have continued to work on a possible compromise bill. Although Mr Reischauer has made clear, over the past year, his own commitment to reform of healthcare in the US, his agency's assessments of the competing reform plans have contributed to congressional unwillingness to act on health reform this year. The CBO's assessment, for example, of the comprehensive reform, presented a year ago by President Bill Clinton, concluded that the plan could achieve its aims by guaranteeing universal health coverage, but would cost much more in the near term than the administration had calculated. Instead of cutting the federal budget deficit by Dollars 60bn (Pounds 39m) over the next six years, as the administration estimated, the plan would increase the deficit by Dollars 70bn, the CBO said. Republican right-wingers such as Senator Phil Gramm, who have been fighting against healthcare reform all year, declared the issue dead some weeks ago. Also, some left-wing advocates of reform, such as Congressman Jim McDermott, worried that anything now likely to pass both chambers of Congress might do more harm than good, have given up the idea of acting this year. Even so, some Democrats want a bill of some kind to come to a vote, if only so that they can pin the blame for failure on their Republican opponents. 'They've killed reform. Now we want to make sure their fingerprints are found at the scene of the crime,' one Democratic staffer said.</p>

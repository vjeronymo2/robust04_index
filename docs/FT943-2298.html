			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Excessive barriers in Euro car market Sir, In his report about the battle over the EU block exemption which governs car distribution in Europe ('The battle for the forecourt' , September 16), Kevin Done makes much of the car price differences that are reported in Europe. In interpreting these findings we place special emphasis on consumer group Bureau Europeen des Unions de Consommateurs' point that institutional barriers impeding cross-border purchases and registrations of cars are excessive in what should be a single market for cars. These must be removed, in combination with greater economic coherence between EU member states, before any form of price harmonisation can be contemplated. Certainly this is one area where new regulation must tread with care. Done suggests that the current debate is determining 'what rules will apply on the forecourt for the next 10 years'. Our conclusion from a major study of the block exemption is that the car industry's distribution system in Europe has been under the most intense and detailed scrutiny for the last 9 1/2 years. This should be long enough to evaluate a system of this kind. The industry and its many dealers and employees throughout Europe should not be subjected to similar uncertainties 10 1/2 years from now. We recommend that the new regulation be put in place for a term as long as any block exemption the Commission has granted, namely for 14 1/2 years.

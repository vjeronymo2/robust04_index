			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ALL-STAR BASKETBALL GAMES SCHEDULED JUNE 24 AT BREN CENTER  </P> <P> Two state all-star basketball games, featuring the top boys' and girls' high  school seniors, have been scheduled for June 24 at UC Irvine's Bren Center.  </P> <P> The doubleheader will have a North vs.  </P> <P> South format with a squad of 11 graduating seniors on four teams.  </P> <P> It will be the first state all-star boys' game since 1971, and the first state  all-star girls' game.  </P> <P> The rosters will be announced in two weeks. Among the players expected to  compete include Ed O'Bannon of Artesia and Lisa Leslie of Morningside, the  state's boys' and girls' players of the year.  </P> <P> Tim Sweeney of Lakewood will coach the South boys' team and Joe Murrillo of  Chino will coach the South girls.  </P> <P> Proceeds from the games will benefit the Boys Clubs of Orange County.  </P> <P> Players will arrive on June 21, and practices are scheduled at Century High in  Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Promoter Greg Katz, an assistant coach at Century High, said he decided to  schedule the games after the success of a Southern California all-stars vs.  Soviet Junior National team at the Bren Center last summer.  </P> <P> "If they can draw 3,200 for a game against a bunch of Russian players that  you've never heard of, then I figured it was time for a state all-star game,"  Katz said.

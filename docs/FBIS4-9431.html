			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by W.K.: "Poland-PFP; We Are Not Taking Part in a </F> Race"]    [Text] The issue of Poland's participation in the  "Partnership for Peace" [PFP] program was the main subject  discussed at the meeting between National Defense Minister Piotr  Kolodziejczyk and representatives of the embassies of the NATO  states. At the meeting, which was held yesterday in Helenow  near Warsaw, the National Defense Ministry [MON] head stated  that on 25 April a delegation of MON and the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs would submit a so-called presentation document in  Brussels.    The minister expressed his hope that today the government  would accept this document. The presentation document should be  submitted by the states that want to take part in the PFP  program.    Kolodziejczyk stressed that,even though Poland was the first  state of Central and East Europe to prepare a draft of the  document, this should not disturb other states of our region in  their striving to achieve NATO membership. The minister added  that the document had been discussed with the Visegrad Group  states. "We are not taking part in any race," he pointed out.  He also said that, at the meeting, a lot of attention had been  drawn to the issue of the consultations mechanism included in  the PFP.    In Helenow, the problems of European security, bilateral and  multilateral cooperation, and the financial aspects of  participation in the PFP were also discussed.    Kolodziejczyk conceded that a weak spot in the structure of  the Polish Army is the issue of constitutional division between  the powers of the civilian minister and the head of the General  Staff.    Participating in the meeting were also, among other persons,  Mieczyslaw Wachowski, minister of state in the President's  Office, and General Tadeusz Wilecki, head of the General Staff.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir Flees to Cyprus: Slap in the face for bail rules FROM THE moment of Mr Asil Nadir's arrest, the Serious Fraud Office always feared he would flee the UK to escape the prospect of a criminal trial and possible imprisonment. These concerns prompted the SFO to oppose bail being given to him - a highly unusual move in important cases of alleged fraud. The request for Mr Nadir to be held in custody while awaiting trial was turned down by the courts. But despite some of the most severe bail conditions ever imposed by a magistrates' court, the SFO's concerns have now proved to be well-founded. Mr Nadir's flight to northern Cyprus has exposed two large holes in the ability of the criminal justice system to bring fraud suspects to justice - the ease with which bail can be jumped and the problems of extradition back to the UK. With SFO cases usually taking two years between arrests being made and trials starting, courts have refused to countenance someone being imprisoned that long before trial. Instead, Bow Street magistrates' court set severe bail conditions. Sureties and securities totalling a record Pounds 3.5m were demanded, Mr Nadir's UK and Turkish passports were confiscated and he was ordered to report to the police weekly. The sureties were provided by Mrs Ayesha Nadir, Mr Nadir's ex-wife, who put up Pounds 500,000, and Mr Ramadan Guney, a Turkish businessman and distant relation of the Polly Peck chairman, who provided Pounds 1m. Mr Nadir himself had to provide a security - money lodged 'up front' with the courts  -of Pounds 2m. Mrs Nadir and Mr Guney are now both due to pay their sureties or risk jail sentences themselves. Mr Nadir has clearly written off his Pounds 2m as the price of escaping the British courts. With no extradition treaty between the UK and northern Cyprus, whose government is recognised only by Turkey, Mr Nadir is now at no risk of prosecution. He can also travel extensively in the developing world where many countries - notably Moslem nations - do not have extradition treaties with the UK. Mr Nadir is not the only fraud suspect to use the gaps in extradition arrangements to avoid prosecution. The investigation into the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International was hindered from the outset by the fact that the two most prominent protagonists, Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, the bank's founder, and Mr Swaleh Naqvi, his right-hand man, were living, safe from prosecution, in countries where no extradition treaties exist with the UK or the US. Mr Nadir's flight has left lawyers and police wondering how a similar situation can be avoided in future. All agree, however, that there are no simple and ready answers. Mr Nadir has demonstrated that the most severe of bail conditions can be no disincentive. The only alternative is to hold defendants in prison for up to two years. Until now, this has been regarded as unthinkable. But many lawyers have observed that the Maxwell affair has led to the courts making decisions that increasingly support the SFO. After Mr Nadir, the possibility that fraud suspects may spend considerable time behind bars before trial may not be so remote - if the SFO can bring cases to court more quickly.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / OFT to rule on bus and rail clash STAGECOACH Holdings, the only company to have run its own service on British Rail, is to seek a ruling from the Office of Fair Trading on whether it may run bus and rail services in the same area. Mr Brian Cox, managing director of Stagecoach's rail division, said yesterday that if the OFT did not give its approval some bus companies considering bids for franchises to run trains on the privatised British Rail network might withdraw. He said: 'We don't want to put a lot of effort into bidding for a franchise and then find it has been referred (to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission). We will take a test case to the OFT. If it doesn't come out in favour, several people will have to think again.' Stagecoach has expressed an interest in bidding for Scotrail and routes from London Waterloo to the West Country. The company ran overnight carriages, attached to a British Rail sleeper train, between London and Aberdeen for 18 months but pulled out after making losses. Mr Cox told a conference on rail privatisation that providing other bus operators were allowed to link their services to the rail network, there should be no objection to a bus operator also running trains. Stagecoach would object, however, to competing rail operators being granted 'open access' to routes for which it had won a franchise. He said that 'open access entrants simply cannot be allowed in at a marginal cost' to help Railtrack, the track owner and manager, meet its targets. 'This would cream off the profitable routes and the whole edifice would tumble.' Mr Cox called for clear franchise specifications between the train operators and Railtrack to keep interference from the franchising director and rail regulator to a minimum.</p>

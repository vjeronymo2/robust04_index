			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / CU plans expansion after return to profit COMMERCIAL Union, the composite (life and general) insurance company, yesterday announced that it is back in the black and said it is raising capital to pave the way for further expansion. Pre-tax profits for the nine months to September 30 were Pounds 6.1m, compared with a Pounds 42.4m deficit for the same period last year. The improvement in the third quarter was particularly strong, with pre-tax profits amounting to Pounds 19.6m. Mr Paul Found, group financial controller, said the results 'clearly confirmed an upward trend', while Mr Tony Brend, chief executive, said the recovery had been pronounced in the UK where pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 33.3m over the nine-month period, compared with a loss of Pounds 21.2m. The group is launching a Pounds 100m cumulative irredeemable preference share issue, the second time it has turned to the markets this year. The issue will allow CU to continue its expansion in life assurance, as well as write additional non-life business in order to take advantage of increasing premium rates. The preference shares, for which Hoare Govett and Cazenove are joint brokers, will pay a net dividend of 8.375 per cent. CU's last issue paid a net dividend of 8.75 per cent. CU, the UK insurer least affected by losses from mortgage indemnity business, has increased business at a steady pace. Non-life premium income increased to Pounds 2.46bn (Pounds 2.14bn), a rise of 12 per cent in underlying terms, while life premium income grew to Pounds 1.30bn (Pounds 945.5m) in the nine months. Premium income in the UK market rose 25.3 per cent to Pounds 1.10bn. Investment income amounted to Pounds 212.4m (Pounds 209.9m), after charging external loan interest of Pounds 35.1m (Pounds 37.6m) and the costs of non-insurance activities of Pounds 4.9m (Pounds 4.2m). Underwriting losses were cut to Pounds 302.3m (Pounds 338.1m), with UK losses down from Pounds 157.7m to Pounds 128.6m. Non-life operating losses of Pounds 75.9m (Pounds 123.1m), were offset by life profits of Pounds 82m (Pounds 80.7m). Earnings from associated undertakings amounted to Pounds 14m (Pounds 5.1m). Shareholders funds increased by Pounds 96m over the nine months to Pounds 1.3bn.</p>

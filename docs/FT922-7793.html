			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Jersey row sparks call for change THE ROW between Britain and Jersey caused by the home secretary's dismissal of one of the island's judges may lead to its assembly seeking some constitutional changes. Jersey's distinctive financial regime, however, and its status as an autonomous territory under the British Crown are not at stake in the dispute. Earlier this week Mr Kenneth Clarke dismissed Mr Vernon Tomes, Jersey's deputy bailiff, a post combining judicial functions with the deputy speakership of the states, Jersey's autonomous assembly. The reason for dismissal was inefficiency in delivering legal judgments. The decision angered many islanders, and Mr Tomes has announced his intention to stand for election to the states when elections are due in St Helier. Moves are also afoot to split the judicial from the political functions of the deputy bailiff's post, to restrict the scope for future interference from London in the island's political affairs. 'Feeling here is strong,' said Mr Pierre Horsfall, president of the states' finance and economics committee. 'But there is no question of instability - or of any threat to the island's political and economic systems from mainland Britain.' The Queen, on the advice of ministers, appoints judges and a lieutenant governor for the island. Beyond that, Jersey enjoys almost complete fiscal and legislative autonomy from the British mainland.</p>

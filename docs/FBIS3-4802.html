The loan to the National Bank of Slovakia is the first by  the  bank since the separation of the Czech and Slovak Federal  Republic in January 1993.    The loan will be extended under a Japanese program launched  in June 1993 designed to help developing countries, the bank  said.    The financing is also in line with a pledge made by the  Japanese Government in May 1992 to provide countries in central  and eastern Europe with up to 300 million dollars to promote  Japan-U.S. cooperation in these countries, it said.    The bank said the loan is intended to support development of  the private sector in Slovakia, particularly small and midsize  enterprises, in collaboration with a U.S. fund called the  American Enterprise Fund.    An untied loan does not require its recipient to use the  fund  for purchases of goods and services from the lender.</p>

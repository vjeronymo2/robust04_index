			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IRVIN HEEDS DICKERSON'S ADVICE AND SIGNS WITH LIONS;  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL: FORMER RAM CORNERBACK IS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT DETROIT'S CHANCES OF  WINNING.  </P> <P> Advice from good friend Eric Dickerson persuaded cornerback LeRoy Irvin to sign  a one-year contract with the Detroit Lions Thursday.  </P> <P> "I was talking with Eric (Wednesday) before I came in and he said, 'The Lions  are gonna win, the Lions are gonna win,' " Irvin said. "He was telling me that  a week ago."  </P> <P> Irvin said his desire to play for a winning team played a large role in his  decision to sign with the Lions. The former All-Pro was a member of eight  playoff teams in his 10 years with the Rams and played in the 1985 and 1989 NFC  Championship games.  </P> <P> The Rams did not protect Irvin, 32, who served a month-long league suspension  last season for drug abuse. He was passed over by other teams under the NFL's  Plan B free agency system before the Rams released him April 17.  </P> <P> Irvin said he worked out with San Francisco, Miami, Kansas City and Atlanta in  addition to his July 23 workout with the Lions. All but San Francisco offered  Irvin a contract, he said.  </P> <P> "I got tired of the traveling," Irvin said. "It was time to do something. When  I went to other teams, I kept telling my agent 'I want to come to Detroit, I  want to come to Detroit.'  </P> <P> "I talked to Coach (Wayne) Fontes before I left and he said he hoped I'd be  back. He's not like a normal coach. You can go up and talk with him."  </P> <P> Said Fontes: "To get a young man of LeRoy's caliber shows you the direction our  program is taking. He has tremendous experience. We want to build with young  players, but if you can get a player of Pro Bowl caliber to help your young  kids along you take him.  </P> <P> "People want to come here now."  </P> <P> Irvin was one of the NFL's premier defensive backs in 1985 and 1986 when he was  selected to the NFC Pro Bowl team.  </P> <P> But his career stalled last season when he was suspended. Irvin said he has  stayed clean since.  </P> <P> "I was wrong," Irvin said. "I made a mistake. All my life, I didn't want my  family to know about some of the things I'd done. I feel I've paid for it.  </P> <P> I don't foresee myself getting into trouble now. With the help of the good Lord  I'll make it.  </P> <P> Irvin, who has intercepted 34 passes in 143 games, ranks third on the Rams'  all-time list. He has returned five interceptions and four punts for  touchdowns. In 1989, Irvin had three interceptions.  </P></p>

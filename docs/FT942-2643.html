			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Mexico's Chiapas peace commissioner resigns Mr Manuel Camacho Solis, the Mexican government's peace commissioner in Chiapas, has resigned from his post and temporarily retired from politics, less than a week after Mayan Indian rebels in the southern Mexican state rejected a peace plan Mr Camacho had negotiated with them. Mr Camacho had been directing Mexico's efforts to find a peaceful end to a peasant uprising that broke out on January 1 in the impoverished state near the Guatemalan border. Mr Camacho launched a blistering attack on Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the candidate of his own ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) saying recent criticism Mr Zedillo had made of his peace efforts had hurt his ability to continue and damaged the peace process. 'At the very moment in which we had achieved ..a consolidated truce in Chiapas, a vote of censure has been expressed with regard to my work, and every resource has been used to broadcast it,' Mr Camacho said of Mr Zedillo's repeated statements that the peace negotiations had been a 'failure.' The rebels want to spur a democratic transition in the country, while the government is increasingly treating the conflict as a local one. Mr Salinas reiterated yesterday efforts to deal with the problem would now be handled by the Chiapas state government. Widely believed to harbour presidential ambitions ,Mr Camacho angrily resigned as mayor of Mexico City last November after being passed over by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in favour of the late Luis Donaldo Colosio as PRI presidential candidate in elections to be held in August. He recently joined a group of private intellectuals and politicians seeking to push for greater democracy and to promote stability after the elections expected to be the closest in recent Mexican history. Mr Camacho pledged not to participate in any political activities until Mr Salinas' presidential term ends in December. While this seems to end the possibility of an independent presidential candidacy an idea he has toyed with since being passed over some analysts believe he may still present himself as an interim consensus president if the existing candidates fail to win a healthy majority.</p>

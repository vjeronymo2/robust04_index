			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Words should not obstruct change Sir, So Michael Holman feels patronised by what he calls the language of medical correctness ('Save me from Health-speak', October 1). Perhaps he can appreciate something of how people with cerebral palsy feel when they are derided as spastic, a word which has become a term of abuse since The Spastics Society was founded in 1952. He may want to laugh when he hears we are changing our name to Scope, and wonders why we didn't choose the more descriptive 'Cerebral Palsy Society'. However, we should point out that the demand for change, and the new name, came not from public relations people, but from people with cp and their families. The trouble with very descriptive names is that they are also very limiting. We agree with Michael Holman that you cannot change reality merely by changing words. However, the word 'spastic' in our name stops people coming to us for support, particularly young families. We want to help change reality for disabled people and we do not want words to get in the way. Ms Ann Robinson, chief executive, The Spastics Society, 12 Park Crescent, London W1N 4EQ</p>

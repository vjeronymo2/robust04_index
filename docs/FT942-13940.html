			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Dark horse sets the pace: The carmaker's UK-born chairman It is less than six months since Mr Alex Trotman, an Englishman originally from Middlesex but raised in Scotland, became the first chairman of the world's second-largest carmaker to be born outside the US. As of yesterday, Mr Trotman, who will be 61 in July, will be remembered in the US for much more than his origins. He has set Ford on the road towards a radically new future faster than the latest Mustang which young Americans are falling over themselves to buy - and to whom Mr Trotman has become something of a hero for saving the Mustang from the chopping block of Ford's product planners. The imagery is apt. In terms of Ford's hierarchy, Mr Trotman himself might be described as the dark horse who became the favourite with almost bewildering speed. He surprised many in the European industry by becoming chairman of Ford of Europe in the mid-1980s. His unassuming manner and faintly diffident air - contrasting oddly with his clipped moustache and the outward appearance of a military man - gave few clues that he might be earmarked for the top. His performance at the opening of the New York motor show two weeks ago might have made him an almost unrecognisable figure to former European colleagues - poking fun at his own expense about past 'boring' speeches and handling the ranks of hard-bitten US media men like a music-hall professional. But Mr Trotman has earned his success the hard way in his 38 years with Ford. He started as a 'progress chaser' - expediting supplies - in the purchasing department at its Dagenham plant. He worked his way through jobs which other potential candidates for the top post - the urbane Mr Allan Gilmour, a vice-chairman who had spent most of his career in finance, for instance - might have found unenviable. 'My three years in purchasing was a boot camp,' Mr Trotman recalls. 'But I can think of no better place to learn the auto business. It was immediate and challenging and one of the toughest jobs I ever had. Often I'd wind up driving all night, with my old car filled with a thousand parts to get to the plant in time for start-up.' He joined Ford of Britain's newly created product planning group in 1959 at a time when 'most thought of product planning as a place where guys sat around sipping tea and reading magazines'. However, it was the first step down a career path which has led inexorably to the restructuring plan announced yesterday, which has new product programmes, and their costs and organisation, at its very core. Almost certainly, his product planning experience was the crucial factor in Mr Trotman pipping Mr Gilmour to the chairman's post. He became chief product analyst on project 'Archbishop' - to become the Cortina when it arrived in showrooms. The kudos accruing to Mr Trotman from one of Europe's most successful saloon cars subsequently carried him into the product planning chief's role for Ford of Europe. Since then he has become the only Ford executive to have run all three of its geographical sectors of operation - Asia-Pacific (in 1983-84), Europe (in 1984-89) and North America, where he was head of US operations before leapfrogging into the chairmanship. Most colleagues admire his no-nonsense approach to the business, although his scrapping of executive privileges, such as separate dining rooms, at first rankled with a few. Mr Trotman is happy to meet critics head on. 'I don't mind punch-ups,' he maintains, 'as long as they're out in the open. I won't tolerate cliques or intrigues.'</p>

			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : CITY COUNCIL ADOPTS $3.67-BILLION BUDGET  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council formally adopted a $3.67-billion budget Tuesday,  giving unanimous approval to a record spending blueprint that includes nearly  $60 million in new taxes and abandons plans for 403 new police officers.  </P> <P> The budget for fiscal year 1990-91, which takes effect July 1, emerged from a  series of council revisions and a formal review by the mayor with relatively  few confrontations.  </P> <P> Bradley had sought to increase the size of the Police Department to a record  8,717 people, but he acceded to requests from the council and Police Chief  Daryl F. Gates to forgo that plan and use the money for overtime.  </P> <P> The only Bradley veto of council changes involved a technical item on funding  for a proposed Fire Department program to have specially trained firefighters  rather than paramedics handle routine medical dispatches.  </P></p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Wolseley tops forecasts with Pounds 121m THE SHARE price of Wolseley rose 18p to 692p yesterday as the rapidly expanding building materials group again confounded forecasters with higher than expected profits for the year to July 31. Pre-tax profits rose by a third from Pounds 91.3m to Pounds 121.1m. Analysts had pencilled in a figure between Pounds 110m and Pounds 115m. Mr Jeremy Lancaster, chairman and managing director, said recession had eased on the US east coast and, more recently, in the UK. The latest figures included 'surprisingly encouraging first-time results' from Enertech, the Swedish oil and gas burner manufacturer acquired for Pounds 45m in April, which made a trading contribution of Pounds 2.6m. Other acquisitions made during the year contributed Pounds 1.1m. A currency benefit added Pounds 5.5m, up from Pounds 700,000. The group had also reduced costs, although Mr Lancaster gave no details. 'We have run this business lean and mean for 30 years, and we just run it lean and mean all the time,' he said. Turnover increased by 27 per cent from Pounds 1.95bn to Pounds 2.5bn, including Pounds 69.4m from acquisitions. Of the total, Pounds 1bn derived from building distribution in Europe; Pounds 1.2bn from building distribution in the US and Pounds 278.5m from European manufacturing and other activities. Mr Lancaster described the UK recovery as 'patchy'. Sales of building materials had been reviving slowly, although there was no sign of an upturn on the manufacturing side. Hire businesses, however, had returned to profitability. Brossette, the French plumbing supplier acquired in February last year, contributed Pounds 21m to profits on turnover of Pounds 433m. Mr Lancaster said it had demonstrated aggressive marketing and tight cost controls. The worst of the French recession was thought to be past. In the US, Carolina Builders was the star performer, with a 25 per cent rise in sales and doubled profits. California remained the black spot. Year-end net debt amounted to Pounds 62.2m, gearing of 14.7 per cent, excluding construction loan borrowing. However, the group said it now had about Pounds 10m cash, helped by a vendor placing in August when it acquired Erb Lumber for Pounds 51m, making it the largest US building materials distributor. In addition to raising the funds for the acquisition, Wolseley placed 8.7m shares raising Pounds 55m. Mr Lancaster said the group planned a further acquisition. He would not give details, but was hoping talks would be concluded in the New Year. Earnings per share rose from 26.27p to 33.6p. A final dividend of 9.75p, against 9.45p, is proposed, taking the total for the year to 13.3p, up from 12.55p. Lex, Page 20</p>

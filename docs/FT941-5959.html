			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Clinton steps up trade pressure on Japan President Bill Clinton last night signed an executive order resurrecting the Super 301 provision of US trade law, which allows him to impose trade sanctions on Japan. Mr Clinton telephoned Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japanese prime minister, to warn him of the move, which will intensify pressure on Japan to open its markets to imports. The president, who has sought to bolster Mr Hosokawa's reform efforts while putting him under pressure on trade, described the phone call as a 'friendly, forthright discussion'. The renewal of Super 301, which has been under consideration since the failed Clinton-Hosokawa summit last month, requires the administration to list countries it considers to have unfair trade practices, and establishes a formal negotiating process of 12 to 18 months that may end in sanctions. The US administration had sought to establish 'quantitative and qualitative indicators' to measure Japan's progress in opening its markets. Mr Hosokawa refused to agree to those, fearing such indicators would become commitments, which might result in trade sanctions if the targets were not met. In a speech for delivery in New York ahead of the expected announcement yesterday, Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, criticised US trade policy towards Japan as 'misguided and dangerous', accusing Washington of putting the multilateral trading system at risk. Mr Sutherland said that when any country stresses the bilateral approach rather than 'the principles of the multilateral system, it runs the risk of weakening that system and the improvements in it that have been so painstakingly negotiated'. Japanese leaders warned of the dangers they saw in invoking the Super 301 provision. Mr Hideaki Kumano, vice-minister of international trade and industry, said: 'Such a unilateral approach to solving trade disputes will result in a shrinkage of world trade,' adding that 'from the viewpoint of Gatt rules, a revival could be problematic'. Japan has said it might lodge a complaint with Gatt. Mr Hosokawa pledged that his government would now concentrate on the trade dispute and the ailing domestic economy. A wrangle within his seven-party coalition over ministerial positions has eroded Mr Hosokawa's authority. Although disagreements were set aside this week when he agreed to postpone a cabinet reshuffle, the aftermath of the row bodes ill for any solution to the Japan-US dispute, because it marks a reduction in the influence of Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the government's backroom strategist, who had sought the shake-up. Mr Ozawa was playing an increasingly important behind-the-scenes diplomatic role in seeking a compromise with Washington. Only last week he proposed Japan should adopt 'non-binding indicators' for reducing its current-account surplus, as a concession to US demands for numerically measured reductions.</p>

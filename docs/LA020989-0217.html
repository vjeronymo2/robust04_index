			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> YMCA GETS NON-CHARITABLE RULING  </P> <P> A YMCA should pay taxes because the doctors, lawyers and others who use the  facility are not legitimate subjects of charity, a judge ruled.  </P> <P> Allegheny County Judge Ralph Smith Jr. ruled Wednesday that the $7.5-million  downtown YMCA does not meet the state's legal definition of a charity and is  not entitled to a tax exemption as a charitable institution.  </P> <P> The ruling could require it to pay more than $200,000 in property taxes a year.  </P> <P> The YMCA said it will appeal.  </P> <P> The YMCA does not have to serve the poor exclusively to be tax-exempt, said Bob  Boisture, associate general counsel for the national YMCA in Washington.  </P> <P> Boisture said the Pittsburgh case isn't viewed as a "major trend-setting case  around the country."  </P> <P> "It's only one case," he said. But he added, "We're not going to lie down and  play dead when we get a ruling that says a Y is taxable. We're going to appeal  that and also go to the Legislature."  </P></p>

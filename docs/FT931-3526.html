			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM firm on summer target for Maastricht MR JOHN MAJOR is sticking to his target of ratification of the Maastricht treaty by the end of July in spite of last week's defeat in the Commons. Amid signs yesterday that some 'soft' Tory Euro-sceptics were reconsidering their opposition to the government, senior ministers said that the proposed timetable for the legislation still allowed for ratification before the summer recess. The prime minister has told close associates he is determined that, if possible, Maastricht should not be allowed to wreck October's Conservative party conference for the second year in succession. To avoid a damaging confrontation similar to that last year the bill would have to pass all the remaining hurdles - including the House of Lords - before the summer recess begins at the end of July. The ministers acknowledged that the government still faced possible defeat on a number of opposition amendments. There remains a risk also that the legislation will be derailed if opposition parties are successful in pressing new amendments to remove Britain's opt-out from the social chapter. But barring a dramatic setback on the social chapter, the plans now pencilled in by the government assume that the present committee stage of the legislation will be completed before the second Danish referendum on May 18. That timetable is based on the fact that six groups of amendments have still to be discussed in the committee stage. Each of those could be expected to take one or at most two days in the Commons. With two days a week allocated to the legislation, that implies a further five or six weeks in committee. Allowing for intervals necessitated by the Budget debate this week and for a two-week Easter recess, the committee stage would then be wound up in mid-May. Ministers are increasingly optimistic that the report stage for the legislation - necessitated by the passage of opposition amendments - will be relatively short. That would provide for the concluding third reading debate by MPs to take place at the end of May or early in June. That in turn would give the House of Lords at least a month to debate the treaty. The government acknowledges that a hard core of between 30 and 40 Tories will continue to harry the legislation at every opportunity. But an announcement yesterday by Mr George Walden, the former minister, that he would drop his opposition was seen as a signal that some Tory MPs who have previously abstained are now willing to support the bill.</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERNST &amp; YOUNG MAY ESCAPE MAJOR DAMAGE  </P> <P> The move by California officials to seek a revocation of the accounting license  of Ernst &amp; Young may further tarnish the firm's reputation but is unlikely  to result in major damage to the firm's operations in the long run, industry  officials said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The staff of the state Board of Accountancy has recommended that the board  revoke or suspend Ernst &amp; Young's license to do business in California  because of "gross negligence" in audits of Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp;  Loan and its parent firm, American Continental Corp. of Phoenix.  </P> <P> But the state agency, which regulates the accounting industry, has never taken  such strong action against a major firm.  </P> <P> "Historically, that sort of Draconian penalty has not been imposed, and I would  be very surprised for it to be imposed in this situation," said John C. Burton,  an accounting professor at Columbia University's Graduate School of Business.  </P> <P> Karen J. Scott, the interim managing officer for the state board, filed the  administrative action against Ernst &amp; Young on Nov. 16. The accusations,  which Ernst &amp; Young denies, set into motion a hearing procedure before an  administrative law judge.  </P> <P> While the staff recommends the revocation or suspension of Ernst &amp; Young's  license, the hearing could also result in a reprimand, probation or no action  at all.  </P> <P> Officials charge in the administrative action that Ernst &amp; Young was  "grossly negligent" by failing to follow proper accounting procedures in audits  of the 1987 financial statements of Lincoln and its parent firm, American  Continental Corp. in Phoenix.  </P> <P> "The firm stands behind its work," said Mort Meyerson, a spokesman for Ernst  &amp; Young. "All standards were followed."  </P></p>

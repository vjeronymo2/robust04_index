			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff is continuing to work with the EPA and the DOE in the development of coordinated Federal Agency guidance on site surveys. The Commission anticipates endorsing such guidance for use in demonstrating compliance with the requirements of this rulemaking when it becomes available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Agreement State Compatibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission currently is developing a new policy on Agreement State compatibility which will be issued for public comment in the near future. The compatibility determination for the radiological criteria for decommissioning will be considered in regard to the implementation of the new compatibility policy. Therefore, the Commission believes that it would be premature to make a proposed compatibility determination on the radiological criteria for decommissioning at this time. However, for the purpose of facilitating the ultimate resolution of the compatibility determination for the radiological criteria for decommissioning, the Commission welcomes any comments on this issue. In particular, the Commission invites comments on to what extent and under what circumstances should an Agreement State be authorized to establish more stringent requirements than those set forth in NRC radiological criteria for decommissioning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Draft Generic Environmental Impact Statement: Availability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in Subpart A of 10 CFR Part 51, the NRC has prepared a draft generic environmental impact statement (NUREG&hyph;1496) on this proposed rule. For informational purposes and ease of distribution, Appendix A of the draft generic environmental impact statement has been published as a separate report, ``Background as a Residual Radioactivity Criterion for Decommissioning: Appendix A of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement in Support of Radiological Criteria for Rulemaking on Decommissioning'' NUREG&hyph;1501.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The draft generic environmental impact statement is available for inspection in the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the draft generic environmental impact statement (NUREG&hyph;1496) or Appendix A of the draft generic environmental impact statement (NUREG&hyph;1501) may be obtained by written request or telefax  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (301&hyph;504&hyph;2260) from: Distribution Services, Printing and Mail Services Branch, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background documents on the rulemaking, including the text of the proposed rule, the Draft GEIS, Appendix A of the Draft GEIS, the Regulatory Analysis, and the staff's working draft Regulatory Guide are also available for downloading and viewing on the NRC Enhanced Participatory Rulemaking on Radiological Criteria for Decommissioning Electronic Bulletin Board, 1&hyph;800&hyph;880&hyph;6091. (See 58 FR 37760 (July 13, 1993)). The bulletin board may be accessed using a personal computer, a modem, and most commonly available communications software packages. The communications software should have parity set to none, data bits to 8, and stop bits to 1 (N,8,1) and use ANSI or VT&hyph;100 terminal emulation.

This rule has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review and approval of the information collection requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 31.6 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.

The analysis examines the costs and benefits of the alternatives considered by the Commission. The draft analysis is available for inspection in the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the analysis may be obtained by written request from RPHEB Secretary, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background documents on the rulemaking, including the text of the proposed rule, the Draft GEIS, Appendix A of the Draft GEIS, the Regulatory Analysis, and the NRC staff working draft Regulatory Guide are also available for downloading and viewing on the NRC Enhanced Participatory Rulemaking on Radiological Criteria for Decommissioning Electronic Bulletin Board, 1&hyph;800&hyph;880&hyph;6091.

Although the proposed rule would cover all 22,000 licensees regulated by the NRC and Agreement States, small entities covered by this rule are primarily licensees that possess and use only materials with short half-lives or materials only in sealed sources. Decommissioning efforts for these licensees are simple and require only that sealed sources are properly disposed of or that short-lived materials are allowed to decay. Complete details of the cost analysis are contained in Section 4.5 of the Regulatory Analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although there is no indication that this proposed rule would significantly impact a substantial number of small entities, the NRC is seeking comments from small entities that may be impacted by the rule. Any small entity subject to this regulation which determines that, because of its size, it is likely to bear a disproportionate adverse economic impact should notify the Commission of this in a comment that indicates the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The licensee's size and how the proposed regulation would result in a significant economic burden upon the licensee as compared to the economic burden on a larger licensee;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) How the proposed regulations could be modified to take into account the licensee's differing needs or capabilities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The benefits that would accrue, or the detriments that would be avoided, if the proposed regulations were modified as suggested by the licensee;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) How the proposed regulation, as modified, would more closely equalize the impact of NRC regulations or create more equal access to the benefits of Federal programs as opposed to providing special advantages to any individual or group; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) How the proposed regulation, as modified, would still adequately protect public health and safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Backfit Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this proposed rule and therefore, that a backfit analysis is not required for this proposed rule because these amendments do not involve any provisions which would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

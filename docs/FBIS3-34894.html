			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Alain Juppe today ended his tour in the Middle East.  Juppe toured the Gaza Strip under a very hot sun today. He  visited Palestinian camps where living conditions shocked him.    [Begin Juppe recording] When one walks through these camps,  such as the Shati camp, when one sees this school, one realises  how much should be done. The living conditions in these camps  are not as required by human dignity. We should change them if  we want the population to believe in the peace process now under  way. There is some kind of race against time at the moment.  France has for so many years been present and helping in the  occupied territories. We have decided in 1994 to intensify this  aid. However, the mobilization of the entire international  community is needed.    I hope that what was announced in Washington a few months  ago  will be implemented in the field. I have repeatedly stated  France's message regarding the right of the Palestinians to  their land and self-determination, as well as dialogue. We  should help all those who are involved in this peace process and  believe in it. From my talks here I have gathered that things  will of course be difficult, but there is no other way. This  [peace process] is irreversible and we have to go forward. [end  recording]</p>

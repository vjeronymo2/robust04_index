			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Change in urban policy signalled MR MICHAEL HESELTINE, the environment secretary, is considering setting up an urban development corporation in Birmingham. Such a move would mark a further shift in the government's urban regeneration policy. The 11 existing urban development corporations, which are given funds to stimulate local economic revival independent of local authority control, have been told to prepare for their own demise. During the 1980s the corporations were the government's main tool for promoting the regeneration of rundown urban areas. Latterly the government has focused regeneration efforts on City Challenge, with local authorities drawing up development schemes and competing for central funds. The new corporation would be in an area of 2,350 acres on the east of the city close to Spaghetti Junction known as Birmingham Heartlands, whose City Challenge bid last year failed. Birmingham Heartlands is the name given to an urban development partnership, active in the area since 1987, which is 65 per cent owned by five construction groups - Bryant, RM Douglas, Galliford, Tarmac and Wimpey - and 35 per cent by Birmingham City Council. The initiative for setting up an urban development corporation appears to have come from the council. The Department of the Environment said there had been talks between Mr Heseltine, Sir Richard Knowles, council leader, and Sir Reginald Eyre, chairman of Birmingham Heartlands.</p>

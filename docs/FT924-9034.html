			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Spring Ram Slicing 27 per cent off a company's share price in response to an exceptional item of less than 15 per cent of last year's profits may seem excessive. But then the disclosure of irregularities at Spring Ram's Balterley Bathrooms subsidiary could have been better handled. The seemingly casual revelation that the company knew about the problem before publishing last year's figures, yet did not draw shareholders' attention to it, hardly reassures. Nor does the fact that when the hole proved larger than expected, the management still kept mum. Spring Ram is also a decentralised company, so fears of inadequate management information and control have to be added to the disclosure lapse. As a growth company with a premium rating, it can ill-afford to treat shareholders in a cavalier way. Even if there are no other skeletons in the cupboard, suspicions will take a long time to disperse. There are concerns about the company's meteoric rate of expansion. Last year stocks and work in progress grew by 72 per cent while sales rose only 34 per cent. The management's view that this would allow the company to supply an improving market must now be being tested. If the extra sales do not materialise, stocks will rise further or this year's profits will be cut. Then there is Spring Ram's gentle depreciation policy. There may well be nothing seriously wrong. But investors have been burnt by too many falling stars of late to take that on trust.</p>

			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGER OVER ECONOMY CARRIES PERONIST TO LANDSLIDE VICTORY IN ARGENTINE RACE  </P> <P> Carlos Saul Menem, a flamboyant populist promising a "productive revolution,"  won the Argentine presidency in a landslide Sunday on the strength of public  anger over the nation's worst economic crisis in nearly a century.  </P> <P> The 58-year-old Menem trounced Eduardo Cesar Angeloz of President Raul  Alfonsin's ruling Radical party by a margin of about 49% to 38%, according to  unofficial results of three-fourths of the ballots.  </P> <P> Angeloz, governor of Cordoba province, lost in nearly every district of the  country and was fighting even to win his own province.  </P> <P> In capturing the presidency for the Peronist party for the first time since  1973, Menem successfully muted lingering fears of Peronism and turned the  campaign into a vote on Alfonsin's economic failings -- inflation is surging at  an annual rate of 3,000%, the Argentine currency has plummeted and workers'  buying power has disintegrated.  </P> <P> Turnout was about 85% of the 20 million eligible voters. Partial returns had  Menem ahead with 6.1 million votes, compared to 4.7 million for Angeloz. The  conservative Center Alliance of Alvaro Alsogaray had 7% of the vote -- less  than expected -- with the rest split among minor candidates.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Will Control Legislature  </P> <P> The Peronists, who already control the Senate, also apparently won a majority  in the lower house of Congress, giving Menem a friendly legislature for his  plan to achieve a vaguely defined "productive revolution" -- raising salaries,  reactivating industry, reducing a huge deficit and tackling inflation.  </P> <P> The vote was regarded as a crucial step in the consolidation of democratic rule  in Argentina, where six coups have broken the constitutional order since 1930.  When Alfonsin's successor takes office in December, it will be the first  genuinely democratic transition of power from one elected president to another  in 61 years.  </P> <P> "Today all Argentines were the winners," said Alfonsin, whose election in 1983  ended a brutal seven-year military dictatorship and formed part of a trend  toward restored civilian rule across the continent.  </P> <P> Thousands of Peronists poured into the streets of the capital to celebrate in a  steady rain, pounding drums and chanting odes to Juan D. Peron, who founded the  party in the mid-1940s.  </P> <P> Menem was virtually assured of a clear-cut electoral college majority, thus  avoiding months of potentially bitter maneuvering for support before the  electors' meeting on Aug. 10 to choose the winner.  </P> <P> From his home in the small province of La Rioja, where he serves as governor,  Menem said, "I've defeated an adversary, but I've regained a friend."  </P> <P> Angeloz called Menem to concede defeat and congratulate him.  </P> <P> Menem said: "I have faith and hope that things are going to start to go better  in this country."  </P> <P> He quoted Juan Peron, saying, "To govern is to give work," and added: "Here  there will be no possibility of speculation, of usury. Let's end this Argentina  where those who do nothing live well and those who work every day of the year  live badly."  </P> <P> The constitution barred Alfonsin from seeking reelection. Despite widespread  approval of the entrenchment of civil liberties during his six-year term,  public disaffection is widespread over his economic failures. One of the  world's 10 wealthiest countries in the 1930, Argentina has lately fallen  further into the ranks of the Third World, with its foreign debt soaring to  nearly $60 billion.  </P> <P> The voting proceeded smoothly, with no complaints of irregularities. Argentine  elections are regarded as among the fairest in Latin America, with observers  from all parties overseeing every step of the process.  </P> <P> Menem, who spent five years in jail during the last dictatorship, said after  casting his ballot: "The important thing is that the Argentine people can  exercise the fundamental right to choose."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Working-Class Base  </P> <P> The son of Syrian immigrants who converted from Islam to Catholicism, Menem  galvanized the working-class base of the Peronist party, a social movement that  defies ideological labels. An amateur race car driver and pilot who is often  photographed with starlets, Menem avoided specifics on how he would right the  foundering economy or on how far he would go in dismantling the state  domination of the economy begun by Peron.  </P> <P> Menem emphasized the "renovation" of the Peronist party, formally known as the  Justicialist Party, since the days when Peron dictated every decision. Menem  helped engineer internal party reforms, including an open primary that he won  in an upset last July, which he said ended the party's authoritarian  traditions.  </P> <P> With a sonorous voice and bushy sideburns reminiscent of 19th-Century  provincial political bosses, Menem enthralled rallies with his appeal to  "Follow me! To end the hunger of the poor children, and the sadness of the rich  children! I will not defraud you!"  </P> <P> Still, uncertainty over Menem's intentions and memories of the Peronists'  combative past combined to kept the number of undecided voters relatively high.  </P> <P> Peron ruled from 1946-55 with the help of his charismatic second wife, Eva  (Evita) Peron, until he fell in a coup. He returned to office in 1973 and, upon  his death less than a year later, was succeeded by his third wife and vice  president, Maria Estela Peron. She was ousted in 1976 at a time of  hyper-inflation, strikes and left-wing violence.  </P> <P> Angeloz, who promised to privatize deficit-ridden state-run enterprises and to  modernize the economy, sought to portray Menem as a throwback to past Peronist  reliance on the state to solve the nation's ills.  </P> <P> The 57-year-old governor, a gruff-voiced career politician regarded as a  capable if dour administrator, was nearly as critical of Radical party policies  as he was of Peronism.  </P> <P> Alfonsin constantly faced conflict with the military over human rights abuses  during the previous regime, and he suffered through three military rebellions  in the past two years and a leftist guerrilla attack against a military base in  January. Many analysts expect some sort of military amnesty in the months or  years ahead to ease tensions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Memory of Perons  </P> <P> The memory of Juan and Evita Peron was more than a sentimental factor for many  voters. In the Villa Urquiza neighborhood of the capital, 74-year-old Juana  Bottini de Rossini pointed to a graffiti-stained stone pedestal in a park  across from the voting station and said, "That was a bust of Evita until they  pulled it down after the 1955 coup.  </P> <P> "This barrio was founded by Peron, it was called Barrio Peron, and Evita  designed this park. They provided houses for the poor. If Peron had stayed in  power, there would be none of the slums that we have in Buenos Aires now."  </P> <P> She said Peron had given the workers free vacations, social benefits and  pensions.  </P> <P> "Now Menem is going to do the same for us," she said.  </P></p>

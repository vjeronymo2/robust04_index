This region, while  being important from a strategic military standpoint, has rich  natural resources; arable lands; and an efficient, creative, and  active work force. China is one of the most important countries  in this region of the world. It is growing at an increasing rate  and developing in military and economic areas with astonishing  economic dynamism and moving towards becoming another world  power. This situation, alongside such important economic centers  as Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, has caused the  center of economic and strategic gravity in the world to shift  to the Pacific Ocean area.    Concerning the importance of this region, 100 years ago, the  secretary of state at the time had said: "Even though trade and  political affairs are expanding in Europe, it will gradually  become less important; on the other hand, the Pacific Ocean will  become the arena of major world events in the future." Ronald  Reagan, the former U.S. president, also said in 1984 in  connection with the extraordinary importance of Asia and the  Pacific Ocean region: "I look at the Pacific Ocean as the future  of the world."    Because of the above-mentioned factors, the attention of the  West and the United States has been focused on Asia and the  Pacific Ocean more than ever before. For this reason, in 1989, a  treaty called the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC], was  signed between the United States, Europe, and the economically  powerful countries of Asia and the Pacific Ocean region and now  has 17 members.    In the last meeting of this economic treaty, which was held  in Azar [22 November-21 December] this year in Seattle, in the  United States, it became clear that this region has continued to  receive the attention of the West, and the leaders of those  countries hope to expand their presence in that region. In this  connection, U.S. President Bill Clinton stated in that meeting  that the Asia and Pacific Ocean region will have a central role  in U.S. foreign policy. He also pointed out that the Asia and  Pacific Ocean region will be the most important political,  economic, and military pole in the world.    In the opinion of political experts, the above statements  show that the United States is determined to pursue an active  diplomacy in that region.    In order to attract the attention of Chinese officials,  prior to the meeting with the government officials of that  country, the U.S. President ordered the sale to China of a very  advanced super computer.  <H5>  U.S. Reasons for Presence in Asia </H5>   A) The U.S. economy, like the economies of European  countries, is facing a great crisis. Economic experts have  projected that U.S. economic growth this year and next will  decrease by 2.7 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively, and hence  result in a wave of bankruptcy for many U.S. companies. On the  other hand, the Pacific Ocean region, with a population of 2  billion people, has the most rapid economic growth in the world  and is considered a great market for American and European  products. Hence, the increase in the U.S. economic and  commercial presence in the region can change the market in that  country and attract the work force in various economic sectors  of the United States.    B) With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the end of  the cold war, and the world moving toward a multipolar system,  as the world military superpower and one of the important  economic centers of the world, the United States is trying to  stop the establishment of such world powers as the former Soviet  Union, so that, so it reasons, it will become the only world  power. Hence, under the circumstances of countries such as  Japan, China, and Russia moving toward becoming world powers, in  which case the Asia and Pacific Ocean region will become the  center of gravity for world powers, in order to prevent the  transfer of the center of power from the Atlantic Ocean to the  Pacific Ocean, the United States is making an effort to shape  the security and economic structure of the region before these  countries become pivotal centers.    C) Since the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and  especially the removal of the Berlin Wall and the reunification  of West and East Germany, Europe is moving towards unification  and becoming a powerful, united complex. Hence, the success of  the Maastricht Treaty in the future will lead the Europeans  towards a closed economic complex day by day, in which case, an  end will be put to the presence of the United States. Under such  circumstances, the most favorable position for the United States  is to transfer its center of trade from Europe to Asia and the  Pacific Ocean region. Another benefit of such a policy is that  it will allow U.S. leaders to increase pressure on the European  Community several times through the APEC treaty and in this way  achieve its wishes in the GATT (tariff and trade agreement),  which was ratified last month by the representatives of more  than 100 countries.  <H5>  Special Attention of the United States to China </H5>   China, as one of the powerful countries in Asia and the  Pacific Ocean, is of special importance. Hence, the United  States, alongside its efforts to make its presence felt in the  region, pays special attention to the most populated country in  the world and in its future political and economic relations  will allocate a special position for China.    In the opinion of political analysts, after the end of the  cold war, the relations between the United States and China  entered a new phase, which, in contrast to the past, has become  more important at the international level. Previously, the  Chinese tried to take advantage of the existing rivalry between  the United States and the former Soviet Union and by  establishing positive equilibrium between Washington and Moscow  obtain maximum concessions from both sides. But after the  disintegration of the Soviet Union and the final failure of  international communism, as the leaders of new socialism, the  Chinese, by continuing the process of reforms that they had  started in 1976 after the death of Mao, established new  relations with the United States and other Western countries.    Economically, the Chinese combined socialist ideology with  the free-market economic system, which they call a socialist  economic system based on the open market. Even though the nature  of such a system is not clear to U.S. officials, because China  has veto power in the UN Security Council, in order to have  their proposed resolutions, which are mostly to cover up their  meddling policies, ratified in the Security Council, the United  States needs the vote of the Chinese Government in this council.    On the other hand, the economic growth of China in recent  years has been significant, and this has been important for  Western governments, especially the United States, that in the  early years of the 1990's have faced economic recession. For  this reason, Americans try to temporarily forget the issue of  human rights, which in the past four years has been the main  center of anti-Chinese propaganda for the Americans, in order to  prepare the grounds for expanding relations. To this end, the  U.S. president, a little before meeting with the government  officials of that country, in order to appeal to Chinese  officials, issued instructions to sell a very advanced super  computer to China.    For the Chinese, who hoped to be a center of power in East  Asia after the end of the cold war, access to advanced  technology and attracting investments by large Western companies  are important. For this reason, the Beijing government, on the  one hand, tries to show itself as the defender of Third World  countries in its relations with them and, on the other hand, due  to the need for Western technology and investments by  multinational companies in China, weighs political  considerations in relation with these countries and even in some  instances gives concessions. For example, the Chinese positive  votes for the proposed U.S. resolution concerning Somalia, Iraq,  Bosnia, Haiti, and the like, are precisely evaluated in the  framework of such an objective.  <H5>  U.S. Obstacles and Problems </H5>   Even though all existing evidence and signs indicate the  completion of American multilateral political and economic  policies in the region in question, attention to hindering  factors, which exist in this area, does not provide a clear  perspective for the economic and political experts of the West.  The most important of these factors are:    A) While the grounds for full cooperation and coordination  between Beijing and Washington have been completely prepared, a  sort of new rivalry is forming between the two countries. As one  of the most powerful countries in Asia, China, even though it  needs the West and the United States in numerous areas, is not  prepared to become an instrument for the United States to become  the sole world power with regard to its economic needs and at  the same time considers itself the economic, political, and  military rival of the United States.    B) The significant economic growth of the countries in the  region has freed them from dependence on Western countries. In  fact, the interest of those countries in more economic  development in cooperation with the United States and Europe is  evaluated. Hence, as soon as countries such as China and Japan  face the oppressive actions of the United States, they are  capable of returning to cold political relations.    C) The growth of nationalism and political development in  the  countries in the region will also confront the United States  with problems in continuing its presence and the interference by  Washington in the internal affairs of those countries. Even  though countries located in Asia and the Pacific Ocean region  have achieved significant economic advancement, this situation  has not hindered change in the view of the Americans as regards  the people of Eastern countries being inferior, and they  continue to look down on the people of the East.    D) America's failure to understand the cultural and social  issues of the countries in the region is another problem facing  the United States in expanding its influence in the Pacific  Ocean region.    Even though countries such as Japan and China began to move  toward corruption and debauchery years ago and now face many  problems in the area of the moral decline of their youth, the  people of these countries believe in a set of cultural and  traditional principles, and this has created a duality regarding  the presence of U.S. forces, which makes the continuation of  their establishment in the region problematic.</p>

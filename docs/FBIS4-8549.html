			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Albania Asks the UN Security Council To Condemn Greece" -- </F> ATA headline]    [Text] Tirana, April 14, (ATA) -- Albania asked the UN  Security Council [UNSC] to condemn Greece for the Sunday attack  by "Greek terroristic commandos" against a military training  centre of the Albanian Army in the Peshkepi village, near the  border with Greece. As is known, an Albanian officer and one  soldier were killed.    In a letter to the president of the UN Security Council, Mr.  Colin Keating, on Tuesday, the Albanian foreign minister, Alfred  Serreqi pointed out that the incident is "a grave terroristic  act," "A massacre of the people while they were sleeping," and  "a serious violation of the territorial integrity and  sovereignty of Albania with clear and premeditated aims." This  act aims not only at deteriorating the present relations between  the two countries but also to the aggravation of the situation  in the Balkans, the letter says. It is part of a coordinate  strategy, in order to create premises for the expansion of the  conflict in the south of the Balkans."    The Government of the Republic of Albania asks the Security  Council to denounce powerfully the Greek Government and to rank  Greece among the countries that exercise state terror, and to  make pressure on the Government of Greece, demanding it to throw  light on this grave incident, to find out and punish the authors  of the crime.    On wednesday, the Albanian Foreign Ministry declared  "persona  non grata" the Greek general consul in Gjirokaster "because of  his activity not in accordance with his status." In revenge for  this act, the Greek Government adopted the same measure against  the first secretary ofthe Albanian Embassy in Athens, Kastriot  Robo.</p>

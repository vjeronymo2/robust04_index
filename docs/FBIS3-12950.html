			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Washington Is Behind the Obstruction of </F> Negotiations"]    [Text] The U.S. Administration, which is called the  sponsor of the peace process, should have responsibly taken the  initiative to have the Security Council issue a strong  resolution to curb Zionist persistence in launching mass  killings, committing hideous crimes, carrying out bloody  massacres against Arab citizens, and violating their places of  worship in the occupied territories. Instead, the U.S.  Administration has done its best to prevent the issuance of any  deterrent international resolution which would end the crimes  committed by Jews.    While several Security Council members, including Britain,  France, and Russia, believe in the need to pass a resolution  that provides protection for the Palestinian people under  Israeli occupation, for dispatching an international protection  force to the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and for  disarming the Jewish settlers, the U.S. Administration is trying  to foil this approach and prevent the issuance of any resolution  in this regard.    Moreover, the U.S. Administration is working to contain the  strained Arab-Israeli negotiations and deflate angry  Palestinian, Arab, and international reactions by inviting a  Palestinian delegation to Washington and trying to convince it  of the need to unconditionally resume negotiations with Israel  and to stop demanding the issuance of an international  resolution against Israel.    Negotiations between the U.S. Administration and the  Palestinian side are still continuing without results. What  draws attention is the fact that this U.S. role, which  encourages Israel and its terrorist policy, has also encouraged  Israeli authorities to continue their hideous crimes against  Arab citizens. Several martyrs and a many wounded fall every  day. Israeli authorities deliberately prevent Muslims from  performing prayers at the blessed al-Aqsa Mosque and other  places of worship, which paralyzes and obstructs the peace  process.    If the U.S. Administration insists on encouraging Israel to  adhere to the arming of settlers and rejecting the dispatch of  an international protection force to the occupied Palestinian  territories, then it will have contributed to the obstruction of  the peace process.    It makes no sense to resume the Palestinian-Israeli and  Arab-Israeli negotiations while the campaign of mass killings is  escalating against the Palestinian people. It can be said that  if the U.S. Administration actually wants to resume the peace  process and achieve peace, it should stop encouraging Israel and  end its full bias toward Israel. This administration should  also participate in passing an international resolution to  ensure protection for the Palestinian people in the occupied  territories.</p>

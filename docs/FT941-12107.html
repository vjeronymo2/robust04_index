			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / The BMW/Rover Deal: A quick route into new market segments - BMW Attacks and the cheapest - to fulfil its long-term aim of expanding its core car business into new market segments. As Mr Volker Doppelfeld, finance director, explained yesterday in Munich, the long route would be to move step by step from its upmarket saloon-based range. In the event, the Pounds 800m bill for Rover is the amount the German carmaker would normally spend on developing a single new model. Included in the price, he added, were 17 brands, including the Land-Rover, Range Rover, and derivatives which came equipped with 'the most interesting, the best, and the longest heritage in off-the-road vehicles'. 'It was our aim for a long time to move into new business segments and new markets. This agreement paves the way for the next 20 or 30 years of BMW's development,' Mr Doppelfeld said. The way to the Rover takeover was prepared when the company took a hard look at itself and its markets two years ago. That was when management saw - through the fog of recession - that it was losing the battle in the US. BMW sales had tumbled, and although no-one was having an easy time in the world's biggest and most competitive market, the Japanese were gaining share. As others, notably Mr Ferdinand Piech (e umlaut), head of Volkswagen, have since agreed, BMW had convinced itself that the carmaker which loses the US market also loses the global battle. BMW cut its prices in the US to stabilise a situation in which sales were falling close to 50,000 a year in 1991 compared with almost 100,000 in 1988. With registrations of 73,000 cars last year, BMW now claims more than 7 per cent of the US trade in quality motors. Mercedes-Benz, lagging with 62,000 registrations last year, has been pushed into an unaccustomed secondary role. Part of BMW's success has to be attributed to the introduction in the late 1980s of cost-cutting programmes and new working practices to enhance productivity, which are only now becoming common elsewhere in German manufacturing. Although it has made more progress on costs than its domestic rivals, BMW still suffers from the problems of all German car makers, including the highest wage rates and almost the shorter working weeks of any of its global competitors. BMW has also been bolstered by the internationally-successful launch of its revamped entry level 3-S series, which reminded the company - and its rivals  -of the value of innovation and keeping interest alive. Now, while Mercedes is aiming to regain its crown with the help of its new C-class cars, BMW is pressing on with a new wave of variations on its classic theme. This spring sees the launch of a shortened, 2-door version of the acclaimed 3-series, to be followed later this year with a new 7-series car. Just in time for the start of the expected international recovery from recession, this is the model on which BMW is pinning most hopes for further and more profitable advances in the US. end As a first step, the purchase will double the group's 3 per cent share of the European car market. The purchase of Rover will inject new models, expertise and opportunities into BMW. But, in fact, both companies are bound to benefit from cross-fertilisation of ideas and improved market penetration. While Rover was the only important European vehicle maker to increase sales last year, only 11,000 of its cars were registered in Germany, Mr Doppelfeld said. And of 70,000 off-the-road vehicles sold, only 1,300 were bought by Germans. Although BMW officials stressed that managements, development programmes and sales networks would be kept separate, there were obvious gains to be made from selling the Range Rover and other four-wheel drive vehicles through BMW's domestic distribution chain. There were also distinct possibilities for returning the British group's cars to the long abandoned US market.</p>

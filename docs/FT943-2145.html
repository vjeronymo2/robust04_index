			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Trade gap in US goods near record: Overall July deficit Dollars 11bn The US trade deficit continued its steadily worsening path in July, recording the second largest monthly deficit ever for trade in goods. The overall trade deficit climbed to Dollars 10.99bn (Pounds 7bn) in July, compared with a deficit of Dollars 9.04bn in June, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. Total exports fell to Dollars 56.47bn from Dollars 58.36bn in June, while imports remained virtually flat at Dollars 67.46bn. Most of the swing resulted from a Dollars 1.7bn drop in exports of goods, which took the goods deficit to Dollars 15.7bn, a total the US has exceeded only once, in December 1985. Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, said that most of the decline in exports was caused by one-time factors, including a gap in aircraft production as makers sought to absorb slack in their order books, which cut aircraft exports to their lowest in five years. In addition, he said, the new car model year meant a decline in exports of vehicle components for assembly in Canada, and there was an unusual Dollars 200m drop in exports of artwork. 'These factors are not indicative of the economy's long term trend,' Mr Brown insisted. 'US exports, which have shown consistent growth, are still 10 per cent higher than this time last year.' Despite the weakness of the dollar, which might have been expected to improve US export performance, the trade deficit has continued to worsen all year as the US, much further into its economic recovery than its main trading partners, has sharply increased its imports of goods. Using three-month rolling averages, US goods imports have risen by 10 per cent since the beginning of this year, while goods exports have risen by only 3 per cent. A 15 per cent improvement in the US's surplus in services over the same period has not been enough to offset this deterioration. But economists expect that faster growth in Europe and Japan in the second half of this year, coupled with slower growth in the US, will eventually narrow the trade deficit. The US's trade balance with most of its main trading partners worsened in July. Its goods deficit with Japan widened to Dollars 5.67bn, compared with Dollars 5.52bn in June, while the deficit with the European Union widened to Dollars 1.93bn, from Dollars 1.32bn in June. The failure to narrow the trade deficit with Japan fuelled speculation of a clash when the deadline for completing the US-Japan framework talks expires at the end of next week. The only area where the US trade balance improved last month was Latin America. Mexico led the way, with the US goods surplus rising from Dollars 198m in June to Dollars 595m in July as the benefits of the North American Free Trade Agreement began to be felt. The US also recorded larger surpluses with Argentina and Colombia, and smaller deficits with Brazil and Venezuela.</p>

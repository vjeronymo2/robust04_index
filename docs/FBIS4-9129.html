			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Ljubomir Janev, general manager of </F> the "Makpetrol" oil firm, by S. Padora; place and date not  given: "Driving at Old Prices"]    [Text] The government decision of two days ago on the  abolition of the 10-percent customs fee for import of oil  derivatives not only will help avoid possible disturbances in  the fuel supply, but it will also mean a stable price, that is,  maintenance of the price that is now paid by consumers. If not  for longer, users can stay "cool" at least until 30 June, which  is the date until which this decision remains valid. It is also  a period in which all is possible, even what the optimists hope  for -- the lifting of the embargo imposed by the southern  neighbor on Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  -- FYROM] on 16 February.    What the "abolition" of the customs fee in fact means, and  how it is going to be reflected in the price, the supply, and  consumption is the subject of our discussion with "Makpetrol"  general manager Ljubomir Janev.  <H5>  Costs </H5>   The additional burden on the price, as Mr. Janev said, was a  result of the eastern transport corridor which has been used  since the embargo. More precisely, according to the specific  customs regulations, the crude oil arriving in the country for  refining was not taxed until that period. That same fact  brought about the only possible alternative -- to "drag" only  oil products for which taxes are to be paid, which burdened the  price and increased the costs. Moreover, the transport costs  became five times greater than before (when the crude oil  arrived by railroad from Thessaloniki directly to Miladinovci).    "Because of all this, and with the aim of avoiding  difficulties in the supply, we asked the government to abolish  the customs taxes on oil products, since it was not our desire  to buy it abroad and transport it via the eastern corridor --  that was simply imposed on us. After some discussions in  government commissions it was finally agreed that our request  was substantial and it was good that the government understood  the problem, because by decreasing the taxes a more stable price  and a better management is provided," Ljubomir Janev said.    On the other hand, since the 10-percent customs fee applied  after the embargo was simply not "planned" in the annual budget,  it was decided to apply it retroactively from 1 March.  <H5>  Supply </H5>   As far as the situation in the supply is concerned, as  Ljubomir Janev pointed out, the situation is under full  "control." Although there is a quantity of crude oil in the  Thessaloniki port valued at $7 million ($4 million for  "Makpetrol" and $3 million for the Skopje Oil Refinery), for the  time being all financial deals for purchasing oil derivatives  from the East and the West are successfully covered. At this  moment, 5,500 metric tons of Italian gas have been transferred  in the country, and an equal quantity is expected to arrive at  the Refinery from the same supplier. Moreover, an agreement was  signed this month with the Bulgarian company "Neftokhim" for  42,000 tons of derivatives from Bulgarian producers. It is also  news that in the days to come there will be discussions on a  peak state level for convoy transports that will cross the  Macedonian-Bulgarian border two to three times per day in a  well-organized way and without delays. This would buy time, but  the very fact that the time and handling costs will be shortened  means a good saving.    "The experiences of the previous and the present embargo  have  greatly contributed to our good organization and, with the great  help of the government and its interventions, the road for the  derivatives has been shortened. Instead of using fuel tankers  travelling for days from Burgas to Macedonia, we are now using  the railroad transport across Bulgaria. More precisely, the  derivatives arrive by railroad to Sandanski, Plovdiv, and Sofia,  where they are loaded on fuel tankers; thus the time is  shortened and the distribution dynamic is much better," Ljubomir  Janev told us.    Beside the eastern transport, there are negotiations with  Albania for the possible use of the western coast. There is an  intention to lease two tanks for light derivatives in Valona,  and it has been agreed to purchase 7,000 tons of "virgin oil"  for Macedonia, in order to discharge the capacities which can be  used for storing derivatives for Macedonia from Italy, Rijeka,  or other suppliers sailing on the Adriatic Sea.</p>

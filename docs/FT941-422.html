			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Arts: Fumbles in the Thirties - Towards the Millennium Plunging on Towards the Millennium, the South Bank's bold survey of our musical century, encapsulated decade by decade in annual series until the year 2000, is now deep into the 1930s (Anxiety and Escapism). In this kind of exercise, hindsight is everything: the spring season in AD2000 will be guesswork, for somebody must identify the crucial works of the 1990s at rather short notice. Even the music of the 1930s still resists confident, God's-ear assessment. When Simon Rattle and the CBSO played Stravinsky's melodrame Persephone (1933) and Walton's Belshazzar's Feast (1931) on Friday, were they presenting major works of the decade, or just Notable Misfires by Major Composers? The performances made a strong case for the latter reading. The composer of Persephone was never happy with it. He had loathed Andre Gide's woozily elevated text - 'vers de caramel', he called it - and set it with a cool disregard for natural accents and scansion. Having heard a single run-through, Gide fled. Later, Stravinsky maintained that the proportions of his score had been geared to precise stage requirements (originally realised by the great Jacques Copeau), and were simply inapt for concert performance. Stravinskians nevertheless detect a rare vein of vernal innocence in this music, luminous enough to shine through its fusty format. In this performance we hardly felt it. Rattle's general conception rang true, with the heroine (Ida Rubinstein's role) spoken by Claude Mathieu in faultless style. But the French diction of his multiple chorus - the CBSO's own and the LSO's, with junior choristers from Abbots Bromley, Tewkesbury and Lichfield Cathedral - was inarticulate and bland, too vague to enliven the rhythms and too smooth to let in much-needed fresh air. As the priest-narrator Eumolpus, Nigel Robson was admirably musical and sensitive, without making us forget that he was replacing another tenor whose brighter, sweeter timbre might have been a decisive asset. The net result was beta-blocker plain and pallid. It sounded the more so in retrospect, perhaps, since Walton's nervy, flashily 'barbaric' cantata followed hard on its heels. In fact, Belshazzar seemed long past its sell-by date, though provincial choruses still aspire to meet its raucous demands. It was no help that Rattle, who hates conventional bombast, took it so swiftly and brittly. Professionally fervid bombast is what it needs; he managed too little of that to conceal the holes between Walton's crafty effects. What we had instead was flatulent rhetoric without lyrical force, tiny modernisms stuck on to safe harmonies, and emptily florid baritone solos needing something more than Stephen Richardson's decently solid delivery. Can't we just admit that this commission caught Walton on the wrong foot, and did him no favour beyond transient success? So far as British music went in the 1930s - not very far - any firm influence from Belshazzar would have been reactionary, even downright pernicious.</p>

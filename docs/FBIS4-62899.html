			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>   [Text] The ruling Fatherland Party parliamentary faction  agreed, on Wednesday [18 May], to Prime Minister Mart Laar's  proposition to dismiss Minister of Defence Indrek Kannik, while  the board of the Fatherland party decided to make a proposition  to the government to resign.    Head of the Fatherland parliamentary faction Tiit Sinissar  told ETA that the prime minister considered it necessary to make  some changes in the composition of the government to increase  the stability and working ability of the government. One of the  means was to change the defence minister with whom the Prime  Minister has had most of disagreements with. Sinissaar said  that the agreement on the decision was quite unanimous by the  faction. "There is no question of splitting up of the faction,  only some fractions might depart," Sinissaar stated.    The board of the Fatherland party, however, decided at its  emergency session on Wednesday to make a proposition to the  government to resign, stating differences of opinion that have  created tension in the government as the reason.    Member of the board of the party Mart Nutt told ETA that the  decision was not directed against any definite person in the  government, but was to be considered as a step to solve tensions  in the government. Nutt stressed that the decision of the board  of the party was not binding to the government. The position of  the parliamentary faction is what counts but the faction has not  yet discussed the problem, Nutt said.    The parliamentary faction of the Fatherland Party made a  statement later on Wednesday, saying that the proposition made  by the emergency meeting of the board of the Fatherland Party,  to the government to resign, came as a "surprise for the  faction." The faction states that such propositions are not a  matter of any party or its board -- the nomination and  withdrawal of a government is, according to the constitution, in  the parliament's authority. "The position of the Fatherland Part  parliamentary faction is that the government has to continue its  activities," the statement says.    The government is to hold an emergency meeting tonight.</p>

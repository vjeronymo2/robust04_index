			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: OTAY MESA  </P> <P> County supervisors voted Wednesday to appeal a $55-million judgment won by a  wealthy San Diego family who sued the county over the price of land obtained  for a new jail.  </P> <P> County spokesman Robert Lerner said the judgment, which could total $71.5  million after interest is paid, "has terrible implications."  </P> <P> The board of supervisors ordered the county counsel to appeal the jury's award  to Roque de la Fuente II and his family and if necessary seek a new trial,  Lerner said.  </P> <P> At issue is 525 acres of barren land in the county's outback at the eastern  edge of Otay Mesa, which the county obtained in September, 1987. The property,  which the county obtained through eminent-domain laws for a jail, was owned by  the De la Fuentes.  </P> <P> Both sides were unable to agree on a purchase price and the De la Fuentes sued.  Last Friday, a Superior Court jury ruled in their favor and put a $55-million  price on the property. County officials complained that the jury's price tag  raised the value of the land by 7,000% over the past five years, from $3,300 an  acre to $375,000 an acre.  </P></p>

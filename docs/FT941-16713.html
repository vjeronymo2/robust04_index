			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / The price is right: UK car sales are rising on the back of manufacturers' discounts The UK has become a lonely, glittering prize for Europe's recession-battered motor industry. Carmakers in continental Europe, surveying the wastelands of their domestic markets, where sales fell last year by up to a quarter, are casting covetous eyes at the one big market in Europe enjoying what now looks like strong and sustainable growth. New car registrations in the UK increased by 11.6 per cent last year - far more than the industry dared to predict 12 months ago. Even pessimists in the industry now expect sales to climb throughout the year. But the explanation for the British revival is not a straightforward tale of rising demand and suppliers rushing to catch up. Much of the sales growth has been the result of consumers being wooed as never before by carmakers seeking either to stem losses or hang on to profitability and to keep production lines going. With few signs of market recovery on the Continent, consumers can expect the wooing to go on. The response of the consumer has caused some mayhem and not a little heartache among the big carmaking rivals. Where traditionally many motorists would stick with one manufacturer for a lifetime, they are now switching between makers according to which is offering the best deal. 'Today's customer has become mobile, choosy - and totally disloyal,' says Mr Alan Pulham, director of the National Franchised Dealers' Association. The break up of customer loyalties is apparent in the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders' figures. Sales in relatively new market niches, particularly leisure four-wheel-drive vehicles such as Rover's Discovery and 'people carriers' like Renault's Espace, are still small but enjoying rapid growth. Most spectacularly, those manufacturers which have established reputations for diesel models are enjoying a field day: diesel car sales last year almost doubled to 340,000 and they now account for one in five of new cars sold. Mr Tom Purves, managing director of BMW (GB) says that the German executive carmaker had expected to sell 1,200 of its new diesel 3 and 5 series cars after their launch in the UK in the summer. 'We're past 1,800 and simply can't get enough.' In such niche markets sales have risen unaided but in the mainstream the battle is being fought increasingly on price, with the biggest gains and losses in terms of sales last year correlating closely to the size of the discounts being offered. Ford, once the market leader, is now struggling to maintain its pre-eminence, trailing behind both Vauxhall and Rover in December's sales figures. Last Spring, it cut the price of its new Mondeo saloon by an average of 6 per cent only a fortnight after launch. Subsequently sales revived. At the same time, sales figures for last year have dispelled any suggestion that, as Japanese makers Nissan, Toyota and Honda strengthened their manufacturing capacity in the UK, they would push aside all other competitors. The Japanese manufacturers are enjoying healthy growth - but having to invest as heavily in marketing as everyone else. Sales of Japanese models in the UK rose by more than 15 per cent last year. In common with other manufacturers, the Japanese companies are having to fight much more strongly than they expected against some of the Continental manufacturers who were expected to be among their early victims. A rash of well-received and competitively priced new models, combined with improved quality, successful marketing and generous offers on after-sales service, has led to companies such as Fiat, Peugeot and Citroen enjoying some of the best sales figures for any manufacturer last year. Sales of Fiats, for instance, which had been falling in the UK since the late 1980s, increased by 38 per cent last year. The company was helped in particular by the introduction of the tiny, Polish-built Cinqueconto, which set the pace for a new generation of urban runabouts and which virtually no other European maker can yet rival. The ferocity of the fighting for supremacy which waged throughout last year  -and which can only intensify in the absence of any significant Continental market upturn - has led some in the industry to question whether the recovery is as strong as it appears. In carefully-timed broadsides just before and during the London motor show in October, Mr Pulham, whose NFDA members sell four-fifths of all new cars, accused manufacturers of desperately trying to preserve market positions by 'forcing' the market. He said dealers were being pressurised into registering cars for which there were no final buyers in order to qualify for manufacturers' sales bonuses. By intensifying the downward pressure on prices, he argued, the practice was having an adverse effect on dealers, and because of the knock-on effects in the second-hand market, ultimately on the motorists as well. According to Mr Pulham, August alone saw at least 40,000 such cases. Such attacks on the tactics of carmakers may be prompted partly by dealers' self-interest. More than 2,000 dealerships have gone bust or changed hands in the past two years of recession, as sales margins have been squeezed. Meanwhile, the leading manufacturers are dismissive of the impact of their attempts to increase sales, saying 'pre-registering' has been part of the UK car market scene for years. In addition, industry analysts such as Garel Rhys, professor of motor industry economics at Cardiff Business School, estimate that the net effect of pre-registration is probably only a slight over-statement of the new car market's size. Year-on-year comparisons hold good and yesterday's statistics are a fair reflection of the trend, he believes. But another grievance of many dealers may prove of more significance: that the interests of individual consumers are being threatened by the practices of carmakers which sell direct to large fleet operators, bypassing the dealer networks. The NFDA says that such deals, which can involve discounts of 35 per cent or more, now account for more than 300,000 car sales a year - nearly 20 per cent of the total. As recently as the late 1980s, such deals were rare. The figures highlight the enduring popularity of the company car, many of which are now supplied from fleets, in spite of the progressive erosion in the past decade of their tax advantages. The latest changes to the company car tax regime, which come into effect on April 6, are expected to be broadly neutral. The NFDA maintains that the discounts offered to fleet buyers have to be paid for somehow - and that small company buyers and private motorists are subsidising them. New car list prices could be cut by 5 per cent if such deals were outlawed, says the NFDA. But the association is not optimistic that its call for such practices to be outlawed will be heeded. Such disputes over practices, however, cannot disguise a new found ebullience among both those who sell as well as make cars. This year, says Mr Ernie Thompson, the former Ford director recently appointed chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, sales should rise further by nearly 100,000, to 1.86m. 'To put that into perspective, it is still 20 per cent down on the 1989 peak,' he says. But for many dealers, the fact that the British recession is history will be enough.</p>

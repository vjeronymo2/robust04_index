			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> U.S. VETOES U.N. RESOLUTION CRITICAL OF ISRAEL CRACKDOWN  </P> <P> The United States on Friday vetoed a Security Council resolution critical of  Israel's crackdown on the Palestinian uprising and said acts of violence by  Palestinians cannot be ignored.  </P> <P> The United States was the only one of the 15 Security Council members to vote  against the resolution, but as a permanent member of the council, it has veto  power.  </P> <P> The U.S. Mission, trying to avoid a veto as the Bush Administration's first  policy statement on the Middle East, offered an alternative resolution that  contained implied criticism of the Palestinian protesters as well as strong  criticism of Israel.  </P> <P> The alternative draft urged Arabs to accept their share of responsibility for  the cycle of violence and to be accommodating in seeking a peaceful resolution  of the problem. But the nonaligned nations rejected the alternative draft and  insisted on proceeding to a vote on their resolution.  </P> <P> "We have made clear to the government of Israel our opposition to certain  Israeli practices, for example, expulsion of Palestinian residents, collective  punishment, use of live fire in non-life-threatening situations," said Herbert  S. Okun, the deputy U.S. ambassador.  </P> <P> But he added, "Acts of violence perpetrated by Palestinians against Israeli  soldiers and civilians are commonplace. Palestinian acts of violence, no more  than those of Israelis, cannot be condoned."  </P></p>

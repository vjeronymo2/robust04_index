			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Mountleigh loses Pounds 73.7m midway MOUNTLEIGH GROUP, the debt-laden property company, yesterday announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 73.7m for the six months to October 31 and passed its interim dividend. A year earlier, it made a Pounds 12m pre-tax profit and declared a 1.25p interim pay-out. These heavy losses are the latest in a series of announcements by the company. Last summer, it announced a Pounds 96.1m annual pre-tax loss and the breach of its banking covenants. It launched a Pounds 96m rights issue, which provoked a public censure by the stock exchange. In October, the chairman and three joint managing directors resigned before the company's annual meeting, as a result of the change of strategy. About half the loss was due to a provision taken on its Merry Hill shopping centre in the West Midlands, which it has agreed to sell for Pounds 125m to investors led by the O'Connor Group, a US pension fund adviser, in partnership with Hammerson property group. The deal is likely to take several weeks to complete. The difference between Merry Hill's book value of Pounds 160.4m and the sale price was the main cause of a Pounds 40.1m exceptional charge. In addition, the exceptional charge included Pounds 6.5m of the Pounds 9.8m costs of last summer's Pounds 96m rights issue. The interim results suffered from an increase in the interest charge from Pounds 26m to Pounds 35.5m, largely because it has stopped capitalising interest. Net borrowings stood at Pounds 526.4m at October 31 compared with Pounds 641.1m at May 31. Operating profits in the UK fell from Pounds 11.2m to Pounds 7.9m. Property sales dropped from Pounds 116.7m to Pounds 48.6m with a further Pounds 22m raised from the sale of investment properties in Spain. Rents and service charges increased from Pounds 10.7m to Pounds 13.3m. The sale of Merry Hill, which has a rent roll of Pounds 10.8m, will significantly reduce rental income in future. Galerias, the Spanish department store, made a Pounds 1.9m loss, as increases in operating costs offset an increase in sales and gross margins. Sir Ian MacGregor, chairman, who is recovering from heart surgery, reiterated Mountleigh's objectives of reducing debt by selling its UK and continental property portfolio and positioning Galerias Preciados as a high quality Spanish retail business. There was a loss per share of 20.1p, compared with earnings per share of 4.7p a year earlier. Lex, Page 18</p>

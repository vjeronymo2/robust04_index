			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / International Company News: PepsiCo shares hit as cola price war breaks out in US Shares in PepsiCo, US maker of the soft drink Pepsi-Cola, lost 9 per cent of their value by mid-session yesterday after the company shocked Wall Street with news that a cola price war had broken out in its domestic market. By early afternoon, PepsiCo had fallen Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 31 1/2 while Coca-Cola dropped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 41 1/8 . The company warned that second-quarter profits would be flat because of the inroads being made into the US cola market by Cott, the fast-growing Canadian maker of low-cost, store-branded foods and drinks. Cott recently sparked a row in the UK by supplying J. Sainsbury, the country's biggest retailer, with a store-branded cola that looks and tastes similar to Coca-Cola but sells at roughly half the price. Coca-Cola accused Sainsbury of trying to pass off Cott's product as 'the real thing'. PepsiCo's announcement left investors worried because it called to mind last year's 'Marlboro Friday', when Philip Morris, US manufacturer of Marlboro cigarettes, slashed prices in response to cut-price competition. The development also reinforced worries on Wall Street about the true worth of brands at a time when value-conscious consumers seem inclined to switch away from famous-name products if they feel they can get the same quality from an unbranded product at a lower price. Cott is the largest supplier of store-branded soft drinks in North America. It is a big manufacturer of beer, iced tea, juices, snacks and pet food. Stores that buy its products either put their own name on the label or one of Cott's - notably, President's Choice. The company has begun to spread outside North America to South Africa and Australia, and signed an agreement with Cadbury Schweppes of the UK that should allow it to distribute its products throughout Europe. Mr John Maxwell, analyst at brokers Wheat First Butcher &amp; Singer, said Cott had signed up 65 store chains in the US and was already supplying 55. PepsiCo was being hurt more than Coca-Cola because PepsiCo owned the companies that bottled its products, he said, 'and it's the bottlers who are taking it on the chin'.</p>

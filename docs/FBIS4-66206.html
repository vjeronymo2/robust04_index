			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tian Li (3944 0500)] </F>   [Text] Since 1 January 1994, information on a new tax  system for Mainland China (PRC) has been emerging. According to  news releases, reforms are being made in categories of tax  classification, tax rates, and tax collection policy.  <H5>  A New Tax System Based Primarily on the Turnover Tax System </H5>   In December of last year, the PRC announced a set of  temporary regulations pertaining to tax collection which are  used to set up a new system of turnover taxes. This new system  which includes a value-added tax, a consumption tax, and a  business tax will be replacing the unified business tax system  presently in use. These turnover taxes will apply to all  enterprises and the products of their operations. These  enterprises include state-owned enterprises, collective  enterprises, shareholder enterprises, individual enterprises,  foreign enterprises, and Chinese-foreign joint ventures engaged  in production, marketing, and management operations from which  their income is derived from Mainland China. The taxes are  levied against this income.    After reforms have been initiated, turnover taxes will  include the value-added tax, consumption tax, and the business  tax which apply to enterprises funded both by domestic and  foreign investment. The value-added tax will be levied on  commodity traded and import items, a consumption or excise tax  on selected consumer goods, and a business tax on productive  labor and service industries, where no value-added tax is levied.    According to reliable sources, the value-added tax will be  implemented apart from the price of an item; that is, basing the  tax on the price of goods without including the value-added tax  as the tax base. The taxpayer should take all the income from  his orders and combine it with operating income to figure the  value-added tax. At the same time, a tax credit system should be  implemented where tax noted on the invoice may be offset. All  steps taken before goods are sold must be priced according to  the notation made on their invoices--whether or not the  value-added tax was included. All invoices without notation of  tax, or if the invoice used does not meet specifications, or if  the invoice is not filled out as specified, no tax is offset.  After reforms have been made, the basic rate for the value-added  tax is set to be 16 percent, though a lower tax rate of 13  percent will apply for basic food staples and agricultural  production materials.    The PRC expects to levy a consumption tax on some goods that  are specially regulated. Products determined preliminarily to  have consumption taxes levied on them include tobacco, alcohol,  color television sets, videorecorders, automobiles, limousines,  jewelry, air conditioners, refrigerators, gasoline, diesel fuel,  firecrackers and fireworks etc. The consumption tax, broken down  to 12 categories, will be calculated according to the set quota  and the set price for the product.    The business tax after reforms is directed primarily toward  the tertiary industry, in the fields of transportation, finance  and insurance, telecommunications, entertainment, construction  and various service industries. For high-consumption karaoke  music parlors, a high-rate business tax should be levied on them  in accordance with local laws, or based on the volume of  business generated by them, as determined by the local  authorities.  <H5>  New Classes of Tax Added </H5>   One feature of the new tax system established by the PRC is  the addition of some new classes of tax.    -- Real estate value-added tax beginning 1 January. Though  the PRC will not tax income from rents on land leased out by  local authorities, it does require such income to be included in  the fiscal budget for management purposes. However, with respect  to domestic and foreign enterprises engaged in real estate  operations, not only will a business tax and an income tax be  levied on them, they will also be subject to a real estate  value-added tax. In the real estate transaction, a four-stage  progressive tax rate is used on the value-added tax that is  levied on the part of the real estate that has appreciated. The  lowest rate of this progressive tax is 30 percent; the highest,  60 percent.    -- A tax on trades of stock. The stamp tax presently levied  on trades of stock is changed to become a tax on stock trades,  at a tax rate ranging from 3 percent to 10 percent, that applies  to both buyer and seller.    -- A real estate tax and a tax on motor vehicle and boat use  by foreign enterprises and foreign personnel, with the  possibility that the tax rate and taxes may be raised. At the  same time, the local real estate tax and the tax on their  permits to operate a motor vehicle or a boat will be canceled.    -- A public works tax on foreign enterprises, based on their  sales income, at a rate of 0.5 percent to 1 percent.  <H5>  An Increased Tax Burden and the Central Government's Tax </H5> Income    In explaining this new tax system, the PRC states its  purpose  is to unify the tax laws, equalize the tax load for all,  simplify the tax system, assign rights logically, and iron out  allottment relationships, to assure financial income establish a  tax system that meets the needs of a market economy. However, in  reality, it is achieving two goals: One is increasing the tax  load, so that taxes collected, in proportion to the total  domestic national product, are increased. Second is that of the  total amount of taxes collected, the proportion going to the  central government is increased.    In Mainland China, about a third of the state-owned  businesses operate at a loss. Besides problems to do with the  system, an important reason for this state of affairs is the  heavy tax load which does not allow enterprises to have  sufficient capital to develop new products and improve their  techniques. In facing such a great deficit, the Mainland Chinese  Government does not exert any great effort to reduce  expenditures, cut down on its bureaucratic work force, stop the  improper use of public funds for meals, trips, entertainment,  purchase of luxury cars etc. As it continues this policy of tax  increases on enterprises already reeling from lack of vitality,  it is like killing the goose that lays the golden egg.  <H5>  Increasing Contradictions Between the Central Government and </H5> Local Authorities    Another feature of this new tax system that is being  implemented is its stab on the local authorities by clearly  stating what are central government taxes, local taxes, and  joint central-local government taxes. To assure that local  authorities will turn in the central government's taxes on time,  it has further ordered the establishment of two tax collecting  agencies on the local level--one to collect for the central  government, and the other, for the local government. Not only  does such a move opt more of local benefits to the central  government, it also dilutes the power of the local authorities.  This move has led to much dissatisfaction among the locals. Some  local areas, such as a few in Guangdong Province, have required  enterprises to turn in, ahead of time, their central government  taxes that are due on 1 January by the end of December to their  local tax collection agency. Some local areas are very unhappy  with this tax apportionment system and the establishment of two  tax collecting agencies, and are dragging their feet  implementing this order. It appears that such contradictions  between the central government and local authorities on this tax  collection matter will become greater as time goes by. It is  serious enough that in several meetings, the PRC's vice premier  Zhu Rongji has appealed to all local authorities in asking them  to understand and support the tax apportioning system and not  allow it to abort.

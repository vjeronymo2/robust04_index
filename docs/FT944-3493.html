			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Mandatory institutional voting would curb executive pay excesses Sir, The belated cabinet concern over excessive executive pay is to be welcomed. But if institutional investors are expected by the cabinet to monitor and supervise it, they will have to be given the tools to do the job. Expecting executives themselves, serving as non-executives on other company boards, to exercise restraint is unrealistic because of their conflicts of interest. Turkeys will not vote for Christmas. The solution lies in enabling institutional investors to exercise appropriate supervision over those whom they elect to manage company assets. At present, these investors cannot vote on the total remuneration package for directors, but only part of it (the rather arbitrary elements like share options, compensation and five-year contracts). But voting on remuneration packages will not be enough unless the principles of integrity, accountability and openness which Cadbury set out for companies are also operated by City fund managers who exercise (or not) votes on behalf of pension scheme members and insurance policy holders. To keep the Christmas fowl in mind, Cadbury sauce for the company goose should also be sauce for the investment manager gander. Where should John Major begin unravelling these conflicts? The first step would be to oblige institutions to cast their votes in the first place. At many companies, most proxy votes are filed in the waste paper bin. A minor amendment to the Pensions Bill making voting mandatory would catch the majority of institutional investors and would also bring UK pension funds in line with their American cousins, which are already under such an obligation in respect of their shares in British companies. But will such votes be cast in the interests of pension scheme and insurance policy holders interests? To ensure that institutions are up to the mark on this they should make their voting policy public (as Cadbury recommended, but most have ignored) and keep records of their voting activity which are open to inspection by the beneficiaries/policy holders. Unless the government digs a little deeper into the conflicts of interest, a worthy reform in favour of voting on directors' pay could simply be used to engineer a mandate for further unacceptable and unjustified pay rises.

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (8): Koc and Sabanci adapt to competition and new rules - Business: the two dominant corporate giants face fresh challenges Two corporate logos adorn nearly every street corner, shop and office building in Turkey. One is the red ram's head emblem of the Koc business empire. The other, the big white and blue letters SA, the first two letters of the Sabanci name. These two giants have dominated the Turkish corporate scene for over a generation, with interests from chocolates to cars to banking to textiles. Together their annual revenues of Dollars 20.73bn are equivalent to 12 per cent of Turkey's GDP. Both face similar challenges as liberalisation and competition intensify. The principal factors in their success - trade protection, strong political connections and firm management - no longer apply as they once did. Both groups were built up by poor men at the dawn of Turkey's industrialisation 70 years ago and are still controlled by their founding families. Haci Omer Sabanci began working at 14 and first went into business in 1932. The Sabanci family remains the group's principal shareholder and the founder's five sons now run the company. Vehbi Koc, 94, still comes to the office nearly every day. His company's headquarters in a converted Ottoman palace controls a far-flung empire with annual sales of Dollars 14.45bn. The two became the partners of choice for multinationals setting up business in Turkey, further broadening their activities, profits and business skills as they learnt from the foreigners. Koc's first alliance came in 1928 when it started distributing Ford cars. Now it makes Ford Escorts and Orions as well as Fiat cars under licence. Sabanci has joint ventures with the likes of Toyota, Philip Morris and Belgian steelmaker Bekaert. These companies are highly profitable: Koc's group pretax earnings rose 55 per cent in dollar terms to Dollars 1.3bn last year. Sabanci advanced far more slowly, rising 3 per cent to Dollars 633m before tax, giving a 10 per cent return on revenues. Analysts warn that their complex pattern of interlocking shareholdings and the vagaries of inflation accounting make it hard to monitor the groups' true financial situation. The controlling families realise change is needed. In January, Koc introduced a flatter management structure, with a headquarters staff of only 200, that granted subsidiaries greater freedom. Eleven divisional presidents supervise the group's 106 companies, with final responsibility in the hands of a single CEO, Inan Kirac, a professional manager. Mr Kutsan Clebican, Koc's finance vice-president, says 'We have very strong financial controls, but have a general policy of leaving companies alone. We approve their budget and provide targets and indicate expected inflation and exchange rates.' Although top managers are increasingly young, foreign-educated MBAs, these groups have acquired a civil service atmosphere. Koc executives tend to spend all their working lives in the company. Very few are recruited from other companies. It does recruit some senior executives, such as Mr Clebican, from the top ranks of the finance ministry. Koc even likes making five-year plans. It abandoned five-year planning this year because of high inflation, but is back at work on a new one. Instability is undoubtedly bad for business - car sales have fallen by a third this year, forcing Koc's Tofas car plant to halt production for six weeks. Although executives insist that they are not postponing investments, analysts say capacity expansion at Tofas has been scaled back. Last year, Koc raised fixed assets and investments 16 per cent to Dollars 1.68bn. But Sabanci's investments dropped nearly a third in dollar terms to Dollars 385.3m. Diversification is out of fashion these days. Sabanci claims it is focusing its business more tightly, but its five core businesses still cover all the main segments of Turkish industry. Mr Erol Sabanci, a group director, says: 'The industrial side is diversified in 50 industrial sectors, so the risks from failure are reduced.' He adds that even apparently unrelated companies provide synergies: the textile companies produce cord for the tyre company which supplies the car company. Despite its wide spread of businesses, Koc gets 75 per cent of its revenues from cars, white goods and consumer electronics. Executives argue that their dominant share in these sectors is a crucial defence to growing foreign competition. Divestment from unrelated companies may come with time. In the past, protection provided companies with high margins, which allowed them to fuel expansion with retained earnings, keeping borrowing to a minimum. However, import protection is declining, so margins must fall. Furthermore, the capital cost of new investment is rising. Outside financing will become an increasingly important issue. Koc is already using the stock exchange to raise capital. Mr Clebican says: 'It is the founder's policy that when a company is financially sound it should offer shares to the public, because there is not a long future for family companies. All the money (from share sales) is reinvested in the companies.' Koc's Arcelik white goods company and its Tofas car unit are both quoted on the Istanbul Stock Exchange. It has recently listed two more subsidiaries, its Bekoteknik consumer electronics arm and Tat, a big tomato processor. But for the time being, neither group is even thinking of giving up majority stakes. Most listed companies have just 15-20 per cent of their shares in the market. Both groups still have plenty of headroom to raise debt. Koc, for instance has only Dollars 161.7m in long term debt. The dominance of the two companies is gradually diminishing as new participants appear on the scene. The Dogus group, for instance, began life as a civil engineering company. It has metamorphosed into to a banking group with a growing portfolio of other businesses like food, television, retailing and tourism. Ayhan Sahenk, aged 65, founded Dogus in 1951 and is still its chairman. Last year it reported combined revenues of Dollars 1.38bn, and a net profit margin of 17.5 per cent. Mr Zekeriya Yildirim, vice-chairman says Dogus aims to become a 'well-positioned consumer, service-oriented group.' He says this should make it less vulnerable to business cycles. Inevitably, Dogus has also adopted a decentralised management structure. Mr Yildirim says: 'Each subsidiary stands alone, managed by their own corporate bodies.' The holding company handles strategic planning, financial controls and head office services. And, like Sabanci, it insists that its financial and non-financial companies are divided by Chinese walls. Dogus also insists that what looks like an opportunistic mixed bag of unrelated businesses is really a balance of inward-looking consumer businesses and outward-looking tourism and overseas construction companies. Turkey's giants grew big and strong in a protected environment. They must learn new skills to prosper in less forgiving conditions. Turkey's chaotic domestic economy is no help. But there is every sign that these blue chips will be around for a long time.</p>

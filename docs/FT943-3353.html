			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / International Company News: Mediobanca rises 8% to L216bn Mediobanca, the powerful Milan-based merchant bank, increased net profits to L215.9bn (Dollars 138.39m) in the year ended June 30, up 7.8 per cent on the L200.1bn profit recorded in the previous year. The bank's directors agreed yesterday to retain the option to relaunch an issue of new shares and warrants when appropriate. Adverse market conditions forced Mediobanca to postpone the original operation - which would have raised more than L1,500bn - in June. A new resolution on the share issue will be put to shareholders at the end of next month. No date has been set for a new offer, but this time no minimum price will be fixed, giving the bank more flexibility. '(The resolution) now incorporates a mechanism that will enable the share price to be fixed more closely in line with market quotations and the underlying net asset value of the bank's shares at the time of the issue,' Mediobanca said. When Mediobanca first announced its intention to issue new shares and warrants at the end of April, it fixed a minimum issue price of L15,000, compared with a market price of more than L18,500. However, the shares were hit by a general decline in Italian equities, and by news that four top executives of the bank, including Mr Enrico Cuccia, honorary chairman, were under investigation by Ravenna magistrates for alleged involvement in false corporate reporting by the Ferruzzi and Montedison industrial groups. Mediobanca angrily denied there was any substance to the allegations, which are still being investigated, but the share price slipped below L15,000 on the eve of the pricing of the issue and the bank decided it would be safer to postpone the operation. Yesterday, Mediobanca's shares closed at L13,706, before the results announcement, against an opening price of L13,603. Mediobanca has no urgent need to raise cash, as yesterday's results indicated. The bank's net worth rose to L4,416bn, up 37.5 per cent, and liquid assets rose 7.8 per cent to L6,481bn. The market value of its share portfolio was L2,902bn more than its book value, after deducting L89bn of unrealised losses. The issue was partly intended to dilute the 50 per cent holding of its traditional long-term shareholders - three banks, Banca Commerciale Italiana, Banca di Roma, Credito Italiano, and a group of corporate investors - to just over 40 per cent. The bank approved its first set of consolidated accounts, which showed a net profit of L301.1bn, and shareholders' equity of L4,605bn, after transfers to reserves. As in previous years, the board is recommending a dividend of L200 per share, and has asked shareholders' permission to increase the maximum number of directors from 19 to 21.</p>

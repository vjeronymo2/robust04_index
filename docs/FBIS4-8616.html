			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 15 (AFP) -- UN envoy Yasushi Akashi  and mediator Thorvald Stoltenberg met with Bosnian Serb leader  Radovan Karadzic Friday, the first such meetings since NATO air  strikes on Serb forces around Gorazde, the Serbs reported.    The Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA said Russian special envoy  Vitaliy Churkin, who has been mediating between the Serbs and  the United Nations, was also at the meeting in the Serb  headquarters at Pale outside Sarajevo.    The talks came a week after the Bosnian Serbs announced they  were suspending contacts with the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR]  in the wake of the NATO raids against Serbs beseiging the  eastern Moslem enclave of Gorazde Sunday and Monday.    Since then Bosnian Serb harassment of UN forces has  increased  dramatically, with a large number of UN personnel held against  their will in the exclusion zone around Sarajevo.    Churkin has been in Pale, east of Sarajevo, for several  days,  trying to mediate with the Bosnian Serbs. Karadzic was also  accompanied at the talks by his deputies, Nikola Koljevic and  Biljana Plavsic,    SRNA said the meeting in Pale was aimed at relaunching the  Bosnian peace process, seriously jeapordized by events since the  Gorazde air strikes.    Radio Sarajevo Friday reported renewed fighting overnight in  the besieged enclave of Gorazde. The casualty toll in Gorazde  has risen to 12 dead, including three children, and 49 injured  in the last 24 hours, the radio said.</p>

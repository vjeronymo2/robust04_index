			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  decided to announce his proposal to hold a referendum on a  withdrawal from the Golan Heights following consultations he  held in his office yesterday at the end of his session with the  U.S. peace team. Prior to issuing the announcement, Rabin  conferred separately with Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur  and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres.    Peres believes the government should retain both options:  holding a referendum or calling an election once an agreement  has been reached. In his opinion, no decision is called for at  this point, but the appropriate option should be chosen at the  right time.    The prime minister does not plan to submit the proposal to  the cabinet for approval any time soon, and will only do so when  the time comes to make a decision. [passage omitted]</p>

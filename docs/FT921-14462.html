			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / Recession in India deepens INDIAN industry is in a sharp recession according to half-yearly figures released yesterday and indications are that it will continue. Figures for the first six months of the financial year show that the decline in the manufacturing sector 1.9 per cent, while production in mining and quarrying fell 2.6 per cent. Capital goods have been particularly badly affected and their production was down by 17 per cent. Consumer durables were down by 11 per cent, while production of consumer goods fell less sharply by less than 1 per cent. Quick estimates of industrial production released yesterday showed that out of 155 industries, only 85 have recorded any growth while the remaining 70 have shown a marked decline in production. The overall fall in industrial production means economic growth is likely to fall short of the modest 3 per cent of gross domestic product forecast by the government for 1991-92. The bad news comes when the government is preparing to present its budget next month and means that revenues from excise duties will fall short of estimates. The finance minister had promised to cut the fiscal deficit to 5 per cent of GDP. This will now be difficult unless expenditure is severely curtailed. The recession is expected to lead to retrenchment of workers in many industries and the labour unrest that is expected to follow will exacerbate the government's difficulties. Reports in Indian newspapers say that some senior cabinet ministers and members of the ruling Congress party are asking Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, act by slowing down his economic reforms. This is because they fear that the 14 per cent inflation rate will rise in the coming months and they have warned the prime minister that this will affect the position of his minority government. The government will, however, find it difficult to go back on its economic policies since disbursement of further instalments of the standby credit of Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) from the International Monetary Fund is dependent on fulfilling performance criteria.</p>

Final  </P> <P> 2 U.S. SAILORS DIE IN BUS CRASH  </P> <P> Two sailors from the aircraft carrier Midway were killed when a tour bus they  were on overturned, the military's Joint Information Bureau said today.  </P> <P> Five other U.S. sailors were injured, two of whom were in serious condition  after the accident Sunday about 50 miles south of al-Dhafra air base in Abu  Dhabi.  </P> <P> The sailors were on shore leave, taking an off-road tour in an all-terrain bus  when the accident occurred, the military said.  </P> <P> A Navy spokesman said that because of the remoteness of the area, helicopters  from the Midway flew to the scene to assist local authorities.  </P> <P> One of the injured was flown to the hospital ship Comfort and three to the  Midway. The whereabouts of the fifth was not immediately known.  </P> <P> The accident brought the number of U.S. deaths in Operation Desert Shield to  80. On Saturday in the Mediterranean, a chartered Israeli ferry carrying U.S.  sailors capsized while returning to the Saratoga from the Israeli port of  Haifa, killing 21.  </P></p>

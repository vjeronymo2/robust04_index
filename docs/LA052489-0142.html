			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE;  </P> <P> GOVERNOR SIGNS GUN LAW LEGALIZING FIRST BAN ON ASSAULT WEAPONS  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian signed two bills today making California the first state  in the nation to ban the sale of military-style assault weapons.  </P> <P> The Republican governor's signature ended a bitter fight ignited by the killing  of five children at a Stockton schoolyard Jan. 17 by Patrick Purdy, a suicidal  drifter armed with a Chinese-made AK-47.  </P> <P> "These bills are not going to bring back the life of the five beautiful young  children who died so tragically on the school ground in Stockton," Deukmejian  said at a Capitol bill-signing news conference. "But we do hope and pray that  these measures . . . will help our brave and courageous law enforcement  community in fighting violent crime and saving innocent lives."  </P> <P> Enactment of the bills today was a major defeat for the powerful National Rifle  Assn., which organized a campaign of letter-writing and phone calls to  legislators by its more than 500,000 California members.  </P> <P> The NRA has vowed to continue its fight with a lawsuit challenging the  constitutionality of the ban.  </P></p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee price touches 17-year low LONDON ROBUSTA coffee prices touched 17-year lows in early trading yesterday as the recent downtrend continued. Long liquidation pushed the July contract down to Dollars 782 a tonne, the cheapest level for a second-month contract since the market switched from sterling to dollars last year. However, the market recovered most of the losses in the afternoon as profit-taking purchases emerged, July closing just Dollars 1 down at Dollars 797 a tonne. Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London futures dealer, said the market was very oversold, with some operators willing to push it down further. It was difficult to see a bullish factor emerging before the International Coffee Organisation meeting in late June. Future ICO developments 'promise to be one of the biggest market factors,' according to the latest World Commodity Forecasts from the Economist Intelligence Unit. The EIU believes that the prospect of a new international agreement with economic clauses has improved through the greater flexibility shown recently by Brazil, the world's biggest producer.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Taipei, June 11 (CNA) -- Republic of China [ROC]  Premier Lien Chan returned to Taipei early Saturday [11 June]  morning after a four-country tour, which took him to El  Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico and the United States.    Lien, accompanied by his wife and several government  officials, arrived at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport at  5:47 A.M., 20 minutes ahead of schedule. The Liens soon left  the airport for home.    The advance arrival allowed Lien to avoid an encounter with  a  group of opposition legislators who arrived at the airport  around 6 A.M. to protest Lien's alleged illegal instructions to  state-run companies to offer ruling Kuomintang [KMT] lawmakers  easier access to bidding for their construction projects.    Failing to meet Lien, the Democratic Progressive Party  lawmakers, headed by Yen Chin-fu, said they will launch a series  of demonstrations around the island to push the government to  stop the practice of taking "kickbacks" among the ruling party,  state-run firms and KMT lawmakers.    Many ranking officials, including Foreign Affairs Minister  Chien Fu, greeted Lien at the airport.    During an in-flight news conference on his way from New York  to Taipei, Lien said his three-country Central American tour  will help strengthen the Republic of China's relations with that  region.    "I'm happy as I have accomplished my mission as expected,"  Lien told reporters who had covered his official visits to El  Salvador and Guatemala.    Lien said his three-day unofficial visit to Mexico was very  fruitful. While there, Lien met with many Mexican political and  business heavyweights for wide-ranging talks.    Lien would not reveal with which Mexican officials he had  talked. He instead said he had managed to meet with whomever he  planned to see.    Lien was the highest-ranking ROC official to visit Mexico  since the two countries severed diplomatic ties 23 years ago.    Lien said he is optimistic about future Taiwan-Mexico ties,  particularly in the economic and cultural fields. "Mexican  authorities have shown keen interest in promoting commercial,  tourist and cultural exchanges with Taiwan," he said.    Taiwan will benefit from boosting cooperation with Mexico as  Mexico has signed the North American Free Trade Agreement with  the United States and Canada and has maintained close relations  with Caribbean and Central American nations, Lien said.</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Mersey area set for Pounds 176m aid fund A Pounds 176m package of European Union and UK public and private sector spending on 780 projects to start reviving Merseyside's economy will be announced today. More than 400 projects were rejected. The money is part of a Pounds 1.6bn six-year programme, underpinned by Pounds 630m of EU grants. Merseyside is entitled to special 'Objective One' funds because its output per head is less than 75 per cent of the EU average. The Pounds 176m - made up of Pounds 75m each from the European Commission and UK public sector and Pounds 26m from industry and commerce - will go to provide 25,000 training places, 3,900 new jobs and 341,000 sq ft of modern industrial space, as well as preparing 291 acres of land ready for development. Fifty-six per cent of the EU grants will go to regional development with the rest going to social funds, a marked shift from government proposals earlier this year which would have used most of the money for social purposes such as training. Projects include: A Pounds 43m programme to improve industrial estates at Haydock on the M6, Kirkby on the M57 and in Bootle, Liverpool, Birkenhead and Wirral. A grant of Pounds 1m will help fund an initial Pounds 2.78m campaign by a partnership of local authorities, universities, colleges, industry and commerce to improve Merseyside's poor image. A grant of Pounds 3m for the port of Liverpool to improve facilities and speed up access to the docks. More than Pounds 4m to be spent on Queen's Square, an area of Liverpool city centre blighted by abandoned property development schemes. Pounds 2.5m to improve 'Atlantic Avenue', the A565 trunk road linking Liverpool, the docks at Bootle and the coastal towns of Crosby, Formby and Southport. An initial Pounds 100,000 to help establish a fund to support new products and processes among small and medium-sized enterprises. Training and enterprise councils will run a Pounds 4m scheme to assist business start-ups. The initial target is 1,300 new businesses.</p>

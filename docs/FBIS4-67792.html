			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Subhash Kirpekar of the TIMES OF INDIA] </F>   [Text] The relations between India and Pakistan have been  deteriorating. The unfortunate part is that they are not  showing any signs of improving mainly because Pakistan wants to  internationalize the Kashmir issue which is essentially a  bilateral matter. The proposed sale of 38 F-16 aircraft by the  United States to Pakistan can by no stretch of imagination be  seen as a measure to improve the ground situation and prepare  for peace in the region. Proliferation cannot be prevented by  delivery system for nuclear bombs. This will only trigger an  arms race and divert funds from poverty removal and development  programs so necessary for the malnourished and deprived  population in both India and Pakistan.    The Indian position has intrinsic merits and cannot be  wished  away or brushed off by Washington if it genuinely wants South  Asia as a zone of peace. In the event of the sale of F-16's by  waiving the Pressler Amendment coming through, the Indian reply  could well be to have as many Agni [long-range  surface-to-surface] missiles. Interestingly, Washington wants  New Delhi to stop the deployment of Agni missile. Washington  has to decide then whether it should show genuine concern for  peace in this region or superimpose this with its concern for  the prosperity of the domestic arms lobby which stands to rack  in $800 million by selling the F-16's.    If the United States is to be credible then its actions will  have to match its words. At the moment, they do not appear to  synchronize. And what is this capping of nuclear weapons  capability by Islamabad that Washington is talking of? If media  reports on Pakistan are to be believed, then the statement by  General Beg at a recent seminar in Karachi is an eye-opener. He  said that Pakistan has done the capping five years ago and that,  too, without verification of nuclear installations by  Washington. What is implied is that America should not go in  for any verification now. Also if the capping has already been  done by Pakistan, then the question that arises is why should  the United States treat capping as a new concession and reward  Pakistan with F-16's. Is this some king of massive hoax?    In the circumstances, what Mr. Strobe Talbott, U.S. deputy  secretary of state in the Clinton administration, could try to  do during his current visit to India is try to work for a  verification package with India applying international  inspection to check out if the use of fissile materials is  really for peaceful purposes. Since Mr. Talbott's next halt  after New Delhi is at Islamabad, he could repeat the same offer  there also.    Washington's contradictions are quizzing. It talks of human  rights [word indistinct] of those very countries which are the  worst perpetrators of human rights violations. It talks of  democracy and then assists undemocratic regimes. It talks of  peace and prepares a conflict situation. It knows that Pakistan  is sponsoring terrorism in Kashmir through armed secessionist  groups. It knows Pakistan wants to grab Kashmir by force,  something India will never permit. It knows that Pakistan  disagrees with agreements signed by it like the Simla agreement.  Since what was signed by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, one would have  thought that his daughter Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto would  have thought seriously of implementing it, but America does  little to persuade Pakistan to shed its belligerence and  obstinacy. The observation that Pakistan was born in sin [as  heard] and lives on hatred of India is not off the mark.  Successive regimes in Pakistan have thrived on India-baiting  and bashing. At various international forums, including the  Human Rights Commission in Geneva where Pakistan suffered a  major diplomatic fiasco recently, it has sought to target India  and hide its own gross violations of human rights, deny the  fundamental rights to the people of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir  and northern territories of Hunza, Gilgit, and Baltistan and the  violent suppression of minorities like the Christians, Hindus,  and the Ahmediyas.</p>

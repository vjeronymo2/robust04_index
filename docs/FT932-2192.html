			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Fashion: A totally tasteful Ascot? - never / After a day's serious frock-watching artist Margaret Keedy and Lucia van der Post found time for fun and frivolity THE GREAT thing about Ascot-dress is never, ever to confuse it with fashion. Ascot, like most of the summer events which collectively make-up the season, could be declared a fashion-free zone. It is one unto itself. But, to the dedicated frock-observer and serious follower of the season, it offers some interesting pointers to the habits and mores of that mysterious breed - the ladies-who-lunch. One thing is clear - if an invitation to one of the set-piece events of the season comes your way do not, if you want to feel you belong, bring out your Issey Miyake, your Romeo Gigli, your directional Martin Margiela or Ann Demeulemeester. Keep them for wearing to a lecture at the Design Museum, to a smart lunch with your girl-friends or to any event where the Voguettes gather (after all, they would know that those seams on the outside and the fraying edges are absolutely the dernier cri and would not for a minute think that you had put your clothes on inside out). What you need are the sort of soft, pretty clothes that have nothing to do with being at the cutting-edge of fashion but everything to do with flattery. The new long, softer look, based as it is on floaty, sensual fabrics and more delicate lines is perfect for going to the races, to Henley, to summer operas, to weddings and garden parties. As for trousers, fashion editors this year have got fearfully excited at uncovering a hither-to forgotten rule which deems that at Ascot women may after all wear trousers provided the jacket and trousers are made from matching fabrics. The other happy thought is that (almost) anything goes. A glance at Margaret Keedy's sketches of some of the outfits on display last Tuesday will reassure all those who have ever felt timid about what to wear. Take comfort from the thought that no matter what you wear there will always be somebody better dressed and others who are worse dressed. Ascot is not the time or the place for an excess of sobriety. It is a time for fun and frivolity, for laughter and chat. For objective observers of the passing scene much of the fun lies in the variety. A totally tasteful Ascot does not bear thinking about. After a day's serious frock-watching I came, for what it is worth, to a few gentle conclusions. Gentlemen, I decided, should resist the temptation to brighten up their grey morning coats with dotty waistcoats or daft ties. They should resist even more strenuously any suggestion that their waistcoats should match her dress. And if you think that goes without saying, then you did not see what I saw at Ascot this week. Women should resist too many ruffles and frills and especially frilled peplums outside straight skirts. Too many cut-away straps and too much flesh is not really very pretty away from a beach or pool. Unless you are one of those enviable beings who does not get out of bed for less than Pounds 10,000 then I think it unwise to wear a masculine top-coat over a very short mini-skirt and very high heels - and even if you are one of those enviable beings you would probably look better in something else. White shoes are the Queen Mother's special terrain and only the very young or the very beautiful can get away with severe little bowlers. Herbaceous borders really look their best in gardens, a thought that might be particularly addressed by larger ladies. The prevalent tendency to wear a printed silk dress and pick out one colour (usually the most obvious) in which to have a straw hat made, came to seem a little predictable. There are, of course, several favourite looks on offer. There is Eurochic (snappy little suits with above-the-knee skirts, eye-catching straw hats and lots of gold jewellery) and English Rose (pale, long strings of beads, echoes of 1920s, an addiction to floribunda, whether on frock, shawl or hat and just occasionally on all three). Then there is the Dress-to-be-photographed look - forget charm, prettiness and elegance, here what really counts is nerve. Dotty hats, bare midriffs, lots of decolletage, acres of leg (no matter what their length or shape) are what seems to get the lenses pointing. Officials at Ascot retain this charming old-fashioned notion that the punters do not wished to be disturbed by vulgar photographers and so keep them herded on a balcony. If you stand on the balcony you do not come away with the same impression. Up and down the Dress-to-be-photographed set go - first one way and then the next. Wait 15 minutes and here they come again. Or you could, if you you could carry it off, aim for what you might call Glamourpuss-style - short, tight dress (forget lunch), high-heels, eye-catching hat, loads of make-up. Of Recession Chic I saw not a sign, though there was a bit of tutting in the press room from the pundits who, from time to time recognised . . . oh, the shame of it . . . last year's dress. My own favourite looks veered towards the under-stated, the quiet monochrome colour-schemes. There was the older woman I saw in a simple but beautifully-cut soft pink coat-dress with pearls and a soft black straw hat: the cream suit, (It's cooler in the shade) with the soft flared trousers and the beautiful straw hat; the quiet long cream skirt and jacket (Cream of the Crop); the floaty navy and cream skirt worn with a long, soft cream top. Longer lines definitely looked newer and prettier. All these managed to carry off that difficult double of being both elegant and pretty. The nicest hats were the big soft straws. The chicest heads had the hair tucked away from the face. Hard little boaters on top of flowing tresses are not becoming. I belong to the school of thought that concurs with hatter David Shilling's dictum about hats: 'The sole purpose of a hat is to make you look more beautiful. If it does not, do not wear it.' Some people, of course, come to watch the horses. You can tell who they are because they carry binoculars and have a purposeful air heading for areas into which the dress-to-be-seen set never venture. Above all, you can tell who they are because they do not loiter endlessly in front of the photographers' stand.</p>

			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. PERMANENTLY OUTLAWS IMPORTED ASSAULT WEAPONS;  </P> <P> ATF BANS ALL BUT 7 GUN TYPES  </P> <P> The Bush Administration today slapped a permanent import ban on 43 types of  assault-style firearms whose shipment into the country has been suspended since  spring.  </P> <P> Stephen E. Higgins, director of the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol,  Tobacco and Firearms, said the government had studied 50 styles of  semiautomatic weapons imported into the country and had decided to ban all but  seven of them permanently.  </P> <P> The ATF has been studying the use of the suspended weapons to determine if they  fit the requirement that they be used for sporting purposes.  </P> <P> The Gun Control Act of 1968 bans the importation of weapons that are not used  for legitimate sporting purposes.  </P> <P> "The study was undertaken because of the dramatic increase in the number of  these weapons being imported and police reports of their use in violent crime,"  Higgins said.  </P> <P> As a result of the study, 43 of the weapons were classified officially as  semiautomatic assault rifles and as such were barred from further importation.  </P> <P> Higgins said in April that the weapons under study were "basically paramilitary  in appearance" and had large-capacity magazines.  </P> <P> Of the seven models exempted from the import ban, six are .22-caliber rimfire  rifles and the other a gun called the Valmet Hunter, which had been considered  an AK-47 type of weapon during the suspension.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Flood of Guns Expected  </P> <P> The ATF said recently that importers were preparing to flood the country with  nearly a million weapons if the suspension were lifted. The suspension covered  new import permits as well as those weapons for which permits already had been  granted and which were en route to this country.  </P> <P> The bureau, which has the power to control imports, does not regulate domestic  manufacture of weapons, so similar weapons made in the United States would not  be affected by the action. Several bills pending in Congress would control or  eliminate many of the U.S.-made assault weapons.  </P> <P> The ATF has estimated that domestic models account for 75% of the 3 million  semiautomatic rifles now owned by Americans. Colt Industries suspended sales of  its AR-15 in March.  </P> <P> President Bush, a lifetime member of the National Rifle Assn., which opposes  limits on weapons, came into office opposing any bans on the assault weapons. A  public outcry over the availability of the weapons was triggered in January  when a man opened fire with an AK-47 and other weapons on a schoolyard in  Stockton, Calif., killing five children. The man, Patrick Purdy, later killed  himself.  </P> <P> Sarah Brady, chairwoman of Handgun Control Inc., praised the ATF's action,  saying it "confirms what was long known: that these imported assault weapons do  not serve a legitimate sporting purpose."  </P> <P> John M. Snyder, spokesman for the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and  Bear Arms, denounced the action. "I think that it shows the undependability of  government, because originally, the ATF had certified that these rifles could  be imported because they are suitable for sporting purposes," Snyder said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, 1 Jun (AFP) -- The dissolved Nigerian Senate  this evening declared the ruling military administration  "illegal" and called for "the official publication of the  results of the 12 June 1993 presidential elections, canceled by  the soldiers.    In a communique signed by its president, Ameh Ebute, a copy  of which has reached AFP, the senate "decides to restore all  democratic institutions" of Nigeria, "calls for the publication  of the results of the June 12 election", and the "formation of a  government of national unity and reconciliation...by the elected  president."    Moshood Abiola, the billionaire Yoruba Muslim, claims to  have  won the 12 June 1993 elections on the basis of official results  published in each of the 30 states of the federation after the  closure of polling stations, and collected by his supporters.  These results were never officially published by the National  Electoral Commission in Abuja, the federal capital, as  stipulated by the Constitution. This is because the former  administration of General Ibrahim Babangida said the elections  were full of irregularities which, up to now, have not been  proved.    The Senate and all democratic institutions of Nigeria were  dissolved on 18 November 1993 by General Abacha, 24 hours after  his sudden takeover of power in the country.</p>

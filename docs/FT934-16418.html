			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: QVC arranges Dollars 4bn finance for Paramount bid QVC Network, the home shopping channel headed by Mr Barry Diller, yesterday said it had arranged financing of Dollars 4bn to back its Dollars 9.5bn bid for Paramount Communications. It also said it had delivered evidence of the financing arrangements to Paramount in an approach which could spark discussions for the first time between the company and directors of Paramount. The board of the besieged TV and film production company, which is backing a rival Dollars 7.5bn offer from cable TV group Viacom, has said it would consider the QVC bid when there was 'satisfactory evidence' of financing to support it. Paramount confirmed yesterday afternoon that it had received financing documents and said it would review them. Sources close to the company said the board was expected to meet next week to decide if the QVC bid could be fully financed, and if so, to authorise discussions with QVC. QVC's Dollars 4bn comprises two Dollars 500m equity investments in the company that had already been reported, from Comcast and Liberty Media, and commitments from six banks to provide Dollars 500m each towards a bid. The six are Chemical Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia, Barclays, LTCB Trust, NationsBank and Toronto Dominion Bank. QVC's cash-and-share bid for Paramount includes Dollars 30 per share in cash, or Dollars 3.52bn. Viacom gained a powerful ally on Monday for its bid when Nynex, the 'Baby Bell' regional telephone company serving the north-eastern US, agreed to invest Dollars 1.2bn in the company. The deal, together with a similar Dollars 600m investment in Viacom last week by video retailer Blockbuster Entertainment, will give the company a war-chest of almost Dollars 2bn with which it could increase its bid, which contains only Dollars 9.10 a share in cash. QVC declined to comment yesterday on reports it had been talking to other 'Baby Bell' telephone companies about potential alliances, including BellSouth, the Atlanta-based company which covers the south-eastern US. Moody's Investors Service, the credit rating agency, said yesterday it had placed Nynex under review for possible downgrade because of the Viacom deal. Shares in QVC rose Dollars 1 1/8 yesterday to Dollars 55 7/8 , valuing its bid at Dollars 80 a share, while Viacom's A shares dipped Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 57 1/8 and its B shares Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 53 1/8 , valuing its bid at just over Dollars 62 1/2. Paramount closed down Dollars 1 at Dollars 76 3/4. Lex, Page 22</p>

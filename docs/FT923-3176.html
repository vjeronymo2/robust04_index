			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / People: Woolf to be a law lord Sir Harry Woolf, the Appeal Court judge who headed an in-depth review of the prison system following the riot at Strangeways in 1990, has been appointed a Law Lord in succession to Lord Ackner who is retiring at the end of September. Sir Harry, 59, whose name is linked in legal circles with the development of judicial review, had been widely tipped for promotion either to the House of Lords or as Lord Donaldson's successor as Master of the Rolls. His appointment as a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary seemed certain after Sir Thomas Bingham was appointed the new Master of the Rolls last month. Their promotions, combined with the retirement of three other Appeal Court judges, have left a number of positions to be filled in the Court of Appeal. Sir David Hirst, Sir Simon Brown, Sir Anthony Evans, Sir Christopher Rose and Sir Leonard Hoffmann have all been promoted to the Appeal Court.</p>

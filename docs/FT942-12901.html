			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Loss deepens to Dollars 29m at Kaiser Aluminum Kaiser Aluminum reported losses deepened in the first quarter to Dollars 29.3m, or 58 cents a share, excluding special charges, from losses in last year's first quarter of Dollars 16.6m, or 29 cents a share. The company's net loss for the first quarter, including a restructuring charge of Dollars 5.4m, was Dollars 34.7m or 67 cents per share. 'Most of our facilities reported good operating performance and strong demand,' said Mr George Haymaker, Kaiser chairman. Kaiser cut its US primary aluminium output by 25 per cent in the first quarter of 1993, and this year intends to cut worldwide production by 9.3 per cent. It will now be operating at an annual production rate of 390,000 tonnes of primary aluminium, or 77 per cent of its total annual capacity of 508,000 tonnes. Kaiser's first-quarter sales dipped to Dollars 415.1m in the first quarter because of production cutbacks, down from Dollars 442.6m in the 1993 first quarter. Kaiser is 60 per cent owned by Maxxam, a diversified natural resources company. Maxxam reported a first-quarter loss of Dollars 34.5m or Dollars 3.65 per share on sales of Dollars 489m, compared with a first-quarter 1993 loss of Dollars 25.9m or Dollars 2.74 per share on sales of Dollars 513.7m.</p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'SELLING OUT' BEGINS WITH INNOCENT ELBOW-RUBBING;  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT: IT'S EASY FOR OFFICIALS TO BE INFLUENCED WHEN THEY HANG OUT WITH  THE SO-CALLED 'RIGHT PEOPLE.'  </P> <P> It was student government day, and a group of Newport Beach high school  students were considering a hypothetical development project at a mock city  council meeting. A student approached the lectern and demanded that one of the  student "councilmen" abstain from voting, charging improprieties and claiming  to have seen the "councilman" with the project developer at a restaurant.  </P> <P> The incident added a little spark to the proceedings. Yet, sadly, it was a  reflection of the lack of trust many people, even high school students, have in  public officials. Unfortunately, this is not without reason.  </P> <P> We read stories of investigations or arrests in blatant cases of influence  peddling or bribery, as politicians or political contributors are led off to  jail. Still, as an elected official and professional planner with a public  agency, I believe that the vast majority of public officials stay within the  law. But is that enough? If something's not technically illegal, does that make  it OK? What about that breakfast?  </P> <P> Local officials who'd be aghast if offered an outright bribe often fall prey to  a more insidious form of influence. One is asked to go to lunch, or to join in  a round of golf, to have answered "any questions you might have" or explained  "where we're coming from." Few would argue that a free golf game or lunch is  sufficient "bribe" to influence a vote, and the cost of either falls well below  most reporting limits. But what occurs during that lunch or golf game?  </P> <P> First of all, the host gets a few hours, undisturbed, to "sell" his position.  Yet, surprisingly little time is actually spent talking business. Most of the  time is spent in extraneous chitchat, establishing a rapport. The persuasion is  subtle.  </P> <P> Remember the subliminal movie commercials in the '50s? A picture of popcorn or  a cold drink would be flashed on the screen so quickly that it didn't register  in the conscious mind but affected the subconscious enough to cause a run on  popcorn or cold drinks at intermission. That's what happens with public  officials. They're invited to social affairs or to lunch at a nice restaurant.  They are stroked. And between comments about the weather and the pate, oh, so  subliminally, they are seduced.  </P> <P> Don't feel holier than thou! It could happen to you, too. Picture it:  </P> <P> Every day you hear from numerous constituents, most of whom have a complaint or  a problem. It's rewarding when you're able to help, but often there's just  nothing you can do.  </P> <P> Many of the people who call have never dealt with government before and have  trouble explaining their situation. Sometimes they are angry or abusive. You go  to a neighborhood to check things out and get a flat tire, or someone's dog  mistakes your leg for a fire hydrant.  </P> <P> You may not get much positive reinforcement from the public. Ninety-nine votes  they like, and you hear nothing. One they don't, and you're pond scum.  </P> <P> Then, in walks Mr. Government Relations in his $1,200 suit. He gleams with  success. He's elegant, he's articulate, and he treats you like his friend. You,  the one who clips coupons and scrimps to pay the mortgage. He has chosen you!  You bask in the glow of his attention.  </P> <P> You spend more and more time with "important people." Dinner here, a concert  there. They do you little favors -- give you a lead on a contract or a great  deal on a new car. Even better, they guide political contributors your way.  That's just networking. No problem. Everyone does it.  </P> <P> You start expecting things. You love approving new upscale restaurants and  hotels because they have such nice opening night parties. You're invited, of  course.  </P> <P> Soon you're spending little time with regular folks, hearing only one side of  the issues. You forget any other side exists, since all the beautiful,  successful people agree on the "right positions." If you want to be truly  beautiful and successful, then you'll have the "right positions," too.  </P> <P> Some say you've sold out, but it's not true. You're just more enlightened.  You're being taught by people who are rich and powerful -- the "right people."  They wouldn't steer you wrong. They're your friends.  </P> <P> You deny the true motive behind this "friendship." You pretend these people  would still fawn over you even if you voted differently or recommended denial  of a project, but you lack the courage to do so and find out.  </P> <P> It happens. I've seen it happen to elected officials and to professional staff.  There's nothing illegal about it, but it's unethical. It's also very sad.  </P> <P> People should be able to trust their government. High school kids shouldn't  have to accept influence-peddling as a fact of life -- but it is. It's so  subtle that the person being influenced can deny it even to himself, making it  all the more pernicious. And it all starts with a free lunch.  </P></p>

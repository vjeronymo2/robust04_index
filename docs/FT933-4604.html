			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Fisons held back by losses in instruments FISONS, the pharmaceuticals and scientific equipment company, yesterday reported pre-tax profits for the first six months to June 30 at the lower end of expectations. Profits rose 5 per cent from Pounds 45.7m to Pounds 46.4m. Turnover rose 14 per cent to Pounds 651m, but was boosted by currency changes. The results were held back by a poor performance from the scientific instrument operations which fell into loss. Fisons's shares fell 6 1/2 p to 170 1/2 p. Mr Mike Redmond, pharmaceuticals managing director, said Fisons was looking to license a number of asthma compounds. These included products either fully developed or in late development, which could be co-marketed by Fisons. The aim would be to fill the gap left by Tipredane, the asthma drug halted in April. Fisons was also looking for agreements to develop other compounds in the early stages, said Mr Redmond. Mr Cedric Scroggs, chief executive, said he still did not know when officials from the US Food and Drug Administration would visit the factory of Opticrom, the eye product. The treatment was withdrawn from the US in 1989 following FDA concerns over manufacturing procedures. Mr Scroggs said the importance of Opticrom's relaunch was becoming increasingly less significant. Its US patents expire next September and the company has formed a strategic alliance with Allergan, a US group, to co-market Opticrom's main competitor, Acular. Trading profits at the pharmaceuticals division rose from Pounds 22.3m to Pounds 29.4m on sales up 22 per cent at Pounds 213.7m. At constant exchange rates, the sales increase was 6 per cent. Profits were helped by sales rises in the US and manufacturing savings, but were affected by health reforms in Germany and Italy, said Mr Scroggs. Sales of Tilade, the new asthma product, rose 13.6 per cent. Mr Redmond said there had been 27,000 prescriptions for it in the US in the six weeks after its launch in June. Operating profits at the scientific equipment business fell from Pounds 17.1m to Pounds 13.2m. The instruments business made a loss of about Pounds 2m. Customers were putting off capital investment and competitors' price cuts were affecting margins. Earnings per share were steady at 4.2p. The dividend was unchanged at 3.3p. Lex, Page 20</p>

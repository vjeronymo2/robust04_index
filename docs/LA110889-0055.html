			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRACELAND DIGGING JUST ROUTINE WORK  </P> <P> One thing the people at Elvis Presley's house never run short of is rumors, so  they're putting out the word early that the digging set to begin tonight at  Graceland is nothing sinister.  </P> <P> Crews are resealing the basement wall, that's all, said Todd Morgan, a  spokesman for the Presley residence and its souvenir shopping center.  </P> <P> The three-story, white-columned home draws 600,000 tourists a year. Rumors that  Presley, who died 12 years ago, was alive set off a flurry of reported Elvis  sightings a year or so ago.  </P> <P> Whenever construction projects get under way at Graceland, the phones start  ringing, Morgan said. "The simplest of household chores at Graceland become  international headlines," he said.  </P></p>

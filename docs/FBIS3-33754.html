			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Arab Maghreb Union summit, which was due to be  held on 5 February [in Tunis], has been postponed to a later  date, according to well-informed sources. This official  postponement announced by the host country, Tunisia, does not  cancel the Council of Ministers' meeting of the Arab Maghreb  Union scheduled for the same day, 5 February, in the Tunisian  capital.    The decision to postpone the summit, which was taken by  Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, was at the request  of Mauritanian President Maaouiya Ould Sid Ahmed Taya, in view  of the current developments on the Mauritanian political scene,  resulting from the recent municipal elections in that country.    This Mauritanian request is not the only reason why the  summit was postponed, because according to the same source, King  Hassan II [of Morocco] was going to be represented at this  summit by an envoy. Moreover, Mr. Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi has  also announced that he will not be attending the summit  proceedings. Algeria, which took over the chairmanship of the  union on 1 January 1994, had prepared the proceedings of this  summit [as heard] and [words indistinct] supported Tunisia's  request for a postponement.</p>

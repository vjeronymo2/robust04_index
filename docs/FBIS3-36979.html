The Ranks of  its Opponents Changing Formation"]    [Text] The Duma committee for CIS affairs and relations  with compatriots held closed-door hearings yesterday on  questions of Russia-Georgia relations in connection with the  treaty of friendship, good-neighborliness, and cooperation  between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Georgia  signed by Boris Yeltsin and Eduard Shevardnadze on 3 February.    The pivotal topics of the hearings were points 3 and 4 of  the  treaty "on aid in the creation of armed forces of the Republic  of Georgia, equipping them, and the acquisition of armaments,  military hardware and technology," and on border troops of  Russia and Georgia, as well as a point on the recognition of the  republic's territorial integrity -- that is to say, questions  which in sum could lead to an exacerbation of the situation in  the region. Aired at the hearings were messages from many  Caucasus regions whose authorities doubt that the Georgian side  could guarantee that arms provided by Russia will not end up in  the hands of criminal elements, while Mr. Zatulin, chairman of  the committee for CIS affairs, voiced bewilderment in connection  with the appearance in the text of the treaty of the names of  concrete military bases and of their "branches" on the territory  of Georgia.    Present at the hearings were deputations of the Foreign  Ministry; the Defense Ministry; the State Committee on Civil  Defense, Emergency Situations, and Recovery from Natural  Disasters; the Ministry for CIS Affairs; the Finance Ministry,  and of the other executive branch agencies privy to the  elaboration of the treaty and the concomitant agreements, and in  addition to them, separately, representatives of the contracting  parties of Georgia and Abkhazia.    The arguments in favor of signing the treaty presented by  Mr.  Pastukhov, deputy foreign minister; by Colonel General Galkin,  Defense Ministry representative; and by Mr. Smirnov of the  Ministry for CIS Affairs, were sufficiently well considered,  according to parliamentary analysts, and raised no special  objections from deputies and experts. The main opponent of the  arguments was a representative of Abkhazia, Mr. Dzhevgeniya, who  put the main stress on the unsettled status of relations between  Sukhumi and Tbilisi.    At the close of the session, journalists were admitted to  the  room to hear commentaries from participants in the hearings.  Konstantin Zatulin promised a corresponding statement from his  committee, but not before Monday. On the whole, the deputies'  dissatisfactions with the agreement boiled down to two: first,  the text of the documents; second, the signing procedure. The  latter dissatisfaction seems to have especially hurt the  committee on CIS affairs and its chairman personally: The  documents had been prepared without their knowledge, the appeal  by all Duma factions to the president not to sign the treaty for  the time being had been ignored, and Boris Yeltsin's word that  he was not going to submit the document for ratification before  Georgian-Abkhaz and Georgian-Ossetian relations have been  normalized, placed the authors of the above appeal in an idiotic  situation. Mr. Zatulin tried to get out of it by pointing out,  on one hand, the fruitful contacts with the executive branch at  the time of organizing the hearings; and on the other, by  supposing that it was the appeal of the Duma factions that made  the president wait a little for the ratification of the treaty.  A plausible version, but too elaborate.    Most likely, the main objective of those who arranged the  hearings was to demonstrate their ability to organize calm  multilateral negotiations and discussions, while their motive  was the fact that Mr. Zatulin apparently did not wish to be  branded for causing yet another standoff between the two power  branches.</p>

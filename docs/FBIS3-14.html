			<p>SUMMARY                                    Russian President Boris Yeltsin is carrying out yet another  reorganization of his presidential apparatus, this time clearly  to help him expand presidential power vis-a-vis parliament and  the cabinet.  The new constitution pushed through by Yeltsin  after disbanding the Supreme Soviet gives the president more  control over the cabinet and the rest of government, and the  current reorganization is being justified by the need to expand  his staff to exercise these expanded powers.  The strengthening  of the president's apparatus and especially his analytical and  policy making staff is important for the prospects for reform  since with a unsympathetic parliament and a less reformist  cabinet, reform policies more than ever depend on a strong  president.                           END SUMMARY      Since December Yeltsin has been creating new agencies directly  subordinate to the president, adding new assistants, expanding  the Security Council structure, and now is preparing an edict to  reorganize and strengthen his "Administration" (the presidential  staff).  Although he has apparently not yet signed the edict, the  reasons for the reorganization and its main features are being  widely reported in the press.  Administration leaders have  claimed that the main reason for the reorganization is that  because of the president's increased powers under the new  constitution, he requires a bigger staff to help him initiate  policies and run more of the government.  Administration Leader  Sergey Filatov told ITAR-TASS on 15 February that the additional  presidential powers in the new constitution necessitate  reorganization of the Administration and that a new economic  analysis service, finance and budget directorate, and  international department are being created to help the president  stay "well informed" on the economy, budget, and tax policy.  Nikolay Medvedev, head of the Administration's Directorate for  Work with Territories and Presidential Representatives, also  stated that the Administration was to be reorganized to bring it  into line with the new constitution (Segodnya, 19 January).      Reports of an impending reorganization of the Administration  began to appear in early January (Kuranty, 5 January; Georgiy  Satarov to ITAR-TASS on 5 January; Segodnya, 6 January; Nikolay  Medvedev to Segodnya, 19 January).  Filatov told ITAR-TASS on 21  January that Yeltsin would probably sign a decree reorganizing  the Administration the next week.  Over three weeks later, the  decree had not appeared but he again told ITAR-TASS on 15  February that Yeltsin would sign the decree in a few days.  On 19  February he told Interfax that Yeltsin had the proposals for the  reorganization on his desk.      Split Between Filatov and Ilyushin      The delay was apparently caused by disagreements over two rival  plans presented by the two main groups in Yeltsin's personal  staff--the Administration led by Filatov and Yeltsin's assistants  and advisers led by First Assistant to the President Viktor  Ilyushin.  Segodnya reported on 6 January that Filatov favored a  plan worked out by his first deputy, Sergey Krasavchenko, which  concentrated analysis in a single center in the Administration,  while Ilyushin backed a plan worked out by members of the  Presidential Council to expand the role of presidential  assistants, giving them their own analytical staffs outside the  Administration.  Moscow News (4-10 February) also reported that  Filatov and Ilyushin were pushing rival plans and said that  Yeltsin had not yet chosen which to accept.  Kommersant-Daily on  10 February reported that a compromise plan had been worked out,  making Ilyushin "for the first time officially equal in status"  to Filatov and strengthening the group of personal assistants,  but accepting most of Filatov's proposals regarding the  Administration's structure (see box on "Reorganization of  Administration").  News reports of the disagreements apparently  prompted Filatov and Ilyushin to appear together on the  television news program "Itogi" on 20 February to deny that there  had been disagreements and to declare that they have "a joint,  agreed on version" of the Administration reorganization, which  divides functions between the Administration and assistants.  This compromise arrangement would appear to heighten the  potential for conflict between the already competing parallel  structures of the Administration and staff of assistants by  making them even more independent, rival power bases.      Other Recent Changes      Yeltsin's effort to strengthen presidential structures has been  evident since December in the addition of more personal  assistants to his staff, his assumption of control over more key  government agencies, the creation of new organs under the  president, and the strengthening of the Security Council's  commission structure.      New Assistants      Yeltsin has added two new reform-minded assistants (pomoshchniki)  to his present four, who were less involved in policy, at least  publicly:      --He created a new post of national security assistant and named  outspoken reformer Yuriy Baturin to it on 6 January (Ostankino  TV, ITAR-TASS, 6 January).  Baturin explained to Interfax (7  January) that he would coordinate the activities of the  intelligence, counterintelligence, and other security services.  He had joined Yeltsin's staff as an assistant on legal and  political matters in June (Sobraniye Aktov Prezidenta i  Pravitelstva Rossiyskoy Federatsii, 7 June 1993, page 2400) on  condition that he could continue to speak out publicly (Novaya  Yezhednevnaya Gazeta, 7 July 1993).      --Sociologist Georgiy Satarov, who as a Presidential Council  member has often voiced sharp opinions to newsmen, was named  assistant to the president on 8 February (Russian TV, ITAR-TASS,  8 February; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 9 February), and he explained in  a 12 February Ostankino TV interview that he will handle  presidential ties with the Federal Assembly and parties and  public organizations and constitutional questions.  He has  occasionally riled Yeltsin with his public remarks (See Note 1)  and told Rossiyskiye Vesti (12 February) that he feels Yeltsin  wants him to continue to speak out independently and offer  differing opinions.      (Note 1)  In October, while Yeltsin was visiting Japan, Satarov  suggested presidential elections be held simultaneous with  parliamentary elections, undercutting Yeltsin's stand and  prompting Yeltsin to publicly threaten to fire him (Obshchaya  Gazeta, 15-21 October 1993).      Control Over Power Ministries      Yeltsin has assumed more control over some key cabinet ministries  and other government agencies, clearly strengthening his power  over the most sensitive security and communications agencies to  protect himself against potential challenges.  His 10 January  edict "On the Structure of Federal Organs of Executive Power"  listed 10 agencies which henceforth will be "subordinate to the  president of the Russian Federation on questions put under him by  the Russian Federation Constitution or in accord with legislative  acts of the Russian Federation":  the Ministries of Defense,  Internal Affairs, and Foreign Affairs, the Main Directorate for  Protection, the Foreign Intelligence Service, the Federal Agency  for Government Communications and Information, the Federal Border  Service, the Federal Counterintelligence Service, the Federal  Service for Television and Radio Broadcasting, and the State  Archive Service (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 12 January).      New Presidential Organs      In recent weeks Yeltsin has created a number of new organs  directly under the president, expanding the already cumbersome  structure run directly by the president.  In some cases it is not  clear if they add to his political- power, but for some reason the  president considered it necessary to put them under his direct  control rather than under the cabinet or elsewhere in the  government.  In addition to creating the Federal  Counterintelligence Service and the Federal Border Service  specifically under the president in mid and late December:      --On 31 December Yeltsin issued an edict creating a Judicial  Chamber for Information Disputes (Sudebnaya Palata po  Informatsionnym Sporam) under the president (Rossiyskaya Gazeta,  10 January), which apparently can be used to strengthen the  president's control over the media.  According to ITAR-TASS, it  will be able to decide matters such as allotment of radio and  television coverage to the parliament and can warn media if they  violate the Law on the Mass Media.  Chairman Anatoliy Vengerov  said that the chamber will enforce constitutional provisions on  information rights and assist the president in protecting freedom  of the press (ITAR-TASS, 5 January).  The new constitution  "guarantees the freedom of mass information" (article 29) and  declares the president "the guarantor" of the constitution and  the rights and freedoms of citizens (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 25  December 1993).      --On 18 January Yeltsin created a new post for conducting his  dealings with parliament--the president's plenipotentiary  representative in the Federal Assembly (polnomochnyy predstavitel  prezidenta v Federalnom Sobranii--Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 20 January)  and named legal specialist Aleksandr M. Yakovlev to the post  (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 25 January).      --On 12 February Yeltsin created a "Directorate of the Federal  State Service of the president" (Upravleniye Federalnoy  Gosudarstvennoy Sluzhby Prezidenta) under his Cadre Policy  Council (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 18 February).  It is to supervise  the new civil service.      --On 16 February Yeltsin created a Public Chamber  (Obshchestvennaya Palata) under the president.  Its statute calls  it a "consultative organ" to provide feedback from the public to  help in preparing presidential decisions and indicates it will be  made up of representatives of parties, enterprises, religious  denominations, trade unions, and other organizations.  It is to  be "coordinated" by Yeltsin's personal assistant Lev Sukhanov  (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 19 February).  It held its first meeting on  19 February (ITAR-TASS, 19 February).      --On 17 February Yeltsin created a Committee for Information  Technology Policy (Komitet po Politike Informatizatsii-  -Roskominform) subordinate to the president and cabinet to  oversee creation of federal computerization systems, along with  the Federal Agency for Government Communications and Information  (ITAR-TASS, 19 February; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 23 February).      --On 25 February Yeltsin created an Expert Legal Council  (Ekspertno-Pravovoy Sovet) under the president--another  consultative, part-time body.  It will be chaired by State-Legal  Directorate Chief Ruslan Orekhov and a Moscow lawyer, Igor  Bezrukov (ITAR-TASS, 25 February; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 2 March).      Security Council Expansion      The president's Security Council, second only to the cabinet as a  highlevel executive body, has become more active, with new  commissions being formed under it and those created earlier being  activated.  Although a 1 February Yeltsin edict (ITAR-TASS, 1  February) dropped economic officials (the ministers of the  economy and finance) in listing the new membership of the  Security Council--appearing to remove economic questions from its  purview--the expansion of the council's working commissions,  including one on economic security, appears to broaden its  activities, rather than reduce them.  A 3 March Kommersant-Daily  article argued that the role of the Security Council may increase  substantially since it is the best organ for Yeltsin to use to  govern, given the independence of the cabinet under Premier  Viktor Chernomyrdin and the lack of a reformist majority in the  Duma.      --An Interdepartmental Commission on Information Security was  created by a Yeltsin decree on 18 December.  The new commission  held its first meeting on 13 January and began working on its  "main task"--working out state policy for information security  (ITAR-TASS, 13 January).      --The council's Interdepartmental Commission for Defense Security  held its first meeting on 29 December.  Its chairman is First  Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin and members include  deputy ministers of the economy and internal affairs, deputy  chief of staff, and the  border guards commander (ITAR-TASS, 29  December).      --The first meeting of the council's Interdepartmental Commission  on Economic Security was held on 10 January, under Chairman  Andrey Zverev, concurrently head of the economic department of  the cabinet (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 11 January).     --The first meeting of the council's Interdepartmental Commission  for Public Security was held on 18 January, chaired by Deputy  Internal Affairs Minister Aleksandr Kulikov (ITAR-TASS, 18  January).      --Yeltsin on 31 January signed an edict outlining the duties of  the Security Council's Scientific Council--defining priorities  for scientific research in the security sphere--and naming Vice  President of the Academy of Sciences V. Purimov chairman (Mayak  Radio, 31 January; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 3 February).  Yeltsin had  created the council with a 1 November decree (Rossiyskaya Gazeta,  3 February).      Implications      With a hostile parliament and a cabinet led by an apparently  loyal but less reformist Premier Chernomyrdin, Yeltsin appears to  be building up presidential structures that, aided by stronger  presidential powers in the new constitution, will enable him to  press reform policies on his own.  His expanding group of  specialists, analysts, and policy-oriented assistants may enable  him to develop more effective policies and establish better  control over the government, more effectively competing with an  assertive Duma or cabinet.  He has, however, reorganized his  presidential structures before, for example, bringing Filatov in  to strengthen his Administration in early 1993, and his staff's  effectiveness still appears to leave something to be desired.  Moreover, by perpetuating parallel structures--the Administration  led by Filatov and the staff of assistants under Ilyushin--the  new reorganization preserves great potential for competition and  conflict within the presidential apparatus.      Box                   Reorganization of the Administration      Although Yeltsin has apparently not yet signed an edict  reorganizing the whole Administration, the features of such a  reorganization have been described in accounts and charts  published in Segodnya on 9 February and Kommersant-Daily and  Novaya Yezhednevnaya Gazeta on 10 February, and several edicts  reorganizing parts of the Administration have already appeared  (abolishing the Directorate for Information Resources in early  February, creating a Finance-Budget Directorate on 28 February,  and creating a Directorate for Information Supply on 3 March).  According to these accounts, the new structure of the  Administration aims to:      --Improve analysis by combining the present three analytical  centers and a newly created "Situation Room" (Situationnaya  Komnata) into one "Analytical Service" (Analiticheskaya Sluzhba),  which will probably employ on a fulltime basis many of the  present part-time presidential analysts (Kommersant-Daily, 10  February).  According to the 6 January Segodnya, the poor  performance of the present analytical centers during the December  election--in analyzing voters' attitudes, predicting the outcome,  and analyzing the results--was one of the reasons for the Filatov  and Ilyushin reorganization proposals.      --Improve economic and foreign policy expertise, probably to make  the president less dependent on the cabinet for advice on these  issues.  The reorganization adds a "Service of Economic Analysis"  (Sluzhba Ekonomicheskogo Analiza), a "Finance-Budget Directorate"  (Finansovo-Byudzhetnoye Upravleniye), and an "International  Department" (Mezhdunarodnyy Otdel).

(See the Trends of 24 March 1993, pages 6-15.)      2 Based on the 10 February Kommersant-Daily and Novaya  Yezhednevnaya Gazeta accounts and charts. (This structure is  provisional since it has not yet been confirmed by Yeltsin.)      3 On 10 February Andrey Voykov was appointed head of the State  Duma's apparatus by the Duma's council (ITAR-TASS, 11 February).  Yeltsin relieved him of his Administration post on 22 February  (ITAR-TASS, 22 February).      4 A Finansovo-Byudzhetnoye Upravleniye was created by a 28  February Yeltsin edict, with Igor Moskovskiy as head and with 30  employees (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 2 March).  It is to supply the  president with information, analysis, and recommendations on  questions of finances, budget, insurance, prices, credits, and  money (ITAR-TASS, 28 February).      5 The Upravleniye Informatsionnykh Resursov was abolished and its  remnants transferred to the Federal Agency for Government  Communications and Information under the president (Segodnya, 9  February; Kommersant-Daily, 10 February; Radio Rossii, 21  February).  Yeltsin fired Vasiliy Kupriyanovskiy as head of the  directorate for "critical failure in performing his duties"  (ITAR-TASS, 22 February).  A 24 February Izvestiya article on the  abolition of the directorate suggests that the communications  agency had pushed this move to eliminate a competing information  center.  According to the article, the directorate disseminated  information to localities using a modern computer system and now  the agency will control this system.      6 Yeltsin signed a 3 March edict creating a Directorate for  Supply of Information and named Petr Filippov (head of the  present Analytical Center for Socioeconomic Policy) to head it  (ITAR-TASS, 4 March).  With 40 employees, it is to work with the  press and television and analyze information coming from regions,  according to a 3 March Moskovskiy Komsomolets article.      7 The Kontrolno-Nablyudatelnyy Sovet that operated directly under  Administration Leader Filatov is not included in the wiring  diagrams in Kommersant-Daily and Novaya Yezhednevnaya Gazeta and  apparently will disappear.      8 Ilyushenko told Izvestiya (15 February) that the Kontrolnoye  Upravleniye's work was to monitor activities of central and local  officials and report wrongdoing to the president.  On 26 February  Yeltsin removed Ilyushenko and nominated him for prosecutor  general (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 1 March).      9 The president's representatives-in oblasts are dropped from the  title of the Directorate for Work with Territories and  Presidential Representatives and placed directly under the  president along with presidential assistants, according to the  Kommersant-Daily and Novaya Yezhednevnaya Gazeta wiring diagrams.      10 Upravleniye Delami.      11 The Upravleniye Deloproizvodstva sends out presidential edicts  and handles the mail, according to a 6 March 1993 Nezavisimaya  Gazeta article.      12 Otdel Sekretnogo Deloproizvodstva.      13 Gruppa Spichrayterov.      14 Kantselyariya.

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / SIB help for investors THE SECURITIES and Investments Board has produced a guidance note for investors who want to present evidence or arguments in the legal action to determine the cut-off date of the investors' compensation scheme, Richard Waters writes. The case has been prompted by Fimbra, the Financial Intermediaries, Managers and Brokers' Regulatory Association, which argues that compensation should apply only to investments made after the scheme came into force on August 27 1988. SIB had given an undertaking earlier to brief counsel to represent investors' interests.</p>

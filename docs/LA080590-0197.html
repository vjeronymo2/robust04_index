He was in the on-deck circle when catcher Benito  Santiago of the San Diego Padres, on an injury rehabilitation stint with the  Stars, grounded into a double play to end the eighth inning.  </P> <P> The only other player in PCL history to hit home runs in four consecutive  at-bats was Gus Zernial of the Hollywood Stars, who homered in his last two  at-bats on May 18, 1948, and in his first two the next day.  </P> <P> Pete Schneider of Vernon set the PCL record of five home runs in one game May  11, 1923.  </P></p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Sharp drop at Western Mining Western Mining Corporation, the Australian mining group, yesterday reported an equity-consolidated profit, after tax but before abnormal items, of ADollars 119.7m (USDollars 89m) in the year to end-June. This compared with ADollars 165.9m in the previous year, a fall of 27.8 per cent. WMC took a large abnormal charge in 1992-93, of ADollars 113.3m before tax, while the net charge in 1993-94 was ADollars 700,000. As a result, WMC's equity profit after tax and abnormals was sharply improved, to ADollars 125m in the year just ended, compared with ADollars 88.3m previously. This figure was in line with the profits forecast made by WMC in its rights issue prospectus last month. The fall in Western's pre-abnormal profits derived largely from an 18.4 per cent drop in operating earnings, to ADollars 127.8m. Total revenue was 7.6 per cent higher at ADollars 1.7bn. On a divisional basis, WMC's nickel operations remained in the red, although the loss was reduced to ADollars 23.2m from ADollars 284m. The company noted that this improvement came despite a 14 per cent decline in US dollar terms for the overall price of nickel, and the production interruptions as the upgrading of facilities took place. The Olympic Dam business contributed ADollars 60.2m, against ADollars 47.4m, but the advance was largely due to WMC's increasing its ownership of the operations to 100 per cent. Higher production, coupled with an improved gold price, meant that the Australian gold interests made ADollars 74.2m, up from ADollars 38.5m. However, the North and South American gold interests produced a loss of ADollars 16m. The main depressant on profits was the petroleum division, which turned in profits of ADollars 4.7m, compared with ADollars 43.7m in the previous year. A lower oil price, declining production from a couple of fields, and an increase in unit costs due to higher amoritisation/depletion charges did the damage. WMC's share of after-tax profits from Alcoa of Australia, in which it has a 48.25 per cent stake, also fell, by 17.6 per cent to ADollars 147.3m. This was largely due to lower US dollar prices and lower aluminium sales volumes. However, Mr Hugh Morgan, WMC's managing director, held out the prospect of a better year ahead. The final dividend is 4 cents a share, down from 7 cents last time, making 8 cents for the year, against 10 cents last time.</p>

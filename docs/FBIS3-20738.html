The discussions  between the Greek delegation, headed by Alternate Minister of  the National Economy Ioannis Papandoniou, and the Albanian  delegation, headed by Minister of Trade and Industry Selim  Belortaja, took place in an especially warm atmosphere and were  evaluated by the two sides as conclusive benchmarks for the  advancement of bilateral economic development.

These were some of the issues discussed:    Investments: There was a discussion of problems related to  Greek investments in Albania and it was emphasized that it was  necessary to conclude the essential procedures for protecting  investments, by initialing, as soon as possible, the agreement  on exemption from double taxation. It was stated that more than  50 Greek enterprises have been established in Albania and that  concrete interest has been demonstrated in setting up many more  in various sectors, mainly as joint enterprises with Albanian  companies.    The Banking Sector: The Albanian side said that it considers  the willingness of the Greek banks to be a dynamic presence in  Albania to be a positive element and it promised that it would  reduce to 90 days the deadline for examining the applications  presented to it. At this time, it was mentioned that the  National Bank of Greece has shown interest in this matter.    Projects in the Infrastructure: The two sides agreed to  cooperate on pinpointing projects in the infrastructure,  especially in the transportation sector, with the aim of  securing financing from Community sources and, concretely, by a  PHARE [Reconstruction Aid to Poland and Hungary]/INTERREG  [transnational cooperation program] coordinated initiative.  Importance was given to the Ioannina-Kakaviie-Vlore-Durres  highway and the railroad systems of the two countries.    The Agricultural Sector: It was agreed that there should be  an evaluation of possibilities for cooperation in the  agricultural sector by means of technical assistance by both  sides in the training and specialization of cadres and technical  assistance by the Greeks in the production of products of animal  and plant origin, assistance in agricultural projects, in  irrigation, in the mechanization of agriculture, and in research  and applications in agriculture.    The Energy Sector: Cooperation should be expanded in this  sector, on the one hand, with the construction of a  hydroelectric power plant on the Vjose River on Albanian  territory on the border between the two countries (the Greek  Public Electricity Enterprise is collaborating with the Albanian  Electricity Corporation on this project), and, on the other  hand, with general cooperation of these two organizations in the  electric power sector.    Technical Assistance: The Greek side stated that, in the  framework of the bilateral technical assistance program, the  implementation of the following projects in Greece or in Albania  might be studied during 1994: technical assistance programs in  the form of seminars and laboratories, the placement of Albanian  experts in such sectors as public administration, the management  of public service enterprises, management in enterprises, in  tourism, in the banking sector, in the health field, in  agriculture, in public works, in transportation, and in  environmental protection, as well as cooperation between the  institutions of higher education of the two countries.

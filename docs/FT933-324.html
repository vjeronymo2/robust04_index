			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Harvest hopes push Chicago soyabean futures lower PROSPECTS FOR fine harvesting weather in the US pushed soyabean prices lower at the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday and overshadowed forecasts for the season's first killing frost. In late trading the January futures position, which had fallen by 8 1/4 cents on Monday, was down another 8 1/2 cents at 637 cents a bushel. 'I'm forecasting open weather this week, and that will give the combines a chance to roll,' said Merrill Lynch's chief meteorologist, Mr Thad Chupalio. The dry weather will be welcomed by farmers, many of whom experienced drenching, harvest-stalling rains last weekend. Although Mr Chupalio and many other forecasters are predicting that there will be a freeze over much of the central US maize and soyabean growing regions, including central Illinois, by Thursday, traders have already taken account of potential frost losses in their assessments of the market. Soyabean prices have been creeping higher on frost fears since early September, contrary to a seasonal tendency for prices to slump as harvest approaches. The higher prices may have discouraged export sales of the new crop. 'We will lose some bushels to a freeze, but we will lose as much or more in offsetting export demand,' says Mr Dan Cekander, a crop analyst with the Chicago brokerage firm Rodman and Renshaw. Mr Cekander expects US soyabean and meal exports to the European Community to drop by as much as 7 per cent this year as the community's farmers switch from soyameal to less expensive livestock feeds. US soya products also face stiff competition from other producers. Brazilian farmers begin seeding soyabeans this week, and could be encouraged to broaden plantings if world prices, as reflected on the Chicago Board of Trade, remain firm. US soyabean exports in September are running nearly 50 per cent behind 1992 levels and export sales of the new crop beans are lagging by a similar amount. 'Our export inspections were only half of what we need to meet the government's export estimates,' said Mr Richard Feltes, senior analyst for the Refco trade house. The export figures, which were released in a weekly report Monday, prompted many traders, including big futures funds, to lighten their holdings of soyabean futures. The data showed only 20.7m bushels of soyabeans had left US ports for export destinations since September 1, compared with 48m bushels a year ago.</p>

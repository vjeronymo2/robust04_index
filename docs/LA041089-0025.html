			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Soviet citizens and businesses may lease land for 50 years or more, sublease  the property to others, and pass on the leases to their children when they die  under a sweeping new law published in Soviet newspapers. The decree, issued by  the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, creates the same right to lease animals,  equipment and even entire factories. It grants considerably more extensive  property rights than many had expected, even after the Communist Party  leadership in March approved the principle of leasing land to family and  cooperative farms. The change in Soviet property rights was prompted by the  disastrous state of the Soviet economy.  </P></p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Survey of Birmingham and West Midlands (2): Quite a lot of catching up to do - Manufacturing industry beginning to pull out of the second recession in 10 years INDUSTRIAL groups in the region mostly show improved profits, as the economy starts its move out of recession. But the higher level of earnings usually owes more to the cost savings brought about by retrenchment and higher productivity than to recovery of demand. In short, manufacturing in the West Midlands is emerging from its second bout of severe surgery in 10 years. The recession of the early 1980s set off a slimming-down process, as companies came to terms with bloated costs and began to change their market positions. Manufacturing employment continued to decline even when the national economy was at its strongest during the second half of the 1980s. The 1990s recession accelerated an already established trend. Cambridge Econometrics, consultants, calculated a 19.2 per cent fall in manufacturing employment in the West Midlands between 1990 and 1993 and forecast a further decline of 6.2 per cent - 35,000 jobs - between 1993 and 2000. But such forecasts do not imply any diminution in the importance of manufacturing to the regional economy. Indeed, technological change and increased investment, leading to higher output, generally need fewer people to do the work. In any case, manufacturing still accounts for 33.1 per cent of regional gross domestic product, against a national average of about 25 per cent; and for 29.1 per cent of total employment. The accompanying table demonstrates that the West Midlands' traditional role as the industrial heart of the UK has not been eroded by the economic difficulties since 1980. According to the Confederation of British Industry, the most important sectors in terms of output are: electrical engineering, motor vehicles and mechanical engineering. But the regional figures disguise the signal importance to particular localities of particular industries: ceramics to Stoke-on-Trent; crystal to the Brierly Hill area of the Black Country; electronics - latterly - to Telford; leather to Walsall. Notwithstanding such specialised interests, there have been significant changes in the industrial structure. 'Figures for the last decade show a shift of emphasis away from metal manufacturing and other metal goods to motor vehicles and mechanical engineering. Such movement towards higher value-added industries should provide potential for future growth and prosperity in the region,' says Albert E. Sharp, stockbrokers. An example of this was the disappearance of basic steelmaking from the region on the one hand, and the gathering power of the automotive components sector on the other. But the immediate market prospects for realising this potential are not encouraging. During the 1980s, the large and medium-sized engineering groups, especially, built up positions in continental European markets to such a successful extent that they were protected from the first impact of the domestic recession. The latest surveys of both the Engineering Employers' Federation West Midlands, and the regional group of the Chambers of Commerce, showed that increased demand for manufactured exports, apparent in the first quarter of the year, had flattened out in the second quarter. While the devaluation of sterling offered Midlands manufacturers an immediate competitive stimulus, the effect was limited. First, the downturn in continental European markets, especially Germany, reduced demand. Second, European customers generally demanded a share of the margin gain which the devaluation offered exporters. Third, the combination of these two factors increased pressure on export prices, rather than relieved it. Fourth, there is now some evidence that imported material costs are rising. All this has meant that the movement towards recovery has been slow, and is likely to remain dependent - at least for the rest of this year  - on the Far East and dollar markets and on the domestic market. Both survey and corporate reports suggest that there has been recovery in both these market sectors. Corporate fortunes are unlikely to improve dramatically except when cost reductions flow through. All the available measurements point to industry working well beneath capacity. The chambers of commerce report that only 14 per cent of manufacturing companies are working at full capacity - 43 per cent are under 80 per cent capacity. Given, too. that the recession has led to reduced investment, there is bound to be some catching up to do before the full potential of higher valued-added manufacturing can be realised. The opportunity is available. The arrival of Honda, Nissan and Toyota has increased UK car-making capacity and offered new markets to the component makers. The prosperity of the component companies causes ripples through the Midlands. But their prosperity will not be easily gained. The motor manufacturers have been seeking both to reduce the number of their suppliers and to change their relationship with them, thrusting out research and development. So the component makers are in some turmoil, even as their markets appear to widen. Not only that. With the downturn in continental European car markets, and the truck market in the doldrums, domestic motor manufacturers - Ford, Rover, Vauxhall - have been bearing down on suppliers, demanding price cuts. However, the pressure to manufacture at low prices has drawn the German motor manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen and BMW to start buying more of their components in the UK, again widening the potential market for Midlands manufacturers. Against the offsetting factors, confidence in the manufacturing sector has risen. More companies are confident about future trends of turnover and profitability than for the last three years. But the striking point about recent business surveys is that confidence is related to future rather than actual performance. Once recovery takes hold, manufacturers will have to contend with skill shortages. Price Waterhouse, in association with the Warwick and Wolverhampton Business Schools, has already detected the first signs, warning that 'a real skills shortfall could be in prospect when the recession ends finally, and it could have a serious impact on our competitiveness. Lack of fundamental reskilling policy during the recession will be to blame.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SEASONALLY ADJUSTED UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE WEST MIDLANDS AND UK IN MAY 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  Males      %   Females     %       Total      %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- W Midlands     216,500   14.5    65,808   6.2     282,300   11.1 UK           2,238,900   14.0   674,900   5.6   2,913,800   10.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: WMEB Labour Market Briefing  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WEST MIDLANDS MANUFACTURING: A regional perspective  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  1980                     1990                         Location     % of UK     Location     % of UK                         quotient      output     quotient      output  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- All manufacturing            1.3        11.2          1.5        11.8  -Motor vehicle and parts    2.9        26.2          3.4        30.5  -Mechanical engineering     1.4        11.6          1.7        14.0  -Other metal goods          3.7        31.6          3.4        28.5  -Metal manufacture          2.3        19.0          2.2        16.7  -Manufacture (Non metal   minerals)                  2.5        16.5          2.6        18.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Albert E.

			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Letter: EBRD - a meaningless comparison of estimates and the need for broader remit Sir, On reading the article on the Bank of European Reconstruction and Development, and its London headquarters ('The bank that like to say yes - to itself', April 13), I was surprised to find a figure I had given as a general estimate for fitting out a city institution building was being used as part of a detailed article investigating a particular project. Though I was pleased to see reference in the article to the estimate containing neither furnishings nor mechanical and electrical equipment, its use as a comparison to the very specific criteria of the EBRD's headquarters renders it totally meaningless. When looking at an individual case such as the EBRD's headquarters, there is a whole range of specific needs that should be considered. The items generally include security, boardrooms, computer and telecommunications facilities, conference halls, etc, all of which add considerably to the cost of normal fitting out. Gleeds has worked on a number of projects throughout Europe with the EBRD. Its very use of such firms as Gleeds points to its acknowledgement of the importance of the correct apportionment and control of funds.

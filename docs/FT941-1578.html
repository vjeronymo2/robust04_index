			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Richardsons up 31% and calls for Pounds 5.7m Richardsons Westgarth, the steel stockholder and processor, yesterday reported a 31 per cent increase in annual profits and announced plans to raise Pounds 5.7m via a fully underwritten rights issue. For 1993 the group's continuing operations lifted turnover from Pounds 53.5m to Pounds 67m, and this generated profits of Pounds 2.52m (Pounds 1.92m) at the pre-taxlevel. Earnings edged ahead to 4.9p (4.6p) and a proposed final dividend of 1.9p raises the total from 3p to 3.2p. The cash call is of 7.2m new ordinary shares on a 1-for-4 basis at 85p a share. Yesterday, the shares closed 4p lower at 101p. The proceeds of the issue will be used to finance a planned capital expenditure programme. And it will fund increased working capital requirements expected to arise from sales growth in 1994 and 1995. The directors feel the rights issue will allow the group flexibility to continue to expand primarily through investment in new processing capacity and facilities while maintaining a sound financial position. The issue is underwritten by Baring Brothers with Cazenove acting as broker. On prospects, Mr Roger Payton, chairman, said trading across the group for the opening two months of 1994 had been satisfactory. He cautioned, however, that although he looked to a general, though restrained, increase in demand, that must be set against overcapacity in steel production in Europe and the fragility of the UK economy.</p>

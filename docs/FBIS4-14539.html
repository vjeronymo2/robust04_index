			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn 31 Mar, BNS -- Estonia at present keeps  about 20 persons under internment, said the country's Minister  of Justice, Kaido Kama. He said these persons are being held at  a former prison facility in Maardu, outside Tallinn.    The minister said that most of the interned in Estonia were  Kurds. He added that this was somewhat surprising, for it is  evident that also people of many other nationalities are staying  in the country illegally. "Unlike the illegal residents of many  other nationalities, the Kurds are not dangerous to society,"  Kama said.    He said plans to build an internment camp for illegal  immigrants at Rummu, a small town to the southwest from Tallinn,  were standing behind money problems. At least a few dozen  million kroons would be needed to set up the internment camp, he  said.    Kama told BNS that a small number of illegal residents had  also been expelled from the country. The minister said this was  possible only in the cases when the country where the immigrant  had come from could be clearly proved.</p>

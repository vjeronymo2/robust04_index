			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PBS TRIBUTE TO EARLY MASTER OF MOVIE MAGIC  </P> <P> The wonderful fantasy and trick films of the French cineaste, Georges Melies --  who made more than 200 short movies at the very dawn of the cinema, from 1896  to 1913 -- are sources of curious, unabashed delight. In them, we watch  magicians appear and disappear in explosive puffs of smoke, devils cavort,  star-men dance and intrepid, mustachioed explorers daringly scale  wood-and-canvas mountainsides or moonscapes while scantily clad chorus girls  "ooh" and "aah."  </P> <P> It's a magic-land, befitting Melies' origins as a music-hall illusionist.  (Sadly, he went bankrupt and wound up operating a toy concession at the  Montparnasse railroad station before the French government, belatedly, gave him  recognition and a subsidy.) For all their fragility, they've proven to be  precious, sturdy illusions.  </P> <P> In "A Tribute to Georges Melies," shown tonight on PBS' "Alive From Off Center"  (Channel 15 at 10 p.m.), three modern French film-makers -- rock video  specialist Philippe Gautier, and feature directors Aline Isserman and Pierre  Etaix -- try to evoke again the long-ago spirit of Melies.  </P> <P> Gautier and Etaix adapt old scripts of Melies' ("The Seven Deadly Sins" and "An  Artist's Dream"), adding their own wit to the consciously primitive recreation  of the master. Isserman, in her "The Slap of Beate Klarsfeld," reimagines in  the style of Melies (who also restaged historical incidents in his films) a  famous episode involving Nazi hunter Beate Klarsfeld and ex-West German  Chancellor K. G. Kiesinger.  </P> <P> Etaix, a clown and maker of comedies, who assisted Jacques Tati on "Mon Oncle"  and later made the ebullient "Yoyo," seems the most natural matchup with  Melies, and his effort, which puts "King Kong" in the artist's studio, is the  funniest.  </P> <P> But Gautier, who apes Melies' style meticulously in his parade of vices, and  Isserman, who creates a grim fairy tale, have their moments too. There are also  delightful stretches of pure Melies shown in between. And, with the narration,  a deadpan video trickery that suggests a Terry Gilliam Monty Python montage and  colorfully complement the black-and-white trickery old and new.  </P> <P> One complaint: "Alive and Off Center" has chosen to eschew subtitling and offer  instead, simultaneous translation of the French narrator and directors, which  makes for an irritating babble of voices. Ignore them and wait for the magic  instead.  </P></p>

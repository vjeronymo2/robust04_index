			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary finds that Wyoming's repeal of W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)(i) satisfies the portion of 30 CFR 950.11(c)(3) discussed above. Therefore, he is approving the proposed amendment and removing the pertinent portion of the program condition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Award of Costs and Expenses: Cap on Fees and Costs [W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(g)] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Wyoming Enrolled Act No. 4 revises W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437 by repealing subsection (g), which provided that attorney's fees, expert witness fees or other fees or costs shall not exceed $50.00 per hour. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed in finding 7 of the January 24, 1994,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  document (59 FR 3517), the Secretary did not approve the now-repealed provision because he found it to be inconsistent with section 525(e) of SMCRA. In addition, he modified the condition of program approval at 30 CFR 950.11(c) by adding a paragraph (3), which, in part, required that Wyoming revise its statute to authorize the award of all reasonably incurred costs and expenses without placing any inflexible limits on the meaning of ``reasonably incurred.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary finds that Wyoming's repeal of W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(g) and its hourly rate cap satisfies the portion of 30 CFR 950.11(c)(3) discussed above. Therefore, he is approving the proposed amendment and removing the pertinent portion of the program condition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Award of Costs and Expenses: General [W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Wyoming Enrolled Act No. 4 revises W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) by replacing the term ``director'' in the phrases ``as determined by the director'' and ``as the court or director deems proper'' with the term ``council.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed in finding 1 of the January 24, 1994,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  document (59 FR 3514), the Secretary did not approve W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) to the extent that it referred to ``the Director'' rather than ``the Council'' (the State's administrative review entity) because he found it to be inconsistent with 43 CFR 4.1291. In addition, he modified the condition of program approval at 30 CFR 950.11(c) by adding a paragraph (4), which required that Wyoming revise its statute to clarify that, with respect to administrative review proceedings, petitions for awards of costs and expenses must be filed with and reviewed and decided by the Environmental Quality Council, not the Director of the Department of Environmental Quality. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary finds that Wyoming's revisions to W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f) satisfy the requirements of 30 CFR 950.11(c)(4). Therefore, he is approving the proposed amendment and removing the pertinent portion of the condition of program approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5.

In addition, he modified the condition of program approval at 30 CFR 950.11(c) by adding a paragraph (5), which required that Wyoming revise its statute to eliminate the requirement that the person establish the existence of a specific violation of applicable statute or rule as a prerequisite for awards from the State. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary finds that Wyoming's repeal of W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;437(f)(iii) satisfies the requirements of 30 CFR 950.11(c)(5). Therefore, he is approving the proposed amendment and removing the pertinent portion of the condition of program approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

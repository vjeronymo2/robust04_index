			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Ukraine tries to salvage reform UKRAINIAN leaders are putting together a package of 'radical measures' in an effort to resuscitate economic reform in the aftermath of a huge expansion of credits last week which pushed the Ukrainian currency to new lows against the dollar. Mr Leonid Kuchma, the reformist prime minister, over the weekend met President Leonid Kravchuk and the chairman of parliament to forge a coalition to back the reforms. Government officials said Mr Kuchma had secured a promise from the National Bank chairman that in future new credits would only be released with the government's consent. The latest credit emission, which was authorised by the parliament, wiped out the existing debts of all Ukrainian enterprises, making it impossible to weed out the weak factories from the strong ones. 'We have taken action to undo the situation which developed last week,' said Mr Vasyl Evtukhov, acting first deputy prime minister. 'We will force the enterprises to behave, we will force some of them into bankruptcy.' The tough talk was a reaction to the National Bank's release of 1.23 trillion coupons of fresh credits at low interest rates to industry and agriculture last week. Ukraine's fledgling currency market reacted immediately as banks cut the value of the Ukrainian currency by 50 per cent in one day to a low of 3,000 coupons to the dollar. 'This single step wiped out almost all of the progress we had made in the previous three months,' said Mr Mykola Syvulsky, deputy minister of finance. Before last week's credit expansion, the Ukrainian currency appeared to be stabilising against the dollar and inflation had slowed to 20 per cent a month. 'This emission means that on paper we have no loss-making enterprises,' he said. 'But the cost of this policy is a degradation of the national currency and a continual lowering of the standard of living of the Ukrainian people.' The collapse of the currency and the prospect of a new round of inflation had exhausted the government.</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Templeton raising up to Pounds 140m A conversion issue by Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust is to raise up to Pounds 140m in a placing and offer of up to 140m C shares. Conversion will take place once the assets relating to the C shares are 80 per cent invested or on September 16 1994, whichever is the earlier. The institutional placing, through Smith New Court, will account for 105m of the new shares, and the remaining 35m will be available to existing investors and the public. Templeton, with total assets of about Pounds 391m is already the largest of the 8 emerging markets investment trusts. The new shares will be offered with warrants attached on a 1-for-5 basis. The warrants, which are exercisable at 399p annually from 1995 to 2004, will also be given to existing shareholders. As at March 11 1994 the trust's diluted net asset value was 396.3p per share. Last applications under the public offer are due on Thursday April 14. Emerging markets funds were popular with investors last year, and Mr Mark Mobius, Templeton's investment manager, is regarded as one of the experts in the area. However, the shares of all emerging markets trusts have come off the top recently.</p>

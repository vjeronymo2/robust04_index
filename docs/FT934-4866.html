			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Gallup in Chinese joint venture The Gallup Organisation, the world's largest survey research group, announced yesterday that it had become the first western company to receive a licence to operate a market research company in China. Until now, commercial market research in China has been conducted from abroad by contracted research or small consultancy companies. The new operation, Gallup China, is a joint venture between Gallup, which is based in New Jersey, and Carrie Enterprises, a state-owned but US-managed import-export company. With headquarters in Beijing, and planned branch offices or satellites in Shanghai, Guangzhou and 16 other cities, Gallup China will conduct market research surveys on behalf of US, European and Asian clients, including Chinese companies. The company however, will not conduct any political research, although Mr Richard Buckholder, director of worldwide operations, said it would be a 'natural development' to move into political polling. Gallup China has already won three contacts to conduct surveys in China worth Dollars 100,000. Gallup expects to invest Dollars 10m-Dollars 20m in its Chinese operation, which is initially licensed to operate for 20 years.</p>

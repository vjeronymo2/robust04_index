			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Early Xmas orders lift Filofax A SIGNIFICANT increase in sales and improved gross margins lifted Filofax Group in the six months to September 30 1992. Turnover rose to Pounds 6.18m (Pounds 4.81m) and pre-tax profit to Pounds 950,000 (Pounds 274,000). Mindful of that success and confident of strong trading through Christmas, directors declared an interim dividend of 0.5p. Mr Robin Field, chief executive, said the sales growth was assisted by retailers worldwide ordering for Christmas earlier than they did previously. There had also been a significant contribution from mid-year products launched specifically to counter the market seasonality of the business. Growth in the US continued to be encouraging and, dependent on the level of the dollar, 1992 might see sales there exceed those in the UK for the first time. Earnings per share were 4.3p (1.5p). For the previous 15 months to March 31 1992 there was a single dividend of 0.5p.</p>

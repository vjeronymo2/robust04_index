			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> POLISH WAR DEAD FOUND  </P> <P> The bodies of 3,311 World War II Polish officers and soldiers were found in  five mass graves in the Lithuanian village of Kalety, Polish television  reported. The report quoted people who claimed to be witnesses as saying the  victims were shot by Soviet troops. It did not say how or when the graves were  discovered. More than 15,000 Polish officers were interned in three Soviet  camps in the Ukraine during World War II and subsequently disappeared. In 1943,  Nazi Germany, which overran Soviet territory, announced the discovery of a mass  grave of 4,250 Polish officers in the Katyn Forest, near Smolensk in the  Ukraine.  </P></p>

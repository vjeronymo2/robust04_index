			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Australian dollar slips as deficit raises fears THE AUSTRALIAN dollar yesterday fell to levels last seen during the 'banana republic' crisis of 1986 as financial markets responded to a worse-than-expected current account deficit for April. The government said the deficit contracted to ADollars 1.7bn (Pounds 760m), from a restated ADollars 1.9bn in March, mainly because of a 7 per cent fall in the value of imports and a 2 per cent increase in exports. However, the deficit was significantly higher than market forecasts of between ADollars 700m and ADollars 1.3bn, contributing to fears that Australia's sluggish economic recovery may be unsustainable. The Australian dollar closed 1.5 cents lower at 67.68 US cents in Sydney, in spite of intervention by the Reserve Bank, and dealers said downward pressure was likely to resume when markets re-open today. The currency also fell to fresh lows against the Japanese yen for the fourth consecutive day, reaching a trough of Y72.44 before closing at Y72.60 from Y74.10 on Friday. The Reserve Bank's trade weighted index fell from 50.5 to 49.4, down 13 per cent since May 1992, and just 0.1 points above the record low of 49.3 in 1986. The 1986 low followed a warning by Mr Paul Keating, the then federal treasurer, that Australia was heading for a 'banana republic' debt crisis unless it solved its chronic current account problems. Mr Ralph Willis, finance minister, said yesterday the cumulative current account deficit for the year to the end of June was 'broadly in line' with the government's budget forecast of ADollars 15bn. Economists said the April figures were out of line with weak domestic activity, suggesting that Australia had made little headway in reducing imports, while the sluggish world economy had slowed export growth. A further batch of figures due today is expected to confirm that Australian gross domestic product is growing at about 2.5 per cent a year, in line with official fore-casts. Growth of at least 3 per cent a year would be required to achieve the government's main economic aim of reducing unemployment from the current level of just under 11 per cent. However, the bad current account news and the weakness of the currency suggest that the Reserve Bank will be reluctant to use monetary policy to encourage faster economic growth. Fiscal policy is also constrained by market worries about the growing budget deficit, which is likely to exceed ADollars 16bn in the year to the end of June, compared to ADollars 12bn in 1991-92.</p>

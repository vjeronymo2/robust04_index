			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BHUTTO SAYS GOVERNMENT STOLE ELECTION  </P> <P> Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said today she had lost Pakistan's general  election because of massive rigging by the caretaker government.  </P> <P> "They have stolen the (National) Assembly from us totally," she told a news  conference.  </P> <P> Bhutto said many of her polling agents had disappeared and reports from other  party workers indicated that ballot boxes had been stolen on a massive scale.  </P> <P> She blamed the alleged corruption on President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, who dismissed  her in August, and the caretaker government he appointed.  </P> <P> Voters had turned out in unexpectedly small numbers today for the bitterly  contested national election widely considered a referendum on the dismissal of  Bhutto.  </P> <P> At least four people were killed and 11 injured in disputes involving rival  parties, officials said. The monthlong campaign claimed at least a dozen lives.  </P> <P> Tens of thousands of heavily armed soldiers, paramilitary troops and police  patrolled throughout the country during the voting. Today's general elections  were only the fifth in Pakistan since its 1947 inception, and never before was  the military deployed in such large numbers during polling.  </P> <P> About 50 million people were eligible to vote, but election officials said  turnout was light, perhaps reflecting cynicism about the future of democracy in  Pakistan.  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, after casting her own vote in her ancestral hometown at  Larkana, in southern Pakistan, Bhutto predicted victory for her party.  </P> <P> "We have turned the tables on them," said Bhutto, who was unopposed in her bid  for reelection to Parliament. "If we win, they will have no choice but to let  us form the next government."  </P> <P> Analysts had predicted that the vote would be close between Bhutto's  left-leaning Pakistan People's Party and three smaller allied parties and the  Islamic Democratic Alliance, a loose-knit coalition of 18 parties united only  by their dislike for Bhutto and strained by individual ambitions.  </P></p>

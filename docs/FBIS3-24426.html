The situation in  the consumer market continued to be strained, the rate of  inflation increased, and the public's standard of living  declined. Participants in the Cabinet of Ministers conference  under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Suret Guseynov, which  discussed the results of national economic activity in 1993 and  the tasks ahead in the current year, arrived at these  inauspicious conclusions.    According to data from the Ministry of Economics, industrial  production declined by 6.8 percent last year and the volume of  national income dropped by 13.3 percent compared with 1992. Oil  production decreased by 800,000 metric tons and natural gas  production declined by 1 billion cubic meters. The situation in  agriculture was especially bad; it failed to deliver 21 percent  of the grain, 43 percent of the vegetables, 59 percent of the  cotton, and the same amount of grapes to the state. Compared  with 1992, 34 percent of the meat, 29 percent of the milk, and  60 percent of the eggs were delivered.    The volume of foreign trade turnover was $545.4 million,  including exports of $325.7 million and imports of $219 million.  The exports were mainly petroleum products and the imports were  mostly foodstuffs. It was noted at the same time that strategic  products continue to be taken out of the republic because of  lack of supervision by the State Customs Committee and law  enforcement organs.    The economic managers see the following reasons for the  situation that has taken shape: the imperfect nature of the  finance and credit system, insufficient capital investments or  even the complete lack of them, and failure by a number of  enterprises to complete deliveries in accordance with the  settlement clearing stipulated by intergovernmental agreements.    The head of government expressed his view with respect to  the  reasons for the crisis as well. He characterized the price  liberalization announced 2 years ago and conducted before  privatization and the land reform as an inexcusable error. In  his opinion, this also led to an increase in the rate of  inflation and a budget deficit of 25 billion manats last year,  as well as the sharp stratification of society, impoverishment  of most of the people, and excessive enrichment of a small  proportion of the public.    The conference participants were familiarized with the  Cabinet of Ministers' draft decree giving clear-cut instructions  to all ministries and departments on putting affairs in order in  their organizations, as well as on improving the financial  sitution in the republic. S. Guseynov reaffirmed the  government's intention to issue a directive on the sale of state  enterprises' products to commercial structures for a cash  payment, as well as the collection of taxes from them in cash.    He also told the conference participants that the republic  government, together with the National Bank, is taking steps to  pay wages, pensions, allowances, and stipends to the public on  the threshold of the spring vacations.    Summing up the conference results, the head of government  again called upon all managers of economic and financial organs  in the republic to direct their efforts toward fulfillment of  the state's targets and normalization of the economic situation  in the republic.</p>

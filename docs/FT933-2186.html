			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Monday Interview: Poised for the home run - Ted Turner, founder of Cable News Network Jane Fonda's husband is set to make his acting debut in a film that receives its premier next month. By any standards the scale of the film is enormous, with more than 5,000 extras and a running time of four hours and eight minutes. The film is Gettysburg, the story of the American civil war, where 150,000 fought and 50,000 died. The man responsible for it is Jane Fonda's husband - Mr Ted Turner, founder of Cable News Network (CNN), the 24-hour satellite news service, owner of the Atlanta Braves baseball team and much more besides. 'You have to watch closely. I'm only in the film for 30 seconds and then I get shot,' says Mr Turner, a southerner who naturally plays a Confederate colonel leading a charge on the Yankees. As a civil war buff - the entrance to the boardroom of Turner Broadcasting System, Mr Turner's holding company, is lined with guns from the American civil war - Mr Turner is keen to show off his new Dollars 18m film. In his vast office on the 14th floor of the CNN Center in Atlanta, an office crammed with personal memorabilia such as silver yachting trophies, basketballs and a doll of his favourite admiral, Lord Horatio Nelson, Mr Turner presses a button and a large movie screen slides electronically from the ceiling. As the clips of Gettysburg run its proud owner remarks on the absence of fashionable and gratuitious nastiness. 'We made it in the old-fashioned way,' says Mr Turner, owner of the MGM library, which includes classics such as Gone with the Wind, Singing in the Rain and the Wizard of Oz. His enthusiasm for Hollywood and feature films is unmistakable. In 1986 he bought MGM for Dollars 1.5bn and also took on Dollars 500m in debt as part of the purchase price. But the financial strain of the deal forced him to quickly sell most of MGM, including the famous roaring lion logo, leaving him with only the library. Now Mr Turner has mounted another attack on Hollywood with last month's Dollars 672m (Pounds 450m) agreement to buy two independent studios: Castle Rock, which produced hit films such as In the Line of Fire and A Few Good Men, and New Line Cinema, best known for lower budget pictures such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Nightmare on Elm Street. 'I had to (buy back into Hollywood). No question,' says Mr Turner, in sanguine mood the day after the Altanta Braves had unexpectedly beaten the Cincinnati Reds, making a place in the World Series baseball finals more likely. 'I have more than 3,000 old movies (from the MGM library) and no new movies except television movies. If you are going to be a big player you have got to have the product. Rupert (Murdoch) has got Twenthieth Century Fox studios,' he says. Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of The News Corporation, is Mr Turner's bugbear: the subject of Mr Murdoch creeps frequently into the interview. Mr Murdoch may have been one of the reasons why the elusive Mr Turner agreed to speak to European newspapers and magazines to coincide with the European launch last Friday of his new satellite channel, TNT. The channel, largely based on the MGM library and the Cartoon Network, is already beamed to Latin America and Mr Turner is considering extending it to Asia. Mr Murdoch's skillful generation of headlines with his promises to beam Sky News around the world and develop Star TV in Asia, seem to have caused irritation at CNN. After all, say Mr Turner's staff in Atlanta, CNN is already broadcasting worldwide on 13 satellites and, on big story days such as the recent Middle East settlement, is viewed by as many as 1bn people through satellite, cable and rebroadcast extracts. Mr Turner does not mince his words on Mr Murdoch. 'He wants to conquer the world. I don't want to conquer it. I just want to be one among many. I want to entertain and inform the world,' he says with passion. Mr Turner is critical of the News Corporation chairman on three fronts: his decision to give up his Australian citizenship in favour of an American one so that he could own a US network; his eagerness to go downmarket to increase sales; and Mr Murdoch's political interference in his newspapers. 'We all know Mr Murdoch would go downmarket at the drop of a hat and that's something we haven't done. He has also used his newspapers to promote his own political views and that is something I don't do (through CNN). Everyone should have their say,' says Mr Turner, who has campaigned with his wife on environment issues and on reducing the amount of violence on television. 'We have the sweeter stuff - its Yogi Bear,' he says, pointing to his tie depicting characters from The Flintstones, another old-fashioned favourite in the Turner library. 'The easiest way to make a quick buck is to go downmarket, to take off clothes, to blow someone's brains out, to stage a car crash.' Mr Turner insists his programme channels will stick to 'the high ground', a course that will, ultimately, he believes, prove the soundest business strategy. The only thing that cheers him up about Mr Murdoch is his age: Mr Murdoch is 62, eight years older than Mr Turner. 'I'm a lot smaller than Rupert (in terms of business size) but Rupert is a lot older than I am. According to the actuarial tables I'll have 10 years after he's gone off if everything works out right.' Whatever the age differences, the pressure is on as the new breed of international media moguls compete to integrate the production and distrubution of films and televison programes and beam their channels around the world by satellite. Mr Murdoch, Mr Turner and Mr Sumner Redstone's Viacom, owner of MTV the pop music channel and Nickelodeon, the children's channel, are at the forefront of this race. Mr Redstone has just staked his claim for such status with an Dollars 8bn bid for Paramount, one of the few Hollywood studios not controlled by an international conglomerate. Is Mr Turner, who tilted audaciously but unsuccessfully at the CBS network in 1985 and then concluded a messy, incomplete deal over MGM, now preparing to ride off in pursuit of Paramount? Last week he was dismissive of the possibility because of the costs. But there is growing speculation that Mr Turner, who shares with Mr Murdoch a visceral feel for strategic deals, may be about to enter a rampant bid phase again. Shortly after after his marriage to Jane Fonda Mr Turner retreated to his Montana ranch where he breeds bison; he was content to turn up at CNN just one day a month. Now he is back and looking for action. Although Paramount would be an enormous target for Turner Broadcasting System, which last year earned net income of Dollars 77.6m on revenues of Dollars 1.77bn, the parent has powerful shareholders, who might provide support. They include John Malone of TCI, the largest cable operator in the world with an equally voracious appetite for Hollywood films, and Time Warner. While Mr Turner ponders whether to seriously go for a home run on Paramount, he has encountered a little local difficulty in Europe, where the French and Belgian authorities are blocking his TNT/Cartoon Network on the grounds of insufficient European content. Even the British government is starting to hint that satellite channels should carry more European programmes. 'They've (the French) got this bee in their bonnet about French culture, they've got a great culture. I've been to Versailles,' he says. Paramount aside, what does Mr Turner, who admits taking medicine for mild manic phases, still want to achieve? 'Catch a 10lb bass and win a World Series,' he replies quick as a flash. And, of course, remaining happy to be known as Jane Fonda's husband.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL FILE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1938  Born Cincinnati, Ohio. 1963  Takes control of Turner Advertising Company. 1970  Buys Channel 17 in Atlanta and in 1976 turns it into       'Superstation' by going on satellite. 1976  Buys Atlanta Braves baseball team and, a year later, Atlanta Hawks       basketball team in limited partnership. 1977  Successfully defends America's Cup in his yacht Courageous. 1980  Launches CNN. 1986  Buys MGM. 1991  Marries his third wife, actress Jane Fonda.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

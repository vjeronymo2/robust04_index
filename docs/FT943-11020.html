			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Technology: Overtaking in the motor industry - Steel makers are fighting off a threat from aluminium Steel is under threat in one of its biggest markets but the world's producers are starting to fight back. The battleground is the motor industry; the challenge comes from aluminium, a much lighter material which the Volkswagen group of Germany has already made clear it intends to use extensively in future cars. In their counter-move, British Steel and more than 20 steel producers from Europe, Asia, Australia and North America are banding together to design the lightest possible steel structure for car bodies. They want to help car makers achieve cost-effective weight reductions. But the undeclared aim is to protect the steel industry from the growing threat to steel's dominance in car body structures. Launching the joint programme last month, the steel makers claimed that a 20 per cent reduction in body weight can be achieved by optimising current design and material availability, with a 35 per cent saving possible using advanced design and production methods. British Steel has invested heavily in developing new products - high-strength and coated steels for the motor industry, now regarded as possibly its most important area of business. But the UK steel maker and producers worldwide have been jolted by the enthusiasm that Volkswagen, Europe's biggest car maker, has displayed for aluminium and the interest being taken in the material by other vehicle makers. Historically, only expensive cars produced in very low volumes - such as Rolls-Royces - have their bodies made of aluminium, which is several times more expensive than steel. However, car makers and the big aluminium companies such as Alcoa of the US have recently adopted a 'whole-life' and 'total energy' approach to the material. They claim that good recyclability can be combined with simplified volume car assembly processes to make it a cost-competitive rival to steel, while also delivering lighter, more fuel-efficient vehicles. Audi, VW's executive car division, has just launched an aluminium-bodied executive car, the A8, with envisaged production of up to 30,000 units a year. More worryingly for the steel industry, VW executives say there is no reason why even volume cars such as the Golf should not eventually be made cost-effectively with aluminium 'space frame' bodies - skeleton-like structures clad with outer panels. However, the steel companies insist that not only can steel virtually match this level of weight-saving, it also has advantages over aluminium. It is more easily repaired and has an already-established repair infrastructure in place. The steel makers also maintain that painting steel is less costly and environmentally damaging than painting other materials; that the aluminium recycling process is more complex and costly than the aluminium industry acknowledges; that making steel requires only one-fifth the energy of aluminium and that in terms of total energy usage, the lower fuel economy of lightweight aluminium cars would only partly compensate for energy consumed during the aluminium production process. The steel industry's design programme is to be directed by Porsche Engineering Services, the US affiliate of the German luxury sports car maker. It will build on research work by Porsche Engineering for Ford and the American Iron and Steel Institute. This has provided pointers as to how the body weight of a four-door, medium-sized saloon could be cut by 20 per cent. VW is collaborating with BMW, Mercedes-Benz and German and French steel producers on parallel projects to develop ways of designing and producing lighter, stronger body components and sub-assemblies out of high-strength steels. Whichever way weight savings are achieved, the potential for reducing vehicle fuel consumption is considerable. Ludwig Hamm, Porsche's head of body engineering, says even a 20 per cent reduction in average body weights would save 800m litres of fuel a year in the US and Europe.</p>

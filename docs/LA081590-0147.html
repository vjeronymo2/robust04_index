			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AUTO WORKER'S 'NO THANKS' TO NON-UNION CAR PAYS OFF  </P> <P> Because of the car she wouldn't take, Pamela Richards has just picked up one  free set of wheels and is about to get another.  </P> <P> The 39-year-old auto-parts worker and member of the United Auto Workers became  a hero of the union movement earlier this month for turning down a $17,600  Honda Accord on a game show because it was made at a non-union factory.  </P> <P> The remark was deleted when the taped Ohio Lottery program aired a night later,  but word got around.  </P> <P> "The phone just keeps on ringing. I've had hundreds of people call me, telling  me that they didn't have the right to delete the reason why I didn't accept the  Honda," she said from her home about 30 miles from Toledo.  </P> <P> The 23-year employee of Toledo Precision Machining, a Chrysler Corp.  subsidiary, also got a letter from Chrysler Chairman Lee A. Iacocca commending  her.  </P> <P> And a Chrysler-Plymouth dealership flew Richards and a daughter to Huntington,  W. Va. -- where they stayed at the home of a company vice president -- to pick  up a 1990 Chrysler Imperial to use for a year.  </P> <P> "She stood her ground and refused to accept that Honda. That takes a lot of  character," said Frank Horney, president of Huntington Chrysler-Plymouth Inc.  He said he first offered her a Plymouth Acclaim, valued at up to $14,000, but  then thought about what she did and decided she "deserves the best."  </P> <P> Later this week, she will get another vehicle, from the AFL-CIO.  </P></p>

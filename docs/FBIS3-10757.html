			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At least 6,000 National Police [PN] officers and an  equal number of Civilian National Police [PNC] will participate  in the national security plan for the 20 March elections, it was  officially reported.    The PNC will be in charge of La Union, Morazan, San Miguel,  Usulutan, San Vicente, and Chalatenango Departments and their  corresponding municipalities. The PN will be in charge of San  Salvador, La Libertad -- excluding the seat that will be under  the PNC -- Santa Ana, Sonsonate, and Ahuachapan Departments and  their corresponding municipalities.    Security will focus on the individuals responsible for  handling and transporting electoral material, which will be done  via private trucks. Magistrate Eduardo Colindres explained that  the Electoral Tribunal has solicited bids so the most  appropriate company in terms of cost and security considerations  can be chosen to provide the service.    The PNC, not the Army, will provide security for the  transportation of electoral material. Colindres said: "The  Electoral Code indicates that the PNC will be responsible for  security. We have therefore reached an agreement with them to  do so."    Unlike previous elections, the 20 March elections will take  place from 0700 to 1700 in both urban and rural areas.    On election day, police officers will maintain a discreet  distance from the voting place, never standing near voting  tables or areas where voters could be moving about, Colindres  explained.    In addition, the Electoral Tribunal will have at its  disposal  several helicopters that will transport personnel and original  tally sheets from limited access areas to San Salvador. The  heliport will be set up in a parking lot in front of the  Presidente Hotel, the cite of the election control center.    The aircraft crew will carry out only this mission. In other  words, documents will be handled only by Tribunal personnel,  international observers, and party delegates, if necessary.  There is no risk. The aircraft will have enough fuel for a  nonstop flight, so en route technical stopovers will be  unnecessary.    In addition to security at the Department seats, the PNC and  the PN will provide security for the 262 municipalities in the  national territory and on the routes where electoral material  could be transported or where personnel could pass with  electoral material.    The PNC and PN rank and will be linked through  communications  radios so their chief can learn of any incidents anywhere in the  country. The two institutions will be supplied with vehicles  and radios with a range wide enough to cover the entire country.    Although it has not been officially decided, it is possible  that a specific number of soldiers could be deployed on some  roads as a deterrent in case of an emergency. As of yesterday,  meetings were still being held to discuss the security plan.    In La Libertad Department, the PNV will provide security for  the (Nueva San Salvador or Santa Tecla) seat, while the PN will  be responsible for the municipalities and the road to the seat.    There are some places labeled former conflict areas where  FMLN groups are known to have their rank and file organized.  One example is the Perquin road to Sabaneras, where an  "entrance" is controlled by FMLN groups that restrict passage.  It is said that this place has difficult access. The PNC will  also be in these places, consulted sources said.    Regarding statements by some groups organized by political  parties that they are "security for the votes," the consulted  sources said there is no danger as each party is responsible for  the actions of each of its members.</p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENDING STALIN TO SIBERIA  </P> <P> For months a special Soviet commission has been poring over records from the  1930s, reviewing the charges of treason and other high crimes brought against  hundreds of old Bolsheviks who were executed at Josef Stalin's command. Many of  the most prominent officials convicted during the infamous purge trials have  now been exonerated, with the accusations that cost them their lives dismissed  as fabrications. But for every major figure who was forced to confess to  imaginary crimes by Stalin's torturers, tens of thousands of ordinary Soviet  citizens also suffered. Now, as part of the reform effort to shed greater light  on the Soviet Union's dark and bloody past, the Communist Party's Central  Committee has proposed the mass rehabilitation of these victims.  </P> <P> The idea of a blanket reversal of convictions was probably prompted as much by  administrative need as by the pleas of the surviving purge victims and their  families. So enormous was the number of those arrested and condemned to quick  execution or deadly servitude in the vast Siberian penal empire that reviewing  their cases on an individual basis would likely take centuries. Those who felt  the worst of the terror have been clamoring for recognition and fitting  memorials. It appears that they may soon get both.  </P> <P> Soviet historians, meanwhile, are starting to ask that the archives of the  period be opened. Even now there are only informed estimates about the number  of people killed or condemned to slave labor during decades of terror. Western  experts, using census figures and what is known of the size of various penal  camps, put the number of those affected at anywhere between 7 and 23 million.  </P> <P> It was the practice of the secret police to arrest someone, force him to name  eight or ten other supposed anti-state conspirators, and then force the new  arrestees to implicate still others. The number of victims thus came to expand  geometrically. In time, suggests Robert Conquest, the foremost Western  historian of the great terror, the frightful logic of the purges would have led  to the arrest of every Soviet citizen. And so the terror came to be restricted  -- though it never disappeared, continuing until Stalin's death in 1953. The  pain that it still evokes among ordinary Russians is evident. That a system not  noted for its sensitivity to popular suffering feels compelled now to try to  address that pain is significant.  </P></p>

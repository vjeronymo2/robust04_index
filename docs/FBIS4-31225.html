			<p>BFN     [Text] After the talks between the joint Croat-Bosniak  delegation and Yasushi Akashi and his aides, Bosnia-Herzegovina  Federation President Zubak said: We have completed the first  round of talks, during which we presented to Mr. Akashi our  proposal for an agreement which would mean the cessation of  hostilities in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The essence of our proposals  is that the deadlines and modalities of establishing a  cease-fire should not lead to the freezing of the current  situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, President Zubak said.    Federation Vice President Ganic added that he expects a new  round of talks at 1700, not with [Bosnian Serb leader] Karadzic  but with Akashi and his team of military experts who are  supported by cochairman Stoltenberg and a UN team.    Secretary-General Butrus-Ghali and his special envoy Akashi  had a meeting in the Palais des Nations this afternoon. They  discussed the modalities and deadlines for a cease-fire in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The United Nations is hoping that the  cease-fire negotiations will begin today.</p>

For six months he failed to appear at Kuntsevskiy Rayon  Court  in the city of Moscow, where legal action to defend the honor  and dignity of the State Duma deputy and leader of the Russian  All-National Union is in progress against O. Kalugin and the  newspaper IZVESTIYA. On Tuesday 15 February the defendant  appeared before the court. During the hearing he basically  confirmed that his action was prompted by political motives: He  had to discredit Baburin.    Addressing the court, Sergey Baburin reminded those present  that "Kalugin's slanderous statements were reproduced by dozens  and dozens of mass media sources, to be relished and publicly  commented on by his political opponents." But he has not yet  received any apology for the offending article.</p>

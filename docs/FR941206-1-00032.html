This SIP revision was submitted by the State of New Jersey to satisfy the statutory mandate that an Employee Commute Options Program be established for employers with 100 or more employees. Under the New Jersey program, compliance plans must be developed by these employers. These plans are to be designed to convincingly demonstrate an increase in the average passenger occupancy (APO) of their employees who commute to work during the peak period of no less than 25 percent above the average vehicle occupancy (AVO) of the nonattainment area. AVO is defined as the number of employees reporting to all worksites in the program area from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m., divided by the number of vehicles driven by these employees during a typical work week. APO is defined as the number of employees reporting to a specific site from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m., divided by the number of vehicles driven by these employees.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before January 5, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  All comments should be addressed to: William S.

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 requires employers with 100 or more employees in severe and extreme ozone nonattainment areas to participate in a trip reduction program. This includes 18 of the 21 counties in New Jersey, excluding the counties of Warren, Atlantic, and Cape May. EPA issued guidance on December 17, 1992 interpreting various aspects of the statutory requirements (Employee Commute Options Guidance, December 1992). Although the federal program has been named ``Employee Commute Options,'' or ``ECO'', the State of New Jersey has opted for the name ``Employer Trip Reduction,'' or ``ETR''. The program shall be referred to as ``ETR'' for the remainder of this document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The concern that led to the inclusion of the ETR provision in the amended Clean Air Act is that people are driving more than ever before. In addition, the distances driven per trip have increased considerably. This has resulted in a rapid increase in the number of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and has offset a large part of the emissions reductions achieved through the production and sale of vehicles that operate more cleanly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  It is widely accepted that within a decade, the increased emissions caused by increased VMT and congestion will outweigh the benefits derived from new less polluting vehicles. Unless this increase in VMT is mitigated, there will be an overall increase in emissions from motor vehicles. The ETR provision is designed to decrease the use of single occupancy vehicles and to reduce emissions_beyond what can be and will be obtained via stricter tailpipe and fuel standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Section 182(d)(1)(B) of the amended Clean Air Act requires that employers submit their compliance plans to a state within two years of the date the State submits its trip reduction plan to EPA. The compliance plans should be designed to ``convincingly demonstrate'' an increase in the APO for their employees who commute to work during the peak period by no less than 25 percent above the AVO of the area. New Jersey has established different zones within its nonattainment areas for the purpose of calculating the AVO. The compliance plans must ``convincingly demonstrate'' that the employers will meet the target within two years of submitting a compliance plan, or by November 15, 1996 for New Jersey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  In order to gain approval, a state's submittal must contain each of the following program elements:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The AVO for each zone if the area is divided into zones;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) the target APO(s) which is(are) no less than 25 percent above the AVO(s);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) an ETR program that includes a process for compliance demonstration; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) enforcement procedures to ensure submission and implementation of compliance plans by employers. The acceptability of these elements as submitted by New Jersey is discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

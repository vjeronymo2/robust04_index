			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Procedures for inviting bids for export commodity quotas </F> issued by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation; place and date not given: "Ministry of Foreign  Trade and Economic Cooperation Procedures for Inviting Bids for  Export Commodity Quotas (Trial Implementation)"]    [Text] Article 1. To improve and perfect the  quota allocation system, to establish a mechanism for fair  competition, to protect the overall interests of the state and  the legal rights and interests of enterprises engaged in foreign  trade, and to ensure normal order in the export business, the  Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC] has  formulated these procedures for inviting bids for export  commodity quotas on the basis of the interim provisions for the  administration of exported commodities sanctioned by the State  Council.    Article 2. In the work of inviting bids, it is  necessary to abide by the following principles: "Fair, Open,  Competitive, and Beneficial."    Article 3. These procedures are applicable to all  export commodities on the quota list of MOFTEC.    Article 4. MOFTEC is responsible for the  supervision and guidance of bidding invitations. MOFTEC  determines the commodities for which bids are invited and set  up. A special committee (the bidding committee) has been set up  to administer bidding invitations for the quota of export  commodities approved by the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The  bidding committee is made up of the relevant division under  MOFTEC and relevant import and export trade associations, which  are in charge of the actual invitation of bids for commodity  quotas. The bidding committee sets up various offices (the  bidding offices) which handle day-to-day work in those trade  associations.    Article 5. The bidding procedures stipulated here  are bidding with compensation. That is, the enterprise which  wins the bid gets the quotas, provided it pays accordingly.    The specific bidding procedures are determined by the  bidding  committee according to the type of commodities open for bidding.    Article 6. Bidding scope: Size of quota, price  of quota. Size of quota refers to the quantity of the export  commodity on the quota list. Price of quota refers to the  expense (in renminbi) for each unit the winning bidder has to  pay. The winning bidder has to pay a fee; i.e., unit price  multiplied by the quota quantity, to the bidding committee.    The fee collected by the bidding committee is used entirely  for the state's development of exports.    Article 7. Quantity for bidding is decided by  MOFTEC on the basis of the previous year's actual exports of  quota-administered commodities and the need in the international  market. The quantity the bidding committee invited for bidding  must be within the range of the total quantity of commodity  decided by MOFTEC.    Article 8. The number of bidding invitations is  determined by MOFTEC and the bidding committee according to the  related situations of different commodities. In principle, each  commodity is set for bidding twice a year. Each bidding  invitation gives a three-month notice.    Article 9. Bidding invitation notices are to be  announced by the news media designated by the bidding committee.    Article 10. All import and export companies that  are members of the import and export trade association and are  sanctioned by MOFTEC to have foreign trade management rights,  all production enterprises that are sanctioned to have foreign  trade management rights (restricted to their own products), and  foreign-invested enterprises (restricted to their own products),  may submit tenders.    Article 11. All enterprises that intend to enter  a bid must complete an "Application for Entering a Bid," which  is issued by the bidding office. This application should be  completed and submitted to the bidding office before a set date.  An enterprise is allowed to enter only one bid for each  commodity.    Article 12. The "Application for Entering a Bid"  must be submitted to the bidding office before the deadline  established by the bidding committee. (It can also be sealed  and sent by mail or by courier.) The date of receipt of the  form determines the judgment of validity.    Article 13. Based on the valid applications  submitted by enterprises, the bidding committee assesses the  quota quantity for the above-said enterprises.    Article 14. The basis for assessment:    1. Consistent with Article 10 of these procedures.    2. The quota price should not be lower than the average  price of the bidding prices offered by bidders.    The average quota price is calculated on the following  formula:    bidders' quota price x bidding quantity  Average Quota    Price = ---------------------------------------    total quantity of tender bidding    3. A copy of the certificate showing the previous year's  export earnings related to the commodity concerned.    4. The Bidding Office has the right to rule out bidders  whose offers are far from the normal standard.    Article 15. Requirements for winning a bid: The  list of bidders which are able to meet the requirements in  Article 14, and the order of the winners are decided by the  bidding committee according to their price offers for the quota  of the commodity.    Article 16. The bid-winning quantity of the  winning bidder is calculated on the following formula:    Bid-Winning Quantity =    bidders' price X bidders' quantity    \ total quantity for tender offer X    winners' price X winners' quantity    If the bid-winning quantity, which is calculated according  to  the aforesaid formula, is larger than the actual quantity the  winning enterprise requires, the bid-winning quantity can be  lowered to its requirement.  The bid-winning fee is calculated on the following formula:    Bid-winning fee = bidder's quantity X bidder's price    Article 17. The bidding committee should finish  its evaluation of a tender offer before a set date.    Article 18. After the announcement of the bid  winners, the bidding committee should send its certificate to  the winner before a set date, report the result to MOFTEC, and  notify the license-issuing authorities.    If any malpractice or violations of the stipulations in  these  procedures are found and proved, MOFTEC has the right to veto  the results of the bidding.    Article 19. Names of bid winners are announced in  a unified way by news media designated by the bidding committee.    Article 20. Basis for issuing export licenses:    1. Names of bid winners (bid winners for major markets are  listed separately).    2. Quantity of bids won.    3. Contracted price for the export commodity (not less than  coordinated price).    4. Country or area to which the bid-winning quota is  applied.    Article 21. The bid winner may get the export  license at the license-issuing authority upon presentation of  the bid-winning certificate and transaction contract. The  license-issuing authority must examine the bid-winning  certificate issued by the bidding committee before issuing the  export license. The license-issuing authority is not to issue  export licenses to those who fail to produce bid-winning  certificates or contracts which are not consistent with the  certificates; otherwise, the license-issuing authority will be  held responsible.    Article 22. If the bid winner is unable to abide  by a contract with the foreign enterprise, it should get  approval from the bidding office before the set date and  transfer its quota to another enterprise. For this, it has to  pay a transfer fee. The transfer should be held publicly in a  place designated by the bidding committee. Priority is given  according to the order of time and price, which are handled by  computer. Outside transactions are strictly forbidden. The new  bidders must be qualified to bid for such commodities, and no  further transfer is allowed.    Article 23. If the bid winner is can neither  abide by the contract with a foreign enterprise, nor transfer  its quota to others, it should hand in the quota to the bidding  office with a written explanation. Once the quota is handed in,  part of the bidding fee is refunded. The returned quota will be  added to the total quantity of the next tender offer.    Article 24. When the quota of the commodity is  cleared through Customs, the enterprise concerned should hand in  the export license of the commodity to the bidding office (one  duplicate copy is left with the enterprise). The bidding office  is responsible for checking and filing statistics and reporting  the execution of the contract to the bidding committee, to  enable the latter to manage and supervise the export commodities  subject to bidding.    Article 25. If the bid winner fails to use the  quota, to transfer it to others, or to hand it in to the bidding  office within the time period before the set date, the bidding  office, with the approval of the bidding committee, has the  right to deprive this enterprise of the right to participate in  the next year's tender bidding for the same commodity or to be a  receiver of a transfer.    Article 26. If a bid winner has transferred its  quota to others without the approval of the bidding office, it  will be deprived of its right to participate in the next two  years' tender bidding for the same commodity, or to be a  receiver of a transfer.    Article 27. If the bid winner sets its export  price lower than the coordinated price stipulated by the trade  associations, this enterprise will be deprived of its rights for  the next three years' tender bidding for the same commodity, or  to be a receiver of a transfer.    Article 28. These procedures shall go into effect  on 2 February 1994. Rights for explanation remain with MOFTEC.</p>

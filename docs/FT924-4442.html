			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Trafalgar House reports Pounds 30m loss TRAFALGAR House, the constr- uction, engineering and shipping group, reported a loss before tax of Pounds 30.3m after exceptional property write-downs of Pounds 138m to the year ended September 30. Last year's pre-tax profits of Pounds 122.4m were restated as a loss of Pounds 38.5m in light of the Financial Reporting Review Panel's decision that property write-downs should be taken through the profit and loss account and not through reserves. The final dividend was held at 1.6p, making a total of 6p. Mr Allan Gormly, chief executive, said the group 'will seek to establish a dividend level which can be sustained'. He said he was keeping his options open as to what the group could afford to pay in the future. Trafalgar's ordinary and A shares fell by 6p to close at 89p and 86p respectively. Mr Gormly signalled his disapproval of the decision by Hongkong Land, the Jardine Matheson-controlled Hong Kong property company, to enter into an option arrangement with a financial house to buy a further 36m shares, taking its Trafalgar stake above 20 per cent. He said he had asked both the Stock Exchange and the Takeover Panel to look into the arrangement, but both said it was 'right and proper'. Trafalgar is concerned that Hongkong Land will exercise a 'significant amount of control' with a minority shareholding. Group borrowings, including off-balance sheet debt, amount to Pounds 452.2m, giving gearing of 86 per cent. Exceptional property write-downs, and the advance corporation tax write-off of Pounds 40.3m, reduced shareholders' funds by 21 per cent to Pounds 542.2m. The group hopes to make a number of disposals. It said it had two interesting offers for the Stafford and Duke hotels which are valued by Trafalgar at Pounds 40m. Sir Nigel Broackes and Sir Eric Parker, former chairman and chief executive respectively, are to receive compensation of Pounds 1.9m arising from early termination of their service agreements. Sir Nigel is honorary president without a seat on the board while Sir Eric remains a deputy chairman until he reaches 60 next June. There was a loss per share of 17p compared with a restated loss of 19.9p. Lex, Page 22; Details, Page 24</p>

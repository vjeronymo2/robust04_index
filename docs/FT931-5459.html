			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Pepsi to invest Dollars 750m in Mexico over five years PEPSICO said it would invest about Dollars 750m over the next five years to strengthen its bottling operations, extend its distribution network and market its products more aggressively in Mexico, agencies report from Mexico City. 'This involves an immediate investment of Dollars 115m in association with Pepsi's bottlers in Mexico, which will generate important economic benefits for the country, among them the creation of 10,000 new jobs,' according to a PepsiCo de Mexico news release issued at a news conference by Pepsi Cola International president Mr Christopher Sinclair. Mr Sinclair said Pepsi had bought shares in three Mexican bottling firms to increase its bottling and distribution capacity, with 29 per cent of Grupo Embotelladores Unidas, 49 per cent of Grupo Protexa, and 20 per cent of Grupo Rello. Pepsi expects to modernise some facilities and will build a new bottling plant in the Tampico region, he said. Pepsi Cola has 31 per cent of the Mexican cola drinks market, up from 26 per cent two years ago.</p>

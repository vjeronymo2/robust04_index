			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Trafficmaster for market at Pounds 28.7m Trafficmaster, a Luton-based company which claims to offer the world's first commercially available on-board traffic monitoring system, is coming to the market with a capitalisation of Pounds 28.74m, writes Andrew Bolger. Allied Provincial has placed 7.5m Trafficmaster shares with institutions at 130p each. Dealings begin on March 31. Mr David Martell, the chief executive, said the marketing had been very well received and the flotation would raise Pounds 7.17m in new money - more than originally planned. Trafficmaster has installed infra-red sensors which monitor traffic speed, transmit it by radio to a central computer and then feed the information to visual display units in subscribers' vehicles, advising motorists of the average speed and direction of any hold-up. The system already covers more than 1,000 miles of motorways and trunk roads in the south of England and the Midlands and part of the flotation proceeds will be used to extend the network to cover the main motorways in England, Wales and Scotland by the end of this year, and main trunk roads during 1995 and 1996. The directors said that once the network was complete revenue from each subscriber should push profitability up quickly.</p>

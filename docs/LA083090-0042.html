			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOYOLA RECRUITS 6-10 PLAYER FROM CZECH NATIONAL TEAM  </P> <P> The Loyola Marymount basketball team has apparently filled its biggest need,  getting a 6-foot-10 center. Richard Petruska, 21-year-old center for the  Czechoslovakian national team, attended the first day of classes at the school  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Petruska, who has spent much of the summer in the Southland, was apparently  interested in attending a California college and shifted his attention to  Loyola when Ed O'Bannon, star high school player from Artesia, recently chose  UCLA.  </P> <P> The Czech team played a preseason game at Loyola two years ago, and Petruska  scored 36 points, making 15 of 17 shots, mostly layups. Petruska will have  three years of eligibility.  </P> <P> "He's big, he's tall, he runs pretty well," Loyola Coach Paul Westhead said,  adding that he won't know if he can play at Loyola's hectic pace until practice  starts Oct. 15.  </P> <P> Jay Hillock, assistant coach, said: "He's a low-post player. We don't have much  of a feel (but) we think he can be an impact player. We think he can score  points."  </P> <P> Points have been Loyola's forte, but most of them are gone with the graduation  of Bo Kimble and Jeff Fryer, the decision of forward Per Stumer not to return  to school, and with the death of Hank Gathers.

At what constituted the first base-level  assembly of the province's workers movement, the 80 workers of  this center came out in favor of continuing to provide free  public health and education services, among others. They all  agreed, however, that there had to be an end to inflated  personnel rolls, and that direct production labor had to be  increased. They explained that excess personnel should accept  offers of new jobs that offer a minimal salary guarantee.    The assembly also came out in favor of changing the currency  as a way to streamline finances, and of confiscating the  property of so-called "profiteers" [macetas].</p>

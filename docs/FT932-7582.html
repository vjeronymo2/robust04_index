			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Losses close a turbulent week for Dow Wall Street A combination of profit-taking, expiration-related trading and sell programs meant US share prices ended a tumultuous week with sharp losses, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 30.45 at 3,492.83. The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 ended 4.75 lower at 445.84, while the Amex composite finished down 0.57 at 432.86, and the Nasdaq composite down 3.14 at 694.29. Trading volume on the NYSE was 273m shares. Following Wednesday and Thursday's record-breaking gains - the Dow climbed 79 points over the two days - some investors chose to book some of their profits as soon as trading opened, contributing to an early 20-point decline in the Dow. The fact that a large number of analysts remained suspicious of the market's strength, believing that the buying was an over-reaction to the absence of an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve, only hastened the rush to take some profits. The monthly expiration of stock and stock index futures also sparked some early selling. Although share prices quickly rallied from early technical selling, stocks were hit later in the day by fresh declines in bond prices. The benchmark 30-year government bond fell almost  1/2 point, sending the yield back over 7 per cent. A number of afternoon sell programs, and news of higher gold prices, subsequently pushed stocks to new lows late in the session. AT&amp;T received an early lift from securities house Alex Brown, which upgraded its rating on the stock and raised its earnings growth estimates. The recommendation helped AT&amp;T gain Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 60 3/4 , but by the close the shares had slipped back to end down Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 59 1/8 . Trading volume was heavy at 3.3m shares. Other leading stocks, under pressure from profit-taking, were also lower. They included Coca-Cola, down Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 40 7/8 , Pepsico, down Dollars 1 at Dollars 36 3/4 , Walt Disney, Dollars  7/8 lower at Dollars 43 1/8 , and Time Warner, down Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 36 1/8 . Storage Technology surged Dollars 1 to Dollars 40 5/8 in volume of 1m shares after the company said it had agreed to acquire Amperif, a privately held storage system manufacturer, for Dollars 83.6m. The news that Storage Tech also plans to start shipping its long-delayed Iceberg storage system by the fourth quarter of this year also buoyed the stock. May Department Stores rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 75 1/4 after the retailer announced plans to invest Dollars 4.6bn over next five years on new stores. The company also announced a 2-for-1 stock split. Canada TORONTO stocks closed little changed in extremely heavy trading. The composite index rose 4.40 points, or 0.11 per cent, to 3835.99, with advances leading declines 378 to 294. On the week, the index was up about 22 points. Volume, the third highest on record, was increased by extremely heavy trading in Encor Inc. (about 14.1m shares) and American Eagle Petroleums (about 12.8m shares), which are involved in separate merger transactions. Volume reached 87,446,000 shares, above yesterday's 83,375,000 shares, and trading value was CDollars 625.6m against CDollars 541.7m.</p>

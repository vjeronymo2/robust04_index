			<p>BFN     [Text] [Correspondent Aleksandr Gerasimov] Last week, in an  exclusive interview with our program, Aleksandr Rutskoy--who for  two months had been keeping a vow of silence following his  release from the Lefortovo prison--said he was ready to unite  and head all opposition movements inclined toward [word  indistinct].    [Begin recording] [Rutskoy] I want to do this.    [Gerasimov] What organizational form could this take?    [Rutskoy] It could be a public political movement, not a  party; not now, because people have had enough. It could be a  public political movement that would express the interests of  society, the interests of the state, and the interests of the  individual. An organization of this kind can be set up. It  can, and it must. This is the first task that has to be dealt  with--to set up a civilized opposition, to draw up clear and  easily understood programs, and to publicize them.    I have no doubts that people will follow this public  political movement, which would stand for the national interests  of the state and its people. They will follow because I just  cannot see who they can follow at present. I cannot. I cannot  see it, looking objectively at any party, at any public  political movement now in existence. I can give way to anyone  as soon as I see that there is a person capable of leading,  capable of setting up a civilized opposition, capable of  explaining the situation clearly to the people and of telling  and showing them how and by what means a way out of this  situation can be found. [end recording]    [Gerasimov] The former vice-president intends to start  forming the opposition movement as soon as the public accord  treaty is signed. Rutskoy said: I will see who signs, who  volunteers to don a muzzle, and I will try to unite those  without a muzzle.</p>

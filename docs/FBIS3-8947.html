			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 14 (CTK) -- Outgoing Slovak Prime  Minister Vladimir Meciar told journalists today that he had  received two letters from President Michal Kovac. In the first  one Kovac informed him of his dismissal and in the second one  asked him as chairman of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  (HZDS), the strongest political party, to name a HZDS  representative to form a new cabinet. Meciar said that the HZDS  would not participate in any government and went into opposition.    The Slovak Government ended its activity at its meeting  today, Meciar said. A vote of no-confidence in his government  was passed by parliament on Friday. He said the government  unanimously voted to end its activity, as according to the  constitution the prime minister's resignation forces the  government to resign.    According to the resolution adopted at the last government  meeting, none of Meciar's cabinet will accept the president's  offer to stay in office until a new cabinet is appointed. The  government decided to recall all its state secretaries and heads  of administration in all fields.</p>

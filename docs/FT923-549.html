			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Presidential punches miss the mark: Bush's badly needed turning point is continuing to prove elusive TURNING points in elections anywhere are sometimes seen as they happen, but are mostly perceived with the benefit of hindsight. All that can be said about this US presidential campaign, now down to the last five weeks and a day, is that President George Bush needs a turning point, desperately. It is not easy to see where it could come from. The economy cannot save him now, as every weekly, monthly, and quarterly number demonstrates. Hammering Governor Bill Clinton as the mad taxman of Arkansas, also inclined to let murderers out on the street before their time, is an exercise in statistical futility, rendered suspect by Mr Bush's own sanctioning of the second largest tax increase in US history two years ago. Bashing his Democratic opponent for dodging the draft 23 years ago is not resonating and, even if the country cared, is neutralised by continuing allegations about what then-Vice-President Bush knew about the Iran-Contra scandals, about which it may care just as little. Trying to paint Mr Clinton as an Oxford-educated social engineer intent on recreating what had failed in Warsaw, Prague and Moscow does not stick in these post-cold war days. Mr Bush may be seeking to shed the albatross of 'family values' hung around his neck by the far right. But he could not last week stop television starting a new season of the drama Murphy Brown, whose heroine, an unwed mother, was the object of Vice-President Dan Quayle's summer discontent. This meant that the popular shows endlessly rehashed a debate that does not work to Mr Bush's advantage. If that were not bad enough, on Friday there was 'Magic' Johnson, the HIV-afflicted basketball star and national hero, resigning from the president's Aids commission with a blast at administration neglect of the problem. Last night 'Magic' aggravated the injury by endorsing Mr Clinton. 'We can't take four more years of the Bush administration that we have now,' he said. Even the places where Mr Bush now chooses to campaign are themselves an indication of desperation. To be sure, Michigan and Ohio, his weekend targets, are competitive and important states. But last week he was tied down in Mississippi and Oklahoma and tomorrow he will be in Texas, all of which would a few months ago have been automatically slotted on to his side of the political ledger. Nobody has the foggiest clue what Mr Ross Perot will finally do. But if the Texan billionaire damages anybody except, certainly, himself, by re-entering the race or by what he says, the suspicion is that it will be Mr Bush and in the states which he absolutely must win, like Texas and Florida, to retain the presidency. Some serious pundits, reeling off polling statistics from the Florida Keys to the Puget Sound, are beginning to talk of a Clinton landslide, comparable to President Lyndon Johnson's over Senator Barry Goldwater in 1964. Many point to the fact that no candidate since Truman in 1948, when polling was less sophisticated and the opposition over-confident, has been so far behind so late in the campaign as Mr Bush now is and gone on to win. Even personal experience, which should be inherently suspect, is becoming hard to ignore. Last Thursday, your correspondent and a German colleague went to Philadelphia to speak to a meeting of European chambers of commerce, not exactly a Democratic hotbed. On the train back to Washington that night, we compared notes and found that we had talked to only one person who proclaimed himself a staunch supporter of Bush. So what does Mr Bush do to retain his crown? It is increasingly hard to believe that he cannot now agree to debate with Mr Clinton, if necessary on his opponent's terms, which happen to be those of the independent bipartisan commission in charge of presidential debates. This means a single moderator, rather than a panel of inquisitive journalists. If there were two debates, both formats could be employed. The Bush campaign could also get more negative and seriously dirty. There has been a sharper edge to some 'factual' commercials, mostly about Arkansas, now flooding the air waves. The president, or more likely a surrogate, may go so far as to accuse Mr Clinton of physical cowardice or to 'reveal' something or somebody more plausible than Gennifer Flowers on the sex front. It is getting a little late to produce it and it will be harder still to make it stick. An October 'surprise' cannot be ruled out, though what it might now be is anybody's guess. There may be some mileage in a Middle East peace agreement before November 3, but the Arab vote is small and the Jewish vote inclined to return to its Democratic base. Iraq's President Saddam Hussein has virtually disappeared from the public consciousness. Or Mr Bush could simply plug away at what he is doing now, in the hope that what he is saying about the contrast between his anti-government philosophies and Mr Clinton's belief in state power will eventually take hold. He can invoke the patriotic spirit, and Mr Clinton's alleged lack of it, at every turn. He can continue to shower money on valuable constituencies such as defence and agriculture. He can also go on laying into the Democrats in Congress like there is no tomorrow, though they have been artful enough to lay some clever traps for him by inviting him to veto popular bills such as those on family leave and cable television regulation. Some of the president's recent speeches have been more specific and coherent, like the economics address in Detroit two weeks ago, which is a tribute to the influence of the Baker team. Mr Bush himself does not seem unhappy in what he calls his 'campaign mode'. It will only require one poll narrowing the deficit with Mr Clinton to make him positively delirious and to claim he has his opponent on the run. But at the moment it is not working. And it is getting very late in the day.</p>

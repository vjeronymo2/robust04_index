			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE AMERICAN MILITARY ACTION IN PANAMA  </P> <P> It is heartening to discover that our policy-makers have yielded to popular  opinion in matters of foreign policy. The invasion of the sovereign nation of  Panama to oust a dictator who stands accused of being an all around bad guy is  an indication that vigilante justice still lives. This could be the beginning  of an encouraging trend whereby protection under the law is denied anyone  suspected or accused of wrongdoing.  </P> <P> This new approach will considerably aid in the declared war on drugs because we  can take out anybody who probably deals in drugs without the lengthy and  expensive inconvenience of allowing them their day in court to confront their  accusers.  </P> <P> RUSS MARLETT  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

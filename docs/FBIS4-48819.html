			<p>BFN     [Text] National Assembly May 26 SAPA -- Regardless of the  political baggage all politicians carried, he was proud to say  he had been liberated by South Africa's transition to a full  democracy, the minister of environment affairs and tourism, Dr  Dawie de Villiers, said on Thursday. Speaking during debate on  the president's state of the nation address, he said the victory  achieved had not just been that of any one party, "but a victory  we can all share -- of freedom, democracy and justice".    South Africans should not under-estimate the enormous  challenges facing the country.    Dr de Villiers warned of a "very difficult future" if "we  fail to make peace with our past". He pledged the new National  Party's [NP] commitment to the new dispensation and said the  party would make its contribution to the writing of South  Africa's final constitution which should not have the  deficiencies of the interim one.    He drew further applause from ANC benches when he said  although the NP and ANC had differed on a number of issues, if  the two parties had not driven the negotiation process together  South Africa would not have reached the stage it had. Other  parties, such as the Inkatha Freedom Party, the Freedom Front  and the Democratic Party, had also made important contributions.    Many Afrikaners had sought escape in the dream of a white  homeland, but many conservatives now realised they had to come  to terms with reality.    Three particularly important areas to which President Nelson  Mandela had committed his government were financial discipline,  confidence in markets, and the role of the private sector in  securing a sustainable economy and the opening of the economy to  global competition. These commitments would inspire confidence  in the business community locally and internationally.    Although difficult times lay ahead, and painful decisions  needed to be taken, the NP would co-operate fully to make the  government of national unity work.</p>

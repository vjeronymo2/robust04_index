			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / International Company News: Slide at Cockerill Sambre NET PROFIT at Cockerill Sambre, the Belgian steel manufacturer, dropped from BFr3.1bn to BFr1.3bn (Dollars 42m) for the first half of 1992, hit by the slump in steel prices. The company said yesterday it expected to make a profit for the whole of 1992, providing steel prices and volumes did not deteriorate much further. During the first six months of the year, Cockerill generated turnover of BFr90.3bn, against BFr89bn last time. The group said the figures were not directly comparable because of new companies consolidated in the year. Adjusted for this, first-half turnover at Cockerill, 87 per cent of which is owned by the regional government of French-speaking Wallonia, slipped by 2 per cent.</p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Hanson in dispute over Nevada gold deposit Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, has become embroiled in an escalating dispute with Placer Dome of Vancouver over ownership of the sizeable Pipeline gold deposit in north-east Nevada. Placer this week filed the latest in a series of lawsuits between the two groups and other companies involved in exploration of the Pipeline property. Alleging that Hanson Natural Resources - a partnership which includes Hanson-controlled Gold Fields Mining - has interfered with its contractual rights, Placer has asked the court to declare that they have no claim against it. The suit is a response to allegations by the Hanson group that Placer failed to disclose that it had made a major gold discovery when it took up an option in August 1991 to buy the Pipeline property from Gold Fields. Placer estimated last April that the deposit has gold-bearing reserves of 11.3m tonnes, with a grade of 0.237 ounces per tonne. The gold content is estimated at 2.7m ounces. The dispute hinges partly on conversations between officials of the various companies, but also on the extent to which a mining company is entitled to keep its exploration data confidential. The Pipeline deposit abuts the existing Cortez joint venture in Nevada, which is owned 60 per cent by Placer and 40 per cent by Kennecott. The disputed area, which is six miles north-west of the Cortez processing plant, is estimated to contain about 45 per cent of the total Pipeline reserves. The rest of the deposit is part of the Cortez operation. A Placer official said that evaluation of the Pipeline deposit was proceeding 'as if nothing had happened.' A feasibility study is due to be completed early next year. But Mr Rich Cohen, mining analyst at Goepel Shields in Toronto, predicted yesterday that output, which had been forecast to begin within the next 2-3 years, could be delayed if the dispute drags on through the courts. Mr Cohen estimated that Pipeline was worth between CDollars 300 and CDollars 500m to Placer, equal to about CDollars 2 a share. Placer shares, which stood at CDollars 13.63 on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday morning, dropped sharply when the Pipeline dispute first surfaced, and have continued to under-perform the rest of the Canadian gold sector in recent weeks.</p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (4): A formidable challenge still - Kevin Done follows developments in the European car industry The European car industry is in the midst of hectic transition, as the European Union moves to become an open car market by the end of the decade. All restrictions on car and light commercial vehicle imports from Japan are due to be removed at the end of 1999, and carmakers in Europe are being forced to act quickly to close the competitive gap behind their Japanese and North American rivals. The pain and dislocation of transition has been compounded by the severity of the recession that struck the industry with full force last year, as west European new car sales fell by more than 15 per cent to 11.4m, the lowest total for eight years and the biggest year-on-year decline in the post-war period. Four of the Big Six volume car producers in west Europe, the Volkswagen group of Germany, PSA Peugeot Citroen of France, the Fiat group of Italy and Ford of Europe, were in loss last year, while profits fell sharply at Renault of France and General Motors Europe (Opel in continental Europe and Vauxhall in the UK). New car sales have begun to flicker back to life this year, and the financial performance of the industry is starting to recover, but the underlying challenge remains formidable. Several of the first wave of Japanese car plants in west Europe - built by Nissan, Toyota and Honda - have started production, adding to existing overcapacity and a fourth Japanese plant - a joint venture in the Netherlands between Mitsubishi Motors and Volvo of Sweden - is due to open next year. The share taken by Japanese carmakers in west Europe may be down this year - to 11 per cent in the first six months from 12.4 per cent in the corresponding period a year ago - as their price competitiveness has been battered by the rapid appreciation of the yen, but it is likely to be only a temporary respite. Japanese carmakers' west European market share is still forecast to rise to more than 15 per cent by the end of the decade, and their presence in those European markets that have previously operated without restrictions on Japanese vehicle imports, serves as a constant reminder of the threat. In the Netherlands Japanese carmakers controlled 25.9 per cent of the new car market last year, for example, and in Finland 38.5 per cent. Competition for the European carmakers is also growing from new sources, most notably South Korea and North America. Kia Motors is to become the first Korean carmaker to assemble passenger vehicles in Europe in a project to build up to 30,000 vehicles a year in Germany. Kia established sales operations in many European markets for the first time last year, and it will be followed in 1995 by Daewoo, the third largest Korean vehicle maker. Hyundai, the leading Korean vehicle producer, says that it is aiming nearly to double its European sales from less than 100,000 last year to 189,000 by the end of the decade. North America is also becoming a growing source for vehicle exports to Europe both from the big three US carmakers and from the expanding Japanese production base in the US and Canada. A recent study by the Economist Intelligence Unit forecast that North American and South Korean manufacturers would almost treble their sales in west Europe by 2000, with US import sales rising to more than 250,000 and South Korean sales increasing to 325,000 by the end of the decade. The market share of the traditional European car producers is forecast to fall from 85 to 79 per cent during the period. European carmakers are fighting back, however, and are in the midst of a period of far-reaching restructuring. Partly under the pressure of last year's heavy losses they have taken action in order to improve efficiency, often with drastic reductions of their workforces. Volkswagen of Germany, the leading European car producer which suffered a group loss of DM1.94bn last year, had reduced the workforce at its six domestic plants (excluding Audi) in the past three years by 27,000 to about 102,000 by the spring of 1994. Higher productivity and reduced sales volumes mean it still has about 30,000 surplus employees. For 1994 and 1995, VW is operating a pioneering agreement with the German trade unions, however, allowing a sharp cut in pay and working hours (to a 28.8 hours week) in order to stave off even more radical job losses. Ford of Europe, has reduced its workforce (excluding Jaguar) by 15 per cent with the loss of 15,100 jobs since late 1992. Mercedes-Benz, the car and commercial vehicle subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest engineering group, cut 14,700 jobs from its domestic workforce in 1992, a further 11,000 last year and it is planning to cut another 8,000 jobs this year to bring its workforce to 151,000 by the end of 1994. The cost-cutting measures along with a modest improvement in new car sales are helping the industry to improve its financial performance this year. New car sales in west Europe in the first eight months rose by 6 per cent to 8.5m. After three successive years of losses Ford's European automotive operations (excluding Jaguar) achieved a net profit of Dollars 353m in the first half of 1994 compared with a loss of Dollars 47m in the corresponding period a year ago. The Volkswagen group cut its loss in the first half this year to DM209m from a loss of DM1.6bn in the same period a year ago, and in the second quarter alone it returned to the black with a profit of DM133m compared with a loss of DM342m a year ago. Volvo of Sweden, which is busy selling off most of its non-automotive businesses in the wake of the break-up of its alliance with Renault, increased its group operating income to SKr4.47bn in the first half this year from only SKr166m a year ago. Its car operations alone jumped from an operating loss of SKr70m in the first half last year to a profit of SKr1.475bn in the first half of 1994. Restructuring is continuing to lead to a further concentration of the industry in Europe, most notably with the takeover earlier this year of Rover, the leading UK carmaker, by BMW of Germany. Restructuring is also taking on new forms, however, as carmakers move, for example, to dispose of in-house components operations to outside suppliers to allow themselves to concentrate on the core operations of the design, development and assembly of vehicles. Fiat has agreed recently to transfer a components operation with more than 700 employees to GKN, the UK automotive components supplier, and it is also selling its Sepi seat-making operations to Lear Seating of the US for Dollars 160m.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS JANUARY-AUGUST 1994  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Volume      Volume     Share (%)     Share (%)                        (Units)   Change(%)    Jan-Aug 94    Jan-Aug 93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET         8,517,000        +6.0         100.0         100.0 MANUFACTURERS: Volkswagen group     1,369,000        +4.5          16.1          16.3  -Volkswagen           882,000        +1.8          10.4          10.8  -Seat                 224,400       +18.4           2.6           2.4  -Audi                 222,000        +1.8           2.6           2.7  -Skoda*                41,000       +11.8           0.5           0.5 General Motors**     1,094,000        +5.1          12.8          13.0  -Opel/Vauxhall      1,048,000        +4.4          12.3          12.5  -Saab***               36,000       +35.3           0.4           0.3 PSA Peugeot Citroen  1,083,000       +11.6          12.7          12.1  -Peugeot              651,000       +10.3           7.6           7.3  -Citroen              432,000       +13.5           5.1           4.7 Ford group**         1,004,000        +5.8          11.8          11.8  -Ford                 997,000        +5.9          11.7          11.7  -Jaguar                 7,000        -9.9           0.1           0.1 Fiat group****         946,000        +6.0          11.1          11.1  -Fiat                 738,000       +10.1           8.7           8.3  -Lancia               119,000        -4.5           1.4           1.5  -Alfa Romeo            78,000       -10.5           0.9           1.1 Renault                918,000        +8.8          10.8          10.5 BMW group              543,000        +5.8           6.4           6.4  -BMW                  269,000        +2.7           3.2           3.3  -Rover                274,000        +8.9           3.2           3.1 Mercedes-Benz          288,000       +34.5           3.4           2.7 Nissan                 275,000        -4.5           3.2           3.6 Toyota                 219,000        -4.1           2.6           2.8 Volvo                  137,000       +17.5           1.6           1.5 Mazda                  127,000       -10.5           1.5           1.8 Honda                  121,000        +6.1           1.4           1.4 Mitsubishi              84,000       -17.2           1.0           1.3 Suzuki                  52,000       -24.8           0.6           0.9 Total Japanese         927,000        -7.4          10.9          12.5 MARKETS: Germany              2,219,000        -0.3          26.1          27.7 Italy                1,284,000        -2.5          15.1          16.4 France               1,297,000       +14.7          15.2          14.1 United Kingdom       1,443,000        +9.8          16.9          16.4 Spain                  620,000       +20.4           7.3           6.4  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    * VW holds 31 per cent and management control of Skoda.   ** Includes cars imported from US and sold in western Europe.  *** GM holds 50 per cent and management control of Saab Automobile. **** Fiat group includes Lancia, Alfa Romeo, Innocenti, Ferrari and      Maserati.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: ACEA (European Automobile Manufacturers Association) estimates.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

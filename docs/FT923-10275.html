			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: USX chairman predicts improved second half MR CHARLES CORRY, chair-man of USX, the US steel and energy group, said yesterday he expected both sides of the business to perform better in the second half of 1992 than in the first half, excluding the impact of special items. On Tuesday, USX announced second-quarter net income of Dollars 226m for its Marathon business and Dollars 6m for its US Steel group. The Marathon figures included a Dollars 119m tax refund. Mr Corry told a news conference that the steel side, which was hard-hit by the US recession last year, should do better in the second half, given that its operating rate during the second quarter had risen to the 'quite good' level of 90 per cent and the June order rate had been the best this year. He also said anti-dumping suits recently filed by US steelmakers against foreign rivals should help improve American steel prices which remained 'very depressed'. Next month, the International Trade Commission, a US government agency, gives preliminary findings in the anti-dumping cases. On the energy side, margins in Marathon's refining business might be 'a bit better' while upstream operations could benefit from firming natural gas prices, especially if coupled with a cold winter.</p>

			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Mexico aims to clean up street markets A FEW streets from Mexico City's oldest and most elegant colonial buildings, the market of Tepito is in full swing. Thousands of street vendors are selling everything from expensive Japanese stereos and Yves Saint Laurent clothes to yellow-faced parrots. Some vendors sell from semi-permanent stalls, belong to unions, and can make 10 times the minimum wage of 14 new pesos (Dollars 4.50) a day. Others, less fortunate, wait at traffic lights, offering to clean window screens, sell chewing gum, or perform circus acts for a few hundred pesos. From a thousand or so at the beginning of the 1980s, there are now an estimated 15,000 street vendors in the centre of Mexico City. Once home to Mexico's smartest and richest, the old colonial part of the city has become a giant street bazaar, where practically everything that can be bought in shops can be found, often at a discount of 20-50 per cent. Until recently, the vendors were tolerated, even encouraged by the government. Like most successful businessmen in Mexico, they were generous supporters of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI). The street sellers belong to informal unions, who charge their members anything from 10 to 50 new pesos a day. The unions often pass on money to the PRI or police, and arrange support at political rallies. Now, however, the vendors have come under fierce attack. The city's shop owners complain that they take away customers, steal their electricity and foul their pavements. The Finance Ministry wants to collect taxes from them. Ecologists and residents blame them for the city's worsening congestion and pollution. Last year Mexico City authorities finally responded to public pressure and agreed to build some 37 official markets with the private sector at a cost of 550m new pesos. The markets will house some 10,000 vendors from the heart of the colonial centre (not including Tepito), and the first ones are likely to be ready by the summer. Mr Roberto Albores Guillen head of the relocation programme, says he is 'nearly 100 per cent sure the vendors will be cleared from the centre' when the markets are in place. The government has worked closely with vendor leaders, and has designed the markets in the same way they are constructed in the street, with passages along which stalls are established. The markets are being built next to bus and underground stations to ensure there is a constant flow of traffic through them. The vendors will, in theory at least, have to pay taxes for the first time on goods they sell. But on the other hand they will own - if they meet monthly payments - their own stalls, and be incorporated in the formal economy, giving them access to loans, and reducing their dependence on the union leaders. The compromise solution, if it works, could become a model for the rest of Mexico. In all Mexico there are some 500,000 illegal street vendors with sales of more than Dollars 35bn a year, according to the main business chamber, Concanaco. In Mexico City, the mayor says he will couple a ban on street vendors after the markets are in place with a 'strategy of modernising rules of trade' for legal shops, and will consider eliminating unnecessary regulations. The hope is that successful street vendors would thus be enticed into the formal economy. The proposed North American Free Trade Agreement may in the long run help this, by eliminating tariffs between the US and Mexico, and thus reducing the incentive to import illegally. Behind the vendors lies an army of rich suppliers. They often smuggle goods in from the US duty free, or get them from Mexican factories that operate in the black economy. Such factories avoid income taxes, social security payments, and burdensome government regulations. These suppliers need illegal vendors to offload their contraband goods, meaning that official vendors may lose their competitive edge. Most important will be the commercial success of the new markets. Were the markets a failure, the government might not have the stomach to prevent the politically important vendors from returning to the Colonial Centre, or places nearby.</p>

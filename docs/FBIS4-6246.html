			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- A committee for the  promotion of the repatriation of old Kim Yong-tae, a long-term  prisoner who has refused to be converted, is now active in South  Korea, according to the South Korean magazine "HUMAN RIGHTS"  Nos. 1 and 2 of 1994.    Hailing from Chongju, North Phyongan Province, he  volunteered  to join in the People's Army at the age of 18 when the U.S.  imperialists unleashed the war of aggression against Korea in  1950.    He was wounded on the front and taken prisoner. He should  have been repatriated to the northern half of Korea according to  the Geneva Convention. But, he has not been sent back to the  North due to the unlawful acts of the South Korean puppet clique  and had to serve a prison term of 33 years in South Korea for  his refusal to be converted.    A committee for the promotion of the repatriation of old Kim  Yong-tae centering on a Christian organisation was formed early  in December last year.    According to the magazine, Kim Yong-tae in a recent letter  to  the president of the International Red Cross said that although  he was released from prison, he was making his living by  toilsome work for many hours at a rough-work place as a lonely  and old disabled man without his relatives, chained by the "law  on supervision for public peace." He asked for help, saying that  it was his cherished desire to meet his relatives once before he  died.</p>

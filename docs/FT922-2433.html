			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / International Company News: Kuwaitis seek a smoother ride in Spain - The search following the resignation of KIO's investment manager MADRID investment bankers, in the doldrums as a sluggish economy has taken its toll of acquisitions and stock market flotations, have been galvanised by news that the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) is looking for a new investment partner in Spain. KIO, based in London, needs help in Madrid to manage its vast Spanish holdings following the resignation earlier this month of its Spanish associate, Mr Javier de la Rosa, as deputy chairman of Grupo Torras, KIO's Spanish holding company. In keeping with the orthodox investment strategies being moulded by KIO's new post-Gulf war managers, it wants a partner, and is understood to be talking to J. P. Morgan, First Boston and, possibly, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya. A partnership with any of these institutions would be a world away from the ride KIO experienced with the mercurial Mr De la Rosa for the past eight years. KIO stumbled across him as a young banker in 1984 when he helped it buy a small paper company, Impacsa, in Catalonia. In the years that followed, KIO, with Mr De la Rosa as an independent point man, spent about Dollars 2bn buying Spain's biggest chemicals group, ERT, creating the country's largest papermaker, Torras Hostench, and buying one of its largest foods groups, Ebro Agricolas. The partnership was close. The bank he ran when they met collapsed in 1986 and, despite the resulting controversy, KIO stuck with him. KIO's nerve only failed once, in 1989 when it pulled out of a venture with two Madrid businessmen to try to take control of Banco Central. By then, though, the Kuwaitis were the biggest foreign investors in Spain. KIO-Torras-De la Rosa were merging ERT with a fertiliser company to form Ercros. They owned Prima, an aggressive property group. They bought a stockbroker and a small insurance company. In Ebro, like ERT, they shook the establishment by mounting Spain's first hostile takeovers. The holding company, Torras, went public in 1988 and then, capitalised in the markets at around Dollars 1.6bn, bought its shares back two years later as Spain's economic boom began to falter and the market, having been tapped for large rights issues, began to worry about the effect Torras' acquisitions were having on profitability. Torras felt it was being undervalued in the markets. Ercros and Ebro continued to quote in the markets but KIO and Mr De la Rosa had tight control of the Grupo Torras holding company. After the invasion of Kuwait in 1990, KIO injected some Dollars 2bn into Grupo Torras to reassure fidgety creditors. Last year, those loans were converted into equity, nearly doubling Torras capital to Pta21bn (Dollars 212m) and boosting reserves by some Pta155bn to Pta180bn. By then Mr De la Rosa had begun to say he wanted to devote more time to his own expanding financial interests, but KIO, preoccupied by the war, was in no condition to assume close control of Torras. Also, Ercros had begun to go badly wrong. A merger with the state's fertiliser producer had not stabilised domestic prices and Ercros last year lost more than Pta15bn. Grupo Torras is said to have lost Pta9bn in 1991. Prima has also gone into debt as the property market has cooled. Mr De la Rosa needed to stabilise Ercros before leaving Torras. Earlier this year he persuaded the US commodities group Freeport MacMaRon to pump new capital into a joint venture with the Ercros fertiliser and mining operations. To get support from Madrid, which had heavily subsidised part of Ercros, he persuaded Mr Jose Recio, a banker and member of the ruling socialist party, to become president. Two days after Mr Recio arrived at Ercros, Mr De la Rosa announced he was leaving Torras, although he has bought 20 per cent of the profitable Ebro group this year and intends to keep it. Whether KIO is happy with this remains to be seen, and it is not clear whether the amicable parting will remain so. But without Mr De la Rosa, even as an adviser, KIO's new management faces a tough time understanding the nature of its assets in Spain, and it needs time to decide what to do with them. Today KIO's leadership is meeting Mr Carlos Solchaga, the Spanish finance minister, to discuss its plans. But Mr De la Rosa's impetuous style has made him powerful enemies and KIO may not find that time. Last February, in a move that could have alarmed KIO, Barnett Fernandes, a London public relations company sent a note, on behalf of an unnamed client, to UK newspapers denouncing Mr De la Rosa's businesses and accusing him of plotting to topple the governor of the Bank of Spain. A shy, secretive investor, KIO shuns from publicity and may have been content to bid farewell to Mr De la Rosa, now 44. And if the Kuwaitis do find a new partner in Spain, it might be to do no more than find a way out. Although Mr De la Rosa believes KIO will stay, he would take a hard look at any of the businesses they shed. He already knows them better than anyone.</p>

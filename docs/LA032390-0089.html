			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BREAKING TRADITION;  </P> <P> RENEGADE SWALLOWS PASS UP CAPISTRANO FOR A MALIBU ESTATE CALLED HEAVEN'S GATE  </P> <P> As tradition would have it, thousands of swallows forsake the Argentine winter  each year and fly north to nest at the legendary Mission San Juan Capistrano,  founded two centuries ago by Father Junipero Serra.  </P> <P> There is a song about it. A weeklong festival. And tourists. Busloads of them.  </P> <P> But for two years now, a renegade flock of swallows -- normally sticklers for  tradition, ornithologists say -- have piloted right past San Juan Capistrano,  stretching their 6,000-mile flight to Malibu.  </P> <P> The swallow pioneers have chosen to spend their time north at Steve and Pam  Malin's $3-million French chateau perched high above the Pacific Ocean on a  pothole-marked private road outside the Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area.  </P> <P> More than 100 of them bedded down last year in bottle-shaped nests tucked  neatly beneath the home's many eaves. And this week -- Swallow Week in San Juan  Capistrano -- the birds began returning to Malibu to reclaim the weather-worn  edifices.  </P> <P> "We thought it was a one-year fluke," said Pam Malin, who says she likes the  nests because they give her home a distinctive European ambience. "Then one of  them showed up again. Then a few more. It seems strange they would pick our  house out of all the houses in Malibu."  </P> <P> Indeed. The Malins' home looks more like something out of a Grimm brothers'  fairy tale than out of a history text on California's Franciscan past.  </P> <P> It boasts large French windows, cherubs, a cobblestone driveway and a quaint  guest house atop the garage. It also has a few contemporary touches, including  a wrought-iron security fence and a pair of Rotweiler patrol dogs.  </P> <P> Its only apparent link to Mission San Juan Capistrano, 75 miles to the south,  is the estate's ethereal designation at the front entrance: Heaven's Gate.  </P> <P> "You can call this the mission of Malibu," Pam Malin said. "I could say there  is a lot of energy that develops here."  </P> <P> The arrival of the wayward flock of swallows in Malibu hasn't exactly  engendered feelings of inadequacy in San Juan Capistrano, which has its share  of million-dollar homes, plenty of other swallows and a visitor center official  who actually left Malibu for the south Orange County city.  </P> <P> "There are enough birds to go around," said Nick Magalousis, director of the  San Juan Capistrano Mission Museum, which features a special exhibit on  swallows.  </P> <P> Mission officials insist it would take much more than one nest-infested Malibu  chateau to undo a tradition first recorded by missionaries in San Juan  Capistrano in 1777.  </P> <P> "They started coming here long before Malibu," said spokeswoman Sudele Cooper.  "We have our guarantees."  </P> <P> At the mission's visitor center, Malibu-transplant Brian McInernary said the  news from his hometown isn't all that surprising. Several years ago, he said,  there were reports from Pepperdine University -- several miles down Pacific  Coast Highway from Heaven's Gate -- about swallows arriving there.  </P> <P> Over the past decade, McInernary said, the swallow population has exploded  because farmers in South America, facing international pressure, have stopped  using heavy doses of pesticides that were killing the birds. The swallows have  already invaded much of south Orange County, building nests several years ago,  for instance, in the May Co. store in Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> "Just as Father Serra was a missionary, converting those he met, so too are the  swallows," said McInernary, the center's communication director. "They are  expanding to greater areas and spreading the word of Capistrano."  </P> <P> But at least one bird expert expressed surprise at the swallows' new perch.  </P> <P> "Malibu?" queried Mayme Carver, secretary of the South Coast Audubon Society  and a proud San Juan Capistrano resident.  </P> <P> "Obviously, they found it more appealing there. More high class," she said. "We  have busloads of Japanese tourists looking for the swallows. If they only  knew."  </P> <P> But Carver warned that the birds spread more than the goodwill of Capistrano.  </P> <P> "Every spring, my husband tells me he doesn't like the swallows because the  droppings have a habit of splattering on the bedroom window," Carver said.  </P> <P> Exactly, Pam Malin said, pointing to her upstairs bedroom window.  </P> <P> "Some of our friends say that we should take a blowtorch and take the nests  off," said Steve Malin, a helicopter pilot. "But the groundskeeper takes care  of it. We like seeing life fluttering all over. When we paint the place, we are  going to paint right around their little houses."  </P> <P> Several swallow watchers said Malibu provides an ideal alternative to San Juan  Capistrano because it is relatively undeveloped and has the gnats, mosquitoes  and water bugs the birds enjoy. What Malibu will never have, though, Carver  said, is the "rich and famous" tradition of San Juan Capistrano captured in  Leon Rene's 1939 song, "When the Swallows Come Back to Capistrano."  </P></p>

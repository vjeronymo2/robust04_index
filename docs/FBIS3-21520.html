			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Igor Tsarev: `State Secrets for the Masses!'] </F>   [Text] The case of chemist Mirzayanov accused of divulging  state secrets concerning the development of chemical weapons is  taking a new turn. In particular Valeriya Novodvorskaya has  issued the following statement to the POSTFACTUM agency:  "Inasmuch as the Russian president has found the time to  express his distress over the tribulations of our hockey team at  the Olympics and even telephoned personally to Norway while  being unable to find either the time or the inclination to give  an opinion on Vil Mirzayanov's imprisonment, on 21 February I  sent two Western powers three secret studies of a strategic  nature. That is I have done something which comes under article  65 of the Russian Federation criminal code -- `espionage.'"    In addition V. Novodvorskaya said that unless Vil Mirzayanov  is released by 10 March she will hand over the formula for a  Russian binary weapon (over which all the trouble started) to a  European Community state. Let us note that the chemist V. Uglev  also intended to make this secret public.    Russian General Prosecutor Aleksey Kazannik yesterday  repealed the preventive restriction measure chosen by the course  for detaining Vil Mirzayanov. Now he must be released  immediately on the undertaking that he does not change his  address.</p>

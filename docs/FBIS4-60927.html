			<p>BFN     [Text] During the Ukrainian Former Prime Minister Leonid  Kuchma's visit to U.S. earlier this month, U.S. Administration  officials repeatedly stressed that Russia should stay Ukraine's  chief strategic partner.    Kuchma, currently leading the Ukrainian Union of  Industrialists and Businessmen, met during his one week tour of  the United States with Vice-President Albert Gore, the Commerce  Secretary's Assistant Andrew Summers, and a number of eminent  senators.    "This trip has changed my attitude to U.S. lawmakers,"  Kuchma  said.    In his words, American Administration officials regard  Ukraine as a state rather than single out any Ukrainian leader.    He said that during his meeting with the International  Monetary Fund's President Camdessus, the IMF leader made it  clear that the Foundation will not help Ukraine unless it sees a  leadership that means business rather than words there.    "If people in East and West alike see positive processes  underway, they will rally around them," said Kuchma, who is a  registered candidate to the Ukrainian presidency.    Presidential elections in Ukraine will take place on 26  June.</p>

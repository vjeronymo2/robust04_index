Among other  things, the prime minister stressed the need for deregulation to  close the commodity price gap between home and abroad.    With plans to finalize its voluntary market-opening package  in late June, the government has now set up within the ARH a  working group to promote imports, following the earlier  establishment of a working group to study deregulation in the  housing and land sectors.    At the working group's inaugural meeting held this morning,  Prime Minister Hosokawa said no one needed to study everything  that went on during the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks to  realize Japan was expected to build an open economy and society.  Promotion of this effort would lead to the correction of and  reduction in the commodity price gap between home and abroad, he  added.    A specialist from the private sector, who is also a member  of  the working group, suggested at today's meeting that to correct  the price gap Japan should ease regulations which are tighter  than in most other countries.</p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Arts: Francoise Pollet - Recital A first-class French soprano is like a rare wine. There are historically very few of them and after a period with none at all, a thirst grows for a voice that has the characteristic French quality and flavour. For some years the lack of top French female singers reached drought proportions, which has made the arrival of Francoise Pollet all the more welcome. Her operatic career began in Germany in the early 1980s. From the range of repertoire that she now has under her belt (Strauss's Marschallin, Wagner's Sieglinde and Berlioz's Dido) it is clear that she is as near as any French singer has come to being a successor to the much-loved Regine Crespin. Her soprano has amplitude, but is still feminine, not a helmet-and-spear-carrying warrior Valkyrie of a voice. To judge from her recital at the Wigmore Hall on Wednesday she has less sheer power on board than Crespin did at her last London appearances there, but Pollet naturally has youth and flexibility on her side. In Debussy's Baudelaire songs she had no trouble settling into that sensuous, hedonistic world, where 'sounds and perfumes turn in the evening air'. The heavily-scented warmth of her voice is ideally suited to this music, while Roger Vignoles managed to combine clarity and deep sensuality in the accompaniments. In her second Debussy group and some of the Wolf it was the pianist, rather than the singer, who was looking for variety. Once Pollet has relaxed, sinking into velvety, warmly rounded singing, she is reluctant to stir herself; throughout a good part of this recital the dynamic range was unvaried, the words did not tell. A pair of big songs in the second half will have roused anybody who was pleasantly slumbering: Wolf's 'Kennst du das Land' and Brahms's 'Von ewiger Liebe' were conceived on a large scale and Pollet was generous with them, unstinting in her outpouring of voice. But it was the final group of Duparc songs that showed the singer back with the repertoire that she could make her own. In the words of Baudelaire, what Pollet affords are three classic French qualities: 'luxe, calme, et volupte'.</p>

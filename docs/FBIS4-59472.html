			<p>BFN     [Text] 'Adnan 'Imran, Arab League assistant secretary  general, has expressed regret and astonishment at the recent  unjustifiable U.S. decision to include some Arab states,  especially Syria, in the list of states sponsoring terrorism.  In an exclusive statement, 'Imran said the U.S. statement has  no credibility. Reality proves the error of the information  that blemishes Syria's reputation and role. He hoped there will  be a fundamental reconsideration of U.S. Middle East policy and  that a form of balance and nonalignment will be established.</p>

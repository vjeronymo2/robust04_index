			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Jin Xiaoming (6855 1420 2494)] </F>   [Text] Chengdu, 8 Feb (XINHUA) -- Enduring the hardships of  a long journey, Zhu Rongji, Standing Committee member of the CPC  Central Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of the State  Council, and a number of leading comrades of State Council  ministries and commissions, arrived in the vast land of Sichuan  on 5 February on a inspection tour. They brought with them new  year's greetings from the CPC Central Committee and the State  Council to Sichuan's 100 million people.    During their stay in Sichuan, Comrade Zhu Rongji attended a  spring festival group greetings ceremony sponsored by Sichuan  Province and Chongqing City. He met with and extended cordial  greetings to local party, government, and military leaders as  well as retired veteran comrades and fully affirmed the  achievements made by Sichuan Province in all fields in recent  years. He said that not only did Sichuan rapidly develop its  economy last year, but it also quite satisfactorily handled the  relationship between reform and development and stability. He  urged the province to seize the opportunity to deepen reform,  open up wider, promote development, and maintain stability in  the new year to win greater victories.    During the inspection tour, Zhu Rongji and his party also  went down to factory workshops and research institutes to pay  new year's calls on workers and research personnel working on  the front line of production. They also joined plant managers  in offering "group diagnosis" to enterprises having difficulties.    On the afternoon of 6 February, Zhu Rongji and his party  arrived at the Chongqing No. 1 Cotton Mill, where he held a  "forum for difficult enterprises," which was attended by plant  directors and managers of nine difficult enterprises. Comrade  Zhu Rongji earnestly listened to the plant directors and  managers on their situations and analyzed the causes of their  problems and difficulties. He pointed out: The first thing we  must do to build a modern enterprise system is to separate  enterprises from the government. The government must not  command enterprises blindly; enterprises shall make their own  decisions regarding operations and management. Plant directors  shall take responsibility for mistakes. All this should be  institutionalized to allow supervision by the workers. Those  enterprises with liabilities greater than assets and without any  hope of stopping losses should go bankrupt on a trial basis and  then undertake reorganization to begin a new life. Zhu Rongji  also pointed out: Reform of the social insurance system is  essential to a smooth shift of the operating mechanism and the  safeguard of social stability at the same time.    Zhu Rongji encouraged directors of difficult enterprises,  saying: Difficulties are only temporary; the future is bright.  Temporary difficulties can definitely be resolved step by step.  While state policies will be instrumental to resolving  problems, enterprises must rely primarily on themselves to  regenerate through self-reliance and hard struggle, through  market research and new products development, and through  strengthened management and the change of operating mechanism.  Enterprises must direct their attention inward to improve  internal management. At present, special attention must be paid  to the workers' livelihood to ensure their basic livelihood and  the stability of society.    He Chunlin, Chen Jinhua, Wang Zhongyu, Gu Xiulian, Yu Zhen,  Li Yanling, Dai Xianglong, Li Yizhong, Pan Liansheng (3382 5571  3932), and Zhang Xianghai accompanied Zhu Rongji in his  inspection of Sichuan.</p>

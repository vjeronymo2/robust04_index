			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Fed lifts interest rates The US Federal Reserve yesterday confirmed US interest rates are on a gradual upward path when it tightened monetary policy for the second time in two months, writes Philip Gawith. The Fed did not specify the extent of the move, but it was taken for granted in the market that the announcement involves a 25 basis points increase in the federal funds rate, to 3.50 per cent. This follows a similar rise to 3.25 per cent on February 4th. The tightening had been largely discounted in the market and there was little reaction. The dollar rose just over half a pfennig to trade at DM1.6870 from DM1.68 before the announcement. It was little changed against the yen hovering at the Y106 level. Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman, said the Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had decided to increase pressure on bank reserves in order to raise interest rates. 'This action is expected to be associated with a small increase in short-term money market interest rates,' said Mr Greenspan. The announcement was made after the FOMC meeting at 19h20 GMT. Attention will now switch to the Bundesbank which is today expected to announce a further cut in its repo rate. The combination of a rise in US rates and a lowering of German rates could well give the dollar a significant upward lift. In the UK, meanwhile, the release of the February retail price index is keenly awaited. Some observers believe a good number could trigger a cut in interest rates, but this is a minority view. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, said the Fed's action 'confirms that Greenspan is still in a gradualist mode. The strong implication is that it is a 25 basis point increase in the fed funds rate, not an increase in the (more significant) discount rate.' Mr Hannah said the nature of the Fed's move also 'adds a degree of predictability about the timing of Fed interest rate moves. This could help the markets to settle down a bit.' The February 4th tightening - the first increase in US rates in five years - sent financial markets into turmoil with bond yields rising sharply in all western countries. For the second time in a row the central bank acted after an FOMC meeting, in the process also showing that it was not responding to specific economic data. The IBJ analyst described the Fed's move as 'not so much tightening as normalising on a gradualist path.' Mr Greenspan made clear in February that he felt real interest rates had fallen to abnormally low levels. The timing of the move caught the market slightly off-guard. Earlier in the day the Fed had, in its normal open market operations, added reserves with two-day system repos which suggested no change in monetary policy. This led many to believe that the Fed would not act until today. The dollar continues to be wrapped in bearish sentiment. With last night's Fed tightening already in the market, one view was that the fate of the dollar was more in the hands of the Bundesbank than the Fed. Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan (Europe), commented: 'What really matters is if the Fed can tighten in tandem with a Bundesbank move. That is the only thing that will lend significance to a 25 basis point Fed tightening.' Ahead of the Fed announcement, the D-Mark was firmer across the board in Europe. It closed at FFr3.418 from FFr3.407 on Monday against the French franc. Analysts warned that if the Bundesbank did not quicken the pace of monetary easing, the steady weakening over the past week of the franc could continue. The Bundesbank announced it was holding another variable rate repo. The lowest bid accepted last week was 5.88 per cent, a reduction of six basis points in the repo rate. Analysts are predicting a fall of up to ten basis points. Overnight rates firmed slightly, from 5.70/5.80 per cent to 5.80/5.90 ahead of the repo, but analysts doubted whether this would have any adverse effect. Ms Phyllis Reed, European bond strategist at BZW, noted that the mid-point of the overnight rate was still below the repo rate and this normally favoured a larger drop in the repo rate. 'Banks tend to be quite ambitious on the bidding,' she said. Last week the overnight rate fell to the repo rate level only at the time of the auction. Sterling finished more than a pfennig weaker against the D-Mark, closing in London at DM2.5094 from DM2.5205. Traders said the UK currency was being affected by speculation about an interest rate cut. Mr Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan, warned there was a danger of a rate cut backfiring. If it upsets the gilts market, this will put upward pressure on mortgage rates. In the discount market the Bank of England dispatched a shortage of Pounds 750m without difficulty. Sterling futures firmed slightly with the June contract a basis point up at 94.85.</p>

			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO-FAULT AUTO INSURANCE  </P> <P> Your editorial "Take Another Stab at No-Fault" (Sept. 24) may have given some  readers the impression that when Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San  Francisco) dropped no-fault from his auto insurance bill (AB 2315), this  stopped work on my no-fault bill (AB 354). While it is true the Speaker grafted  some of the basic no-fault provisions from my bill onto his bill before he  asked the Assembly to pass it, once in the Senate the no-fault amendments were  quickly removed.  </P> <P> Although my bill stalled this year, it is still very much alive. I intend to  ask for a hearing on it in the Assembly Ways and Means Committee next January.  </P> <P> AB 354 provides a basic no-frills no-fault policy at affordable rates for all  Californians and allows those with more at risk to buy the coverage they need.  The sponsors of the bill, Consumers Union, nonprofit publishers of Consumer  Reports, and the minority and low-income coalition, including Latino Issues  Forum and Public Advocates, have been joined by the more far-thinking insurance  companies, who realize that only pro-consumer no-fault has the slightest chance  of appealing to Californians.  </P> <P> The Times' continued support for good no-fault is encouraging.  </P> <P> PATRICK JOHNSTON  </P> <P> D-Stockton  </P> <P> Chairman, Assembly Finance  </P> <P> and Insurance Committee  </P></p>

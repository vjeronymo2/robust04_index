			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Try rises 43% but warns of below-cost tendering TRY GROUP, the contractor and housebuilder, yesterday warned against what it called an alarming trend of below-cost tendering in the industry. At the same time, it reported net attributable losses reduced from a restated Pounds 3m to Pounds 1.93m. However, the dividend for the year was cut from 6p to 1p, with a 0.5p final, as earnings per share tumbled from 7.4p to 3.4p. The group again included heavy provisions of Pounds 2.85m (Pounds 3.23m) below the line as it moved to get out of the commercial and industrial property sector. Under FRS 3 accounting rules, these will in future have be shown as a profit and loss item. Turnover rose from Pounds 114.3m to Pounds 117.9m and pre-tax profits by 43 per cent to Pounds 1.38m (Pounds 961,000). This was achieved in large measure through acquiring construction contracts from builders in receivership. Contracting turnover was up to Pounds 103.2m (Pounds 100.1m), while profits were flat at Pounds 2.3m. Mr Hugh Try, chairman, said there was still significant excess capacity in the contracting industry. Mr Peter Howell, managing director, described as 'extremely dangerous' moves by many companies to chase turnover by bidding for tenders on negative margins. Pre-tax profit growth came after rationalisation costs of Pounds 432,000 and a write-down on residential developments of Pounds 400,000 (Pounds 1.15m). Housebuilding turnover grew from Pounds 14m to Pounds 14.6m and losses in the sector were cut to Pounds 436,000 (Pounds 955,000). Mr Try said the company had looked forward to 1997 in assessing its provisions for the shortfall of rental income against interest. 'We honestly believe that is it,' he said.</p>

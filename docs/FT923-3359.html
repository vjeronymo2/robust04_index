			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / UK Company News: BIL expects some Gibbs family acceptances BRIERLEY INVESTMENTS Limited, the New Zealand Investment company traded on the USM, yesterday posted the offer document detailing its Pounds 11m hostile bid for Gibbs Mew, the USM-quoted brewer and property development group. Although nearly 60 per cent of the shares are owned by the Gibbs family and directors, Mr Stephen Bellamy of BIL, said he was confident that the 200p per share offer would prove tempting to some members of the family. 'We believe some of them, controlling 18 per cent of the shares, may accept our offer,' he said. He is also targeting non-family board members such as Ms Tessa Brook, who controls about 9 per cent of the shares. BIL owns 19.7 per cent of Gibbs after the group's biggest shareholder, Scottish Amicable, sold its 7.8 per cent stake in July. The offer document says Gibbs' property profits had proved transitory. The commercial property subsidiary, which contributed Pounds 1.4m in pre-tax profits between 1988 and 1990, made aggregate pre-tax losses of more than Pounds 700,000 in 1991 and 1992. The pre-tax profit amounted to Pounds 633,000 (Pounds 673,000) for the 12 months to March 28. Mr Peter Gibbs, chairman of Gibbs said: 'BIL's offer significantly undervalues Gibbs' assets and prospects. It represents an unwelcome attempt to obtain the ..company's assets on the cheap.'</p>

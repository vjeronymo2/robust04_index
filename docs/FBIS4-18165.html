			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sune Olofson report: "Missile Deal Causes Conflict"] </F>   [Text] French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has written  a frank letter to Prime Minister Carl Bildt on the sensitive  issue of the purchase of missiles for the Jas-39 Gripen  aircraft. After the failure of two major deals France is  expecting to win the missile order.    Balladur's lengthy letter is dated 2 March, and Carl Bildt  replied on 10-11 March. According to information from French  sources, Carl Bildt's more than three page reply in French was  perceived as "cool" and "gave rise to gloom" in Paris. Both  letters have been classified as secret in the Cabinet Office's  computer system.    The last day for tenders in the missile deal was 15 March.  The value of the deals totals 3 to 5 billion kronor. Three  companies are fighting for the order: France's Matra with the  Mica missile, British Aerospace with Active Skyflash, and the  United States' Hughes/Raytheon with the Amraam missile. The  Defense Materiel Administration, FMV, has begun evaluation of  the bids.    France is mourning the failed Volvo-Renault fusion and the  loss of the tank deal, which was worth 7 to 10 billion kronor.  Now the French want revenge and have clearly placed the missile  deal at the highest political level.    According to SVENSKA DAGBLADET's sources in France and  Sweden, Balladur's letter to Bildt can be taken as sarcastic in  places, but at the same time it is diplomatic and cleverly  written. However, there is a clear underlying message that now  it is France's turn.    Balladur gives Bildt an account of the missile's advantages  and of the industrial gains that can be achieved through  Swedish-French missile cooperation -- this chiefly affects Saab  Missiles in Linkoping and Ericsson Radar Electronics in Molndal.  Ericsson already has a contract with Matra regarding the radio  link between the aircraft and the missile and is negotiating  with the French to also manufacture the target seeker. If these  negotiations succeed and Saab Missiles becomes involved in the  comprehensive work of integration and in the fitting of the  robot and its electronics systems on the aircraft, this will  lead to more secure employment in the hard-pressed Swedish  missile industry.    In his reply to Balladur Carl Bildt points out that an  official purchase procedure is taking place involving the  customary bidding practices and that the Swedish Government will  reach a decision on the basis of the Air Force's needs and the  merits of the various missiles. In the formal letter Carl Bildt  leaves no room for a generous interpretation of France's  advantage.    Competition for the missile deal is tough. Some time ago the  U.S. Pentagon announced that the FMV had asked to buy 500 Amraam  missiles valued at 3.7 billion kronor. The FMV subsequently  announced that no decision has been reached and that scrutiny of  the bids will continue.    In January the head of the FMV's air force materiel  department, Major General Sven-Olof Hokborg, became defense  attache in Washington. He is said to be fighting hard for the  United States to win the order and a few weeks ago a group of  missile experts from Hughes/Raytheon paid a study visit to  Sweden.    An important question is whether the United States really is  prepared to allow the further export of Jas-39 Gripens equipped  with Amraam missiles. The U.S. Congress keeps careful check on  further exports and has in the past been particularly  restrictive. The United States has not even permitted the  testing of Amraam on foreign soil, both Britain and Germany have  been refused permission.    It is still unclear how many missiles Sweden is planning to  buy. But according to SVENSKA DAGBLADET's information, it is  likely to be quite a lot less than 800.    Neither Amraam, Mica, nor Active Skyflash is likely to be  able to resist the missile threat which is growing rapidly in  the world. Modern wars are to a large extent about air  supremacy and missiles as weapons to be used against important  central military installations and attack systems. It is  possible that the government will decide to buy a smaller number  of missiles now and then invest in the next generation.    Intensive discussions are taking place between Matra and  British Aerospace about a possible merger. Saab Missiles and  Ericsson are waiting in the wings. The four companies could  come to play an important role in the next generation of radar  attack missiles.    The choice facing the government is to continue along a  traditional transatlantic path with regard to the purchase of  military materiel from the United States, a technological  superpower, or choose a European path with the possiblity of  cooperation and mergers with Europe's defense industries.    FMV is expected to nominate the winners of the missile deal  in the course of the spring and the government will probably  reach its decision before the summer recess.</p>

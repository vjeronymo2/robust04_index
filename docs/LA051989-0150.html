			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> A WEAKNESS?;  </P> <P> IF LAKERS HAVE ONE, IT MAY BE PLAYING ONE-ON-ONE DEFENSE  </P> <P> Spontaneity seemingly has no place in Pat Riley's regimented practices, where  every action must have a purpose.  </P> <P> So, when Riley interrupted a half-court drill during the Lakers' first  pre-playoff practice late last month, it was understood that he had something  significant to say to his players. Riley spoke passionately and convincingly to  his players about their perceived defensive weakness. He cited scouting reports  obtained from obliging opponents, plus another report elicited from an  independent scout, all noting that the way to beat the Lakers is to exploit  their defensive matchups.  </P> <P> Assured that the point had been made, Riley folded his practice notes into  thirds, tucked them into the back pocket of his khakis and went back to silent  observation.  </P> <P> "That was a motivational tool," said Riley, when reminded of his short speech.  "A lot of that was for attitude. We were building a challenge in them, like,  'If that's what they think about us, then . . . ' I mean, I wanted them to know  that other people don't think they can guard them."  </P> <P> That evaluation, however, cannot be totally dismissed. There is some truth, it  seems, in the assessment that one of the Lakers' few problem areas is  individual defense -- as opposed to team defense, such as their effective  half-court trap.  </P> <P> "It has to be a little realistic, because that's what other teams are saying,"  said Michael Cooper, the Lakers' defensive specialist. "We had lapses, sure.  But it was a different intensity in the regular season."  </P> <P> So far in the playoffs, however, the Lakers have proved those appraisals either  inaccurate or obsolete. In sweeping the first two rounds, against Portland and  Seattle, the Lakers have given up nearly six fewer points a game than during  the regular season.  </P> <P> But the Lakers, who credit their defensive resurgence to greater intensity and  concerted effort, will face their biggest challenge yet starting Saturday, when  they play the Phoenix Suns in Game 1 of the Western Conference finals.  </P> <P> The Suns, led by quick point guard Kevin Johnson and high-scoring forward Tom  Chambers, averaged 116.8 points against the Lakers during the regular season,  when the teams split six games. And, so far in the playoffs, the Suns are  averaging 122.8 points a game, more than any other playoff team.  </P> <P> Though respectful of Phoenix's offensive capabilities, the Lakers say they are  confident they can harness the Suns' powerful running game. If so, the Lakers  will have to once again prove wrong the scouts who said they have trouble  stopping open-court and isolation moves the Suns often use.  </P> <P> "Those other teams that sent us reports, they always said the same thing,"  Riley said. "It was, 'Take it at them, beat them off the dribble. There's an  opinion around that we don't have good individual defenders.  </P> <P> "But, in this league, against the many offensive talents, there aren't many  good individual (defensive) players. Everybody gets beat off the dribble  sometimes. But you got to keep that to a minimum.  </P> <P> "(The scouts) got to look at something and ask, 'What can we attack?' Look at  our starting lineup. Magic (Johnson) is a 6-9 guard and even though he is an  excellent team defender -- probably the best team defender in the NBA -- he  cannot really contain point guards. There's a physiological difference.  </P> <P> "Byron (Scott) can guard and can contain point guards. James (Worthy) and A. C.  (Green) are thought of as guys that aren't good defending out on the floor  (away from the basket). And, then, Kareem (Abdul-Jabbar) . . .  </P> <P> "Teams think they can break us down. So, we see a lot of isolation and putting  the ball on the floor."  </P> <P> The Lakers already have faced such tactics against the Trail Blazers and the  SuperSonics in their first two series and were hardly threatened. Through seven  playoff games, opponents have made only 44% of their shots against the Lakers.  </P> <P> The combination of tough individual and team defense, in the form of switches  and traps, enabled the Lakers to hold Dale Ellis and Xavier McDaniel, Seattle's  scoring threats, to 42% and 43% shooting, respectively. And, in the first  round, Portland's Clyde Drexler made 49% of his shots.  </P> <P> "I'm pleased," Riley said. "We're doing a better job individually, cutting the  (uncontested drives to the basket) down to a minimum. Once they apply  themselves, our guys are capable of guarding people."  </P> <P> The Suns, however, present matchup problems because they often play without a  center. They also favor a fast-break offense -- "You can't really call it a  passing game," Riley said -- and spread the court for Kevin Johnson in  half-court situations.  </P> <P> Johnson is the Western Conference's version of Detroit's Isiah Thomas, but he  may even be quicker and more of a scoring threat. In six games against the  Lakers this season, he averaged 22.5 points and 16 assists.  </P> <P> Probably drawing the assignment against Johnson will be Scott, with  considerable relief by Cooper. Both talked as if it would be their toughest  assignment in the playoffs, even if they end up playing Thomas and the Pistons  again in the finals.  </P> <P> "The fact that he can shoot and drive presents a problem," Scott said. "You  can't play him just one way. You can't say, 'I'll play him back and make him  shoot the jumper,' because that's what he likes to do. You've got to get up on  him and play him as tough as possible."  </P> <P> And risk having Johnson simply drive around him for a layup or easy assist.  </P> <P> "You can't be scared of his quickness, because he might beat you anyway," Scott  added. "Myself and Coop are more aware now what he likes to do and what he does  best. We can't relax at all when we're on him. When you relax or straighten up,  just for a second, he's gone."  </P> <P> Even stopping Johnson, were that possible, would not ensure stopping the Suns.  Chambers averaged 20.5 points against the Lakers and the Suns' other Johnson,  sixth-man Eddie, averaged 22.4.  </P> <P> "We've got to stop two of their three threats," Cooper said. "That's the same  line of attack (the Lakers used) against Seattle, where we had to stop two of  the three -- McDaniel, Ellis or (Derrick) McKey -- in order to win.  </P> <P> "There's no way we can beat these guys with two of them getting 30 and holding  one down, and then having guys like (Dan) Majerle and (Tyron) Corbin come in  and hurt us."  </P> <P> If the Lakers manage to contain Johnson and the rest of the Suns, and advance  to the championship series for the third straight season, maybe those scouting  reports will have to be amended.  </P> <P> Not that Laker players believed them much anyway.  </P> <P> "They were just looking at us in the regular season," Scott said of the scouts.  "That's not the same. We've shown already that we're playing different.  Everybody here plays stronger and more intense in the playoffs. But you'd have  to say, definitely, this will be our toughest (defensive) test."  </P> <P> Cooper said he has heard the criticism of the Laker defense before. "People  have always said that about this club, that we're weak," he said. "Yet, we  somehow always manage to pull it off. I don't think there's a weak link on any  individual on this club. It's just a matter of asserting ourselves."  </P> <P> Riley said that he, too, believes in the Lakers' defensive capabilities, that  he just felt compelled to make his players aware of what others are saying.  </P> <P> "I wanted (the scouts) to be very critical, as well as telling us our good  parts," Riley said. "There are a number of parts of our game that can be looked  at critically."  </P> <P> No doubt, Laker players will eventually hear about them.  </P> <P> Laker Notes  </P> <P> Guard Byron Scott aggravated his bruised right wrist Thursday in practice while  trying to dunk over teammate Orlando Woolridge. Scott had the wrist taped by  trainer Gary Vitti and continued practicing. . . . For the first time in eight  seasons, Laker guard Michael Cooper was not voted onto either the all-defensive  first or second team by NBA coaches. However, Laker power forward A.C. Green  made the second team.  </P> <P> Said Cooper: "There were a lot of good defensive players this year. It just  gives me more incentive to play hard the rest of this season and next year.  I've built a reputation on (defense). Not making it this year isn't going to  make me or break me. But I've marked my consistency by it."  </P></p>

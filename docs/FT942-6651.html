			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Survey of Residential Property (11): A master plan to halt the cowboy builders - Portugal / At the sign of the golf club you know you are in the Algarve Almost apart from the rest of the country the much-visited Algarve has a life of its own, writes Audrey Powell. Today's 'real' Algarve is the golf course development. A figure swinging a golf club must now typify the province in the way that a pavement orange seller may have done in another era. Further expansion of most of the main projects has been mothballed until the leisure market revives, but construction continues on the Alto Golf and Alto Club development, near Portimao in western Algarve, financed and managed by the British construction company Mowlem. This two-part development, an hour's drive from Faro airport, has an 18-hole golf course designed by golfer Henry Cotton, who lived in the province for 25 years. On one hole, the 660-yard 16th, if you make a birdie, you get a certificate and have your name engraved on a roll of honour in the clubhouse. Alto Club, about a mile from Alto Golf, is set in gardens on the site of an old farm. The farmhouse has been restored, with its well and ancient wheel. This resort has views over the fishing village of Alvor and the bay of Lagos. It has swimming pools, a floodlit tennis court and a restaurant. A short walk takes you down to one of the Algarve's vast beaches. Both Altos offer quite spacious villas and flats with a high ratio of bathrooms to bedrooms, and many broad terraces. The villas are of varied design, with two to four bedrooms; they cost from Pounds 175,000 to more than Pounds 300,000, depending on type and plot size. Flats cost Pounds 115,000 in Alto Golf and Pounds 107,000 to Pounds 110,000 in Alto Club. There is also an arrangement by which four people can buy together, each owning a share in a freehold flat. This costs from Pounds 26,000. A word of warning. One of the attractions of the Algarve is that you can play golf throughout the year, with warm, sunny days even during the winter. What you are less likely to be told is that the Algarve also has some extremely cold days, which can be chillier than the UK at the same time of year. If you plan to spend a lot of off-season time there, make sure you have an adequate central heating system in your property. Three Alto resorts are planned. The third, Alto Beach, has yet to be built, and remains an 18-acre clifftop site, close to the existing Altos. Eventually, Alto Beach will have 70 apartments, a restaurant, tennis court, swimming pool and a mini-golf course. If residents of the three Altos want a change of scene, they can drive to the Algarve's westernmost point, Cape St Vincent, a wilder version of England's Land's End, and watch the Atlantic swirling below the cliffs. They may soon feel inclined to return to the more tranquil challenge of the 16th hole. For further information, tel: (UK) 0737-222022.</p>

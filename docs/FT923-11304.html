			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Warsaw retraces Q2 losses POLISH equities have retraced most of the losses incurred in the second quarter and some analysts believe that the outlook for Europe's fledgling stock exchange has improved. After a generally stable first quarter, the Warsaw WIG indicator dropped around 25 per cent from April to June on selling by individuals, disillusioned by a decision by Wedel, the food company controlled by Pepsico, to omit the 1991 dividend. Political uncertainty, high interest rates and a big flotation of Treasury bonds at the start of June also weighed on the index. Mr Wieslaw Rozlucki, the president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, told fund managers in London yesterday that the recovery in the index since the end of June had been triggered by the formation of a new government and the National Bank of Poland's decision to reduce interest rates. The appointment this week of Citibank as a custodian of the stock exchange's central depository system has solved a fiduciary problem for international institutions and should lead to more foreign participation in a domestically-driven market, Mr Rozlucki said. Another positive factor is the expected launch next week of the Boston-based Pioneer Group's open-ended mutual fund in Polish securities which aims to attract Dollars 50m in its first year. Mr Reginald Duquesnoy of Cresvale Securities, the hosts of the seminar, believes that the Polish stock market capitalisation will grow from Dollars 148m to at least Dollars 500m in the next year. The market's average price/earnings ratio has fallen to 2.3 from around 3 late last year.</p>

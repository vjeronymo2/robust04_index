			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> K N Interstate states that it is faced with capacity constraints on its pipeline system downstream of Casper. K N Interstate further states that based on the results of an open season, shippers have indicated an interest in additional capacity, in the amount of 83,500 Mcf per day. K N Interstate maintains that, in addition, the development of new gas supplies from sources west of Casper support the need for additional pipeline capacity out of the area. K N Interstate submits that it can solve the capacity constraint downstream of Casper and move incremental volumes of gas as they are developed by selecting a pipe sized larger than that which would be necessary to move only the unprocessed gas stream east of Casper and adding a new compressor unit at an existing compressor station. K N Interstate maintains that such a configuration will result in increased system reliability, flexibility and redundancy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> K N Interstate states that the proposed facilities will enable K N Interstate to close its Casper Processing Plant and move the gas currently being processed at Casper to the Douglas Processing Plant. In addition, K N Interstate states that the proposed facilities will enable K N Interstate to transport incremental volumes of up to 47,500 Mcf per day from the west end of its transmission pipeline system. K N Interstate further states that it will charge the firm transportation rates that result from its current rate proceeding for transportation of gas through the proposed facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> December 28, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Standard Paragraphs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> F.

If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

Russian space officials are  optimistic that the cryogenic rocket deal with India will be  carried through despite Moscow's refusal to supply related  technology as envisaged by the original contract.    The head of the Russian space agency, Glavkosmos, Mr. Yuri  Koptev, told a local news agency that India would receive two  extra cryogenic boosters as compensation for technical aid that  Russia was forced to cancel. Russia will also supply equipment  for the testing and exploitation of cryo-engines.    The 1991 contract provided for the delivery of two cryogenic  rocket boosters along with the knowhow for their manufacture in  India. However, last year Moscow bowed to U.S. pressure not to  transfer the cryogenic technology because it allegedly violated  the Missile Technology Control Regime designed to prevent the  spread of military rocket technology to developing nations.    Mr. Koptev said the delivery of extra boosters would keep  the  initial value of the contract "virtually intact" at about 228  million U.S. dollars. India has already paid Russia about 60 per  cent of the cost.    Not yet finalised: The cryogenic contract was  renegotiated during a visit to India last month by a Russian  space delegation led by the head of the Glavkosmos, Mr.  Alexander Dunayev. However, diplomatic sources in Moscow said  the new terms of the contract were yet to be approved by both  sides.    Meanwhile, a Russian daily has reported that an additional  agreement has been reached by Moscow and Delhi for the supply to  India of three more cryogenic boosters at a cost of $3 millions  each.    The Rossiiskiye Vesti daily, published by the  Russian government, said the new contract would enable India to  pursue its space exploration programme, although it would have  to adjust it to the changed terms of the 1991 contract.  According to the paper, additional boosters will be supplied in  1996, after the fulfilment of the main contract.</p>

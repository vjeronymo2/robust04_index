			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Arts: Othello - Everyman, Liverpool The Everyman, Liverpool has taken a bold course with Shakespeare's Othello. It has been pared down to the basics, the text cut to just under two and a half hours on stage. The result is a fine, swift, muscular production which brings out the play's essentials at surprisingly little discount to the full (three and half hour) version. The set and design are apt for this incisive performance: just bare boards, white curtains, and a few effects to feed the orderliness of Iago's mind and the bedlam of Othello's. Warm pools of light in the blue gloom, and a wonderful improvised storm are the extent of the technical additions. The setting is the Italo-Turkish war of 1911-12, the costumes militaire, and the ethos martial. The danger with cutting Othello, a play which Dr Johnson thought 'a drama of the most exact and scrupulous regularity', is that Othello's credulousness scarcely has time to meet Iago's guile before the conclusion. At times here the action skims the surface of Shakespeare's text, uprooting the characters from their own language: so Othello's 'The pity of it' or Iago's 'put money in thy purse' are discoveries rather than reminders. However, at the price of removing the suspense, John Doyle's stern direction follows a single path of energy into the play; the Iago-Othello relationship. The whole action turns on the words, 'Ha, I like not that' as Iago casually traps Othello (he speaks of Cassio's leaving Desdemona). All the elements of the play fuse around that moment, and it is brilliantly delivered and pursued. Ray Fearon's Othello is welter-weight rather than heavyweight, ardent in affection and obdurate in revenge, but never calamitously in love with Desdemona. Opposite him, Gillian Kearney plays a sweet, biddable Desdemona. Between them, Tony Turner as Iago conjures a pasty-faced and gimlet-eyed malice which takes him to the final scene as a believable villain. His interchanges with Fearon and his frank soliloquies fuel the production's energies; his treatment of Emilia (well played by Joanne Stoner), her virtue loosely worn but not yet cast aside, is all cruelty. As Trevor Nunn's rigorous 1990 RSC production showed, Shakespeare offers few compensations in Othello. The intellectual satisfactions of the two equally exhausting plays he wrote before and after (Troilus &amp; Cressida and Timon of Athens) redeem the violence of their worlds. In Othello however, Iago removes all palliatives, and this Everyman production leaves one thinking, of Othello's jealousy, 'All this the world well knows, yet none knows well to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.</p>

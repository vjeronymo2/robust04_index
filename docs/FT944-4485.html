			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Lenders delay response to base rate rise Banks and building societies kept their heads down yesterday as they postponed a response to the half percentage point increase in base rates. Although none increased its mortgage or savings rates, most believed rates would have to rise. Halifax building society, the biggest mortgage lender, said: 'The base rate rise will inevitably put upward pressure on both savers' and borrowers' rates and they are likely to rise in due course.' The society was 'very disappointed' at the base rate rise because it would damage the fragile housing market recovery. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society said the base rate rise was disappointing for homeowners, especially after moves to restrict mortgage income support in last week's Budget. It added: 'It must create pressure for a mortgage rate increase at some time.' Bradford and Bingley agreed that it was likely mortgage rates would have to go up. Mr John Wriglesworth, strategy and marketing manager, said the rate rise made it more important that the government did not deal another blow to the housing market by cutting mortgage interest relief to make up for defeat on VAT. Mr Rob Thomas, housing market analyst at UBS, said lenders were being held back by the likelihood of another base rate rise. He said: 'If they thought it would be within the next three months, they would wait and move then. But if they thought it would not be for, say, another six months, they may decide to put up rates within a month.' Abbey National, the second biggest mortgage lender, said it hoped to maintain its mortgage rates until early next year. Similarly Nationwide, the second biggest building society, said that as the housing market remained subdued it saw no immediate need to raise the cost of home loans. Mr Peter Robinson, managing director of Woolwich, pointed to its concern about savings rates. He said: 'There is no need to raise mortgage rates at present as the market is seasonally inactive and customer sentiment would not be helped by such a move'.</p>

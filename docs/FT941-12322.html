			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Leading Article: China and the Gatt Napoleon once advised the world to let the Chinese giant sleep since 'when he wakes he will move the world'. By now it is too late. The question for the world is how to respond to the quake. On balance, the best choice is to facilitate rapid market-oriented development of the Chinese economy. One implication is that China should be accepted into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, on strict economic conditions. There is no denying, however, that China presents problems. The country has three inhabitants for every two in western Europe, North America and Japan combined. Its economic growth ran at over nine per cent a year between 1980 and 1991 and could continue at such a rate for decades. It also brings together a powerful comparative advantage in labour intensive manufactures and easy access to capital and skills. On the minus side, its economy continues to be distorted by the legacy of planning and controls. Last but not least, China is a corrupt despotism. The notion of China as an economic colossus under anything like the present regime is bound to cause concern. But rapid export-oriented industrialisation is likely to create strong pressures for political change in China, as it has in other east Asian countries. This is why the west should focus its attention on sustaining market-oriented reforms. China's application to join (or, as it would argue, rejoin) the Gatt presents an opportunity for achieving just that. Urgency The Gatt's working party on China's membership was established in 1988. But the Tiananmen Square massacre and the Uruguay round put these discussions largely on hold. Now a degree of urgency has been injected into the negotiations, partly because this is an important piece of unfinished business and partly because China is ensured of becoming a founding member of the prospective world trade organisation only if the negotiations on Gatt accession are completed this year. Otherwise, there would have to be new negotiations over China's accession to the WTO. China, would like Gatt entry on standard conditions, consisting of tariff concessions alone. Other Gatt contracting parties want special provisions, including a selective safeguards clause, a special procedure for review of the reforms and greater transparency in the policy regime. Meanwhile, the US is making the grant of most favoured nation treatment, itself the most fundamental Gatt principle, hostage to improvements in human rights. Technically, it would be possible to combine Gatt membership with such bilateral conditions. But they would render membership largely meaningless, since the US would not be in a secure contractual relationship with China. Economic dialogue There are good reasons, however, for the US to modify its approach. Withdrawal of MFN treatment would be economically damaging to the US itself. It would also harm the economic dialogue begun by President Clinton at the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) forum in Seattle last November. Bilateral pressures designed to corner Beijing and force concessions have been shown not to be the most effective way to secure political change in China. Gatt, by contrast, offers a less tense but still powerful multilateral framework for improving China's economic policies in a more market-oriented direction. China's membership of the Gatt should therefore be accepted, but subject to a safeguards regime that could be modulated to the state of economic reform. This would bring China into what is expected to become one of the most important bodies in the global economy, as befits the country's size and potential. Some will argue that China cannot be a Gatt member in good standing, because it would be politically impossible to offer equal treatment to imports from so large a non-market economy. That is an argument not against accession, but in favour of conditional accession. The west cannot ignore gross violations of human rights in its relations with China, or any other country. But its trade relations should focus on the policies that affect trade. If trade and economic issues move in the right direction, the politics will follow.</p>

			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DESIGN SOLUTIONS: WHEN SHOULD DESIGNER JOIN HOME PLANNING?  </P> <P> QUESTION: We are going to build a new home and have begun working with an  architect on plans. At what point should we begin to consult with an interior  designer?  </P> <P> ANSWER: A designer should be called in at the same time as the architect. They  should work closely together to achieve a well-functioning home for your  lifestyle, and one that is aesthetically pleasing to you. This will be the best  money you can spend and can save you thousands in costly mistakes and possible  redos later.  </P> <P> The qualified designer will be concerned with the actual function of the space  for your lifestyle. The practical placement of furniture and the wall space  required for that furniture. The designer helps see, enhance and translate your  priorities.  </P> <P> The designer understands traffic patterns, spatial relationships, scale and  proportion, and color and texture, and what will be best suited to the period  and style of your residence.  </P> <P> DEBORAH LOCKE-KAHN  </P> <P> Chairman of the Board, San Diego chapter, ISID  </P> <P> </P> <P> Strong Combinations When Painting House  </P> <P> Q: We are planning to paint the exterior of our home and do not want it to be  bland or ordinary. On the other hand, we won't want it to stick out like a sore  thumb. Can you suggest some combinations of colors to achieve a distinct  appearance?  </P> <P> A: Most people play it too safe when painting the exterior or their homes. A  rich new color is an easy way to add distinction to a nondescript house.  </P> <P> I've tried certain strong combinations that work wonderfully well on houses.  I've found that painting the bulk of a building a strong/dark color and  trimming out the woodwork, the overhang, window frames, shutters and roof trim  in a very light color, with a darker accent color for the window sashes and  doors.  </P> <P> Do not paint natural, unpainted materials on the exterior of the house, such as  weathered brick, wood shingles or stone unless they look ugly.  </P> <P> SANDRA HAYES, ASID  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mixing 'Clubby' With Southwest Interiors  </P> <P> Q: I like the Southwest style, but my husband prefers a "clubby look." You can  imagine how difficult it is for us to agree when buying furniture. What  combination can you suggest?  </P> <P> A: First of all, we need to determine what the "clubby look" is. Perhaps old  English, dark paneling, overstuffed furniture? This could be blended with  Southwest only if both sides will concede to some compromise.  </P> <P> Take the usual dark paneling and lighten to a natural or whitewash finish. If  paint is the only wall element, a faux leather finish may be used. Add wood or  slate floors and major upholstery pieces, such as big overstuffed sofas and  chairs. Choose Indian blankets or poncho-style fabrics in darker, traditional  colors. In accessories, again, the key is compromise. Some from each style can  make you both happy. Don't forget, scale and color are important elements to  consider when mixing styles.  </P> <P> RAE WHEELER, ISID  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P> <P> EXTERIOR COLOR COMBINATIONS  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.55IN:2.44IN:2.99IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> House  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Trim  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Sashes/Door  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> camel beige  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> white  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> navy  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> gray  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> white  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> navy or burgundy  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> blue-gray  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> white  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> black  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> forest green  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> cream white  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> burgundy  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> dusty rose  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> cream white  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> burgundy or rust  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> rust  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> cream white  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> chocolate brown  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE></p>

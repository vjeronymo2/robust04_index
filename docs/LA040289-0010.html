			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: QUIBBLES &amp; BITS  </P> <P> . . . The animated "The Rescuers Down Under" -- about the Aussie adventures of  those valiant mice, Miss Bianca, Bernard and their "mouse rescue squad" -- is  in production at Disney. Due out next year, it's the sequel to the "Rescuers"  (1977). This time, the mice will rescue a little Aboriginal boy from the  clutches of a mean poacher, assisted by a kangaroo mouse named Jake -- who, we  are told, is in the Mick Dundee mold.  </P></p>

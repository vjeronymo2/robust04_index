			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oceans set to yield up their treasures - Canute James reports on the agreement of an international code of conduct for seabed mining after 11 years of negotiations After 11 years of tortuous and often contentious negotiations, agreement has been reached on a code of conduct for mining the international seabed. The agreement, which hinged on convincing industrialised countries that commercial principles would be observed, is to be be adopted by the United Nations general assembly this month. It will allow the establishment of the International Seabed Authority, a new UN agency, which will administer the Law of the Sea Convention, and will create the Enterprise, the authority's commercial arm, which will oversee exploration and mining through joint ventures among private companies and states. The agreement will also create a tribunal that will adjudicate disputes over seabed mining among states and companies. The authority and the Enterprise will be located in Jamaica, while the tribunal will be in Hamburg, Germany. At the centre of the debates in the UN Law of the Sea Conference, which sought general acceptance of the convention are the trillions of dollars worth of polymetallic nodules that are lying on the international seabed, outside the 200-mile economic zone of any country. The nodules contain copper, nickel, manganese and cobalt, and varying quantities of other minerals. 'The intention was to find an orderly method of dealing with minerals located on the international seabed,' says Mr Kenneth Rattray, rapporteur general of the Law of the Sea Conference. 'Since these minerals are outside the economic zones of states, it was important to have an acceptance by all countries that the minerals did not belong to any one state or private company, but were the common heritage of all mankind. 'This is an attempt to avert anarchy in mining the international seabed and to permit orderly exploration and exploitation within a regulatory framework.' While developing countries have always been in favour of a convention to regulate the mining of the international seabed, the discussions were protracted because of reservations that industrialised states had about the commercial feasibility of the proposals, and about the sharing of costs and benefits. In its original form the Law of the Sea Convention was not clear on the role private business would play in seabed mining, and on how the technology would be obtained. Fundamental changes in the world economy, the move by governments away from central planning to market-based economies and the growing role for private business, all precluded the creation of an economic agency in which only governments would be involved. Under the draft of the convention, the Enterprise was to have been funded by the member states based on subscriptions and loans, with the first mining venture estimated to cost about USDollars 1bn. 'Philosophical and economic arguments indicated that this was not the most desired method, so it was agreed that the first operation of the enterprise will be done as a joint venture with the partners providing the investment, on the now accepted basis that the international seabed is the common heritage of mankind,' explains Mr Rattray. 'The enterprise is the only way for poorer countries to participate. Some developed states wanted the Enterprise to be abolished, but it was agreed that after its first venture the Enterprise will begin operating on a purely commercial basis.' There were also concerns among the industrialised states about the transfer of technology. Since private business, and not governments, own the technology, members of the UN were unable to get access to it. In the accord, it has been accepted that if the technology is not available on the market at commercially fair terms, governments would co-operate with the International Seabed Authority to make it available. 'This is intended to give the Enterprise a jump start,' says Mr Rattray. One of the more fundamental concerns about seabed mining, and in which both developed and developing countries had common concerns, was the effect the extraction of the polymetalic nodules and production of the minerals would have on land-based producers. While most states eschewed production ceilings, saying this method was an echo of central planning, land-based producers argued that there could be unfair economic practices in seabed mining, which could lead to a flooding of markets and depressed prices. There will be no production limits, but the principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on unfair competition have been adopted in the Law of the Sea Convention. Production plans will include an estimate of the maximum quantity of minerals to be produced each year and there will be a compensation fund for land-based producers who are adversely affected by seabed mining. 'The original expectation when the conference began 11 years ago was that seabed mining would have started by 1998,' says Mr Rattray. 'This was not achieved because of real and philosophical changes in the world economy. With this agreement, commercial production from the seabed is now expected to begin in another 10 years.'</p>

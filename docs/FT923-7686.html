			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions ON THE first anniversary of its debut on the UK stock market, directors of Eurocamp have been taking profits. All five of the executive directors each sold 50,000 shares at 315p. Shares in the tent and the mobile home rental group have outperformed the market by almost 40 per cent since they were floated last year. Interim results announced last month covered the period to the end of April and, as such, give little away because of the strong seasonal nature of the business. Southern Business Group is another stock to have outperformed the market by 40 per cent over the past year. Paul Roberjot has sold 150,000 shares at 94p in order to meet a personal tax liability. He bought 100,000 shares in April last year at 102p. BPB Industries has featured frequently in this column. Alan Brooks, the joint managing director, has bought 22,000 shares at 159p. A week earlier, his colleague Jean-Pierre Cuny had purchased 10,000 at 137.5p. Together with Alan Turner, the chairman and chief executive, these three have been actively building up their personal holdings since November last year. Malcolm Dagul, chairman of Southend Property Holdings, has been accumulating shares steadily since the company's final results were announced on 22 July 1992. In total he and his colleague John Main have acquired 271,000 shares at prices ranging from 40.5p to 43p. The net asset value per share was revealed to be 116p at the year end.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                               No of Company                     Sector     Shares    Value    directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Caledonia                     OthF     94,065      334            2 EMAP                           Med     11,705       30            1 Eurocamp                       H&amp;L    250,000      787            5 Le Creuset                    Misc     30,000       81            1 NFC                           Tran     41,000      100            1 Owen &amp; Robinson CCRP          Stor  1,222,943      150            1 Perpetual                     OthF     15,000       21            1 J Sainsbury                   FdRe      8,459       39            1 Southern Bus Grp              Misc    150,000      141            1 Sterling Publ                  Med     86,178       47            1 Warner Estates                Prop     37,500       54            1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Allied Lyons                  Brew      3,500       21            1 Asprey                        Stor     30,000       57            3 BPB Industries                BdMa     32,000       49            2 Jarvis Porter                 Pack     35,430       49            1 Leigh Interests               Chem     21,300       49            3 OMI International             OthI    150,000       18            3 Owen &amp; Robinson CCRP          Stor  1,222,943      150            1 Royal Bank of Scotl           Bank    325,000      495            1 Shanks &amp; McEwan               Misc     25,000       43            2 Southend Prop Hldgs           Prop    271,000      113            2 Thames TV                     Med      21,310       33            2 Unit Group                    Pack     25,000       10            1 Waddington J                  Pack      6,000       10            1 Wellcome                      Hlth     12,000       96            3 Wheway                        EngG    100,000       14            1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Kembrey Kembrey, a maker of electrical connectors and accessories, returned to profit in the second half of 1992-93, overcoming the first half loss, and Mr David Burnet, chairman, said he expected a further recovery in the current year. Pre-tax profit for the 53 weeks to April 3 emerged at Pounds 11,000 - better than the directors expected at halfway when a loss of Pounds 114,000 was reported. The previous year's deficit was Pounds 347,000. Mr Burnet said that no clear trend had emerged for the current year, but he hoped that profits would improve and borrowings decline further. He said that the weight of any improvement would probably be heavily biased towards the second half. Turnover was lower at Pounds 22m (Pounds 27.4m). Extraordinary costs in the year fell from Pounds 741,000 to Pounds 441,000 and related to losses on the disposal of non-core businesses Despro and Dalforsan. Redundancies throughout the group cost Pounds 189,000. Net borrowings have come down by Pounds 1.27m to Pounds 4.3m. After the extraordinary items and the cost of the proposed dividend of 0.155p (0.15p), there was a deficiency on the profits and loss account of Pounds 472,000 (Pounds 1.14m) which was met from reserves. Earnings per share were 0.04p (1.24p losses).</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: FIFA hands out longest suspension A Romanian player was suspended for three games yesterday for what FIFA called a 'brutal' foul, the latest move by the governing body against rough play. FIFA imposed the penalty on Ion Vladoiu, who was sent off minutes after entering Wednesday's game against Switzerland as a substitute in the closing minutes. It was the third red card of the tournament but by far the stiffest penalty. In addition to the suspension, which begins with Sunday's game against the USA, FIFA's disciplinary committee levied a 7,500 Swiss franc (Dollars 5,555) fine on the Romanian federation.</p>

			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> DRIVE TO SUCCEED LEFT HIM FLAT  </P> <P> Country music singer Ricky Van Shelton says he was so driven to succeed that he  didn't have enough fun -- even when success finally arrived.  </P> <P> His debut album in 1987 vaulted him to big-time attraction, but years of  business pressures made the struggle to the top tough, he said.  </P> <P> "That's what made me not have a good time with it," Shelton said recently. "I'm  beginning to really have fun with it now."  </P> <P> Shelton, 38, is a finalist in three categories of Country Music Assn. Awards  announced last week and is the reigning CMA Male Vocalist of the Year.  </P> <P> His No. 1 hits include "Somebody Lied" and "From a Jack to a King."  </P></p>

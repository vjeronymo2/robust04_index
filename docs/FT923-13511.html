			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Letter (2): Proposals for protected trade are confused and misleading Sir, His being a professor of political science at MIT does not ensure that Prof Dore has a firm grasp of basic economics. He concluded his article by asserting that the case for free trade requires the '. . .assumptions of competitive markets and undistorted prices'. Every discussion of free trade, from David Ricardo to Paul Samuelson (to note only the most famous) has shown that mutually beneficial trade requires only differences in prices. Why the prices differ, and how these prices were determined is, so far as the trade discussion goes, immaterial. Further, Prof Dore's assertion that the benefits in the form of lower prices which accrue to the consumer from free trade would be 'mopped up in unemployment pay' rests of course on the assumption that when workers have became unemployed in one activity - any activity - they are totally unemployable for ever more. That is not likely. Prof Dore's arguments are as misleading as his recommendations would be damaging.

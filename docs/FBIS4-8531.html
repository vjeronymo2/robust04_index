			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Vjekoslav Radovic] </F>   [Text] New York, April 12 (TANJUG) -- Under NATO's  "umbrella" and with the United Nations' "moral" blessing, the  United States again dropped bombs on Serbs on April 10 and 11,  raiding Bosnian Serb positions near Gorazde in the southeast of  the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The Americans did it for the first time in World War II,  precisely on Orthodox Easter in April 1944, when they bombed  towns of their Serbian allies, including Belgrade, in order to  allegedly destroy facilities of the German army.    This time they did it while Croats in the U.S. were  "democratically" celebrating in their clubs and churches  throughout the U.S. April 10 -- the day when the Nazi puppet  independent state of Croatia was created under Hitler's  patronage in World War II.    If one adds to this the fact that the world has recognized  Bosnia-Herzegovina as an independent state on April 6, 1991, at  the 50th anniversary of the German bombing of Belgrade, it is  hard to resist the impression that someone has deliberately been  playing with historical dates.    It is impossible at this point to foresee the consequences  of  the NATO (i.e. U.S.) raid on Serb positions in Bosnia but this  heinous act should be a signal for the Serbs to sober up and  give up their illusions about "the country of brave and free,"  as the Americans like to think of themselves.    What they did near Gorazde is a cowardly act of  power-wielders manipulated by the flickering images on the TV  screen who have lost the ability to form judgement under the  loads of money offered by Moslem, Croatian, Jewish and who knows  whose else lobbies.    Giving the "green light" for air strikes on Bosnian Serbs,  the U.N. and its secretary-general Butrus Butrus-Ghali waded  even deeper into the moral swamp from which they can hardly be  expected to walk out clean.    Butrus-Ghali's spokesman Joe Sills said on Monday that the  real objective of the air attack had been to protect the Moslem  enclave of Gorazde while protection of U.N. monitors had been  only "a moral framework" for the action. In other words, it was  a false excuse.    Even Butru-Ghali himself clearly indicated in a report to  the  U.N. Security Council that Moslems had used the U.N.-declared  "safe havens" for training and resting of their troops and for  armed provocations against Serb positions.    The U.N. Secretary-General's Adviser Chinemaya Garrehan and  current Chairman of the U.N. Security Council Colin Keating last  week also confirmed that the fighting around Gorazde had been  initiated by Moslem forces.    All these facts, however, were completely forgotten under  the  pressure of U.S. and NATO hawks, who were eager to drop bombs on  Serbs and thus force them to bow to unacceptable conditions for  peace.    All things considered, the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR)  commander, British General Michael Rose, who has proved himself  highly sensitive to his media image, seems to have played the  most dishonest role because he requested air strikes despite the  fact that he had previously given 48 hours to the Moslem and  Serb sides to think again about possibilities for reaching a  comprehensive peace accord.    Such an accord has been proposed by the Serb side, and  rejected by the Moslem, but even that fact has been hidden from  the public at East River.    After the air strikes on Serbs, Washington can expect new  Moslem provocations and terrorist actions in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  because crime is obviously worth their trouble.    Even Bosnian Moslem Deputy Prime Minister Ejup Ganic made  hints in that direction when he told the U.N. Security Council  on Monday that Moslems would not negotiate unless Serbs withdrew  from their positions around Gorazde to the positions they held  on March 30.    He called for new air strikes -- including the blowing up of  bridges, roads and lines of supply in the Bosnian Serb  territories -- in order to force the Serbs to agree to a peace  solution fashioned to fit the interests of the Moslems and the  West.</p>

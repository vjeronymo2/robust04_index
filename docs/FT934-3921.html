			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / People: AXA sends Hawken to Tokyo Early in the new year, Jim Hawken will be on his way to Tokyo to set up a life insurance operation for AXA group. Hawken's new role comes after five years as sales and marketing manager for AXA Equity &amp; Law and earlier experience in the 1970s setting up from scratch and then running Equity &amp; Law's life operation in Germany. He is spending the next month in a language laboratory learning Japanese; when he was given the similar task of setting up a new operation in Germany in the 1970s he had at least, he says, 'school German' to start with. His current move, he says, is similar in some ways to entering the highly-regulated German market, but he expects much more rapid expansion in Japan in the early years than was achieved in the German operation, partly because it will have the weight of AXA behind it. AXA sees expansion into the Japanese domestic market as a key element in its plans to be a significant player in all the major life assurance markets. Aged 53, Hawken expects to stay with the new company through its start-up period next year and for the first couple of years after it acquires its licence and opens for business in early 1995. At AXA headquarters in Paris, Hawken's background in sales is seen as at least as important as his German experience, since distribution will be so critical in the success of the company. He also has, an official says, 'the right way of working that could be applied to Japanese staff' in terms of his ability to reach decisions through consensus. He is replaced as general manager (sales and marketing) by Mitch Brown who, together with Duncan Kerr, chief actuary of AXA Equity &amp; Law Life Assurance Society, join the board of the holding company, AXA Equity &amp; Law.</p>

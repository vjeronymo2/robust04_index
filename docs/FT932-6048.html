			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / International Company News: NEC battered by downturn in PC sales NEC, the Japanese electronics group battered by the sharp fall in corporate and consumer demand in Japan, reports its first group loss in nearly two decades. The downturn in the domestic computer market, stagnant sales of semiconductors, high depreciation costs, and severe difficulties in its home electronics business resulted in a Y37.7bn (Dollars 342.72m) consolidated loss for NEC. The loss came as sales fell 7 per cent to Y3,514bn. At the net after-tax level, NEC consolidated losses totalled Y45.1bn. Parent company results were better, largely because the results of its troubled home electronics business are excluded. A substantial proportion of semiconductor business is also excluded. Pre-tax profits for the parent company were down 77.3 per cent to Y18.1bn, on sales that declined 6 per cent to Y2,869bn. NEC, which is the largest manufacturer of personal computers (PCs) in Japan, came under severe pressure last year as corporate investment in the country was stagnant and computer sales suffered under fierce competition from foreign companies. NEC was hit by a sharp fall in PC demand late in the year, following the introduction of lower-priced US PCs into Japan. PCs account for nearly 30 per cent of NEC's computer sales: their sales fell about 7 per cent. Electronic devices, such as semiconductors, were also down about 7 per cent, while telecommunications sales dropped 5 per cent. However, the company expects PC sales volumes to rise 10 per cent this year, to 1.4m units. At the same time, the Japanese semiconductor market is forecast to rise 3 per cent, compared with a 10 per cent fall last year. The company has taken cost-cutting measures, including a reduction in capital investment from Y190bn in fiscal 1992 to Y140bn this year. It expects results to recover substantially in 1993-94. Forecasts are for a 6 per cent rise in parent sales, to Y3,030bn, with pre-tax profits emerging at Y50bn. Consolidated sales of Y3,700bn are expected with net profits of Y10bn. At Mitsubishi Electric, the decline in the semiconductor market and weak demand for consumer electronic products is blamed for a 5 per cent fall in parent sales, to Y2,494bn. Pre-tax profits were 47 per cent down to Y32.3bn. Mitsubishi expects non-consolidated sales in the current year to improve to Y2,510bn, and pre-tax profits to increase to Y35bn.</p>

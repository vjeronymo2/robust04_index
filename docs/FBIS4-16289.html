			<p>BFN     [Text] RIGA, Apr 14, BNS -- Deputies in the Latvian Saeima  (parliament) oppositionary National Bloc said Wednesday [13  April] they wanted a new delegation for talks with Russia. The  bloc also urges the parliament not to ratify the March 15  initialed agreements with Russia because they contain several  norms that can be interpreted as legalization of consequences of  the Soviet occupation in Latvia. These issues should be  considered in an extraordinary session of the Saeima, the group  said. The majority of the Latvian people dislikes the agreement  on social guarantees for Russia's war pensioners in Latvia, the  National Bloc said.    Russian President Boris Yeltsin's directive on the setup of  a  military base in Latvia signals that Russia has aggressive plans  in the Baltic country. In addition, none of the foreign  countries, which pressed Latvia into compromise with Russia on  the Skrunda radar's operation, has extended real security  guarantees against possible conflicts, disputes or provocations,  according to the bloc's statement.    Yeltsin's decision presented the Latvian government a way  out  of situation because it would have had to resign if these floppy  agreements were signed, said Aristids Lambergs, of the National  Independence Movement faction.    Lambergs claims that the country's delegation for talks with  Russia should include representatives of all Saeima factions.    The National Bloc proposes to convene an extraordinary  plenary session to discuss the setup of the new delegation on  April 20, Lambergs told BNS. The bloc's statement was signed by  16 deputies. To propose an extraordinary session, signatures of  33 deputies, or one-third of the 100-member Saeima, are needed.  The National Bloc, which includes 35 MPs, hopes to get the  lacking signatures until Monday.    The National Bloc includes National Independence Movement,  Homeland and Freedom and Christian Democrats factions.</p>

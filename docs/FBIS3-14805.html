			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Amnesty: ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI Experts' </F> Opinion"]    [Text] Russian General Prosecutor Aleksey Kazannik must  apparently have contradictory feelings about having landed in  the problematic legal situation created by a majority of the  State Duma deputies who spoke for passing the decree announcing  political and economic amnesty.    First, being general prosecutor, Aleksey Kazannik has no  right to oversee the legality of a legal act passed by the State  Duma. Hence his unequivocal statement that the General  Prosecutor's Office would immediately execute the Duma decree as  soon as the document is on the general prosecutor's desk. As  many people know, a package of Duma acts was delivered on the  evening of 24 February at 15a Pushkinskaya Street, where A.  Kazannik's agency is located. He, according to General  Prosecutor's Office officials, is ill at the moment. Will this  circumstance affect the date for making a decision?    Second, there is also no knowing what the general  prosecutor's reaction would be to the circumstance that a number  of noted lawyers have serious doubts about the constitutionality  of some of the provisions of the amnesty decree. Solving such  differences is the prerogative of the Constitutional Court, but  it is not functioning at present.    What shall be done in this case? How is one to qualify the  Duma decree in regard to acts of treason? -- precisely this  article is invoked to charge a number of persons from among the  organizers of the August 1991 and October 1993 events. Would it  not be acting against logic and legal norms if the Duma  amnesties Rutskoy, Khasbulatov, and others, and leaves in jail  those who fall under more merciful articles of the Criminal Code?    Finally, one detail of no mean importance is the entering  into force of the decree as soon as it becomes published. The  State Duma has no press organ of its own that could be an  official information source. The Duma is not known to have  passed any normative act on this score. This means that the  appearance of Duma decisions on the pages of some newspaper is  no more than information.    Thus, in addition to creating political tensions, the State  Duma decision also creates a field for confrontation of a legal  nature.    Time will tell whether the legal community is going to have  an impact on the Duma decision. At any rate, the controversial  nature of this situation will affect the future of the Lefortovo  inmates.</p>

			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / DTI Astra report criticises auditors UP TO 25 individuals and organisations may be criticised in the long-awaited Department of Trade and Industry investigation into Astra, the collapsed munitions group, which is due to be published next month. Two dozen draft letters of criticism are believed to have been sent out by inspectors to those involved, particularly in the circumstances surrounding the company's Pounds 36m rights issue in July 1989 and its purchase of Poudreries Reunies de Belgique (PRB), a Belgian company which made propellant for the Iraqi supergun. Among those criticised is Stoy Hayward, the accountancy firm which was the company's auditor. It has received one letter addressed to the firm, and two individually to partners involved on Astra work - although neither still works with Stoy. Former directors have also been criticised, but are understood to be furious that the inspectors have apparently not examined allegations of the government's involvement in defence deals which may have played a part in Astra's downfall. Stoy Hayward yesterday said it would not comment 'until we have seen the final report and in particular the inspectors' conclusions in relation to the directors'. It would call for an inquiry into how details of the investigation had been leaked to newspapers. Others under the scrutiny of the inspectors included the directors of Astra, and the professional advisers to the rights issue: Paine Webber International, the merchant bank, Hitchens, Harrison &amp; Co, Astra's stockbrokers, and Baileys Shaw &amp; Gillett, its solicitors.</p>

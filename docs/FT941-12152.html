			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / People: Age no encumbrance at Attwoods Several years beyond the statutory retirement age, Peter Lane - created Lord Lane of Horsell by Margaret Thatcher in 1990 - has stepped up his duties at the international waste management group Attwoods to become non-executive chairman, at 69. Ken Foreman, a comparative junior at 59, is to continue as chief executive, while Sir Denis Thatcher, 78, is retiring as non-executive deputy chairman. By profession an accountant, Lord Lane, right, said yesterday that 'in a perfect world one doesn't appoint a chairman of 69' but that the board is fully aware of his age. The decision to split the chief executive and chairman's role is being made to ensure compliance with the Cadbury's committee's recommendations on corporate governance. Foreman said yesterday that 'it's not easy to find really good non-executives' and that Lord Lane's 'knowledge, experience and bright mind' mean that 'he has has all the requisites to be a first class chairman'. Attwoods has gone through uncomfortable times recently, particularly concerning litigation in the US, from where it derives some 70 per cent of its revenues. But Lord Lane said that a settlement with Eastern Waste Industries, a US subsidiary, plus the October 1993 sale of another US subsidiary, the loss-making metal re-cycling company Mindis, which required a Pounds 91m provision to cover the loss on disposal, had put the group in better shape to face the future. 'All we need now is for the economy generally to pick up,' he said yesterday. In 1992 Lord Lane retired as a senior partner of chartered accountants BDO Binder Hamlyn and first joined the Attwoods' board in July 1992. Among his other interests Lord Lane numbers the chairmanship of the charity Action on Addiction, and the deputy chairmanship of the outdoor advertising specialist More O'Ferrall. He said that Attwoods is now seeking to make two new non-executive appointments, and that one of those will probably go to an American, boosting the group's representation in its most important region.</p>

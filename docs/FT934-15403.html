			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Japan may help fund rail link to Heathrow: Ex-Im bank may offer Pounds 150m at commercial rates HALF THE finance for the Pounds 300m high-speed Heathrow Express rail link could be provided by the Export-Import Bank of Japan, a state-owned bank that specialises in loans to developing countries. The loan would form part of a fresh drive by Japan to recycle some of its massive trade surplus into public works projects in industrialised countries. The UK might be the first Group of Seven country to benefit under the initiative. The British Airports Authority, the privatised operator of London's Heathrow airport, confirmed yesterday that it had been approached by the bank, which saw the link 'as a good commercial deal'. A long-term loan from the Export-Import bank, which as a government-backed institution can borrow on the Japanese markets at favourable rates, was one option under consideration for financing the 17-mile link from the airport to London's Paddington station. 'We have not yet chosen a bank or decided whether to raise the finance through debt or bonds,' the authority said. 'We are still talking to a number of banks around the world which are interested.' However, the authority denied reports in the Japanese business daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun that the bank had offered a low-interest loan for the project. 'Any loan would be at market rates,' the authority said. 'It would not be subsidised credit.' Japan hopes the decision to finance public works projects in industrial nations will increase the flow of long-term capital and highlight the country's efforts to reduce its current account surplus, the newspaper said. This is a fresh development in Japan's six-year-old strategy of recycling part of its capital surplus in development and aid. Last month, the bank signed its first deal in a European Community country when it guaranteed a Pounds 49m private sector loan to modernise Greece's railways. 'We are interested in doing something to revitalise the world economy,' said Mr Yoshisiko Morita, Export-Import bank's London representative. 'Our purpose is to co-operate with industrialised countries if there is a project that will contribute towards that aim.' Financing the Heathrow Express would be the bank's first significant project in the UK. The bank was looking at several similar projects in Europe, he said. BAA has already put Pounds 50m into the Heathrow Express, which is due to be completed by the end of 1997. It intends to raise the balance of the cost through a mixture of short-term and long-term loans, in the same way as it finances airport projects.</p>

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Johannesburg to relax market access restrictions: Committee urges increased black participation in stockbroking community The Johannesburg Stock Exchange yesterday announced its intention to relax restrictions on foreign participation and ownership of brokerages, allow corporate membership, and lower barriers to entry for first-time investors, especially blacks. The exchange is the 11th biggest in the world by market capitalisation with a value of some Dollars 170bn. The proposals are part of the findings of a sub-committee that had been commissioned two years ago to 'advise on how the JSE should be structured as South Africa enters a new era'. The inquiry was prompted both by a need to increase the efficiency and accessibility of the exchange in a time of political flux and address pressure from institutions, such as merchant banks, for the right to deal on the market. The committee urges the encouraging of wider share ownership among the black community, promoting small business and emerging black entrepreneurs, the expansion of possible channels for black savings in the market, and increased black participation in the stockbroking community. The JSE proposes easing access to the exchange for small and medium-size black companies through a restructuring of the largely moribund local venture capital market as well as introducing a new class of members of the exchange to make market entry simpler. Operational questions addressed by the report centred on whether to permit corporate members, whether to allow negotiated commissions, and whether to switch from the current single trading capacity, where brokers act on behalf of buyers and sellers, to dual capacity trading, where brokers can act as principal as well as agent. Although divided, the majority report of the committee decided that a London style, immediate 'Big Bang' was not desirable for Johannesburg and that 'phased implementation' of deregulation would be preferable. It decided to retain fixed commissions at a slightly lower basic rate, but allow for negotiation on commissions on trades over R3m. On corporate memberships, it suggests that initially up to 30 per cent of a broking firm may be sold to non-stockbrokers, with the proportion possibly expanding at a later date. As the report also recommends lifting the restriction on South African citizens becoming brokers, this opens the door for foreign ownership of broking firms. Several local brokers are already sounding out prospective international partners. 'There is a great deal of interest among the foreign community in increasing their involvement on the exchange,' admits Mr Roy Andersen, JSE president, who described the proposals as an 'elegant solution' that would 'level the playing field between brokers and bankers and allow the process of evolution without disruption.' On the more contentious debate over trading, a majority view decided to retain the current single capacity so as to prevent possible abuses and price manipulation. South Africa's banking sector is largely controlled by conglomerates which have significant industrial interests as well, thus opening up potential conflicts of interest. However, the report acknowledged that, were South Africa's restrictive exchange controls ever lifted as the committee favours, a shift to dual trading capacity in the broader global market would be inevitable. The report also blames the foreign currency controls for the problem of market illiquidity - annual turnover currently amounts to only around 7 per cent of market capitalisation - but suggests that the abolition of the Marketable Securities Tax, currently levied at 1 per cent of transactions, could also help address the problem. The recommendations have to be passed on to the new parliament and then legislated before they take effect. Among stockbrokers, the general reaction was favourable, with some seeing it as a pre-emptive strike against possible action by the new government. 'All in all it is good news and far better than having it imposed by an external force,' said one dealer.</p>

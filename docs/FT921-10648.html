			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Bonds: Denmark set to launch first domestic Ecu paper DENMARK is expected to launch its first domestic offering of Ecu bonds today. The Ecu1bn issue of 10-year bonds is being arranged by two Danish banks, Den Danske Bank and Unibank. A non-Danish European bank is also believed to be involved at a senior level. The bonds will be listed in Copenhagen in order to encourage some domestic trading and some participation by Danish investors. However, the bonds will be mainly placed and traded internationally and will be treated like other Eurobond issues. The deal will be priced to offer a yield pick-up of 7 to 10 basis points above the 10-year Ecu OAT. Yesterday, new issue activity in the Eurobond market again followed no clear pattern. Despite an overhang of paper, a broad range of new issues emerged in a variety of currencies, including lira, Australian dollars, Swedish kronor and Ecu. Swiss Bank Corporation identified an unusual business opportunity in the dollar sector, which is still failing to excite any investor interest. By stripping Dollars 500m of a Dollars 2bn bond issue for Italy into its component parts, the Swiss bank was able to create a range of zero-coupon bonds. No other banks are involved in the transaction. The original issue of 9 5/8 per cent bonds due 1999, launched in 1989, has recently been underperforming the market. It has been trading at a price of around 110, a substantial premium to its par value, which deters investors from buying paper. (Bonds priced at a premium have a built-in capital loss since they will be redeemed at par). By stripping the issue into its component parts (coupons and principal), the disadvantage of a premium pricing is removed. Since the transaction, the spread of the remaining Dollars 1.5bn of 9 5/8 per cent bonds has tightened by about 10 basis points to 48 basis points above the relevant US Treasury, SBC said. However, the lack of demand for dollar securities led to some scepticism from other traders about the level of demand for such paper. But SBC said the paper was sold-out, following broad-based sales across the maturity spectrum, as a result of a dearth of zero-coupon paper. Elsewhere, attractive swap opportunities continue to attract borrowers to the Swedish kronor market. Yesterday's SKr500m deal for the International Finance Corporation, the arm of the World Bank, met firm demand from German retail investors, who were also the mainstay of last week's three deals in the habitually slow sector. Eurofima added ADollars 135m to its ADollars 200m global offering of 15-year bonds. The deal, arranged by Fay Richwhite and Merrill Lynch, was considered attractively priced to yield 10.51 per cent, 25 basis points above the 10-year Commonwealth of Australia bond. Eurofima is the third borrower to use a global structure in this market, following Swedish Export Credit and the European Investment Bank. Although other borrowers, such as SBAB, the Swedish mortgage agency, and Credit Local, the French regional financing agency, are said to be considering the market. However, traders said the market was limited to the very top borrowers. In the matador bond market, Ireland raised Pta10bn of 10-year bonds, via Banco Bilbao Vizcaya. The deal met mainly retail demand from German and Benelux investors. From an issue price of 101 1/4 , it was bid at 99.90, within fees of 1 7/8 points. In the D-Mark sector, Norway added DM500m to its recent DM1bn issue of five-year bonds via Deutsche Bank.</p>

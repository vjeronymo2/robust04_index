			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Taiwanese lawyers seek release of textile tycoon LAWYERS for Mr Oung Ta-ming, a Taiwanese textile tycoon, renewed efforts to obtain his release from jail at the weekend amid fears that his detention could have serious repercussions on the stock market, Reuter reports from Taipei. Mr Oung, whose Hualon group is one of the largest in the market, was arrested on Thursday for failing to make scheduled court appearances on charges of involvement in a SDollars 22m (Pounds 6.9m) stock scandal, the island's biggest. The Taipei District Court, rejecting claims that he was too sick to stand trial, on Friday ordered him detained without bail, citing the possibility of him fleeing abroad. Mr Oung's lawyers petitioned the court again on Saturday to release him on bail saying his health was deteriorating. Newspapers reported that the court would consider the petition today when it reopened after the Mid-Autumn Festival public holidays.</p>

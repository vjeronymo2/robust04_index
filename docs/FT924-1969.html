			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Italy (9): A bankable professor / Profile of Tancredi Bianchi THE last door of a long corridor at Milan's Bocconi University is hardly the most obvious place to find the man now gently steering Italy's banks at a time of unprecedented change. But the surroundings fit the character of Mr Tancredi Bianchi, the professor of banking economics at Italy's most distinguished university, who was last year's surprise choice to chair the Associazione Bancaria Italiana, Italy's bankers' federation. ABI is the mouthpiece for all Italy's banks. Sometimes, as in the early 1991 collapse of the Federconsorzi farm services group, it comes out of the shadows to play a central role in a financial drama by representing the entire system in talks with the government and foreign counterparts. At other times, ABI keeps to the sidelines, providing detailed information to help member banks make better strategic decisions on broad macroeconomic issues or on specialised banking matters. Mr Bianchi, a Bocconi graduate who has been teaching at his Alma Mater for the past 13 years, prefers the second approach. Instantly recognisable for his shock of grey hair, his clipped, precise sentences are a long shot from the verbiage of some colleagues. 'I was born a university professor,' he says, somewhat diffidently. But Mr Bianchi is no wallflower when it comes to defending the Italian banking system. True, the country's banks still have a reputation for inefficiency, small networks and a negligible presence abroad, which put them in the shadow of bigger European rivals. But many of those characteristics are legacies of rules made years ago, rather than inherent faults in the banks themselves, he emph- asises. Attacks on inadequate internationalisation are unfair, he insists. Only in 1990 did Italy finally allow the free movement of capital. 'Swiss banks could tell you all about investing in Australian shares or New Zealand bonds: at an Italian bank, such knowledge was useless.' Likewise, the very strict controls on branching imposed by the Bank of Italy until the beginning of the 1990s prevented banks from developing big networks. 'Now things are moving, but the problem is that banks have only two ways to grow; either organically, which is slow; or through acquisitions, which is expensive.' Yet on the positive side, Mr Bianchi points out that Italy's banks are relatively profitable - even if largely due to limited foreign competition - and relatively well capitalised. He prefers to talk of 'restructuring', rather than 'rationalising' the banking system to create fewer, bigger banks able to take on the best in Europe. It is a small, but significant, nuance at a time when many medium and smaller banks are uneasy about their fates. The Amato law on bank mergers of the late 1980s, which accelerated the pace of change by offering tax advantages to banks changing their status into that of joint stock companies or merging, has had some effect. 'Along with the European Community's Second Banking Directive, which will prepare the way for universal banking in Italy, such changes will provide the backdrop which could encourage a major leap,' Mr Bianchi says. 'But we still need a few years.' It is the need for additional funds which will provide the biggest push for change as more banks tap private sector capital, he predicts. Hence privatisation of public sector banks, which currently comprise around three-quarters of the system, is less an ideological issue for Mr Bianchi than one of pure practicality. 'It's not that the public sector is inappropriate as a partner in the banking system. Rather, the state is no longer in a position to provide funds.' This year may go down as paving the way for the greatest change. While January brought the flotation of an opening stake in Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, 1992 should close with preliminary steps to privatise a number of state-owned institutions, starting with Credito Italiano. 'Restructuring requires additional capital, so there is no doubt the role of private investors will grow,' says Mr Bianchi. Looking ahead, he sees four or five really big Italian banks emerging by the end of the century. Together, they will account for around half the banking system in terms of assets. Two - San Paolo and the new Banca di Roma - have already surfaced. Cariplo, the big Milan-based savings bank which could buy the IMI financial services group, looks like the third. Finding the names for the fourth and fifth is more tricky, but Mr Bianchi points to Banca Nazionale del Lavoro - alone or with a partner - and possibly Monte dei Paschi di Siena as the most likely candidates. The next level down will comprise banks which are still substantial in size, but whose main focus will be on retail banking, rather than all services, he believes. And there will still be a substantial role for the municipally-owned savings banks, which currently account for around 30 per cent of the Italian banking system. Rather than remaining locked in their current positions owing to political or regional rivalries, Mr Bianchi expects the savings banks to form bigger units through mergers and takeovers. 'There is already some movement,' he says. 'Some are merging, while in other cases, bigger counterparts such as Cariplo and Banca di Roma are taking minority stakes.' Like most observers, he expects those minority participations to become majorities in the end. In the meantime, more banks will have to decide on their own internal structures. Though most have traditionally adopted the so-called 'polyfunctional' model, involving a holding company and subsidiaries for specialised functions such as merchant banking or leasing, the concept of the universal bank is gaining ground. In the past, the issue has sometimes been decided on fiscal grounds, with banks seeking to reduce their tax bills by choosing the most fitting structure. 'If the choice were fiscally neutral, then banks could make the choice on purely organisational grounds,' he says. However, Mr Bianchi doubts that any model will prevail. 'It's not a question of winners or losers,' he says. Rather, banks such as Banca Commerciale Italiana, which have tended to grow up along the 'polyfunctional' path, will probably carry on that way, while others, such as Cariplo, with few subsidiaries, will probably develop their banking activities under one corporate roof. And what of ABI in the meantime? The role of a bankers' association is to help identify the parameters that might influence important decisions for members. 'Our scope is to study banks' problems. We are here to point out possible solutions, not to find answers or give orders. It's up to the banks themselves to decide on how to implement that advice.' Mr Bianchi is now two-thirds the way through his second year at ABI. Its rules allow the chairman up to four renewable two-year terms. 'No one stays for eight years,' he says. With a queue of students outside his door waiting for advice from their professor-turned-practitioner, he would clearly not be opposed to a second term. 'But that is up to the members.'</p>

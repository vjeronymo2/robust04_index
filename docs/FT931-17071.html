			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Sterling underpinned What does seem a reasonably safe assumption is that by next summer the UK's position relative to the rest of Europe will look very different. A recovery of sorts should be under way and interest rates should have bottomed out. There may even be expectations of a modest rise in rates which will underpin sterling in the exchange markets. The combination of recovery and currency stability may attract overseas money into UK equities and gilts, especially if the Bundesbank is grudging in its rate cuts and the continent remains mired in recession. Even so, it would be foolish to assume that the government's funding requirement will not restrain the equity market next year. The thought also occurs that, in the absence of a vigorous recovery, the UK could easily follow the pattern set by Wall Street, which showed its strongest gains while interest rates were actually falling in late 1991. It has gained only modestly since. If that points to only small gains for equities as a whole this year, the mood may swing violently at times, especially once the funding programme gets under way in earnest in the spring. The best returns may accrue to those nimble enough to move in and out of the market - and who, by luck or judgment, enjoy an impeccable sense of timing.</p>

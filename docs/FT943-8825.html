			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Charter ready for next move on Esab Charter, the UK industrial group, will today announce whether it is willing to pay more for Esab, the world's largest supplier of welding equipment, than the Pounds 260m (Dollars 402m) recommended bid rejected by an important group of the Swedish company's institutional shareholders. In spite of some bad blood engendered on both sides last week, it appeared unlikely yesterday that the UK company would carry out a threat to 'walk away' from Esab, which the terms of its original offer allowed it to do if Charter failed - as it did - to win 90 per cent acceptances. 'Charter still thinks Esab is a great company. It really believes it can bring something to the business,' said a source close to the deal, which would more than double Charter in size and add a long-sought fourth arm to its operations in building materials, coal and rail track equipment. Most shareholders in Stockholm expect Charter will either raise its bid, or hold for the time being to the majority of the voting capital it has already won. Charter was stunned last week when five Swedish institutions rebuffed its offer of SKr345 a share after the share price had shot up to as high as SKr365 since the bid was made in late June. The UK company was already assured of 53 per cent of the voting capital, mainly through the 48 per cent pledged by Esab's controlling shareholder, Incentive, the industrial group, and may have received more by the last Friday's deadline. But Charter had made the bid conditional on achieving a complete takeover. Esab shareholders insisted their objections to its bid were based solely on the perception that it was underpriced. Even the biggest institutional shareholder, the Fourth Fund, a state pension fund with trade union representation on its board, rejected a campaign by trade unions within Esab that argued Charter was a hostile foreign predator likely to run down its Swedish operations. 'In fact, you can argue that Charter is good for the Swedish operations. Charter has no existing overlapping business so it will not be looking for rationalisations,' said a senior institutional director. The main shareholder complaint is that the price of SKr345, which when the offer was made represented a 20 per cent premium, no longer offers a premium on an updated valuation of the company based on the share price and enhanced earnings forecasts. 'That is a fact,' Mr Bengt Eskilsson, Esab's chairman, acknowledged last week. Esab, with annual turnover of SKr7bn (Dollars 900m), has recently surged back into profit after a programme of heavy restructuring and is forecasting greatly improved earnings as international demand picks up. Most of its production and markets are outside Sweden. See Lex</p>

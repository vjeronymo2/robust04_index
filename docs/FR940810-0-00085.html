			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several participants noted that most asbestos work would not be assigned to a single worker, and SSSD should include only jobs completed by 2 employees in one work shift (Ex. 7&hyph;31): Preston Quirk of Gobbell Hays Partners, Inc. suggested that a maximum of 3 workers be allowed (Ex. 7&hyph;34). Organization Resources Counselors, Inc. (ORC) maintained that the specification of the number of workers was not necessary, as long as the employer had a comprehensive safety and health plan. (Ex. 7&hyph;99).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The views on these defining variables has influenced the Agency's decision to broaden and realign its job classification system based on relative risk. Based on this record and the agency's experience in enforcing the 1986 standard's provisions on small-scale, short duration work, OSHA is dropping the term ``small-scale, short term'' work from the regulatory text. The agency finds that the term ``small-scale, short term'' is too limiting, has been shown to be confusing, and cannot be defined with sufficient precision to serve the purpose of distinguishing high risk asbestos-disturbing activity from activity of reduced risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The term is limiting because it focuses on a fraction of the circumstances and criteria which define lower risk work with asbestos-containing material. OSHA has found that thermal system insulation (TSI) and surfacing material are the asbestos-containing building materials likely to produce significant employee exposure. On the other hand, removing asbestos-containing products like transite panels, likely will not result in significant exposure, even if conducted for more than one day, under minimum controls. As much as the scope and duration of the job, the materials themselves, their condition and the work-practices used define hazard potential.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA's organization of asbestos jobs into categories is based on the more objective criteria, such as the type of material to be disturbed and the type of activity. Factors which are more subjective, such as condition, and crew experience are part of the required pre-job assessment by a ``competent person.'' Not concentrating on the amount of asbestos material or the time the job takes, avoids serious objections raised by rulemaking participants to the time- or volume-based definition in the proposal. For example, a frequent complaint was that the duration of the operation should not be specified in the definition of small-scale activities because this might create incentives to perform the work more hurriedly and in a more hazardous manner when the worker must meet defined time schedules (Ex. 7&hyph;18, 7&hyph;35, 7&hyph;37, 7&hyph;43, 7&hyph;50, 7&hyph;52, 7&hyph;54, 7&hyph;63, 7&hyph;74, 7&hyph;76, 7&hyph;81, 7&hyph;87, 7&hyph;89, 7&hyph;95, 7&hyph;99, 7&hyph;106, 7&hyph;112, 7&hyph;124, 7&hyph;128, 7&hyph;135, 7&hyph;139, 7&hyph;146, 7&hyph;151, 143, Tr. 417). (In a few regulatory provisions, however, OSHA still relies on the amount of material to be removed to indicate risk, and thus, the protections required. These are the exemption from critical barriers from low-exposure Class I jobs [see paragraph (g)(4) and in defining ``disturbance'']).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This classification system is OSHA's response to the Court's remand issue of how to clarify the term ``small-scale, short duration.'' (see also preceding discussion of classes of asbestos work under ``Definitions.'')  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Class I Work <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Class I work, i.e., the ``removal'' of TSI or surfacing ACM or PACM, must be performed using procedures in paragraph (g)(4) and using a control method which is listed in paragraph (g)(5) of the standard. If another control method is used, or if a listed control method is ``modified,'' the standard in paragraph (g)(6) requires that a certified industrial hygienist (CIH), or licensed professional engineer who is a ``project designer,'' certify the control method using the criteria set out in the regulatory text. The requirements of (g)(4) are: for Class I jobs, preparation must be supervised by a competent person, dropcloths must be used and HVAC systems must be isolated. The area must be set up using ``critical barriers' either as part of a negative pressure enclosure system, or as a supplemental barrier to another listed system which isolates the asbestos disturbance in a different way. Other barriers or isolation methods may be used to prevent asbestos migration. The effectiveness of such methods must be proven by visual inspection and clearance or perimeter monitoring (see e.g., Ex. 9&hyph;34 cc). As noted below, OSHA believes that the size of the removal job alone does not predict the risk to workers. However, if a job is smaller, the chances are reduced that isolation barriers provided by glove bags or boxes will fail.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA was reluctant to limit glove bag removals without critical barriers only to maintenance projects, where as NIOSH noted, it is more likely that crews will be untrained (Ex. 125). Rather, OSHA has followed the lead of some states, which allow removals involving less than 25 linear feet of TSI, and 10 square feet of other material to be handled without critical barriers, unless the glove bags or enclosure loses its integrity (see e.g., 12 NYCRR 56) or where a negative exposure assessment has not been produced. Such projects are class I removals, and workers required to perform them must be trained in an EPA-accredited training course or equivalent; OSHA believes that the work force performing these relatively minor removals is the same work force performing major removals, thus the jobs will be well-conducted and critical barriers will be unnecessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

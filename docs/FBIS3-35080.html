			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In a telephone interview with MBC today, Israeli  Defense Ministry Spokesman (Odet Ben'ami) said the Palestinian  Black 13 September Organization [as heard] fired a Katyusha  rocket at northern Israel last night. He blamed Syria and  Lebanon on the grounds that Syria controls most of Lebanon and  that all the activities of Hizballah and other organizations are  carried out under its supervision, as he put it.    Black September broke away from the Fatah Movement after the  signing of the Oslo accord in September. It is led by Colonel  Munir Maqdah, who is currently in Lebanon.    In contacts with MBC this evening, a Syrian source rejected  Israel's charge that Damascus is responsible for firing the  Katyusha rocket at the Galilee. He emphasized that it is not  Syria's task to guarantee protection for Israel.</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Relationship still special but showing its age: Washington views UK alliance from an altered perspective The form of their meeting has been carefully contrived to present an image of easy harmony. But the substance of the encounter will not be quite so relaxed. When Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister, visits Washington early next week he will receive the sort of reception from President Bill Clinton which will be characterised by anxious UK officials as red carpet treatment. After the recent storms in transatlantic relations Mr Major needs to prove that he remains a welcome and important visitor in the US capital. Mr Clinton is equally keen that the visit is seen as a success. In a ballet of symbolism, the two will meet first in Pittsburgh, one-time home of Mr Major's grandfather. Preparations are in hand to reciprocate during Mr Clinton's trip to the UK in June, with a visit to his old college porter at Oxford, a pint in a favourite pub, and a stay at Chequers. But the elaborate emphasis on the etiquette disguises a more complicated picture. What Britain could once declare with conviction to be the special relationship has not been as badly damaged as some recent newspaper headlines have proclaimed. Mr Anthony Lake, Mr Clinton's national security adviser, points out that the telephone on his desk is programmed to reach Mr Roderick Lyne, his opposite number at 10 Downing Street with the touch of a single button. Only two of his other foreign counterparts have their own button. 'Let me very firmly dispute that this is a relationship in trouble,' Mr Lake said in an interview with British journalists this week. But nor is it as robust or as warm as Mr Major's government would like to pretend. The world has changed and with it the relevance and strength of the Anglo-American alliance. On one level there have been the rows over Northern Ireland and Bosnia. On another there was the personal suspicion caused by the support offered to Mr George Bush by Mr Major's Conservative party in the 1992 presidential election. The two leaders should be able to dispose fairly quickly of one of these pieces of grit in the relationship. The message conveyed to London in recent days has been that President Clinton wants to draw a line under his controversial decision earlier this month to allow Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, to visit the US. White House officials deny that they have concluded that the Adams visa was a mistake, as their counterparts at the State Department or even the Federal Bureau of Investigations have. 'We'll have to see what the results are. We can't know yet,' said Mr Lake, insisting that Mr Clinton's disagreement with Mr Major was purely tactical. British officials, however, take this as a tacit acknowledgment of error. The talk of personal animus has also been overstated. There are aides at the White House - dubbed the 'Munchkins' by one US diplomat - who will lose no opportunity to exact revenge for Mr Major's support for Mr Bush. 'I believe the president wishes he knew who they were so he could discuss with them alternative plans for employment,' said Mr Lake, describing the talk of animosity as 'utter nonsense'. Mr Clinton is astute enough to know that relations with allies are more important than settling scores. Bosnia - likely to top the agenda next week - is much more difficult. It has, in the words of one British minister, been the 'real poison in the relationship'. Britain was at the forefront last year of Europe's destruction of Mr Clinton's planned approach to the war in the former Yugoslav republic. More recently the prime minister acquiesced in the air strike ultimatum against the Serbs besieging Sarajevo only after strong pressure from the White House. Mr Lake hotly denied Mr Clinton had told Mr Major that to do otherwise could undermine the US commitment to Nato. But senior British ministers and US diplomats said the president had done just that. The differences have been smoothed over. But the potential for a further sharp divergence remains. Mr Major's view is that the west has a chance of imposing a settlement in Bosnia only if the US commits troops. Washington is equally determined that no troops will be sent until a political agreement is reached. But British officials acknowledge that Mr Clinton could not obtain congressional backing for the deployment of ground troops at this stage, and that it will still be difficult if a peace agreement is reached. US involvement in the peace talks is thus seen as crucial to ensuring its later involvement in peacekeeping. 'If they are helping to broker the deal, they can't cop out at the point of implementation,' a senior British official said. Mr Major's government insists with some justification that the relationship can survive such storms. Trade, cultural and economic links remain strong. In many regions of the world, notably Iraq, Britain remain's Washington's most reliable ally. 'What is strongest in this relationship is a shared confidence, and through that shared confidence an ability not only to agree on issues but to disagree,' said Mr Lake. But the ending of the cold war, the increasing integration of continental Europe, unification of Germany and the economic power of the Pacific region have changed Washington's priorities. Mr Major would do well next week to acknowledge that reality.</p>

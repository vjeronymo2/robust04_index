			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / International Company News: Loss at US business hits Southcorp Southcorp, the Australian packaging, wine and appliance manufacturer formerly known as SA Brewing, yesterday announced a 2.4 per cent rise, to ADollars 121.2m (USDollars 90.4m), in annual operating profits after tax but before abnormals. However, after abnormals, profits plunged 58.5 per cent to ADollars 49.8m. The reason was a one-off charge of ADollars 68.7m, mainly related to write-offs and restructuring costs at its troubled US water heater business. Sales for the year were 1.6 per cent lower at ADollars 2.25bn. Southcorp said that its packaging, wine and Australian appliance businesses were 'very satisfactory'. The wine business performed particularly well, in spite of competition in the domestic market, with sales rising 11 per cent to ADollars 352m, and pre-tax profits jumping 35 per cent to ADollars 62m. However, the US water heater business incurred a USDollars 18.3m loss, leading to a 20 per cent decline in pre-tax profits from the appliance division.</p>

			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BASKETBALL REGIONALS;  </P> <P> DIVISION IV BOYS;  </P> <P> HERALDS LOSE A LONG-RANGE BATTLE, 74-61  </P> <P> Word of the considerable exploits of Carl Ray Harris spread as far south as  Whittier Christian High School in La Habra this week.  </P> <P> The Heralds knew of his array of dunks and other crowd-pleasing moves to the  basket.  </P> <P> What they learned to their dismay was that Harris, a 6-foot-2 guard for  Washington High of Easton, Calif., is not limited to acrobatic moves. He also  has a soft touch from the outside.  </P> <P> Harris showed off his long-range shooting in Washington's 74-61 victory over  Whittier Christian in a Southern California Regionals Division IV semifinal  game Thursday at Fresno City College.  </P> <P> His versatility is one of the reasons he is the Central Section's all-time  single-season scoring leader. Harris, who has signed a letter of intent to play  at Fresno State next season, passed Clifton Pondexter, a former Cal State Long  Beach and National Basketball Assn. player who played at San Joaquin Memorial  in the early 1970s. Harris has 822 points this season.  </P> <P> "We didn't realize how good Harris was from three-point range," Whittier  Christian Coach Bob Brown said. "We talked about stopping his dunks and keeping  the crowd out of the game. Maybe the kids were a little too concerned about  that."  </P> <P> Harris had a game-high 27 points, including three three-pointers in the first  half, to lead Washington (25-5) to the Regional final against Santa Clara at  Cal State Dominguez Hills Saturday.  </P> <P> Whittier Christian finished its most successful season with a 23-7 record.  </P> <P> The Hearlds, who won their first Southern Section title last week, also learned  that Washington's supporting cast also can inflict damage.  </P> <P> Forward Brad Gardner was particularly troublesome for Whittier Christian. He  had 20 points and helped seal the victory with a pair of free throws with 1  minute 18 seconds left in the game.  </P> <P> Sonny Burton, a reserve guard, added 13 points and also made two key free  throws late in the game.  </P> <P> "Everybody thinks we're just a one-man team," Washington Coach Al Biancalana  said. "One guy can't carry a team unless he's a 6-8 guy. Carl Ray doesn't carry  us."  </P> <P> Harris had only eight of his 27 points in the second half and that contributed  greatly to a fourth-quarter rally by Whittier Christian.  </P> <P> Washington took control of the game, leading, 23-14, at the end of the first  quarter. The Panthers maintained a six- to 14-point advantage until Whittier  Christian got hot from the outside midway through the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> A three-point basket by guard Matt Riehm pulled the Heralds to within 60-55.  </P> <P> Washington started to pull away again after Burton made a short jumper and  Harris, who made nine of 16 from the field including two dunks, drove for a  basket.  </P> <P> But Whittier Christian didn't fade. Center Scott Ferguson made a turnaround  jumper and forward Rob Diaz followed a moment later with a basket and Whittier  Christian was down, 64-61, with 1:35 left. But that was as close as the Heralds  could get.  </P> <P> Washington regrouped as Gardner and Burton made key free throws for a 68-61  lead with 1:02 left. The Panthers added four more free throws and Gardner  scored at the buzzer as Whittier Christian went scoreless in the final 1:35.  </P> <P> "We picked up momentum in the second half but it seemed like we didn't have  enough 'umph' to complete the rally," Brown said.  </P> <P> Paul McKinley led Whittier Christian with 20 points and Ferguson had 16 to go  with nine rebounds and three blocked shots.  </P></p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Inkatha resumes place at talks SOUTH AFRICA'S constitutional negotiators yesterday appeared to have averted a serious crisis after the government and the African National Congress made concessions to permit the Inkatha Freedom party and its allies to return to talks. Inkatha and five of its conservative allies stormed out of the 26-party negotiating council on Tuesday, raising fears that the conservative bloc known as the Concerned South Africans Group (Cosag) would boycott the talks permanently. Cosag returned to the talks after the council accepted its demand that the merits of a federal versus a unitary state should be considered, as well as different forms of transition to democracy - whether a constitution is written by elected or appointed representatives. The walk-out provoked a test of strength between the conservative bloc headed by Inkatha, and blocs led by the ANC and the government, which often act together in the talks. The ANC and government clearly decided to give in to Inkatha's demands rather than provoke a permanent withdrawal. But the solution - to refer to a technical committee the questions of form of state and transition - does no more than postpone the crisis. The council must decide on the two issues within the next few weeks. At that point, those who disagree may again walk-out. Some members of the Cosag group - notably, the white right-wing Conservative party - seem likely to withdraw permanently once the form of state is finally decided. The Conservative party demands a separate homeland for Afrikaners within a confederal state. Inkatha's participation remains in the balance.</p>

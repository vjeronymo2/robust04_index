			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW ERA OF PLANETARY MISSIONS;  </P> <P> NASA SEEKS CLUES TO LIFE IN THE EARTH'S BACK YARD  </P> <P> Each July and August, blue ice lakes form on the surface of glaciers near the  U.S. research station at Sondre Stromfjord in southern Greenland. Belying the  pristine Greenland air and the clean-swept beauty of the glaciers, the bottoms  of the lakes are covered with black organic goo.  </P> <P> The tar is not the residue of an oil spill, nor is it any other detritus of  civilization. It is comet dust, a melange of rock and organic materials formed  between the planets, and between stars, and dating back perhaps to the  formation of the solar system 4.5 billion years ago.  </P> <P> The dust falls to Earth continually -- and on other planets and moons as well  -- becoming buried in the snow and ice. In the arctic regions, it is  concentrated by the summer melt and then settles on lake bottoms.  </P> <P> Earth's organic chemicals -- the stuff of life -- represent only a fraction of  the total found throughout the solar system. In fact, "the universe is awash in  organic chemicals" like those from which life evolved on Earth, said astronomer  Dale Cruikshank of NASA's Ames Research Laboratory in Mountain View.  </P> <P> Because of the apparent ease with which life was created on Earth, some  researchers believe life could have arisen elsewhere in the solar system as  well: on the surface of Mars, when water flowed freely there, or in the frozen  oceans of Europa, a moon of Jupiter.  </P> <P> Now, with the launch of the Magellan probe to Venus in May and next month's  launch of Galileo to Jupiter, NASA has begun a new series of exploratory  missions to Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, its satellite Titan and at least two  comets. In addition to evidence about the origin of the solar system, they hope  to discover primitive forms of life that are no longer present on Earth itself,  as well as other evidence that would illuminate the origin of life.  </P> <P> At the very least, researchers hope that information gained from those missions  will shed light on how primitive organic molecules were organized into the more  complex forms that are now characteristic of life.  </P> <P> "The clues to life's origin . . . are going to be found elsewhere in the solar  system," said Lynn Griffiths, head of NASA's exobiology program, which studies  life off the Earth. "Exobiology has matured quite a bit in the last 20 years  and is now in its active young adulthood," added cosmologist Harold P. Klein of  the University of Santa Clara. "We have unlimited challenges. Unfortunately, at  the present we have only limited opportunities."  </P> <P> Researchers gathered recently in Sunnyvale for a NASA-sponsored conference to  discuss the best places to look for life off the Earth. They concluded that a  number of tempting targets exist within the solar system but that undoubtedly  the chances of finding life are rather small. Many would be happy to find  fossils of life that had once existed elsewhere, but others argue that more  clear-cut evidence -- including living organisms -- is necessary to convince  them.  </P> <P> Exobiologists once had high hopes for Mars, the fourth planet from the sun, and  were crushed when the Mariner probes produced no evidence of life. But they  have been reassessing what they know about the Red Planet and now think that  perhaps the probe simply wasn't looking in the right place. "Mars is still the  best candidate for life in the solar system," said astrophysicist Christopher  McKay of the Ames lab.  </P> <P> The chief factor militating against life existing on Mars, which is about half  the size of Earth, is the small amount of water that exists there, either  frozen at the poles in winter or vaporized in summer. The fact that water is  not present in liquid form is "a serious problem for contemplating life on  Mars," McKay said, "but it hasn't always been that way."  </P> <P> Photographs of Mars show large areas, such as Valles Marinaris and Playa Lake,  that look as though they were shaped by water. Valles Marinaris, for example,  has a delicate surface tracery of small channels that could have been formed by  the slow flow of water on the surface, "perhaps rain finding a collection  area," McKay said.  </P> <P> This and other evidence suggest that during the period from 4.5 billion to 3.5  billion years ago Mars had a relatively thick atmosphere, much larger  quantities of water and a surface temperature above freezing. "If life did  exist then, there could be a record," said Glenn Carle, chief of NASA's Solar  System Exploration Branch.  </P> <P> "What we really need to know is: If life didn't evolve there, why not?" McKay  said. If life didn't evolve on Mars, "there is something wrong with our  understanding of Mars or our paradigm for the evolution of life on Earth."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Missions to Mars  </P> <P> The Soviet Union and the United States are discussing manned missions to the  Red Planet. McKay and others are urging that any landings be made in the polar  regions near the ice caps or in regions where there is evidence of past water  flow because that is where evidence of life is most likely to occur.  </P> <P> A more remote possibility for life is Venus, the second planet from the sun.  The planet, which is about the size of Earth, has an average surface  temperature of about 900 degrees Fahrenheit, an atmosphere that is 95 times as  dense as Earth's and virtually no water.  </P> <P> "The idea of extant life can be ruled out by these data," astrophysicist Larry  Colin of San Jose State said.  </P> <P> But, like Mars, Venus could have been more hospitable to life early in its  history when the sun was not putting out as much radiation as it does now. One  key piece of evidence favoring a clement early Venus are mass spectrometer  measurements made by the Pioneer Venus spacecraft of the ratio of deuterium to  hydrogen in the planet's atmosphere. Deuterium is a rare heavy isotope of  hydrogen.  </P> <P> The deuterium/hydrogen ratio on Venus is about 100 times as great as Earth's.  Because water containing deuterium is heavier than normal water and thus  evaporates more slowly, this ratio indicates that Venus probably had  "significant amounts of water," Colin said. As the planet warmed up, that water  eventually rose into the upper atmosphere, where it was broken apart by  sunlight, leaving behind the heavier deuterium as much of the lighter hydrogen  escaped into space.  </P> <P> Venus could have had oceans during this period, and life could have gotten  started, only to die out as the planet heated up, astrophysicist James Kasting  of Ames said. Traces of life could still remain, he said. It may be very  difficult to locate such evidence, however, because of Venus' hostile  environment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Venus' Past  </P> <P> Scientists hope to learn much more about Venus' past from the Magellan probe,  which is scheduled to reach the "Veiled Planet" Aug. 10, 1990. The probe will  use sophisticated radar imaging to map at least 80% of the planet's surface, a  process that is expected to shed light on its geological history and the origin  of the "runaway greenhouse effect" that caused its high surface temperature.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most tantalizing object in the solar system is Europa, a Jovian  moon slightly larger than Earth's moon. Voyager 2 pictures show that its  surface is bright, smooth and highly fractured "like sea ice," astronomer Steve  Squyres of Cornell University said.  </P> <P> The whole surface of Europa has only about five craters, even though it has  presumably been subject to the same intense bombardment that has left the  Earth's moon covered with craters. Researchers thus believe that Europa has  continuing geological activity that obliterates the craters.  </P> <P> About 7% of the mass of Europa is water, he said, and the most likely  explanation for the surface features is that the moon's surface is covered by  an ocean of liquid water topped with a thick layer of ice. The water is  presumably kept liquid by tidal heating, a continual compression and relaxation  of the moon caused by Jupiter's massive gravity.  </P> <P> Furthermore, according to biochemist John Oro of the University of Houston,  "there is more organic material on Europa than in the terrestrial biosphere,"  as well as other elements, like phosphorus, that are crucial to life. "And if  there is liquid water, then Europa has potential hot spots" similar to thermal  vents in the Earth's oceans.  </P> <P> His conclusion: "Could terrestrial life grow there? My answer is yes. We  definitely need a close flyby and landing."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Plans for Mission  </P> <P> No such missions are planned at the moment, however, largely because of the  difficulty of landing amid Jupiter's massive gravity.  </P> <P> Another possibility, less likely but more accessible, is Titan, the largest  moon of Saturn, said Thomas Scattergood of the State University of New York at  Stony Brook. Titan, which is slightly larger than the Earth's moon, looks like  "a featureless billiard ball" because its extensive atmosphere hides its  surface.  </P> <P> Although researchers have never seen the surface of Titan, Scattergood  speculated that it is an ethane ocean containing both water-ice and frozen  carbon dioxide. Large numbers of organic compounds could be formed from these  raw materials through the action of sunlight, lightning and energetic particles  trapped by Saturn's magnetic field.  </P> <P> Whether or not Titan can accommodate life will depend on how much water is  present, he said. But "it looks like there is interesting organic chemistry  taking place there even today," NASA's Carle added.  </P> <P> Exobiologists are also interested in studying asteroids and comets, not because  they think life might exist there but because these celestial bodies contain  large amounts of organic chemicals and are presumably the source of most of the  carbon-containing compounds now on Earth.  </P> <P> Asteroids, which early astronomers called the "vermin of the skies" because of  their misleading motion, come in two categories, black and lighter, NASA's  Cruikshank said. The black material, he said, is very much like kerogen, the  complex organic material found in oil shale. The lighter material is made up of  less complex organic substances.  </P> <P> The asteroids and meteorites, added geochemist John Kerridge of UCLA, "are the  only materials we have that date from the beginnings of the solar system. . . .  Studies of carbon-containing meteorites that have fallen to Earth, called  carbonaceous chondrites, have shown the presence of more than 400 different  compounds, including most of the chemicals that are involved in life processes.  </P> <P> Studies of such meteorites allow researchers to determine what kinds of  chemicals were present on Earth before life arose, and may lead to new insights  into the events that sparked life's formation. Researchers are thus eager to  have more samples. Kerridge added: "We pray for more carbonaceous chondrite  falls."  </P> <P> Exobiologists may be able to get more information about life's origin without  waiting around for more meteorites, as NASA begins sending more probes out into  the solar system after an 11-year hiatus. "The queen is ready to give us more  ships," Carle said.  </P> <P> The Magellan mission that will perform radar mapping of Venus was launched from  the space shuttle Atlantis in May, and the Galileo spacecraft to Jupiter is  scheduled to be launched Oct. 12.  </P> <P> NASA has also tentatively approved two other deep-space missions, Titan-Cassini  and the Comet Rendezvous and Asteroid Flyby (CRAF). Both spacecraft, designed  at JPL, would use versions of the successful Mariner Mark II spacecraft that  would be outfitted with new instrumentation.  </P> <P> The Titan-Cassini probe, named after the 17th-Century French-  </P> <P> Italian astronomer who discovered several of Saturn's moons, would be launched  from an expendable rocket in April, 1996. The following March, it would have a  close flyby of asteroid Maja. It would swing by Jupiter in February, 2000, for  a gravitational boost and reach Saturn in October, 2002.  </P> <P> The orbiter will perform radar mapping of both Saturn and Titan, identifying  objects as small as 200 yards in diameter. It will occasionally fly through the  upper reaches of Titan's atmosphere and sample it, and will also send a probe  to the moon's surface.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Help on Financing  </P> <P> Last November, the European Space Agency agreed to build the Titan probe and  help finance the mission. NASA has not yet received funding from Congress for  the $550-million mission but is seeking $40 million for the next fiscal year to  begin construction of the craft.  </P> <P> The CRAF mission, which is scheduled for launch in August, 1995, would  intercept comet Kopff on Aug. 14, 2000, Marcia M. Neugebauer of JPL said.  Unlike the flights to Halley's comet, which flew past it at high speed, CRAF  will rendezvous with Kopff 850 days before its nearest approach to the sun and  accompany it through its orbit, measuring its output of gases and dust.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tests on Comet  </P> <P> After it has collected data for a year, CRAF will launch a 4.5-foot-long, golf  tee-shaped penetrator that will sink at least 1 1/2 feet into the comet,  measuring its strength, density, temperature and composition.  </P> <P> On its way to the comet, CRAF will fly by an asteroid named Hamburga. "Perhaps  we can get McDonald's to sponsor the mission," Neugebauer said. The craft will  survey the asteroid's size, shape and rotation and gather information about its  chemical composition.  </P> <P> The CRAF mission has not yet been approved by NASA. Its cost would be about the  same as Titan-Cassini.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT'S TOP LAWYER TO RETIRE  </P> <P> After serving for more than a quarter-century as Orange County government's top  lawyer, Adrian Kuyper is stepping down and recommending that his chief deputy  succeed him.  </P> <P> Kuyper, 62, who has worked in the county counsel's office for 34 years, said  Wednesday that "it might be time to move on."  </P> <P> Known as a conservative and thoughtful lawyer, Kuyper provided guidance to the  county Board of Supervisors during the most explosive period in Orange County  history. When he took over as county counsel in 1964, the county was largely  agricultural and few envisioned the real estate and population boom that would  transform it into a bustling urban area.  </P> <P> "It's been very interesting and exciting over the years," Kuyper said. "We've  seen a lot of problems and issues as a result of the growth and changing laws."  </P> <P> Kuyper will leave on March 22 and has recommended that the supervisors appoint  his chief assistant, William J. McCourt, to the post.  </P> <P> Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, the senior member of the Orange County board, said  he would miss Kuyper's advice.  </P> <P> "I have respected Adrian for his integrity, his professional excellence and his  conservatism," Riley said. "The county has certainly received outstanding  advice from him over the years."  </P> <P> Although Riley said it was too soon to settle on a replacement for Kuyper, he  added that McCourt has also impressed board members during his 25 years of  service.

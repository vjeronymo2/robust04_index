			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / International Company News: SAS profits recovery continues in third period The recovery at Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) continued in the third quarter, enabling the group to report pre-tax profits of SKr1.24bn (Dollars 170m) for the first nine months after a SKr1.13bn loss in the same 1993 period. The group, half-owned by the governments of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, benefited from cost-cutting, a lower debt burden and a positive trend in its core airline business. Disposal of non-core operations yielded SKr829m in capital gains. The airline was hit by SKr750m in restructuring costs and a higher aircraft depreciation charge after a change of accounting methods. Operating income fell slightly to SKr28.3bn from SKr29.2bn, but costs fell further to leave the group with an operating profit before depreciation of SKr2.56bn, compared with SKr1.82bn. The figures benefited from a 7 per cent currency-adjusted rise in traffic revenues and higher yields. The traffic increase was felt mainly on the company's European and intra-Scandinavian routes. The group's cost-cutting programme, involving the loss of 3,000 jobs, is also beginning to have an impact. The third factor in the airline's revival has been sharply reduced interest costs after cutting its net debt to SKr6.98bn from SKr13.89bn since the start of the year. The balance sheet has been strengthened by the disposal of SAS Leisure, a tour operator, SAS Service Partner, a catering unit, and Diners Club Nordic. These generated more than SKr3bn in cash flow. The third quarter brought a SKr624m pre-tax profit after last year's SKr520m loss. It was the airline's second consecutive quarter in the black and keeps it on course for its first full-year profit since 1989. During the past four years, it has made losses due to recession, fierce competition, heavy restructuring costs and currency losses.</p>

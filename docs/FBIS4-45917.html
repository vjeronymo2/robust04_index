			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa denied Tuesday [10 May] that Japan and the United  States concluded a secret agreement in 1969 under which the U.S.  can redeploy and transport nuclear weapons in Okinawa Prefecture  in case of emergency as was claimed in a soon-to-be published  book.    "Such a secret agreement does not exist as the government  has  been saying," Kakizawa told a press conference.    According to a book to be published Thursday, Japan and the  U.S. concluded the secret deal during summit talks between then  Prime Minister Eisaku Sato and President Richard Nixon in  November 1969.    The author of the book is Kei Wakaizumi, a former professor  of international politics at Kyoto Industrial University, who,  as Sato's special envoy, negotiated the reversion of Okinawa to  Japanese control with Henry Kissinger, Nixon's national security  affairs adviser.</p>

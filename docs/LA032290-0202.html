			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> LAW ON CANDIDACY IS NEARING REPEAL  </P> <P> The City Council has taken the first step toward repealing a 20-year-old  ordinance requiring members of city commissions to resign from those posts  before running for the City Council.  </P> <P> City Atty.  </P> <P> James L. Markman recommended that the ordinance be repealed.  </P> <P> "We feel the ordinance as it sits can not be enforced. It interferes with the  constitutional right to run for office," Markman said.  </P> <P> Under state law, the only restrictions that can be placed on candidates is that  they must be registered voters and live in the cities where they are running  for office, he said.  </P> <P> With city elections slated for November, the council decided to act  immediately. By a 4-1 vote the first reading to repeal the ordinance was  approved Monday night.  </P> <P> Councilman Don R. Griffin, who cast the dissenting vote, said that if the  ordinance is repealed there are several potential conflicts of interest. One  involves the City Council's ability to select the people who serve on the  various commissions.  </P> <P> "I don't want commission appointments to become a stepladder to use  politically. I think individuals need to go in with the least amount of ties so  they can represent all people," Griffin said.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Rhonda J. McCune, who stepped down from the Planning Commission  before taking her seat on the council, said she couldn't see the point of the  ordinance. If it were repealed, she said, more people might become candidates.  </P> <P> A final reading will be held at the next council meeting and, if passed, the  repeal will go into effect in 30 days.

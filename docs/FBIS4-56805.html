			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jesus Sanchez] </F>   [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chis. [Chiapas], 5 May -- Tense  and anxious cattle owners, tradesmen, and businessmen have asked  presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo to strive for a vigorous  legal recovery that will allow peace negotiations to end the  "painful path" that let impunity reign over justice.    Although the presidential candidate acknowledged that the  conflict "has placed injustice above justice," he praised the  resumption of the negotiations between the Zapatist National  Liberation Army (EZLN), whom he called for the first time by its  real name, and Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis.    Zedillo's proselytizing campaign in Chiapas was used to  support the gubernatorial candidate of the PRI [Institutional  Revolutionary Party], Eduardo Robledo Rincon. The security  surrounding the candidates was low-profile. They visited a  radio station in Tapachula and attended a rally along with  fellow PRI members. Later, he attended a feast at the  Montecarlos Room of the Flamboyant Hotel.    A communique signed by Manuel Camacho Solis and Bishop  Samuel  Ruiz was made public in San Cristobal de las Casas, which is  less than three hours from Tuxtla. The communique announced  that the negotiations will resume.    The cattle owners were expecting a strong response to their  demands. Alberto Marin, president of the Northern Zone Cattle  Owners Union, told reporters that cattle owners will hand  Ernesto Zedillo a document stating that nothing tangible has  been done so far to honor the commitments made during the 16 May  [as published] meeting with the Army chief to solve the problem  of 150,000 hectares in the municipalities of Altamirano,  Ocosingo, and Margaritas.    The cattle owner leader said: "Nothing has been done." He  added that economic losses in the region affected by the armed  conflict amount to 300 billion old pesos [currency as  published]. He added that it is still a delicate situation and  that 30 percent of the state's livestock owners are virtually  idle, a situation that sooner or later will prompt the import of  not only meat and milk but also corn. These comments flew from  one table to another as the meal in honor of Ernesto Zedillo was  being served. The cattle owners could barely taste the chicken  breast with vegetables that was being served.    The claims of those who are on the other side of the Chiapas  conflict were harsh. Gonzalo Lopez Camacho, president of the  Center Zone Cattle Owners Union, noted Zedillo's views on lack  of security and said that Chiapas cattle owners have travelled a  painful road full of offal, assaults, kidnappings, and  robberies. This situation requires agreements that, in addition  to reaching peace, "will fairly recognize the efforts made by  the state's productive sectors" to ensure the forces hampering  production will wane.    The cattle owners representative supported Eduardo Robledo's  candidacy. He said Robledo will reestablish the rights of the  Chiapas residents without controversies or violence. He  insisted, however, that the despoiling attempts against the  patrimony of many Chiapas residents are in the hands of  "intellectually deprived individuals who are currently hiding  behind impunity."    Francisco Gutierrez, leader of the National Association of  the Processing Industry, made a rough estimate of  underdevelopment in Chiapas, to which he added the expectations  of movements that sow division and violence. He strongly  criticized the federal government for its mismanagement of the  state developmental process and insisted industrialists need  security for their families and assets.    Tradesmen leader Walter Leon said they are tired of hearing  promises and are no longer willing to live with the dream that  Chiapas residents are potentially rich although they live poorly.    The Chiapas production sectors waited until Zedillo spoke.  They showed no sign of being overwhelmingly jubilant. He said:  "I know that the conflict has unfortunately piled injustice upon  injustice. I hope tolerance, dialogue, and reconciliation will  prevail to ensure that the final results of the negotiations  will fairly meet legitimate demands. The agreements must also  be fair to ensure that those who obey the laws, but whose  personal lineage and patrimonial integrity have been affected,  will be respected."    Zedillo then talked about the upcoming resumption of the  peace negotiations and pointed out that the institutions have  shown determination to reach an agreement to enjoy a lasting  peace once again. He added: "As a candidate today and as  president tomorrow, I am determined to honor all the commitments  that our patriotic President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will make  in the name of peace."    Very early in Tapachula and through the XEKQ radio station,  Ernesto Zedillo sent a message to the EZLN and said: "We want  peace to be signed and will honor the commitments made during  the process to ensure that Chiapas residents and all Mexicans  will learn that peace is the road to follow."    Some observers who are closely following the Zedillo  campaign  said he sounded different from the PRI candidate because he was  heard through the local sound system sometimes saying "Shapas"  and "Shapas residents." Perhaps, there was something wrong with  the sound system. The PRI ceremony had a second meaning in  Tapachula: to see Zedillo supporting Eduardo Robledo.    Amid rattling noises and cheerful slogans such as "You are  on  the right track, Zedillo; you are on the right track," Chiapas  PRI President Gerardo Pensamiento delivered a speech different  from those he usually makes. At the beginning of the speech, he  said: "You are among Chiapas friends, who are asking you not to  make more commitments; we are merely asking you for what we have  already been promised but which have never been honored."    At the Tapachulas Country Club, the delivery of caps and  t-shirts commanded the attention of the attendees for a long  time. Security agents drove reporters away. When ordered to,  two agents virtually flew to the dais to switch the microphones  that Zedillo would use.    Igor [not further identified] led a horde of reporters who  wanted to make sure they would have access to the pro-Zedillo  ceremony, but a Staff agent stopped him and they verbally abused  each other. Those Tapachula residents who witnessed the  incident said: "If this is what they do to the media, what will  they do to us?"    Zedillo and Robledo embraced, and their followers filled the  square. Robledo stressed that Chiapas demands a political  proposal that will not blame anyone or seek revenge. He said:  "I came here to defend those colors that have already been  whitened; the colors of personal resentment are among them."</p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Ciga plans capital write-down The board of Ciga, the heavily-indebted Italian-based luxury hotel group, said yesterday it would propose to shareholders that the company's nominal share capital be cut to L91.72bn (Dollars 54.08m) from L185.25bn. Ciga is the subject of competing bids from Forte, the UK hotels and restaurant groups, and Host Marriott of the US. The capital write-down for the hotels group, which lost L195.43bn last year, would be carried out by reducing the nominal share value to L379 from the present L1,000. Shareholders will be issued with 30 new ordinary shares for every 79 ordinary shares currently held. The board said an extraordinary shareholders meeting would also have to approve a capital increase of around L1,100bn to cover net debt. It said, however, that the conditions of the capital rise could not be set until creditor banks had reached agreement on a rescue plan. Host Marriott last month suspended negotiations with Ciga because it said it had not been given sufficient information about the Forte bid. It said yesterday these issues had now been resolved and added: 'We are still very much interested in acquiring the hotel chain.' Forte said earlier this month it was discussing a joint bid for Ciga with Mr George Soros, the international financier. Forte said it had joined with Mr Soros's Quantum Fund to make a revised offer to Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank overseeing the restructuring of the chain. Forte's original agreement with Mediobanca, concluded last year, would have led to it paying Pounds 33m (Dollars 49.2m) in cash and putting some of its hotels, worth Pounds 125m, into an operating company in which it would have had a majority interest.</p>

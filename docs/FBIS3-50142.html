			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Skopje, 24 Jan (TANJUG) -- At its session today the  government of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia passed a  law on denationalization, which is applicable to all property  seized by the state without compensation between 2 August 1944  and 15 February 1968, it was announced in Skopje this evening.  Implementation of the law will mean the return of property to  the previous owners, which will take a long time, the Macedonian  Government says. Among those dispossessed of their property are  large numbers of the Serbian nationality, who were expelled from  Macedonia in 1941 by the Bulgarian aggressor, and Josip Broz's  [Tito's] regime banned their return to their homes. Most of the  owners and their heirs are now citizens of the Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia, and a number of them also live abroad.</p>

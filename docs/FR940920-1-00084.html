			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For a small existing MWC plant (135 Mg/day capacity), table 3A shows a capital cost for retrofit of about $2.6 million of which $2.5 million would be for the acid gas control system and the remaining for activated carbon injection and GCP. On an annualized basis, the cost would be about $770,000/yr or about $17/Mg of waste combusted. This would increase baseline combustor cost from about $61/Mg combusted (based on the baseline combustor cost for a new small MWC plant presented in table 3B) to about $78/Mg combusted. Small MWC plants represent about 6 percent of the existing MWC combustion capacity.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Rationale for the Proposed Guidelines for MWC Emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section addresses the legal, technical, and economic basis for the proposed emission guidelines. The basis for regulating MWC's, for regulating the specified pollutants, and for regulating MWC's according to the specified size categories are discussed. The section also presents the EPA's approach in establishing the MACT floor and selecting MACT. Additionally, the section discusses the selected format of the proposed guidelines, the proposed performance testing and monitoring requirements, and the proposed reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On November 15, 1990, the Act was amended. The Act of 1990 includes a new section 129 that applies to a range of solid waste incinerators including MWC's, medical waste incinerators (MWI's), infectious waste incinerators, and industrial waste incinerators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under authority of sections 111 and 129 of the Act of 1990, the EPA was directed to promulgate MACT-based guidelines for MWC's. However, section 129 also includes a clause directing the EPA to issue emission guidelines based on BDT under the terms imposed in the consent decree issued from  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> State of New York et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reilly <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (No. 89&hyph;1729 D.D.C.), but limiting applicability of those emission guidelines to MWC's with unit capacities greater than 225 Mg/day. Emission guidelines that were signed by the Administrator on January 11, 1991 and published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on February 11, 1991 (56 FR 5514) complied with this component of the section 129 requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the MACT-based guidelines, section 129 directs the EPA to promulgate MACT-based guidelines for MWC units located at plants with capacities greater than 225 Mg/day and at plants with capacities less than 225 Mg/day. The MACT-based guidelines are to include numerical emission limits for Cd, Pb, Hg, and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and are to address operator training requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's proposal complies with all requirements of section 129 described above. This has been done by: (1) Proposing MACT-based guidelines that cover MWC units at plants with capacities above 35 Mg/day; (2) proposing numerical emission limits for Cd, Pb, Hg, and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ; (3) proposing operator training requirements; and (4) proposing opacity limits for air curtain incinerators firing specific ``clean'' fuels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The subpart Eb NSPS that is proposed in a separate notice in today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  would apply to new facilities constructed after September 20, 1994. However, the February 11, 1991 subpart Ea NSPS will remain in effect. Therefore, those existing facilities subject to the February 11, 1991 NSPS that were constructed on or prior to September 20, 1994 would be subject to both the subpart Ea NSPS and the proposed subpart Cb emission guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

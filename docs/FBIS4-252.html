			<p>BFN     [Text] Nigeria has appealed to the United States to lift  the ban preventing Nigerian officials from traveling to that  country. Nigeria's ambassador to the U.S., Alhaji Zubeiru Mahmud  Kazaure, made the appeal in Los Angeles in a television program  on Africa. Ambassador Zubeiru Kazaure said the ban by President  Clinton had made the collection of visas very difficult for  Nigerians traveling to that country. He said the United States  should have allowed Nigerian leaders to intimate her with their  programs instead of taking a hasty action. Ambassador Kazaure  also expressed concern on the way and manner Nigerians were  being maltreated in that country. He said the U.S. should rather  commend Nigerians, who provide employment for others and those  employed in American organizations, instead of harassing them  unduly.</p>

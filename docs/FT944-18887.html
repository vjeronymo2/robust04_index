			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Clinton affirms stance on Adams Mr Bill Clinton, the US president, has no plans to meet Mr Gerry Adams, US officials repeated yesterday in the face of the Sinn Fein president's continued campaign for a White House meeting. 'He will meet with officials from the State Department and White House at the working level, but not here,' said Ms Dee Dee Myers, Mr Clinton's press secretary. Mr Adams visits Washington on Monday and Tuesday. It is thought that final decisions on who will meet him were taken yesterday. On his two-week tour of the US, Mr Adams has been campaigning steadily to have his reception upgraded. This week, Mr Rudolph Giuliani, mayor of New York, welcomed him as a 'harbinger of peace'. He added: 'I think President Clinton should greet him.' But the Clinton administration is sticking to its promise to the British government that Mr Adams would not be received at the White House.</p>

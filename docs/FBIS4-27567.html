			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Mun Chae-chol from Washington] </F>   [Text] North Korea hinted that it would withdraw from the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty if the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] officially declares that the possibility of  the further measurement of fuel rods is dissipated, or the UN  Security Council takes steps to impose sanctions on North Korea.    A high-level official of the North Korean Mission to the  United Nations, in quoting the statement by the North Korean  Foreign Ministry, said that if some circles of the IAEA declare  that the possibility for the further measurement of the nuclear  fuel rods has dissipated technically, or the UN Security Council  pressures North Korea by imposing sanctions, North Korea will  take a decisive step to deal with them, rather than suffer from  their unreasonable steps. Therefore, he hinted at the  possibility that North Korea would withdraw from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty.    Also, he admitted that North Korea accelerated the speed of  the work to replace the nuclear fuel rods some time ago in order  to test the maximum efficiency of the machine that carries out  the work.</p>

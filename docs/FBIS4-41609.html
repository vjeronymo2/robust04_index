			<p>BFN     [Text] The European Union [EU] summit is opening on the  Greek island of Corfu on 24th June. Georgian head of state  Eduard Shevardnadze has sent letters to the heads of 12 EU  states and to European Commission chairman Jacques Delors.    The Georgian head of state reviewed the difficult economic  situation in Georgia and dramatic aftermath of the Abkhazian  conflict that has had an adverse effect on current affairs.  Apart from that, the letters point out what is thought to be  impeding the establishment of democracy and market economy in  the former Soviet republics. And finally, the letters call for  the heads of state to support a request that the EU grant aid to  Georgia in the face of a difficult winter expected in the  country due to insufficient stocks of fuel and bread.    Mr. Shevardnadze has indicated that a strategy to provide  new  independent states with economic assistance should be devised.  This is essential for strengthening democracy and creating  market economy in these countries, this being of major  importance for stability worldwide.</p>

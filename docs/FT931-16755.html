			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Letter: Peso reform cosmetic Sir, In a short account of Mexican currency reform ('Mexico slims peso', December 31) you illustrate the change by pointing out, first, that a meal for four in a top Mexican restaurant will no longer cost 1m old pesos, but will cost 'just' 1,000 pesos; and 'alternatively' that the minimum daily wage will be a 'mere' 12 pesos. Such cosmetic change will not alter this shocking ratio, viz that individuals in Mexico spend on a single meal more than 20 times the daily minimum wage - which often supports as many as six people. If such a family on the minimum wage eats twice a day, and spends 70 per cent of its income on food, then each person's meal will at most cost 0.3 per cent (three thousandths) of the price of the meal of each person at the top restaurant. Unfortunately, it is not just the peso which is being slimmed, but also the many millions in Mexico surviving on the minimum wage or less. The 1980s saw 'liberal' pro-market policies adopted in Mexico, in which wages were deliberately reduced so as to release resources to repay debts and increase profits. The data you quote is the result. Frances Stewart, International Development Centre, Queen Elizabeth House, University of Oxford</p>

			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Books: A comic eye on decaying mortality - Max Loppert reviews a novel where humour masks a serious purpose / Autumn Fiction SERENITY HOUSE by Christopher Hope Macmillan Pounds 14.99, 227 pages CHRISTOPHER Hope's latest novel, shortlisted this week for the 1992 Booker prize, renews and develops his singular comic vision. In it, he mixes a potent, comically intoxicating brew of the surreal, the farcical and the socially and politically satirical, exactly as he did in A Separate Development, Kruger's Alp and The Hottentot Room, those exuberant, free-spirited South African farces pivoted upon the madness of apartheid. The difference, now, is that in Serenity House the scene has shifted to the outside world; this writer's precious gift for perceiving and exposing in so-called normality a crazily- patterned patchwork of violent obsession and zany ritual has now found expression on a wider canvas. (In My Chocolate Redeemer - Hope's fourth novel, and his first non-South African in subject matter - the attempt to do just this had proved curiously loose in subject-focus and uncertain in style; but as no such disappointments mar the manifold pleasures of its successor, perhaps that is to be understood as no more than a necessary dry run, and to be excused as such). Here, the comic targets are joyously unclouded and cleanly hit. The book's title is itself an impudent in-joke; for Serenity House is actually a down-at-heel north London 'eventide refuge' run by a bizarre collection of wardens, matrons, therapists and doctors, all purveying a distinctive argot steeped in moral uplift and euphemistic slogan. ('Leaving' for 'dying,' for instance). The inmates include the Five Incontinents, with their trail of catheters and armoury of protective padding; Lady Divina, a dilapidated blue-blood occasionally roused from senile torpor to rage against the holes in the ozone layer; and sundry other avatars of fast-advancing physical decrepitude. The fun - so blackly hilarious because it is so lightly and deftly plotted - that Hope has with the desperation and self-absorption of decaying mortality, the nursing spectacle and medical paraphernalia that accompany it, and the patronising doublespeak of those who minister to it, earn Serenity House a place alongside Muriel Spark's Memento Mori and Kingsley Amis's Ending Up in the literature of frankly observed old age. The leading inmate, Max Montfalcon, has come to the home guarding a grisly secret; the process of its unravelling will also drag Serenity House to its downfall. A walking repository of royalist sympathies and grammatical stringency (he takes Fowler to breakfast), as well as the knight-protector of a wardrobe-full of grotesque hidden treasure, he is gradually unmasked as Maximilian von Falkenberg, a Nazi scientist responsible for horrible experiments on concentration camp inmates and in mass-murder methodology in the final phase of the Holocaust. Montfalcon's daughter, living the life of an upper middle-class English rose, is married to a braying Tory MP who has already played a notable role in promoting the bill for the prosecution of elderly war criminals  - a device which allows the comedy of discovery to be unfolded in uproarious broad strokes. But simultaneously with the investigation of Montfalcon's shady past, a grander set of narrative parallels is being proposed and explored. Under its facade of do-goodery, the Serenity House administration has been quietly following a programme of unlicensed euthanasia (involving such modes of swift despatch as the Water Cure, another relishable euphemism). After a while, one discerns that Hope's underlying purpose is to throw up for examination notions of people-disposal - whether of a society's inconveniently long-lasting old people or, in extremis, of its unwanted minorities - and to compare and contrast the situations in which such an a option can ever come to be taken seriously. As in his South African novels, so here again it is the crispness of wit, the keenness of observation, and the gravity-defying ability to link apparent opposites that render the vision at once so bright and so alarming. A key tool of linkage enters the story with the arrival from Florida - after all, one of the world's most populous senior-citizen habitats - of the illiterate, violent, video-addicted teenager Jack Robinson, brought to London to pursue the tenuous links that connect him with Max's Nazi past. With typical Hope legerdemain, this Jack-in-the-Beanstalk sub-theme is teased out to its fulfilment, and the novel to its dizzying comic climax, in one of the turrets of a fairy-tale castle at the Orlando Disneyland. Earlier, one has occasionally been given cause to observe that the author's ear for American speech tones, and his eye for the nuances of American class distinction and social manners, are a degree less finely honed than their English equivalents. But this is, anyhow, a small point to weigh in the balance of so rare and distinctive an achievement. Serenity House is a surreal farce rigorously logical according to its own terms of reference, scabrously enjoyable, and motivated by a sense of the 'real world' that is always profoundly and exhilaratingly sane.</p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC agrees preliminary meat deal with US THE EC yesterday reached preliminary agreement with the US over Brussels' ban on American meat coming into the Community, European Commission officials said yesterday. This appears to defuse a row that has been raging since 1983, which culminated in total bans on pigmeat imports from October 31 last year, and on beef from the start of this year. Washington began action against the EC within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in January, but had delayed a formal disputes procedure pending negotiations. EC veterinary experts say hygiene is deficient in US abbatoirs, with insufficient post-mortem inspections and a high incidence of trichina worms in pigs. US exports to the EC dropped in the period 1980-90 from 76,000 tonnes to 4,500 tonnes of beef, and from 44,000 to 11,000 tonnes of pigmeat. Last year's total ban affected Dollars 13.5m of US prime beef and Dollars 100m of pork and pork offal. Following meetings in Washington between Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, and Mr Ed Madigan, US secretary for agriculture, Community vets will reinspect US abbatoirs next month. 'They will have to meet certain minimum criteria which we will insist on,' a spokesman for Mr MacSharry stressed. But he expected that many would be relicensed, and that broader agreement on mutual recognition of hygiene standards would be reached. Agreement in a separate dispute over trichinosis in US horsemeat also looked likely, the official added.</p>

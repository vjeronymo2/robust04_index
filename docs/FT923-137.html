			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Bank manager emerges with credit - Conference Notebook THIS has been a good week in Blackpool for Mr John Smith. But then, neither he nor his party has yet left the foothills beneath the mountain to be climbed before the next election. His first speech to the party conference yesterday had none of the rhetorical flourishes of his predecessor. It was worthy and uninspiring, a statement of the values that underpin Scottish socialism rather than a call to arms. It was too long but timed for the moment. The message ran as follows: Mr John Major was floundering in a crisis of his own making; Mr Smith would maximise his discomfort. But he would be calm and consistent in formulating his alternatives. In the flat delivery and in the uncontroversial content there was an admission that, like the prime minister, Mr Smith is from the bank managers' school of politics. The important difference was that his newly opened branch would not go bust. Consistency is the favourite word of those closest to the new Labour leader. He was appropriately generous in his tributes yesterday to Mr Neil Kinnock. But his friends saw no contradiction in emphasising that his Europeanism and his preference for a mixed over a command economy were grounded in long-held conviction. There were none of the belated conversions that made Mr Kinnock such an easy target. With a cynicism explicable only in a party that has lost four successive elections, one or two took the comparison further. Mrs Margaret Thatcher had won the trust of the electorate because she was unshakable in her core beliefs. Mr Smith would prove himself equally resolute. By contrast, recent events had shown Mr Major as a leader of straw whose course would be mapped out by events. Just like poor Mr Kinnock. Mr Smith does not have to rely on fanciful parallels to feel content. The National Executive election results more than compensated for the awkward headlines generated by Mr Bryan Gould's abrupt departure from the shadow cabinet over Europe. Mr Gould left the NEC alongside the unreconstructable Mr Dennis Skinner. In their place are Mr Smith's acolytes Messrs Gordon Brown and Tony Blair. He now has unprecedented power bases spanning the shadow cabinet and the NEC. His grip will be further tightened by the creation of a new joint committee charged with all initial policymaking. Within two or three years the party's awkward squads may discover that they are powerless to embarrass the leadership by forcing it to accept new commitments from the floor of conference. The proposed concentration of power has slipped by unnoticed in Blackpool. Unsure whether to celebrate the crisis in Mr Major's government or to mourn the April election result, delegates have opted for respectful compliance. Mr Smith has taken full advantage. An overwhelming endorsement of his instinctive Europeanism and the comfortable defeat of calls for new commitments to the welfare state or to economic interventionism have left him free to redraw Labour's policies in his own image. Yet for all that, it is impossible to miss the uncomfortable atmosphere of uncertainty that creeps into any conversation on whether Mr Smith can win rather than wound. What should have been the most important debate of the week - the post-mortem on the party's defeat - was a deliberately cursory affair sandwiched between the debates on Europe and the economy. A few desultory exchanges saw the ritual criticism of the tabloid press, some soul-searching about the triumphalism of the party's Sheffield rally, and a few words about the need to reassure women voters. No one, least of all Mr Smith, has been ready to debate the fundamental reasons why Labour lost. Its image as the party of the downwardly mobile and the voters' mistrust of its economic and tax policies have been brushed to one side. So, too, have the profound implications of the electorate's perception that the Conservatives are now the party of opportunity. Nor does the Labour leadership seem willing or able to confront the conflict between its formal links with the producers in the trades unions and a recognition that it must restyle itself as the champion of the consumer. The blue-suited trades unionists who delivered their block votes to Mr Smith this week look like men confident they will keep a grip on the levers of the power. Mr John Edmonds of the GMB has been curtly dismissive of talk of changing the relationship between Labour and its paymasters. Mr Edmonds and his colleagues will accept reform but not divorce or separation. Mr Smith seems disinclined to press them. The new leader may yet surprise us. Those close to him insist that consistency does not exclude radicalism. There will be policies to go with the values. But he cannot afford to spend too long in the foothills.</p>

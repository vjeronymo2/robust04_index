			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Volodymyr Skachko report: "Everything Will Have To Be </F> Proved"]    [Text] In accordance with the data of the sociological  opinion poll involving 1,200 persons that was conducted on 29  March-7 April by the "Democratic Initiative" Center in various  regions of Ukraine, just 10 percent of the respondents stated  that they would not vote at the repeat elections, 8 percent did  not make a final decision, 33 percent did not know for sure for  whom they would vote, and 42 percent knew precisely for whom  they would vote.    Just 28 percent of respondents were pleased with the  candidates' speeches prior to the elections, 24 percent were  disappointed, 22 percent remained indifferent to the calls of  the candidates, and 26 percent did not have an idea about the  candidates' speeches.    Of all the respondents, 63 percent were convinced that their  participation in the elections would somehow influence Ukraine's  future and 37 percent were convinced that the elections would  not change anything.    Only 35 percent of the respondents believed that those  candidates, who passed the first round, are worthy of being  Supreme Council deputies, and therefore, in the opinion of the  respondents, those who have been elected will have to prove that  they are not accidental people in politics.</p>

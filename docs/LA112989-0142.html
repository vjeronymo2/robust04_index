			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER;  </P> <P> ANIMAL SLAUGHTER IN PUBLIC PROHIBITED  </P> <P> An ordinance that prohibits the slaughtering of animals in public was adopted  by the City Council unanimously Tuesday night.  </P> <P> The ordinance was introduced in response to a citizen's complaint about a  neighbor seen killing a duck in view of several children during the summer,  said Councilman Frank Fry Jr.  </P> <P> The ordinance, which goes into effect in 30 days, is intended to prevent, for  example, the slaughtering of poultry where the public might see it.  </P> <P> "This doesn't make it illegal to kill a chicken," said Councilwoman Anita  Huseth. "It just means you have to kill it in your garage instead of your back  yard." The rule exempts commercial slaughtering buildings or buildings with  interiors not visible to the public.  </P></p>

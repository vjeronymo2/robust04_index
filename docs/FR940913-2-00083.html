			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion for a Default Judgment and Entry of Sanctions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 --> Date: August 18, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> Case No. 94&hyph;OFC&hyph;14 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> In the Matter of: United States Department of Labor, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, Plaintiff v. KRT Drywall/Acoustical, Defendant. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It appears that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Plaintiff U.S. Department of Labor filed the complaint herein on July 13, 1994 pursuant to the expedited hearing procedures set forth in 41 CFR 60&hyph;30.31  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A copy of the complaint is attached hereto and is incorporated herein by this reference. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The complaint and Plaintiff's Request for Admissions were served on Defendant KRT Drywall/Acoustical by Federal Express and were received by KRT on July 13, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. KRT did not file an answer, nor has it requested an extension of time within which to file an answer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. On August 9, 1994 Plaintiff filed a ``Motion for Default Judgment and Entry of Sanctions'' on the grounds that Defendant failed to file an answer or request an extension of time within 20 days after service of the complaint as required by 41 CFR 60&hyph;30.6(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. On August 10, 1994 Defendant filed an ``Objection to Plaintiff's Motion For a Default Judgment and Entry of Sanctions'' requesting a denial of the Plaintiff's default motion on the grounds that the complaint ``may have been misplaced,'' and that therefore entry of default ``will work an injustice upon KRT.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. On August 15, 1994 Plaintiff filed its response to Defendant's objection contending that the provisions of 41 CFR 60.32(c) are mandatory. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 41 CFR 60.30.32(c) provides that if a hearing is not requested within 25 days of the filing of the complaint, the allegations of the complaint shall be adopted as findings, and the sanctions and/or penalties sought in the complaint shall be imposed. It appears that the above provisions of 41 CFR 60.30.32(c) are mandatory and not discretionary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since Defendant has neither filed an answer nor asked for an extension of time within which to answer, and has to date not requested a hearing in any other way, Plaintiff's Motion for Default is granted and Plaintiff's Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, which are attached and incorporated herein by this reference, are adopted as the findings herein. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is therefore ordered that all of KRT's Federal contracts and subcontracts are immediately canceled; and that KRT or Construction Associates, its officers, agents, subsidiaries, and successors (including Construction Associates), are declared ineligible to receive any Government contracts or subcontracts or for extensions or other modifications of any existing Government contracts or subcontracts, for a period of at least 210 days, and thereafter until KRT has demonstrated to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Federal Contract Compliance Programs that it is currently in compliance with the provisions of the Executive Orders No. 11246, 11375 and 12086 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and that it has undertaken to correct past acts of noncompliance, including identifying and making whole any victims of its past noncompliance, and that it will carry out employment practices in compliance with the Executive Orders No. 11246, 11375 and 12086. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Alexander Karst, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative Law Judge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> San Francisco, CA. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

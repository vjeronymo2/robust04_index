			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / EU Summit: EU Rottweiler both petted and panned - Summiteers at odds over Ecofin council's role If there is one question unresolved following the Brussels summit, it is the strange case of the European finance ministers' split personality. As a result, finance ministers return to Brussels today to discuss the technicalities of carrying forward the ambitious growth plans agreed by their political masters on Saturday, not quite sure whether they are the angels or the devils of the new European Union. The answer probably depends on your point of view. At one extreme, there is Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president. In an animated contribution to Saturday's post-summit press conference, he condemned the finance ministers as both arrogant and ignorant on the subject of funding for new cross-border infrastructure projects. 'Ignorance doesn't prevent you from getting on as a politician, but sometimes if you know what you're talking about it is quite useful,' he told journalists. At the other end of the scale is Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and an enthusiast for a powerful Ecofin council. On Friday, he railed against the Belgian presidency's decision to exclude the finance ministers from the leaders' discussion of EU growth plans, claiming it was like preventing the 'resident physician' from helping to analyse the patient's fever. On Saturday, Mr Major went further. Many heads of government, he said, had reacted to the approach of the finance ministers by 'holding up a clove of garlic and shouting 'unclean'' to keep them away from the building. Mr Major probably had in mind the attitude of President Francois Mitterrand, who told fellow leaders on Friday that sending the detail of Mr Delors' growth plans back to finance ministers would be the same as burying them. In fact, the Ecofin council has already built up something of a reputation as the Rottweiler of the Union's many ministerial groups. To governments which want to defend themselves against unpalatable extra expenditure or fiscal measures it is a useful guard-dog, but to other governments, the Commission, and even ministers in other councils, it can be a dangerous nuisance with a tendency to savage their pet ideas. In June, for example, the Ecofin council effectively shelved the idea of a European energy tax, in spite of earlier agreement between energy and environment ministers on the principle. During the Belgian presidency, the ministers have found themselves at loggerheads with the Commission over its white paper on growth, competitiveness and employment, and proposals for legally binding macro-economic guidelines. Finance ministers have also been condemned by Mr Delors for their sluggishness in enacting EU leaders' promises on a European growth initiative at the Edinburgh and Copenhagen summits. The bone of contention at the Brussels summit was Mr Delors' suggestion that the EU should find some Ecu8bn (Pounds 6.1bn) of extra financing each year to back big infrastructure projects in energy, transport and telecommunications, possibly by issuing 'Union bonds'. After the meeting, Mr Major and Mr Kenneth Clarke, his chancellor of the exchequer, said this idea had been thrown out by leaders. But, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister who chaired the meeting, said 'all the options were open, including the possibility of Union bonds'. For Mr Dehaene and Mr Delors it was more important that leaders had backed the principle of an action plan, including infrastructure investment, and measures to improve employment opportunities. However, when pressed on the funding question, Mr Delors was crushing about some finance ministers' claim that the European Union or the old European Community had rarely, if ever, borrowed money on such a scale. 'The finance ministers were very arrogant about this, but if I'd asked how much the Community had borrowed this year, they would have got nought out of 20,' he said. In 1993, he pointed out, the Union had borrowed Ecu6bn and been named 'borrower of the year'; in 1979, the member states won a facility to borrow Ecu7bn which was lent on to companies; in 1975, Ecu6bn was borrowed to cope with the oil crisis. Nonetheless, it is finance ministers who will bear the brunt of the follow-up work on trans-European networks, the growth initiative and further financing. According to the summit communique, finance ministers are expected to finalise the text on macro-economic guidelines today and report back annually on its implementation. They must also adopt a system of interest-rate subsidies for small and medium-sized companies before the end of the year; assist the Commission in implementing infrastructure programmes 'efficiently, consistently and as soon as possible'; and study, together with the European Investment Bank and the Commission, how to mobilise that additional Ecu8bn a year for investors in networks. Whether or not the ministers do their homework, it seems that the Ecofin council is indispensable.</p>

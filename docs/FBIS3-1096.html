Consultations in Cairo among the Somali factions  representing  the Salvation Alliance were held at the invitation of Egypt,  which currently chairs the OAU. Commenting on that, interim  President Ali Mahdi Mohamed, who lived in Cairo in 1960 as a  researcher at the Malaria Institute, said: President Mubarak's  invitation to us reflected the strong fraternal relations and  the historic ties that link our countries.    In an exclusive interview with AL-AHRAM, Mahdi said that the  Somali people are eager to see peace prevail in their country.  This desire was enhanced with the arrival of international  forces. Mahdi warned against overoptimism, in view of another  development that calls for concern; namely, the withdrawal of a  considerable part of the international forces by the end of this  month before all factions are disarmed, the establishment of  state institutions is completed, the police force is  reorganized, and peace is restored. This constitutes a threat  because fighting might resume after the forces withdraw, he said.    Speaking about the obstacles hindering reconciliation, Mahdi  said: Although we reached an agreement in Addis Ababa last  March, a small group is working to separate the northern part of  Somalia. Mahdi denied that Aidid is in control of a wide area of  Somalia. He pointed out that the image of Aidid drawn in the  media is not true and distorts the facts. He explained that  Somalia has 18 regions, 16 of which are under the control of the  12 factions of the Salvation Alliance, while two regions are  controlled by the National Movement in the north.    Asked whether there is dialogue between the 12 factions and  the National Movement in the north, Mahdi said: There is no  official contact between us, but there are personal contacts  with figures from the north. We hope the situation will develop  in the future into an expanded Somali dialogue, he said.    Mahdi was asked about the agreement reached in Cairo between  the factions and the prospects for its success in the absence of  Aidid, who was invited to the meeting but failed to attend. He  said: We are eager to meet with him to solve the problem. We  have not ignored him; we will invite him to take part in  implementing the agreement.    Mahdi believes that several parties are encouraging Aidid to  take negative stands and they provide him with what he needs to  maintain the present situation. Mahdi, however, refrained to  name these parties.    On the reason for and significance of Aidid's presence  outside Somalia and the acceptance of Aliyow, one of the leaders  of the factions allied with Aidid, of Egypt's invitation to  attend and participate in the Somali discussions, Mahdi said:  Aidid took part in the political consultations that took place  in Addis Ababa last March. Ever since then, he has been  traveling on tours outside the country. As regards Aliyow, he  came here in response to Egypt's invitation. His presence here  manifests the differences in viewpoint with Aidid, who is allied  with two other factions. The total number of Somali factions is  15.    On Aidid's earlier comments that the Somali factions were  about to reach agreement had Egypt not intervened, Mahdi said:  Egypt invited us all without distinction. What Egypt is doing  does not target any specific party and does not give or withhold  privileges to any. All the rumors Aidid is spreading against  Egypt are not true.    As regards differences between the group of 12 that  constitute the Salvation Alliance, Mahdi said: I confirm that  there are no differences among the 12 factions and that all  reports about divisions are not true. We have defined a  specific and united policy and a fixed defense, which will grow  from whatever conclusions we reach through our democratic  discussions.    On Aidid's accusation that the United Nations is the reason  behind the suffering in Somalia, Mahdi said: It is unfortunate  for us to hear accusations, which are not in line with the true  interests of our people, leveled against the role of the United  Nations. The truth is very different. The United Nations  intervened at a time when our people were going through a very  bad crises. The average daily number of deaths was about 2,000.  Chaos prevailed everywhere. These problems were eliminated, and  stability and peace were restored. He added: We should not  forget that the role of the United Nations contributed toward  constructing administrative institutions in various regions of  Somalia. Had the United Nations not intervened, the catastrophe  would have been much greater. On the role of the forces  remaining in Somalia after the end of the current month, the  number of which will be 22,000, Mahdi said: Actually, we are  not satisfied with the new duties specified for these forces in  accordance with the Security Council resolution. The resolution  stipulates that these forces should stay in their barracks,  maintain public facilities such as airports and ports, and  protect aid convoys, without actually participating in  disarmament operations, spreading public security, and  contributing toward reconciliation. We deduce from this that  the role of international forces in Somalia will shrink.</p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORMER UCLA BASKETBALL PLAYER HEARS PRAISE, THEN 9-YEAR PRISON SENTENCE  </P> <P> Former UCLA center Darrell Allums heard the kind of testimonials Friday that he  once must have dreamed would come at the end of a long and successful  basketball career, and not just before he was sent to prison.  </P> <P> Allums, who played on a team that finished second in the 1980 NCAA basketball  championships, listened intently Friday as a stream of supporters sang his  praises on the witness stand in Torrance Superior Court.  </P> <P> First UCLA basketball Coach Jim Harrick, an assistant coach in Allums' days on  campus, called the former Bruin center "a young man prepared to contribute to  society." Then former teammate and current UCLA assistant coach Brad Holland  described the 6-foot, 9-inch Allums as a player who always rose to the occasion  in big games. Finally, there were emotional comments from his mother, who  called Allums a "loving and giving person."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 9-Year Sentence  </P> <P> Tributes aside, Judge William R. Hollingsworth sentenced Allums to nine years  in state prison for robbing eight Domino's Pizza deliverymen. He faces two  additional years in prison if he is convicted of possession of cocaine when he  returns to court for a separate trial June 22.  </P> <P> Allums, 30, has served nearly two years in Los Angeles County Jail since his  arrest June 22, 1987. If he continues to earn credits for good behavior and  prison work, he could be released from state prison in three years.  </P> <P> Hollingsworth said he sympathized with Allums -- who admitted committing the  robberies to pay for a runaway cocaine habit -- but that he was bound by state  law to punish the former player for the string of armed robberies in 1987.  </P> <P> The judge compared Allums to former University of Maryland basketball star Len  Bias, who died of a cocaine overdose. "I am convinced that, but for drugs, Mr.  Allums never would have been here," Hollingsworth said.  </P> <P> Allums appeared glum, looking down at his feet, as the judge denied his  lawyer's attempts to send him to a drug rehabilitation center.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Robberies Admitted  </P> <P> Moments before, Allums had admitted for the first time that he committed the  robberies. "It was a situation where I had no control over it," Allums said. "I  never intended to hurt anyone. It was just a means to get money to get drugs. .  . . I was out of control."  </P> <P> Authorities said that 14 times in April and June of 1987, Allums called the  pizza chain's outlets, usually in the South Bay, and ordered small pizzas and  six-packs of soda. But when deliverymen visited the addresses they found no one  at home and were confronted instead by Allums, who usually wielded a  screwdriver, Deputy Dist. Atty. Julie Sulman said. Allums usually took the  sodas and cash, ranging from $20 to more than $100, and ran off, leaving the  pizzas behind.  </P> <P> A jury convicted Allums in March of committing eight of the robberies, and the  remaining six charges were dropped when that same jury could not reach a  verdict.  </P> <P> Allums said in an 11-page handwritten letter to the judge that he began  experimenting with drugs in high school but that his downfall began after two  short stints in professional basketball -- the first with the Dallas Mavericks  and the second with a pro team in the Philippines.  </P> <P> "I was introduced to free-base cocaine," Allums wrote. "That was the worst  mistake I ever made in my life. . . . It would later be my destruction."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Injury Ended Career  </P> <P> Allums said he dropped drugs for a time when he took a job with a team in  Switzerland. But a knee injury ended his basketball career and he returned to  the United States, plunging deeper into cocaine addiction, he said.  </P></p>

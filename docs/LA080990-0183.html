			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> COUNCIL OKS RISE IN CONSTRUCTION FEES  </P> <P> Over the objections of two of its most fiscally conservative members, the City  Council this week voted to increase an assortment of building and planning  processing fees and establish nine new charges.  </P> <P> Council members voted 3 to 2 in favor of the new charges, which will take  effect next month as an interim step toward reshaping a city fee schedule that  officials say is outdated.  </P> <P> The most significant change in the new fee schedule, which affects minor home  renovations as well as the construction of housing tracts, is an added planning  processing fee for any new construction or renovation. The new fee will tack on  a charge equivalent to 0.3% of the assessed value of the new project or  addition.  </P> <P> For example, the new charge would mean that the cost of adding a  400-square-foot room to a house will increase 21%, from $337 to $409, according  to a Planning Department analysis.  </P> <P> In addition, the cost of 51 service fees, ranging from obtaining a home  occupation permit to processing an environmental-impact report, will increase  between 9% and 328%. Eight other new fees have also been created, such as a $35  charge for each time a city staff member has to reinspect a construction  project.  </P> <P> The council, at the prodding of City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga, plans  this fall to hire a consultant to analyze the city's entire fee structure and  bring its charges in line with what it costs to provide particular services.  </P> <P> Councilmen Wes Bannister and Jim Silva, who opposed the increases, argued that  the council should wait for that study to be completed before changing city  fees.  </P> <P> But Mayor Thomas J. Mays and council members John Erskine and Grace H. Winchell  prevailed, agreeing with Uberuaga's recommendation.  </P> <P> Uberuaga, who took over as the city's chief executive in February, warned the  council that the city could face a budget deficit of $7 million or more if it  does not inflate the city's annual income.  </P> <P> According to community development director Michael Adams, the city's current  fees, many of which hadn't been updated since 1981, are among the lowest of  Orange County cities.  </P> <P> Including the increases and new fees, which are estimated to bring the city an  extra $600,000 per year, the city's charges will remain below the county  average, Adams said.JOHN PENNER  </P></p>

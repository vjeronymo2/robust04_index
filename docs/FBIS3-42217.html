Six  other escaped militants are standing trial in absentia on  similar charges.    As the trial entered its second day Tuesday, the  presiding-judge read out the indictment sheet which listed the  charges against the 15 defendants. They were all accused of  belonging to an illegal group whose target is to overthrow the  government by force. Three of them were accused of the  attempted murder of Sidqi, by exploding a booby trapped car near  his motorcade, and the premeditated killing of a teenage  schoolgirl, Shayma' Muhammad 'Abd-al-Halim Jawdah. Four others  are accused of inciting the murder attempts while the remaining  militants face the lesser charges of illegal possession of  weapons and forging official papers.    "The nine defendants present denied all the accusations  against them," defence lawyer Muntasir al-Zayyat told AL-AHRAM  WEEKLY. He said the court also granted the request of the  defence lawyers to meet with the defendants -- which they had  been denied for nearly two months -- and another request for  more time to study the case. Hearings, which first opened last  Saturday, were adjourned until 5 February. At Saturday's  opening session, one of the defendants said that although the  al-Jihad organisation took responsibility for the assassination  attempt, "all confessions made by the nine (to police  interrogators) were extracted from them by torture." The  organisation, in a statement faxed to foreign news  organisations, said it was responsible for the attempt shortly  after it was carried out on 25 November last.    The nine defendants, standing in an iron cage during  Saturday's session, seemed in fairly high spirits. They chatted  with their relatives before the session started.    Four volunteer lawyers were present to defend the accused  militants. One of them expressed pessimism about the expected  verdicts.    Defence lawyer al-Zayyat complained to the court that the  accused were being ill-treated and forced to make confessions.  He also said the accused were being kept in solitary  confinement in cells under poor detention conditions and asked  the court to order an inquiry into these conditions.    One of the defendants interrupted him to complain that the  medical examiner assigned to verify their claims of torture was  a woman. "How can we reveal ourselves before a woman?" he asked.    Al-Zayyat told the court that military trials will not solve  the problem of terrorism but may lead to more violence. At  midday, hearings were interrupted by one of the defendants  raising his voice to call for the noon prayer.    During a subsequent recess, one of the defendants read out a  statement by al-Jihad: "We wish to remind our fellow Muslims  that they should not help the government with its plot but  should boycott the national dialogue ... al-Jihad, led by Ayman  al-Zawahiri, is opposed to any dialogue with the government and  will pursue its struggle ... We do not have faith in these  trials. Judgment is the prerogative of God."    Al-Zawahiri, a doctor-turned-Islamist militant leader, is a  prominent "Arab-Afghan" who fought with the Afghan mojahedin  against Soviet occupation. He is believed to be in Europe at  present.

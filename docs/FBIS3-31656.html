Speaking to journalists before his departure from Prague,  Kozyrev expressed hope that this would not be repeated. "We  have now embarked on a better path of joined efforts and, in my  opinion, it is extraordinarily important to concentrate on  consolidating the success which was achieved within three days  after Russian President Boris Yeltsin's initiative was  announced," Kozyrev said.    That was a reason why Russia was determined to join the  United States, NATO and other partners in united actions and not  in separate ones, Kozyrev said.    He expressed hope that now at last there would be mutual  friendly feeling between the peoples of the Russian Federation  and the Czech Republic in full measure -- without pressure,  without a totalitarian regime, without any attempts to maintain  in this or that form of the former socialist camp, without  "Brezhnev's doctrines."    It is equality and mutual respect which are creating  political trust and the political background for the renewal of  close relations which existed between the cultures of both  peoples, Kozyrev told CTK.    After that, Kozyrev left the Czech Republic where he was on  a  working visit at the invitation of Czech Foreign Minister Josef  Zieleniec. On Saturday [19 February] in Prague Kozyrev held  talks with Zieleniec and was received by Czech President Vaclav  Havel in his cottage in Hradecek near Trutnov, East Bohemia. On  Sunday [20 February] he had lunch with Czech Premier Vaclav  Klaus.    Kozyrev's stay in Prague was part of his tour of the  Visegrad  Group (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland). From  Prague Kozyrev made his way to Hungary from where he will travel  to Poland. His planned visit to Slovakia which was due to have  been first in this series was canceled because of the government  crisis in Slovakia. According to diplomatic sources, nothing is  known about a replacement date for his visit to Slovakia.</p>

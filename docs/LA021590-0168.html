			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORE STOLEN EXPLOSIVES DISCOVERED  </P> <P> Eleven more stolen explosive cartridges believed used in the space shuttle  turned up Wednesday in a Saugus neighborhood where 10 of the devices have been  found since Feb. 3, including one that blew up and slightly injured a boy,  authorities said.  </P> <P> The discovery came two days after Los Angeles County sheriff's officials warned  area residents to be on the lookout for the devices, 46 of which were stolen in  1987 from a now-closed testing plant run by Hi-Shear Technology Corp.  </P> <P> Deputies planned to visit several schools in the area today to describe the  cartridges to students and instruct them to call authorities if they find any  of the devices, Sheriff's Lt. Ed Chenal said.  </P> <P> Authorities believe the remaining 25 cartridges, which are seven inches long  and three-quarters of an inch in diameter with red plastic caps on each end,  were also discarded in the area. The cartridges are used on the space shuttle  to jettison empty fuel tanks after liftoff.  </P> <P> Deputy Dean Scoville said Hi-Shear employees found the 11 devices Wednesday in  a plastic foam container dug from rubble near a brick wall in the 27500 block  of Urbandale Avenue.  </P> <P> Representatives of Torrance-based Hi-Shear could not be reached for comment  Wednesday. Scoville said the company sent representatives to scour the field  for additional cartridges after authorities announced the earlier finds on  Monday.  </P></p>

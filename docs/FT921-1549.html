			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Leading Article: France fragmented AS EXPECTED, French voters took the opportunity provided by local and regional elections on Sunday to deliver a stinging rebuke to their little-loved Socialist government, without giving anything like a massive vote of confidence to the conservative opposition. The Socialist party's share of the vote (which was 36.4 per cent in the 1988 general election) fell to an ignominious 18.3, but the conservatives' also fell, if less drastically, from 37.7 to 33.0. This was clearly a protest vote not just against the government but against the whole political establishment; and it seems to have been directed more against the style and morality of politics than against the substance of policy. Asked what had counted most in inciting them to vote as they did, 41 per cent of those polled referred to 'les affaires' - the spate of recent political scandals. Only 24 per cent cited unemployment - although this is at a near-record level, affecting 9.8 per cent of the workforce - and 15 per cent immigration, the theme which has given the racist National Front (FN) its popularity. FN's advance The FN itself won 13.9 per cent of the vote, which comes almost as a relief after its own and others' predictions that it might reach 20 per cent and/or overtake the Socialists. The uncomfortable fact is, however, that the latter did happen in several regions, including those centred on Paris and Lyon. The FN is not strong enough to win executive power for itself in any region, but in many it will hold the balance, forcing the conservative parties to make an awkward choice between seeking its support, renouncing power, or reaching some kind of accommodation with their Socialist opponents. As Mr Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist leader, was quick to point out, this fragmented picture - with many seats in regional assemblies also going to two rival ecology parties, and not a few to purely local groups - is a product of proportional representation, which President Francois Mitterrand has hinted he would like to reintroduce also for next year's parliamentary election Mitterrand's prestige But only a rigorously proportional system would, on Sunday's figures, be enough to deny the conservatives an overall majority in the next parliament, and such a system would also give the FN 77 parliamentary seats where at present it has only one. It is hard to believe the president would take on himself the responsibility of producing such a result simply to avoid a repetition of his experience of 'cohabiting' with a conservative government If a governing party in Britain suffered a defeat of this magnitude one year before a general election, it might well consider changing its leader. But the real leader of France's Socialists is Mr Mitterrand himself. Even if he decides, as many are urging him, to correct the mistake he made in appointing the unfortunate Mrs Edith Cresson as prime minister last year, there is little reason to suppose he can revive his own prestige in the eyes of the voters. The best service he could render to his party now would be to resign before the parliamentary elections in March 1993. It would be in the interests of a Socialist presidential candidate - whether Mr Michel Rocard or, more probably, Mr Jacques Delors - to have the presidential election first, if the right persists in restricting its own choice of candidates to Mr Chirac and Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, both quintessentially 'yesterday's men'. That, perhaps, was the message the voters were sending on Sunday when they cast their protest votes for parties other than the official opposition.</p>

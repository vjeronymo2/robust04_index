			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: Victoire report lifts Suez shares Suez, one of France's largest holding companies, yesterday saw its shares rise sharply on speculation that it is close to selling Victoire, the French insurance company. The shares closed FFr5.50higher at FFr361 following a newspaper report that BAT Industries, the UK insurance and tobacco conglomerate, was poised to acquire Victoire. Suez and BAT declined to comment. Victoire's ownership has been clouded by speculation since last autumn's deal whereby Suez took full control of the company by acquiring the minority stake held by Union des Assurances de Paris in part exchange for control of Colonia, the German insurer. Victoire is the fifth largest insurance company in France and has been valued by analysts at about FFr15bn (Dollars 2.5bn). It was until recently one of the more robust members of the recession-scarred French insurance industry but last year suffered from the problems at Baltica, the troubled Danish insurer in which it has a holding. A sharp fall is expected in Victoire's 1993 net profits. It has reported a 41 per cent fall in net interim profits to FFr275m in the first half of the year fromFFr470m in the same period of 1992.</p>

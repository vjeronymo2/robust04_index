General 'Uzi Dayan said: If the peace talks remain in crisis,  the Israeli military is braced for the contingency of war. Gen.  Amnon Shahaq said he did not foresee any change to the status of  the occupied Golan Heights this year. Uri Lubrani, the chief  Israeli negotiator with Lebanon, said those pressing for  implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 425 do not care  for peace.    Observers a re unanimous that the Washington talks are about  exploring ways to terminate Israeli occupation of Arab  territories and bring peace to the Middle East. They are agreed  that as long as Israel continues to balk at the requirement of a  complete withdrawal, peace will remain an impossibility. The  Arabs did not join the peace process or go to Washington to  appease Israel or indulge its wishes. They went to get their  occupied territories back and promote an enforcement of  pertinent Security Council resolutions. Syria wants the entire  Golan Heights back. Lebanon and Jordan also want to regain  sovereignty over their occupied territories, no matter how small  these may appear to be. Security Council Resolutions 242, 338,  and 425 -- the mainstays of any fair and universal settlement in  the Middle East -- require an immediate Israeli pullout from the  occupied Arab territory and an end to settlement activity. What  is the point of the Washington talks if they are not about  finding ways to implement these resolutions, remove the  occupation, and clear the path to peace? Does Israel really  think that the Arabs will define the shape of peace they want  before the Israelis make a public commitment to a complete  withdrawal as called for by UN resolutions?    Those who talk about peace being in crisis and raise the  specter of war are not interested in making peace. If the peace  is in crisis, this is thanks to Israel itself. It is thanks to  Israeli stubbornness that the two-year-old Washington talks have  hit an impasse. Had Israel proved receptive to a global  inclination for peace, Middle East peace would now be an  established fact. The Geneva al-Asad-Clinton summit has charted  the course of true peace and given added strength to  international efforts to that end.    If only Israel would end its intransigence and begin to act  as if is bound by Security Council resolutions instead of  creating obstacles and threatening a referendum on the Golan and  talking about a crisis that may erupt in war. The shortest  route to peace lies in the implementation of the underpinnings  of the peace process -- Security Council Resolutions 242, 338,  and 425, which are best summed up in the land-for-peace formula.  If Israel has trouble relinquishing its expansionist blueprints  and handing back the occupied Arab territories, how can it  realistically expect the Arabs to concede their land, rights,  and tradition, and bow to aggression, when they are impatient to  see peace established so that they can return to their land and  homes?    Syria has called for the peace of the brave. Israel must  realize that unless it displays a degree of courage commensurate  with the cause of peace, Middle East peace will remain an  unrealizable dream. However, belligerence and saber-rattling on  the one hand and courage on the other are strange bedfellows.  But if the Israelis reconcile themselves to hard facts and stop  showing racial hatreds and belligerent tendencies, they will be  truly courageous. All the world is waiting for the Israeli  rulers to adopt a positive stand in keeping with international  law and the sanctity of the cause of peace.</p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Faster phase-out sought for ozone-depleting chemicals GOVERNMENT experts from 56 countries have recommended an accelerated phase-out of ozone-depleting chemicals in industrialised countries by 1996, four years earlier than specified by the Montreal Protocol, the United Nations-sponsored international agreement. The recommendation, after a 10-day meeting in Geneva, follows new scientific evidence that ozone concentrations in the earth's atmosphere, which protect plant and animal life from harmful ultra-violet rays, are decreasing more rapidly and over a wider area of the globe than previously thought. The US and EC have already decided unilaterally to phase out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons and some other ozone-depleting chemicals by the end of 1995. CFCs are used in refrigeration, aerosols and solvents, and halons are used in firefighting equipment. The meeting discussed amendments to the Montreal Protocol to go to a ministerial meeting in Copenhagen in November. Proposals include: A phase-out of CFCs, halons, carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform (used in industrial solvents) by January 1 1996. Some countries want this advanced a year. Restrictions and eventual phase-out of short-term CFC substitutes, such as hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) which are also ozone-depleters. Restrictions and eventual phase-out of bromine-based substances, including methyl bromide, which are significant ozone-destroyers. Methyl bromide is widely used as a base for agricultural fumigants and fungicides. Additional financial and technical assistance for developing countries, which now have 10 more years than rich nations to implement the Montreal Protocol, to phase out ozone-depleters more quickly. Worldwide CFC consumption has already fallen 40 per cent from 1986 levels. Even so, atmospheric concentrations of chlorine and bromine are expected to rise into the next century, prompting environmentalists to urge an immediate and comprehensive ban on ozone-destroying chemicals.</p>

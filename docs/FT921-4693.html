			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Labour bites back Labour bites back: Angus, a West Highland terrier, and his owner, Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, yesterday endorsed the opposition's claim to be political market leaders on animal welfare, writes Ivo Dawnay. Labour's bid for the animal-loving vote, only days after the Liberal Democrats launched their policy, is based on evidence that electors prefer policies friendly to the furry and disenfranchised. A Mori poll for the International Fund for Animal Welfare has shown that kindness to animals could be worth up to 2 crucial percentage points in 52 marginal seats. Major's defence, Page 22</p>

Korean Students" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- Students in Seoul and  Kwangju, South Korea, staged fierce demonstrations Tuesday in  protest against the arrival of Patriot missiles at Pusan port  and U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry's Seoul trip.    The demonstrators in Seoul marched to the U.S. Embassy,  breaking through the close encirclement of the police, and  shouted anti-American slogans with a placard reading "We Hate  The Patriot. We Hate Perry."    Some 500 students affiliated with the Kwangju-South Cholla  Province Federation of General Student Councils demonstrated in  front of "the American Cultural Centre" in Kwangju. They threw  more than 200 paint bottles at the building, branding Perry's  Seoul trip and the deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea  as criminal acts increasing the danger of war.    The puppet clique mobilized a large force of riot police to  harshly suppress the protesters. The students, however,  continued the demonstration, chanting slogans urging the  withdrawal of the U.S. imperialist aggression troops from South  Korea.</p>

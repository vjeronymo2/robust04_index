			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Casting light on Whitehall THE LAUNCH yesterday of an inquiry into the role of the UK civil service by a House of Commons select committee is timely. Since 1979, the Conservative government has been engaged in what one minister recently called 'a long march' through the institutions of British public life. The civil service has been one of those institutions, and an appraisal is needed on the progress of the reforms it has undergone. Whatever the faults of Whitehall, the civil service model created by the Northcote-Trevelyan reforms of 1854 has proved durable. It is built on values of impartiality, objectivity, selection and promotion on merit, and accountability through ministers to parliament. Envied throughout the world, these principles have been frequently imitated, though not always successfully. Since the second world war, however, there has been increasing dissatisfaction among politicians over the effectiveness of the civil service. At its peak, it employed more than 750,000 civil servants, reaching deeply into many areas of British life. A civil service designed to advise ministers and administer an empire found itself running a welfare state and managing the commanding heights of the economy. The election of a radical Conservative government in 1979 offered an opportunity for reform that Mrs Thatcher seized. Many civil service functions have been privatised, others abolished. Departments have been required to run themselves in more business-like ways. Almost 60 per cent of civil servants now work in over 80 executive agencies specialising in services such as the payment of benefits and vehicle licensing. Many must compete for their jobs against contractors in the government's market-testing programme. Efficiency benefits These reforms have produced benefits in both efficiency and effectiveness. They have also led to allegations of loss of accountability to parliament, and of damage to civil service values such as promotion on merit. Evidence to justify these charges is in short supply, but the select committee is right to investigate them. However, the committee should also investigate the charge that the civil service has not done as much as it could to reap the benefits of these reforms. Despite losing more than half their staff to agencies, many Whitehall departments have been slow to reorganise around their new core functions. A 1991 report by a government efficiency adviser which recommended 25 per cent cuts in headquarters staff appears to be gathering dust. The committee should also ask why there has been no reduction in the number of white-collar civil servants over the last 10 years. In the private sector, similar service businesses have achieved substantial productivity gains. Privatised utilities Newly privatised utilities have been able to cut staff by 30 per cent or more when exposed to market pressures. Finding out why numbers of civil servants are again rising, especially in the agencies, should be a priority. So, too, should be the new concerns crowding in over the role of policy-makers in Whitehall. Responsibility for policy failures such as sterling's exit from the Exchange Rate Mechanism and the mishandling of the pit closure programme cannot be solely attributed to politicians. There are fears that civil servants have become politicised by 14 years of single-party rule. And the events surrounding the sale of arms to Iraq, currently under investigation by Lord Justice Scott, give concern over ethical standards. A code of ethics is needed to protect both the public and civil servants who may be pressed to behave unethically. More radical reforms may be needed, however, to create greater accountability among civil servants for policy decisions. One solution, proposed by the European Policy Forum, is to introduce fixed-term contracts for top civil servants who would be paid according to their performance on publicly-declared objectives. The select committee could usefully examine the benefits from such an approach, which appears to work well in New Zealand. However, the committee should also ask searching questions about whether such reforms would also bring undesirable consequences such as the further politicisation of the civil service.</p>

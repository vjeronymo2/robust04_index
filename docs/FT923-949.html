			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Threadneedle street credibility: Currency turmoil has raised the question of whether the Bank of England should be more independent Is the case for an independent central bank in Britain an idea whose time has finally come? Or is it just one more overblown nostrum of the kind that has contributed to the exceptionally erratic path of British monetary policy over the past two decades? Whatever the answer, the arguments for an independent central bank will run and run in the aftermath of the debacle over the exchange rate mechanism. The issue of central banking independence has already been aired in the course of the debate on the Maastricht treaty, which contains a blueprint for an independent European central bank. The emphasis on independence undoubtedly stems from the success of the Bundesbank in achieving price stability in Germany within a context of high economic growth. Given the pivotal position of the Germans in the negotiations over monetary union it was inevitable that the Bundesbank should become the model for any European central bank. But the idea also derives wider support from the work of thinkers such as Friedrich Hayek and from the adherents of public choice theory. Current academic theories on central banking hold that, since there is no trade-off in the medium and long term between growth and employment, on the one hand, and inflation on the other, the only sensible goal for a central bank is the exclusive pursuit of price stability. But as there remains a short-run trade-off, politicians who work within the constraints of an electoral timetable will always be tempted to engineer pre-electoral booms regardless of the longer-run inflationary consequences. That, in essence, is the argument for protecting central bankers from political interference. It particularly appeals to the growing band of people who favour explicit constitutional limitations on government. The idea has obvious relevance for countries such as Britain where inflation has proved highly resistant to orthodox treatment. A huge body of academic evidence suggests that more independence, however defined, is accompanied by lower inflation. But work by Alberto Alesina and Lawrence Summers* does not confirm that freedom from political interference delivers lower unemployment, a more stable economy or higher growth - this, despite frequent assertions that the anti-inflationary credibility which supposedly derives from independence encourages more rapid adjustment in labour markets. Nor does the existence of a correlation between independence and low inflation mean that independence is a sine qua non. France has recently achieved a lower rate of inflation than Germany despite the Bank of France being more subservient to government than most. What was the key to this impressive disinflationary performance: the exercise of political will, or the institutional arrangements that the French borrowed from the Bundesbank via the ERM? Japan's ability to control inflation over the past decade has compared more than favourably with that of Germany or the US, where the Federal Reserve enjoys a high degree of independence. Yet the Bank of Japan ranks low in the independence stakes because it is so closely tied to the apron strings of the Ministry of Finance (MoF). That said, it is the officials, not the politicians, who count at the MoF. And in a system where the governorship alternates between appointments by the Bank of Japan and the MoF, the bank tends to become more independent when one of its own men holds office - witness the single-mindedness with which Mr Yasushi Mieno has pursued anti-inflationary policies in the face of opposition from the MoF. The low view of politicians implicit in the arguments for independent central banking assumes a degree of competence, as well as cynicism, on the part of ministers that is not always in evidence. The Barber boom in Britain in the early 1970s was followed by sterling crises and a succession of panic increases in minimum lending rate that severely damaged the prospects of Tory leader Mr Edward Heath at the polls in 1974. Nor is it easy to reconcile the economic policies of the Conservative government before the 1992 election with anything that remotely resembles ruthless political expediency. Clearly the issue is more complicated than it appears at first sight. Statutory independence must strengthen the central banker's arm in resisting political pressure. But there are degrees of independence, as well as conflicting goals: even the German central bank, under the Bundesbank Law of 1957, is obliged to 'support the general economic policy of the federal government', and was seen to do so at the time of German unification - much to the chagrin of the Bundesbank Council. And when it comes to any consideration of independence for the Bank of England, it is important to acknowledge that the best known examples of independent central banks such as those of Germany, the US and Switzerland, are products of a federal system. They are thus representative organisations, enjoying a legitimacy they could not enjoy in a unitary state. In a country such as Germany, where the folk memory of the devastating inflations of 1923 and 1948 is strong, such a structure has obvious appeal. The British inflationary experience has been exceptionally mild by comparison. This is reflected in official statements. The governor of the Bank of England, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, remarked in the early stages of moves towards economic and monetary union (Emu): 'I have to say that I believe the term 'independent' is misleading and obscures the key issues. No one could sensibly suggest that in liberal democracies any central monetary institution should be unaccountable.' Yet the Maastricht treaty's subsequent blueprint for a European Central Banking System comes even closer than the Bundesbank to a version of central banking independence where the politicians are, so to speak, required to throw away the key. That highlights one of the problems the government would face in the course of any ratification process for Maastricht. It also suggests that a British move towards independence for the Bank of England, if it takes place outside the context of Emu, would have to incorporate an extended discussion of accountability and democracy. The best available model for an independent central bank in a unitary state is that of New Zealand. There the government has signed a contract with the governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Donald Brash, whereby the bank commits itself to a 0-2 per cent inflation target as measured by a specially adjusted version of the retail price index, which makes allowance for external pressures such as adverse shifts in the terms of trade. In other words, the goal is specific, performance can be measured and the existence of a contract provides for a transparent political override: the politicians can reset objectives in response to circumstances. Yet the government cannot override a contract without giving notice and an override has to be renewed after six months. The procedure is thus transparent. There is also some link between achievement and reward, if not to the extent originally intended. According to Professor Charles Goodhart of the London School of Economics, who helped advise on the adoption of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act, it was originally proposed that the salaries of the governor and his top officials should be related to the inflation outturn. This idea was shelved because it was thought politically inflammatory to increase the governor's salary for taking deflationary measures that might throw people out of work. But a sanction remains: if the governor fails to deliver, reappointment is unlikely. It is conceivable that something more akin to the New Zealand version of independence could be acceptable in Britain. But the existence of an override might be thought to dilute the anti-inflationary commitment. And as David Marsh has pointed out in his new book on the Bundesbank, referred to here on Wednesday, the German central bank only acquired credibility over a long period in which forceful bankers engaged in constant trench warfare with the likes of Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Schmidt as well as Helmut Kohl. With the benchmark German bond standing at nearly 7 1/2 per - 4 percentage points more than German inflation and marginally higher than comparable US Treasury securities - the Bundesbank is clearly having to fight the credibility battle again and again. Would British politicians and central bankers be capable of such dogged persistence in pursuit of low inflation? It is tempting to argue that any government that so cheerfully abandoned control over its monetary policy to the Germans could hardly object to giving away control of the Bank of England to British central bankers. What has the Treasury got against the Bank of England that does not apply with greater force to the Bundesbank? But then the government only passed the buck to the foreign central bankers with an opt-out clause on Emu and, as we saw last week, the ERM always contained an opt-out clause anyway. Would such a government offer the Bank of England a version of independence worthy of the name? As for the people who run the Bank of England, their undoubted resolve could no doubt be reinforced by different institutional arrangements. But whether they would ever be a match for the inheritors of the great Prussian civil service ethos who run the Bundesbank is an open question. In a clubby British culture that no longer attaches overwhelming priority to the protection of the currency, the risk might be similar to that in Ireland, where central bankers are sometimes alleged to be too close to the politicians, notwithstanding their central bank's high degree of formal independence. To return to the academic statistics, there could be another explanation for the low correlation between independence and low inflation. To wit, those electorates that give their central banks independence may be precisely the ones that value price stability most. In which case, thinks Prof Goodhart, the act of granting independence to a central bank to pursue policies that the public does not want could lead to severe political problems. It is striking how often the case for an independent UK central bank is put most vocally by politicians who have left office (Lord Tebbit, Lord Lawson) or are unlikely to hold it in the foreseeable future (Mr Paddy Ashdown, Mr Alan Beith). That correlation is perhaps even more impressive than those provided by the academics. Over to you, Messrs Major and Lamont. * Harvard Institute of Economic Research Discussion Paper No 1496.</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / UK Company News: ICD Pounds 1.09m ahead International Communication &amp; Data, the USM-traded marketing services and database group, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.09m for the year to May 31, compared with a Pounds 4.92m loss for the 15 months to May 31 1993. The group returned to the black at interim stage, with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 191,000. The Pounds 6m turnaround was partly the result of a substantial decrease in exceptional costs, which helped bring about an operating profit of Pounds 1.37m (Pounds 3.32m loss). ICD also made a Pounds 48,000 profit on disposal of The Database Group, compared with a Pounds 993,378 goodwill write-off during the previous period. Earnings per share emerged at 2.2p (6.2p losses).</p>

			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Hoover workers agree settlement THE 151 workers at a Hoover washing machine plant in south Wales who were due to take the company to an industrial tribunal next week for alleged unfair dismissal have agreed a settlement. Under the deal they will receive Pounds 3,300 each. A meeting of the men and women who were made redundant in May 1991 from the Merthyr Tydfil plant overwhelmingly agreed to accept the company's offer. Hoover said yesterday: 'We are in discussions with the unions through Acas (the conciliation service), but we can neither confirm nor deny that an agreement has been reached.' The settlement is understood to have been reached after talks in London last month between Mr Ian Bonnar, Hoover's vice-president of manufacturing, and national officials of the AEEU engineering and electricians union. The workers were claiming the company should have adhered to the previous policy of last-in, first-out. For the first time for years, Hoover had decided to choose those to be made redundant. If the workers' claim had failed before the tribunal they were prepared to challenge the criteria used as the basis for dismissal in each individual case. A challenge could have prolonged the hearing for months, costing the company millions of pounds. An earlier case before a tribunal concerning 36 port workers extended over two years and cost more than Pounds 1m before an out-of-court settlement was reached. The Merthyr decision will cost Hoover Pounds 500,000 before any legal charges. The company has been anxious to avoid bad publicity as it is about to launch a new range of models.</p>

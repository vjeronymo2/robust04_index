			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Euro Disney payments to parent may be cut DISNEY, the US entertainment and leisure group, plans to reduce the financial pressure on Euro Disney, which operates the theme park on the outskirts of Paris, by renegotiating part of the agreement between the companies. Euro Disney, 49 per cent-owned by the US group, has been clouded by speculation about low attendances and sales since EuroDisneyland opened in April. The park attracted 7m visitors in its first six months, but is expected to fall below its original target of 11m for the first year. Mr Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman, said his company could 'do all sorts of different things to help Euro Disney. We are not going to allow a project as important as Euro Disney to suffer'. Disney receives a management fee of 3 per cent of turnover, together with royalties of 10 per cent on admissions and 5 per cent on catering and merchandise. Euro Disney is also committed to paying an incentive fee to Disney when operating profits reach an agreed level. It must pay 30 per cent of operating profits above FFr1.6bn (Pounds 186m), 40 per cent above FFr2.4bn and 50 per cent above FFr3.2bn. Mr Eisner said Disney was prepared to be 'flexible'. He said the management fee and royalties would remain intact, but Disney could 'defer other payments'. This suggests Disney might renegotiate the incentive fee, which is expected to be payable from next year. Analysts are concerned about Euro Disney's ability to finance the second phase of EuroDisneyland, fuelling speculation that it may have to raise further funds. Mr Eisner confirmed that EuroDisneyland would be 'a few hundred thousand below' its initial attendance forecast. Euro Disney is taking steps to improve attendance. A priority is to encourage people to visit at off-peak times. Euro Disney's prospects have also been clouded by the postponement of its property development programme because of the downturn in French property. Its property income was intended to help finance the second phase of EuroDisneyland. Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, European leisure industry analyst at Morgan Stanley, suggests Euro Disney will incur a net loss of FFr216m this financial year, with another deficit of FFr185m next year, before breaking even in the following year.

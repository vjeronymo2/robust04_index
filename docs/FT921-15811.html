			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / International Company News: OBU assets rise 1.1% in third quarter TOTAL assets for Bahrain's Offshore Banking Units (OBUs) rose marginally in the third quarter of last year, but were more than 10 per cent down on the same period in 1990 - a measure of the limited revival of confidence in the Gulf's banking centre since the Gulf war. Figures released by the Bahrain Monetary Agency (BMA), the Emirate's central bank, show assets to have risen 1.1 per cent cent in the third quarter to Dollars 51.578bn, compared with the second quarter. But total footings were 10.7 per cent down on the same period in 1990. The BMA reported that total assets of OBUs in June 1991 stood at Dollars 51.007bn. However, the preceding June assets stood at nearer Dollars 71.2bn before the shock to confidence caused by the Gulf war, which led to a flight of both capital and expatriate bankers from the island. OBU assets fell to their lowest level, Dollars 48.986bn, in May 1991. The BMA bulletin showed there were 47 offshore banks operating on the island, down from 56 before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian peace envoy for Nagorno-Karabakh Vladimir  Kazimirov says that there could be no cease-fire in the disputed  territory unless peacekeepers have been sent there. In an  interview with Interfax, he spoke of no other alternative being  envisaged for the time being.    At the same time, Kazimirov stressed the forces that the  military officials of Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh and Russia had  agreed on sending to the area of conflict were not intended to  disengage troops. Instead, they were designed to ensure the  security of military observers including one common and three  regional headquarters and a large number of stationary  observation posts and mobile observer groups.</p>

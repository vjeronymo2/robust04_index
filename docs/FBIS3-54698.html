For several days now the Azerbaijani troops have been  attacking all along the Karabakh front line. In the north they  have managed to advance some way. Both sides are suffering  heavy losses.    The Azerbaijan army needs if not a real military success  then  at least the semblance of success. It is not clear what the  ultimate goal is -- to reinforce their positions at the talks or  on the contrary to wreck these talks?    The Russian diplomats are saddened by Baku's decision to  start an offensive. The signing of the latest cease-fire  agreement has been thwarted. All details had been agreed  verbally but at the last moment the Azerbaijanis refused to sign  the document.    It may be expected that in the very near future the Karabakh  Armenians will try to seize the initiative and switch to a  counteroffensive as a result of which some part of Azerbaijani  territory will again be occupied. That will worsen the  prospects of attaining peace.    Envoy Vladimir Kazimirov, the Russian president's special  representative, is again setting off for Baku, Yerevan, and  Stepanakert. It has been decided to turn the page on the  incident of the Armenian soldiers' shooting of his automobile in  the Nagorno-Karabakh region. During the talk in Ashgabat  between Boris Yeltsin and Armenian President Levon  Ter-Petrosyan, the Russian president, we have found out, "talked  through gritted teeth" and something in the nature of an apology  was made. At any rate Minister Kozyrev has decided to interpret  Ter-Petrosyan's words as an apology.    The Russian diplomats will insist that the leaders of the  opposing sides come to Moscow -- here, outside the meetings  environment, they are usually easier to convince.    Meanwhile the situation is obviously deteriorating. Only a  month ago Academician Primakov, director of the Foreign  Intelligence Service, was speaking of the activation of the  Afghan mojahedin in this war. But he noted at the time that the  reports at the intelligence service's disposal "attest to  intentions more than to facts of participation right now."  According to recent information from Moscow experts, 1,500  Afghan mojahedin are taking part in the war on the Azerbaijan  army's side and there will soon be more.    The Armenians also suspect that Turkey is taking part in the  conflict. In early December IZVESTIYA's Yerevan correspondent,  Sergey Bablumyan, reported that the Dashnaktsutyun party  analytical center, citing the French special services, was  warning that in mid-December Turkey was preparing a missile  strike against Armenia's energy centers. The pretext was the  presence on Armenian territory of bases of the Kurdish Workers  Party, which is struggling against Turkey and Turks throughout  the world.    The Dashnaktsutyun party's statement is most likely  propaganda. Any military action against Armenia would put into  operation the treaty on the CIS countries' collective security;  that is it would pit Turkey against Russia. Turkish servicemen  take no part in combat operations on the "Karabakh front,"  although it is known that they are engaging in the Azerbaijan  army's combat training. Since Azerbaijan's accession to the CIS  countries' collective security treaty, the appearance of foreign  servicemen on its territory looks quite dubious.    As for the bases of the Kurdish rebels, the Russian Foreign  Ministry knows only that this information has appeared in the  Turkish newspapers, which of itself is not proof.  Representatives of the Russian intelligence service unofficially  doubt there are such bases, but officially they cite the absence  of a mandate allowing them to work on the territory of the CIS  countries.    The ally relations of the North American and West European  countries within NATO do not prevent them -- thoroughly and  while observing the proprieties -- from spying on each other.  It would be logical to give Russian intelligence similar  powers. The political and military leadership in Moscow is  quite obviously in need of information, including that obtained  promptly. And the intelligence assessments of the situation in  republics neighboring on Russia should be made public in the  most general form. The taxpayers have the right to know what is  happening around Russia and to have the opportunity to judge  competently how far Moscow's peacemaking efforts accord with the  gravity of the situation in the conflict zone.</p>

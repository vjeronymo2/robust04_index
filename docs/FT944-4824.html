			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / FDP makes overtures to SPD The German Free Democratic party (FDP) yesterday made overtures to the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD), the first step in a mating dance which may pave the way for a coalition between the two parties. Mr Hermann Otto Solms, the leader of the FDP's parliamentary party, said: 'If Scharping can actually bring his party to change course in economic and social policy then he will become an interesting and serious partner for talks with the FDP.' There has been speculation that the FDP, which lost almost half of its seats in the Bundestag at the recent elections, will eventually pull out of the coalition with Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats. However, the feelers that Mr Solms is putting out contrast sharply with comments by Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister and party leader, who has steadfastly said that the FDP sees its fortunes tied to those of the CDU.</p>

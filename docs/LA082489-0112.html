			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland, United Mine Workers President Richard L.  Trumka and 15 other labor leaders were arrested while demonstrating on behalf  of striking Pittston coal miners in Virginia. Pittston, which argues it needs a  contract with more flexibility to compete in overseas markets, broke off talks  last week to protest what it called an increase in union violence. The contract  dispute focuses more on benefits and scheduling than wages. The labor leaders  sat down to block the double doors of the Russell County, Va., Courthouse.  After refusing to disperse, they were arrested and charged with obstructing the  free passage of others, a misdemeanor.  </P></p>

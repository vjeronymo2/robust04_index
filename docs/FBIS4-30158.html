			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists  committed an aerial espionage on the DPRK by bringing an  overseas-based RC-135 strategic reconnaissance plane to the sky  of South Korea on June 21, military sources said.    The provocative aerial espionage was part of their  premeditated war preparations against the DPRK.    Meanwhile, overseas-based pursuit-assault planes, VTOL  [vertical takeoff and landing] assault planes and early warning  planes held a surprise bombing exercise in the skies above  Yongwol, Pyongchang and Asan Bay in cooperation with scores of  warplanes belonging to the U.S. Air Force present in South Korea.    On the same day, a formation of Pacific-based KC-135 tankers  were deployed in a U.S. Air Force base in South Korea.    Facts prove the U.S. imperialists are persistently seeking  confrontation and war, going against peace and detente.</p>

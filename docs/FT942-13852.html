			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Amoco weathers drop in oil price Amoco, the Chicago-based energy company, yesterday reported a net profit of Dollars 398m for the first quarter, up from a Dollars 343m a year ago. The rise was posted in spite of lower oil prices. Revenues were Dollars 6.7bn, down slightly from Dollars 6.9bn in the same quarter of 1993. Mr Laurance Fuller, chairman, said cost-cutting and restructuring had allowed Amoco to post stronger earnings in spite of a 'Dollars 4-to-Dollars 5-per-barrel' drop in crude oil prices. However, he said further changes to corporate structure were required to keep Amoco competitive. Lower oil prices were partly offset by a 66 per cent jump in profits, to Dollars 90m, at Amoco's chemical business. Refining, marketing and transportation earnings also rose, to Dollars 104m from Dollars 80m a year earlier. Income for exploration and production operations in the US, however, were lower than a year ago, at Dollars 207m against Dollars 253m. This was primarily because of the drop in crude oil prices. Earnings from Amoco's overseas exploration and production operations also declined, to Dollars 61m. Worldwide capital and exploration spending dropped to Dollars 357m from Dollars 381m a year ago.</p>

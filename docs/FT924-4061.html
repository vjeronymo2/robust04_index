			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / France offers troops for Somalia FRANCE yesterday offered to make a substantial contribution to a United Nations military force in Somalia. It is expected to contribute 2,000 men - half from its base in neighbouring Djibouti and half from France - under command arrangements resembling the Gulf war's Desert Storm operation. French troops will be nominally under UN auspices, but effectively under US command. The US has offered 20,000 men to protect famine relief supplies. France may ask the US to airlift light French tanks to the area, while the French base at Djibouti may in turn be used by American forces. President Francois Mitterrand yesterday telephoned President George Bush, before leaving for the Franco-German summit in Bonn. A statement from the Elysee Palace said the French contribution was to help 'put an end to the intolerable situation prevailing in Somalia, where rival warlords have been pillaging relief supplies'. Earlier this autumn French schools collected a large amount of rice for Somalia, but little has got through to starving Somalis. At the UN Security Council session last night France was expected to pronounce itself in favour of 'firm and determined' international action. According to the Liberation newspaper, France plans to lobby for one of its citizens to get the post of military adviser to the UN secretary-general, in recognition of France's growing contribution to UN operations. It has 4,000 troops in Yugoslavia and 1,500 in Cambodia. In Washington, although the use of force appears to command general public and political support, some have voiced opposition. Congressman John Murtha, who wields considerable power on defence issues as chairman of the House of Representatives appropriations subcommittee that decides the defence budget, complained yesterday that US intervention in Somalia could be a precedent for demands in a host of other countries. 'This is a fundamental change in the direction of what we've done in military policy for years. It's always been based on threat in the past, it's always been based on national interests,' he said. 'We can only do so much. We cannot be the policeman of the world,' Mr Murtha added. Other influential members of Congress have backed intervention in Somalia, but are wary of entering an open-ended commitment. 'The important thing is that we have a clear mission. . . that our military people know exactly what they are supposed to do and we'll know when we have succeeded,' said Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate armed services committee. Reuter adds from Addis Ababa: Mr Jan Eliasson, UN under-secretary for humanitarian affairs, said yesterday he doubted that Mr Mohamed Farah Aideed, Somalia's most belligerent warlord, would obstruct plans to deploy the US-led troops. 'We have no reason to be concerned that Aideed would be against the accelerated delivery of humanitarian assistance,' Mr Eliasson said after a meeting of Somali clan leaders and western donors. Mr Aideed stayed away from the three-day conference.</p>

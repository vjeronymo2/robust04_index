			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Redland Redland's successful Steetley bid looks shrewder by the day, yesterday's 17p jump in the shares owing more to growing market appreciation of the bargain price it paid than to largely anticipated 1991 results. Early indications are that the forecast merger benefits should be comfortably achieved, and that, thanks in part to the happy coincidence that Steetley's loss making first quarter will not be consolidated, significant earnings enhancement is possible. The combination of a generous 7 per cent yield and the overseas earnings makes it an ideal political hedge in the sector, though whether investors want to be there at all at the moment is another matter.</p>

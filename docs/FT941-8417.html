			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Finance and The Family: Soaring investment trusts set record pace / New and existing issues jostle for business - but is this a good time to buy? Investment trusts are more popular now than they have been for decades. New launches in the first quarter of this year could well raise more than in the whole of last year, which was record-breaking as well. And existing trusts are attracting unprecedented investor interest because of lower interest rates. The price of investment trust shares fluctuates according to market demand, rather than the value of their assets. If a trust is out of favour, you could buy the shares at a substantial discount to the value of its assets. If the trust is very popular, you might have to pay a premium. Just how big a comeback the investment trust sector has made is shown by the fact that the average investment trust discount to net asset value was at its narrowest for more than 20 years last month. But a flood of new issues, and the stock market response to the recent US rate cut, has started to reverse the tide since. Discounts actually widened slightly last week. This is a timely reminder to investors that a narrowing discount is not a one-way process: if the market turns bearish, premiums can turn into discounts, and small discounts can become yawning gaps of 20 or 30 per cent  -making a severe dent in your profits when you want to sell. Existing trusts Now that investment trust discounts are at historically narrow levels, one of the old arguments for buying investment trusts has been eliminated: that they provided an opportunity to acquire undervalued assets cheaply. If that is no longer true, is this generally a bad time to buy investment trusts? According to the experts - not necessarily. Value has not disappeared from the sector: you might just need to look harder for it. Philip Middleton, an investment trust analyst at Smith New Court, says: 'At the moment, there are some perfectly decent international generalists which you can buy on quite acceptable discounts.' He mentions Scottish Eastern, Witan, and Kleinwort Overseas as trusts in this category. Some Far Eastern funds are looking attractive, too. The fact that a trust is at a premium does not always mean you should avoid it, says Brian Tora, of stockbroker Greig Middleton. Several of the funds recommended by his firm are at a premium, including Fidelity European Values, and Perpetual Japanese. This is because the managers are respected and have a track record which can justify paying a premium. Management experience and performance is what to look for. But David Harris, of Chantrey Financial Services, says investors should know they are taking a greater risk by buying at present levels. He advises them to look at unit trusts in the same sector before buying shares in an existing investment trust at a premium - particularly if they are run by the same manager. The unit trust could be a more cost-effective option, Harris adds. New issues Conversely, the narrowing discount improves the case for buying new investment trust issues. It used to be that new issues were a bad deal: you had to pay the full asset value plus the issue expenses. But, by buying shares in an existing trust, you could get the same assets at a 15 per cent discount. Now, new issues can be better value. Middleton warns, however, that even when a trust is expected to be popular, you should not subscribe with the intention of 'stagging' it - selling immediately for a profit, as many people did with privatisation shares, which were priced cheaply. Investment trust issues cannot be underpriced, as they have no assets to start with. Even the recent Kleinwort European Privatisation investment trust, which was oversubscribed heavily, went to only a 2 per cent premium on its first day. Issues should be judged on their medium to long-term prospects. Harris says careful choice is necessary because of the many issues and it might be more sensible for small investors to go for big names in fund management, with a track record in their area, rather than unknown management groups. C-share (conversion share) issues, where existing trusts raise new share capital, also can offer better value than ordinary shares in the same trust. C-share issues under way now include Templeton Emerging Markets, Fleming Japanese, and Abtrust New Dawn. What about warrants? The majority of the new investment trusts being launched now are offering subscribers to the public offer 'free' warrants, one for every five ordinary shares. A warrant gives you the right (but not the obligation) to buy shares in the trust at a fixed price at some date or dates in the future. Warrants are traded separately from ordinary shares. They are highly-geared, speculative instruments which can deliver huge capital gains if the trust's share price rises above the warrant's exercise price. But if the trust flops, they become worthless. Many private investors who normally would never trade in warrants can find themselves holding them because of a public offer. The question then arises of what to do with them. It can be tempting to sell them quickly but advisers say this is not always the most sensible option. Middleton argues that the term 'free warrants' is a misnomer: investors have paid for them as part of the package of ordinary shares. 'You should not just regard them as some bit of frivolity that has been thrown in for nothing. Generally, you should hang on to them,' he says. After the trust has been running for a few years, you can decide whether to sell or exercise them. Tora feels that the best course is to keep warrants, perhaps tucked away in an envelope labelled 'round the world trip 2003.' Alternatively, you could put them in a child's portfolio, where capital growth is more important than income. But you should not forget about them altogether - warrants do have fixed expiry dates. Harris says that investors not prepared to take the longer view could sell the warrants immediately and look on the proceeds as a discount on the ordinary shares.</p>

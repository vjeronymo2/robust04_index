			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Nico Lopez refinery's catalytic cracking  [craqueo catalitico] plant resumed operations this week. This is  the plant responsible for refining the largest quantity of  gasoline in the country. Nevertheless, the problems extend  beyond this factory, and [fuel] availability remains low.    From the very beginning of the year, fuel availability  plummeted due to trade delays and the shutdowns in the nation's  production plants. The latest situation at the Nico Lopez plant  occurred because of a lack of input. However, once one  difficulty is solved, others arise, such as the very important  need for maintenance, which is a year behind schedule because of  lack of financing.    According to the director of Cupet [expansion unknown], the  gasoline situation today depends on the nation's financial  situation.    [Begin Cupet director recording] Essentially, there is a  financial problem that causes the availability of fuels to be  considerably below the real demand today, below the amount  needed to accomplish the economy's essential activities --  activities essential to both the economy and the population. The  difficulties make it impossible for us to ensure a certain  stability regarding the time and quantities in which the various  fuel supplies are guaranteed for the nation's different  activities. [end recording]    What is happening regarding gasoline is also the case for  kerosene and liquified gas. Availability levels have dropped  considerably. In 1989, the amount of fuel oil was over 6  million, while in 1993, it exceeded only 3.5 million. [sentence  as heard]    As for liquified gas, 135,000 metric tons were distributed  in  1989, while in 1993, there were only 59,900. Likewise, last  year, only 299,000 tons of kerosene were distributed, compared  to 613,000 in 1989. It was predicted that distribution levels  would improve in 1994 due to important intergovernmental  agreements, international price adjustments, and particularly,  economizing. Nevertheless, the anticipated response has not been  forthcoming during these first two months [of 1994]; and both  private and state [enterprises], including priority sectors,  have been affected.    In order to predict what will happen in the future, one  would  have to make so many suppositions when only time itself will  tell. What is true, however, is the nation's financial  instability. We will be able to solve the fuel problem to the  extent that financial instability is resolved.</p>

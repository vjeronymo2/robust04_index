			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: When probate is required I HAVE recently been appointed executor by an elderly lady with a small estate. What is the value of an estate below which probate is not required? In nearly all circumstances, a grant of probate is required so that it can be produced by the executor to prove his title to the assets of the estate. In very limited circumstances, small sums of money owned by the deceased may be paid or transferred on death to those persons entitled to them without the need to produce a grant of probate. The ability to do this depends on the amount owned by the deceased and the source of the money. The upper limit on these payments is Pounds 5,000. If the sum owned by the deceased is in excess of Pounds 5,000, grant is needed for the whole amount. The payment can only be made in respect of: 1. Money held in the National Savings bank, Savings Certificate or Premium Bonds. 2. Money payable on the death of a member of a trade union. 3. Money invested in a building society. 4. Arrears of salary and pensions payable to certain Crown employees. In all these cases, the release of the monies by the Director of Savings, the building society manager etc is within that person's discretion. The executor cannot enforce them to hand over the money if, for some reason, they require to see a grant. It is clear, therefore, that it is not the overall value of the estate which determines whether or not probate is needed, but whether monies owned by the deceased are within the circumstances described above. You will need to decide if the estate of the deceased comes within the above terms. The Probate Registry will also be able to offer advice should you need it. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

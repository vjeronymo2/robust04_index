			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Mexico having to bear cost of market fickleness Sir, Your editorial, 'Right decision, wrong tactics' December 22), correctly points out some policy mistakes of this and the previous Mexican administration. However, nothing was said about the extreme fickleness of international financial markets, as a key element in provoking recent events in Mexico. The markets were somewhat over-optimistic about Mexican prospects a week ago; they are certainly over-pessimistic today. Nothing that has happened in Mexico in recent days can explain such a massive change in perceptions; recent events are largely explained by the intrinsic volatility of international financial market. Maybe the largest mistake of the Mexican authorities was to pursue a policy so heavily reliant on external capital flows. Would not some disincentives to discourage excessive foreign inflows (especially short-term ones) a year or two ago have implied lower, but more sustainable, private flows? Greater reliance on domestic saving (as Stephen Fidler rightly suggests in 'Latin America faces difficult year ahead,' December 23) would also have been prudent. Perhaps the time has come for governments - in industrialised and especially in developing countries - to review whether deregulation should not be complemented by some management and greater regulation of international capital markets. Though this clashes with 'conventional wisdom', the costs of current extreme freedom in these markets may start to outweigh the benefits.

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Observer: Got a light, guv? A director of Colombia's central bank, en route to a pow-wow with his opposite numbers in Venezuela the other day, was caught at Bogota airport with a small amount of marijuana. He was released on the basis that it was only a 'personal dose'. It is hard to imagine the Bank of England's new governor 'Hard' Eddie George lighting up a joint to relieve the boredom of the endless round of EC central bankers meetings. But his new deputy, former Economist editor Rupert Pennant-Rea, may be more sympathetic to the plight of his unlucky Colombian colleague given his well-known desire to decriminalise drugs.</p>

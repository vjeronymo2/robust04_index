			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUDGET CUTS IN STATE PROGRAMS  </P> <P> The state has a new record-high budget, and the gasoline tax just went up by 5  cents a gallon. Yet we still hear people blaming Proposition 13 for cuts in  important programs.  </P> <P> Proposition 13 is innocent.  </P> <P> First of all, there have been no budget cuts. In 1978, when Proposition 13  passed, the state budget was roughly $14 billion. The budget just approved by  the state is slightly under $56 billion. The state budget has quadrupled in 12  years! The population of California has not increased by that much, nor has  inflation been so high. The recent news reports of cuts made by the governor in  the new budget are misleading: They are cuts in proposed increases.  </P> <P> Second, budget cuts would be a good thing! Every dollar taken in taxes from the  person who earns it deprives that person of freedom to choose how to spend the  fruits of his or her efforts.  </P> <P> Proposition. 13 was an attempt to stop the politicians from robbing us without  limit. It's a shame it wasn't stronger.  </P> <P> SARA BAASE  </P> <P> La Mesa  </P></p>

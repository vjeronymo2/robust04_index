			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Morgan Stanley to sue over Pounds 100m Canary Wharf deal MORGAN STANLEY, the US bank, is suing Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian developer, over the timing of a deal worth more than Pounds 100m. The dispute centres on Morgan Stanley's office block - at Canary Wharf in London's Docklands - which was the subject of a sale and leaseback agreement with Olympia &amp; York in 1990. Morgan Stanley claims that it should have already received the proceeds from the sale and leaseback. Olympia &amp; York, however, believes that it is not required to complete the deal until the end of June. The companies are not arguing about the sum involved, which they would not disclose. The dispute concerns the interpretation of an option agreement, which Morgan Stanley believed it had the right to exercise at the end of last year. Olympia &amp; York has also taken Morgan Stanley to court to press its own interpretation of the agreement. The two sides are attempting to reach a settlement out of court, although there is no sign of an imminent conclusion.</p>

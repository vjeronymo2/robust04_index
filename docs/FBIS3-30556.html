			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" statement by Momcilo Krajisnik, chairman of the </F> Serbian republic assembly, to Novi Sad Television Dnevnik on 6  Feb; place not given -- recorded]    [Text] What is certain is that the Serbs are not the  perpetrators [of the massacre in Sarajevo]. In addition to the  routine investigation that we conducted immediately after  learning what happened at the produce market in Sarajevo, we  also carried out an additional investigation, and we can say  with certainty that the Serbs did not do this and that the  Serbian side did not gain any political advantage.    It is impossible to grasp that the Muslims would do  something  like this, and usually when we know that it was not us we are  inclined to blame the other side. We have reached certain  conclusions that a third side exists that is very interested in  massacres such as this one happening, as certain political aims  of foreign factors in former Bosnia-Herzegovina are thereby  achieved. This said, we cannot today identify this side. There  are many parties interested in preventing closer relations  between the Serbs and the Muslims. They wanted to undermine  these talks precisely at the moment when we were making positive  progress on establishing trust between Serbs and Muslims, and  when we were close to an agreement similar to the one signed  with the Croats. We cannot now say that we cannot exclude the  possibility of this being the Muslim side, but one thing is  certain, and that is that the Serbs did not do this [sentence as  heard].</p>

			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Some Manville Lawyers' Fees Capped: U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein,  supervising an overhaul of the Manville trust fund, for the first time limited  fees to plaintiffs' lawyers for settling claims involving asbestos-related  diseases. Weinstein, who has ordered an overhaul of the cash-strapped trust,  limited the amount lawyers can charge clients to 20% of settlements in  emergency cases. Under the ruling, for settlements paid out over time, the 20%  fee limit may be collected only as each payment is received so that victims  always receive 80% of each check.  </P></p>

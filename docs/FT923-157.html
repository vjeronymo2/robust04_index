			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Call for shake-up of auditing BRITAIN SHOULD create an independent agency to appoint and oversee the work of auditors of large companies, according to a study sponsored by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. The report, by three academics, also called for auditors' responsibilities to be extended beyond existing shareholders of companies, and for them to detect material fraud. The radical conclusions by Mr Christopher Humphrey and Mr Stuart Turley, of Manchester University, and Mr Peter Moizer, of Leeds University, are likely to prove embarrassing to the institute, which has argued strongly for the retention of self-regulation through its own organisation. The findings follow a detailed analysis of the 'expectations gap' - the difference between the service non-auditors expect and which auditors provide. The study says the gap has existed since at least the end of the last century and auditors have tended to believe the fault lies with public ignorance of their role. The study argues there is an enduring expectation that auditors should detect material fraud and that auditors should respond by accepting this role, even though there would be an effect on fees charged. It says that there should be an 'office for auditing' to oversee auditors of companies, with appointments and the setting of fee levels taken out of the hands of directors on whom they are reporting. The study also suggest that auditors' responsibilties should extend beyond existing shareholders to potential shareholders and existing and potential creditors. Mr Henry Gold, technical director at the institute, welcomed some of the findings but said it was 'less confident' about the recommendations for an 'office for auditing' and to develop more explicit responsibility for fraud detection. He said the argument for independent regulation was not developed in sufficient detail to analyse its effectiveness. The Audit Expectations Gap in the UK.

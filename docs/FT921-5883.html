			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Appointments: Royal Bank of Scotland Iain Robertson is moving from County NatWest, where he is deputy chief executive and group finance director, to Royal Bank of Scotland, where he will be managing director of the corporate and institutional banking division, succeeding John Barclay who recently became deputy chief executive. This means that the Royal Bank will now have two former chief executives of the Scottish Development Agency in its top ranks. George Mathewson, who has been Royal Bank's group chief executive since January, left the SDA for the Royal in 1987 and was succeeded by Robertson, his close associate at the agency. Robertson left the SDA in 1990 shortly before the government turned it into Scottish Enterprise and moved to London to join County NatWest as group finance director. Now Mathewson has Robertson under his wing again. Robertson will stay in London. Robertson, a tall, terse man, originally trained as a chartered accountant with Peat Marwick but spent much of his career in the civil service before running the SDA's Locate in Scotland division. He has been in his present post at County NatWest since last July. AEGIS Group has appointed Thierry Vial Collet, 46, an executive director. Vial Collet joined Aegis last October, taking up the post of chief executive of Carat, Aegis's powerful European-wide media buying subsidiary. A marketing specialist, he was chief executive of Henkel France immediately before joining Carat. ***** Derek Hawkins, formerly finance director of Davy Corporation, is appointed director of corporate finance at WPP Group. Chris Coles, formerly director of group treasury, is returning to SG WARBURG. ***** Stephen Hodge has been promoted from deputy to group treasurer of SHELL INTERNATIONAL PETROLEUM on the retirement of Michael Harvey. ***** Colin Drummond, currently chief executive of Courtaulds yarns division, is appointed director of development at SOUTH WEST WATER. ***** Michael Derbyshire has been appointed group md of WHITECROFT.</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN DEFENSE OF RONALD REAGAN  </P> <P> In answer to the letters of Shirley Wolf and Phil Pister on naming the new  state building for Ronald Reagan (Nov. 8):  </P> <P> Yes, it is entirely fitting that the man who governed California so well as his  fiscal policies proved, a man who as President bankrupted the entire Eastern  Bloc, a man who removed the threat of atomic warfare between the Soviet Union  and the U.S., thus saving hundreds of millions from annihilation or perhaps  saving the human race, a man who caused the Communist tyrants to be deposed in  so many countries -- yes, it is entirely fitting that the new Los Angeles state  building be named in his honor.  </P> <P> In fact this honor is not even enough of a tribute for the accomplishments of  Reagan. The whole world should acknowledge what this great American did for it.  </P> <P> MAURICE SCHLESINGER  </P> <P> Malibu  </P></p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Survey of North American Free Trade (3): Overwhelming importance attached to pact - Impact on Mexico Mexico remains deeply worried about Nafta. On November 24 last year, Mr Jose Cordoba, the chief of staff to Mexico's President Carlos Salinas, was having lunch in an elegant Washington DC restaurant with Mr Samuel Berger, head of national security in the Clinton administration team, and Mr Barry Carter, another Clinton adviser. For Mr Cordoba, the lunch was important enough that he flew to Washington especially for it. The Mexican government had barely concealed its preference in the US elections for President George Bush, and was worried the Clinton administration might (partly as a result) be less than enthusiastic about pushing for a rapid congressional approval of the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr Cordoba thus turned salesman. In a private conversation obtained by the newspaper El Financiero and the weekly Proceso, and whose contents have been confirmed, Mr Cordoba said (with his remarks re-translated): 'For us, timing is everything. We would like to see this finished by the end of 1994. . . In December 1993 we will have a candidate for the presidency and the electoral process in Mexico will have started. 'It is very important for us to have finished this by then; that Nafta does not become mixed up with internal political affairs. By these dates, we would want to have left this matter behind us.' Mr Cordoba's remarks capture well the overwhelming importance the Mexican government attaches to Nafta. The presidency of President Salinas has come to be identified with the treaty. If it is passed, Mr Salinas will go down in history as the Mexican president who tied his country's economy irrevocably to the market principles of the US. If it is rejected, then his single most important initiative will have been seen to be a failure. However, whether rejection would go so far as to lead to an economic collapse and nationalist backlash is questionable. Given the lack of grass-roots support for Nafta in the US, the Mexican government has exploited such an argument, in the belief this would step up pressure on the US administration and Congress to approve the treaty. But were Nafta not approved by the US Congress, the government may want to intensify economic reforms, as a way of reassuring foreign and domestic investors that there will be no sudden change in government policy. As one senior government minister said earlier this year: 'We will have to speed up structural change were Nafta not passed'. This would be the preferred option rather than 'shooting yourself in the foot' by reversing reforms, he said. The government is believed to have a number of such reforms up its sleeve - such as the independence of the central bank, and news regarding membership of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) - in case the prospects for Nafta look dim. Similarly, while some analysts speculate that rejection of Nafta would encourage President Salinas to select a candidate with political savvy for the presidency next year, just as many say it would put the premium on a candidate with a strong economic background, given the need to assure investors, in the absence of Nafta, of the future direction of economic policy. Even if the rejection of Nafta does not provoke a crisis, most investors in Mexico's stock market, and leading businessmen, reckon such an event would have some damaging short-term economic consequences. Mexico last year ran a current account deficit of Dollars 22.8bn, forcing the government to let interest rates rise to 18 per cent to attract short-term foreign capital. High interest rates and a budget surplus in turn helped slow economic growth to just 2.6 per cent. Investors reckon passage of the Nafta will reduce uncertainty about future economic policy in Mexico and thus encourage more foreign investment. This should allow interest rates to come down and government spending to increase, giving the economy a vital shot as it enters the last year of the Salinas presidency. Such reasoning explains how on any given day positive news about Nafta can lift the stockmarket 20 or so points, while negative news depresses it by the same or more. Later in this year, concerns over Nafta may become worse as they feed speculation over the presidential succession. As Mr Cordoba indicated, the selection of the presidential candidate for the ruling party is expected to occur just after the congressional vote on Nafta (earmarked for December, according to one US adviser to the Mexican government). The confluence of uncertainties could drive even the most adventurous investors from Mexico's stock market and threaten the stability of the peso. In an attempt to temper such uncertainties, the president has made sure that all the presidential candidates from the PRI broadly share his economic philosophy. The potential candidates - whether it be Mr Donaldo Colosio, the social development minister and current favourite, Mr Manuel Camacho, the populist-leaning mayor of Mexico City, or Mr Pedro Aspe, the finance minister - all worked under Mr Salinas in the budget ministry in the last administration and while differences remain between them they are unlikely to reverse current policies in any significant way. Likewise, the government has been at pains to stress that the current austere macroeconomic policy will remain unchanged throughout this and next year. It is pressing ahead with further economic reform in the form of a new foreign investment law - to be introduced as part of the Mexican enabling legislation for Nafta some time in the summer - and more deregulation in the financial and industrial sector. Despite such precautions the government is still biting its tongue. Indeed, Mr Cordoba returned to Washington recently to impress on the US administration the importance of the treaty for Mexico and Mexico-US relations. This time he was advised to stay clear of public restaurants.</p>

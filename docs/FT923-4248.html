			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Glut of European produce puts pressure on Perkins A GLUT of fresh produce in Europe and weakening demand for frozen foods was blamed by Perkins Foods for interim pre-tax profits only 4.1 per cent up to Pounds 10.9m. The group, which trades or makes fresh, chilled and frozen foods, is one of the first food companies to report on a period which is expected to have seen trading conditions worsening and profits under pressure. The glut of fresh produce began to be felt towards the end of the first half, and the company said the impact was worse in July and August when prices fell by around 20 per cent. The market for frozen foods was difficult, the company said, and demand in Germany was now softening. Profits fell in the group's mushroom business which, like other companies in the sector, has been under pressure since 1990. Perkins, which had expanded rapidly through acquisitions mainly financed through issues of shares and convertible securities, suffered a fall in fully diluted earnings per share from 5.1p to 4.8p. The interim dividend was held at 1.7p. Mr Howard Phillips, Perkins' chief executive, said that the group was no longer looking for acquisitions but was concentrating on organic growth, based on finding new products and new customers. He said this change in strategy was 'realistic' in the light of the fall in the share price from around 150p early in the year to 64p at yesterday's close. Group sales rose 42.6 per cent to Pounds 176.3m because of a number of acquisitions. Operating profits were 23.1 per cent higher at Pounds 11.4m, but would have been down 4 per cent if acquisitions were excluded. There was a Pounds 1.7m swing to interest payable of Pounds 445,000. Mr Ian Blackburn, finance director, said that interest cover was 25 times, but was five times if charges on the convertibles were taken into account. A Pounds 5.1m D-Mark convertible loan note which had been counted in the balance sheet as equity was now regarded as debt, he said. Perkins has a potential liability on earn-outs of acquired companies of Pounds 19.7m, with up to Pounds 10.9m due in 1993 and Pounds 5m in 1994. Mr Blackburn said these could be met without gearing rising from its current level of 29 per cent. Details, Page 26</p>

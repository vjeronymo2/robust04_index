			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / UK Company News: SFO talks to Jersey police over Richmond share deals THE SERIOUS Fraud Office, the London Stock Exchange and Jersey police met last week to discuss possible irregularities in share dealings of Richmond Oil and Gas, the beleaguered natural resource company which recently announced that creditors had foreclosed on its main remaining asset. Officials of the two UK regulatory organisations were briefed in Jersey by local authorities, who raided a local accountancy firm under the island's 'investigation of fraud Jersey law 1991'. The SFO is conducting a preliminary investigation into whether a full-scale inquiry will be necessary. The discovery was made when the Jersey fraud office raided the premises of Bryant and Co in April, following a complaint by one of its clients that he could not recover Pounds 150,000 given to the company for investment purposes. The office appeared to be deserted, with dead cigarettes lying in ash trays and jumpers flung across the backs of chairs. However, police collected thousands of files from the premises which have been passed to UK accountants, Price Waterhouse, for analysis. The exact current trading status of Bryant and Co is uncertain, local officials said. Detective Inspector Peter Hopper of the Jersey police declined to comment in general terms, but stated that if irregularities were found they would be referred to the regulatory bodies. Also present in Jersey last week on a separate matter was Mr Herb Deutsch of the New York law firm, Deutsch and Frey. The firm is representing Butte Mining - under new management since last year - in litigation against more than 70 defendants, including Bryant and Co. The case alleges fraud and misrepresentation by former directors, executives and advisers. Mr David Wilkinson, joint managing director of Richmond, said he had no knowledge of any irregular share dealing in Richmond Oil's flotation. The company's Pounds 21m flotation at 105p in July 1989 flopped amid concerns over the valuation of assets against original purchase price. However, in October the share price had begun a steady climb from 63p to 163p by February 1990. The shares, which were 7p last night, hit a high of 173p in the summer of 1990.</p>

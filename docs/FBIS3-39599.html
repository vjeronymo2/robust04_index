In  Austria, the Greens allegedly demanded a special session of  parliament on this issue.    Vranitzky indirectly referred to criticism by Czech Prime  Minister Vaclav Klaus concerning Austrian efforts against  Temelin, stating that it is true that the autonomous decision by  the Czech Republic was in favor of nuclear power, but that there  was great readiness for cooperation with Austria on this issue.    Thus, Vranitzky mentioned the commission of experts that was  established to examine the Bohunice power plant and the  opportunity that Austria was given to look at documents of other  nuclear power plants and to inspect them. In addition, Austria  made financial contributions to a number of studies on energy  policy and ecological aspects. Austria's offer to supply free  electricity worth 3.5 billion schillings in the event of a  shutdown of Bohunice was rejected by the Czech Republic for  reasons of principle. [passage omitted]</p>

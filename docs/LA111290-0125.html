			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> YELTSIN DEFIES GORBACHEV PRESSURE TO BOW TO CENTRAL CONTROLS  </P> <P> Boris N. Yeltsin, the outspoken president of the Russian Federation, today  accused rival Mikhail S. Gorbachev of trying to pressure his republic into  ceding some economic powers to the central government.  </P> <P> "But we couldn't and will not go for that," Yeltsin told a legislative  committee.  </P> <P> Yeltsin and Gorbachev, the two most powerful Soviet politicians and frequent  critics of each other's policies, met in the Kremlin on Sunday for four hours  of what were intended as peacemaking talks.  </P> <P> But Yeltsin came out with more criticism of Soviet authorities, especially over  negotiations on a new treaty to group the 15 splintering Soviet republics.  </P> <P> "They pressed us yesterday and earlier to first sign a union treaty and then  resolve remaining issues, in the meantime transferring everything to the  authority of the center," Yeltsin told the Russian Federation's constitutional  commission. His remarks were carried by the independent Interfax news agency.  </P> <P> Yeltsin did not use Gorbachev's name, but the Soviet president appeared to be  his target. In the end, an agreement was reached to resolve differences this  year, before the treaty is signed, Yeltsin told the commission.  </P> <P> Soviet authorities and Russian authorities will form parallel groups to work on  issues, Interfax said, including banking, property and the money supply.  </P> <P> The Russian Federation and most other republics are at odds with the central  Soviet government over who should control what. The Russian Parliament has  declared its laws take precedence over national legislation and has passed a  plan for switching to a market economy in 500 days.  </P> <P> Earlier today, the prime minister of Russia said he told Soviet Prime Minister  Nikolai Ryzhkov his republic wants to help strengthen the union, but also wants  more powers itself.  </P></p>

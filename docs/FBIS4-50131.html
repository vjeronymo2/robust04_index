			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Wang Yanbin (3769 6056 1755) and Ji Bin (1213 </F> 2430)]    [Excerpts] Beijing, 13 Apr (XINHUA) -- Premier of the  State Council Li Peng said today that using straw to develop  cattle industry in agricultural zones is an undertaking that  benefits both the state and the people because it enriches the  masses' "shopping baskets," helps increase farmers' incomes,  brings about the development of relevant processing industry,  and promotes a virtuous cycle in ecology in farm areas.    Leading comrades of the State Council, including Li Peng, Li  Lanqing, Chen Junsheng, and Luo Gan, met today at Zhongnanhai  with representatives from the Third National Forum on Developing  Animal Husbandry in Farm Zones.    Li Peng said: In developing agriculture, it is not only  necessary to do a good job in grain, cotton, and oil-bearing  crop production, but also to develop diverse operations to  increase farmers' incomes. Cattle-raising is a good way to  increase farmers' incomes. He added: Using straw as animal feed  may promote development of the cattle industry and development  of relevant processing industries. The cattle industry can be  said to be a type of ecological farming. Using straw to feed  cattle and turning cow dung into fertilizer will benefit the  virtuous cycle of farming. In developing the cattle industry,  he suggested combining the methods of collective, large-scale  cattle breeding with individual cattle raising, bringing  superior labor resources into play, placing more emphasis on  scientific cattle-raising techniques, and modernizing the cattle  industry. He also proposed developing the leather-making  industry as there is a great market potential for leather  products. He urged scientific, technological, and industrial  departments to develop relevant machinery equipment so as to  raise the industrial level of the leather-making industry. Li  Peng stressed, seeing that as China has rich straw resources,  that there is great potential for using straw to develop the  cattle industry. He called on localities to adopt positive  measures to further promote the use of straw to develop the  cattle industry.    State Councillor Chen Junsheng spoke at today's closing  meeting about the great potential for developing animal  husbandry in farm zones. He said when promoting the use of  straw to develop the cattle industry throughout the nation, it  is necessary to consolidate and further develop beef production  areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Huang He [Yellow  River]; to develop beef production areas in the northeast; to  explore beef production in South China; to devote about eight  years to launching a major drive to accelerate the development  pace of the cattle industry; and to help raise China's total  beef output to new heights. [passage omitted on cattle raising  in Shandong, Henan, and other areas]    A decision was also adopted at the current meeting to  promote  the use of straw for raising sheep. The nation's farm zones  will experiment with using straw to raise sheep starting next  year. [passage omitted on giving titles to advanced  cattle-raising collectives and individuals]</p>

South Pacific correspondent,  Erina Reddan, says no candidate received the required 38 votes  or two-thirds majority to win.    [Begin Reddan recording] The government's candidate, Luc  Dini, received 28 votes while 18 votes were cast for Father John  Bernard Bani, who is supported by the opposition group, and 10  ballot papers were destroyed. A local council president was  disqualified from the electoral college on a procedural matter.    Chief Justice Charles d'Imecourt called for the 57-member  electoral college to reconvene on 2 March. Justice D'Imecourt  also apologized for any offense he had caused for comments he  had made over the opposition's boycott of the electoral college  last Monday. It had boycotted because it had not been officially  notified.    Justice D'Imecourt had said that the boycott was a disgrace  and would make Vanuatu the laughingstock of the Pacific.  Following those comments, the opposition had accused him of  political bias. [end recording]</p>

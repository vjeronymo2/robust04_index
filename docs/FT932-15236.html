			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): French interest rate cut signals further reductions BOURSES offered a limited response to the overnight strength in the US and Japanese equity markets, writes Our Markets Staff. Mr Anthony Thomas, European strategist at Kleinwort Benson, said that Europe, these days, is looking inward much more than before, influenced by the German recession on one hand and by the fall in continental interest rates, on the other. PARIS reacted to the cut in the 5-10 day repo rate with a 1.6 per cent gain in the CAC-40 index which closed 31.22 higher at 2,018.08. While the 2 percentage point cut had been anticipated last week, the market now expects a decrease in intervention rates, perhaps before the weekend. The central bank's decision reflected the resilience of the franc, which many commentators had expected to come under pressure in the currency markets as speculators tested the new government's commitment to the franc fort policy. March inflation figures, much in line with expectations, also supported trading in average turnover of FFr2.3bn. Interest-rate sensitives were among the best performers with SocGen gaining FFr13 to FFr644, Paribas FFr8.80 to FFr424.80 and Credit Local FFr24 or 6 per cent to FFr429. FRANKFURT registered its biggest gains in a month as the DAX index closed 15.32 higher at 1,671.05, but opinions on the market continued to conflict. Turnover was reported to have been thin. Financials were strong as bond markets rose following the decline in US bond yields, Deutsche Bank rising DM8.80 to DM707.40, although dealers said that the DM35 gain to DM2,220 in Allianz reflected a buy signal in the stock's chart pattern. Car stocks moved up, down and sideways, reflecting disagreement between German financial advisers like Merck Finck, in Dusseldorf, which puts the sector in the reduce/underweight category, and Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt, which has gone for an overweight position now that comprehensive cost-cutting measures are in hand in the industry. Daimler rose DM4.20 to DM569.20 after an intraday peak of DM576.00; BMW lost 50 pfennigs to DM484 after an intraday high of DM487.50; and Volkswagen ended with a gain of DM1 at DM312. MADRID rose on Wall Street's strength and the view that the early general election might remove some of the uncertainties facing the market - although some analysts demurred, saying that a close-fought campaign could create more problems than it solved. The general index rose 2.51 to 239.00. There were gains of up to, and over 10 per cent in constructions where Cubiertas ended Pta700 higher at Pta7,300 and FCC rose Pta510 to Pta9,620 on a Pta658bn hydrological plan to redirect water resources to the drought ridden south. ZURICH began firmly on hopes of lower interest rates, but the advance was not sustained as worries about the effect of a firmer Swiss franc weighed on the prospects for exporters. The SMI index finished 6.5 lower at 2,181.8. Among export oriented companies, Nestle bearers slipped SFr5 to SFr1,165 while Roche certificates eased SFr20 to SFr4,170. Banks and insurers were the beneficiaries of lower rate hopes. CS Holding bearers firmed SFr10 to SFr2,410, recouping early losses which followed Thursday's news that Moody's had downgraded the long-term debt of Credit Suisse. AMSTERDAM followed the general trend with a gain in the CBS Tendency index of 0.7 to 108.6. VNU put on 80 cents to Fl 112.10 ahead of confirming after the close that it had reached agreement to sell its printing division. MILAN moved ahead from the start before gains were pared by technical trading ahead of today's expiry of options contracts. The Comit index ended 0.92 higher at 513.01. Privatisation stocks were mixed in further response to last Thursday's sell-off timetable. Among candidates due to be sold by May, Credito Italiano fell L60 to L2,650 while Sme gained L60 to L5,990. STOCKHOLM edged ahead in thin trading and the Affarsvarlden Index rose 2.3 to 996.9. Volvo B shares added SKr10 to SKr382 following news at the weekend that its North American truck operations had returned to profit. Hennes and Mauritz, the clothing retailer, added SKr10 or 5 per cent to SKr208 after Mr Stefan Persson, the majority shareholder, agreed to accept SKr800m of company shares in payment for the SKr1bn convertible debenture loan that he holds. DUBLIN took its gains further, the ISEQ overall index closing 28.92, or 1.92 higher at 1,551.36, on anticipation of yet another rate cut this Friday, and on indications of improved cash flow at domestic institutions - meaning that they had no need to sell into continued foreign buying of the market. TEL AVIV rose in strong trading with a gain in the index of 4.72 or 2.3 per cent to 215.44.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- April 13                                           THE EUROPEAN SERIES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open        10.30        11.00        12.00  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1159.03      1159.84      1159.75      1158.72 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1221.83      1222.39      1223.64      1221.61  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00        14.00        15.00        Close  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1158.38      1158.43      1157.83      1157.54 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1223.55      1223.27      1222.03      1220.72  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                          Apr 8     Apr 7     Apr 6     Apr 5     Apr 2  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1151.40   1144.36   1147.43   1136.15   1140.36 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1211.28   1206.25   1210.05   1202.24   1215.52  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1160.41; 200 - 1224.90 Low/day: 100 - 1157.10; 200 - 1219.86.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

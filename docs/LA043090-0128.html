			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> BUILDING NAMED FOR BURL IVES  </P> <P> Eastern Illinois University is honoring one of its dropouts, folk singer Burl  Ives.  </P> <P> The university named an art studio after the 81-year-old folk singer and actor,  who enrolled at the college in 1929 but dropped out in his third year as his  grades slipped.  </P> <P> Ives said it felt good to be back at Eastern, despite not having a degree. He  said he hoped that people who use the building will follow his example and go  where their creativity takes them. After leaving college, Ives' wanderings as a  hobo and as a troubadour took him through 46 states, and he memorized about 500  folk songs.  </P></p>

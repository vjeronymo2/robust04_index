			<p>Recent     Hong Kong and PRC media reporting have contrasted the  excessive spending habits of newly wealthy individuals on food,  clothing, entertainment, or expensive private schools, with the  continuing struggle of people in the poor, remote areas to provide  for their basic needs.  The lavish life style of the rich appears to  have contributed to social uneasiness and discontent.      An article in the 15 November issue of the Hong Kong monthly TANG  TAI (CONTEMPORARY) reports that some of the "upstarts" in Shanghai  show off their wealth by purchasing expensive clothes and other  things.  Examples cited include a boutique store owner who sold 60  pieces of fur and leather clothing, ranging in cost from $138 to  $1,150, in less than a month, a jewelry store which sold a diamond  ring for over $3,448, and an entrepreneur who had made a fortune in  the stock market who spent $11,500 on his wedding banquet.  Health  clubs and golfing have reportedly become popular in the past few  years with international golf club membership fees rising from  $20,000 in 1989 to $59,000 in 1992.  Pets have also become a new  status symbol with a pair of Pekinese recently being sold for  $7,356, according to the article.  An article in the 18 September  1993 issue of the Hong Kong monthly NAN PEI CHI (NORTH AND SOUTH  POLES) reports that a "Dakuan" (nickname for the newly rich people)  paid $5,747 to a singer for a one-song performance.      Luxurious private schools have emerged in the past year as part  of the spending trend for the rich.  According to a 15 October TANG  TAI article, nearly 100 "aristocratic schools" were established in  the past year.  They have swanky offices, modern electronic  classrooms, libraries with rich collections, indoor and outdoor  gyms, swimming pools, tennis courts, and music halls.  Teachers'  salaries reportedly range from $70 to $150 per month.  One example  of such schools is Beijing Jinghua Elementary School which  reportedly charges a tuition of over $115 per month per student,  plus a one-time entrance fee of $3,450.      While a small number of teachers enjoy a comfortable income, most  teachers in public schools have been struggling to make ends meet.  According to an article in the 8 October issue of Hong Kong PAIHSING  HSINWEN CHOUAAN (PAIHSING NEWSWEEK), a teacher's salary in the  countryside averages only $11.50-23 per month.  Even that amount is  not guaranteed, because many local governments are behind in paying  their teachers, forcing them to take a second job to support  themselves.  Beijing GONGREN RIBAO on 29 September cites a teacher  in a remote mountain area who had to commute a long distance to  teach two or three different grades of students, and work over 10  hours a day just to earn 250 jin (=125 kilogram) of potatoes a  semester which he later sold for $3.      The Chinese press notes that the gap between the rich and the  poor has become so great that it may negatively affect social  stability.  (Beijing JINGJI RIBAO of 23 September reports some 80  million people in China are still below the poverty line.)  According to an article in the 23 August issue of the Beijing  monthly ZHONGGUO JINGJI TIZHI GAIGE (CHINA'S ECONOMIC STRUCTURE  REFORM), published by the State Commission for Restructuring the  Economy, the "wantonly extravagant" life style of a small number of  people who have used legal or illegal means to gain a windfall has  "polluted" society, causing strong public resentment.  The paper  notes that some people have spent $40,230 for a table for 10 at a  restaurant, or $46,000 for a rare breed of fish, while others go  gambling, use drugs, or engage prostitutes.  The crime rate has  reportedly increased and public order has steadily deteriorated.  According to a 15 December TANG TAI article, from January to June,  serious criminal cases in Shanghai increased 38.4 percent compared  to the same period in 1992.  Embezzlement, murder, rape, robbery,  drug peddling, and prostitution have increasingly been on the rise,  the article said.      (AUTHOR: CHINN.

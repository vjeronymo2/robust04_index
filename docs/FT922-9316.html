			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / UK Company News: BM spins off ten subsidiaries in Pounds 40m deal with offshoot BRITISH Building and Engineering Appliances, which is 75 per cent controlled by BM Group, is buying 10 building-related subsidiaries from BM for Pounds 40m in shares. BM, the construction equipment and engineering concern, increased its stake in BB&amp;EA in March at 355p a share. It said it would introduce into it first senior managers from its building products division and then a series of subsidiaries. The list of companies being sold to BB&amp;EA includes three under the Kass name, Simplex Piling, Birchwood Concrete Products and Boddis (Old Hill). One of the areas identified for expansion is the hiring out of small pieces of plant. BM is placing a quarter of the 10m BB&amp;EA shares it will receive at 400p each to bring its holding down to 75 per cent. Dealings in BB&amp;EA's shares were suspended at 475p. The near-Pounds 10m realised will be used to reduce debt. BM's gearing was nearly 45 per cent after the January acquisition of Thomas Robinson and an accompanying Pounds 60m rights issue. The building products companies involved in the BB&amp;EA deal made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 6.38m on turnover of Pounds 45.4m in the year to June 30 1991. In the six months to December, the corresponding figures were Pounds 2.56m and Pounds 17.9m, and net assets stood at Pounds 20.5m at the end of the period. BM as a whole made an interim pre-tax profit of Pounds 17.3m, up 28 per cent, on turnover of Pounds 229.3m. The spinning off of the building products businesses has been likened to the formative years of BM. The building group Beazer - now part of Hanson - lent its backing to Mr Roger Shute, BM's chairman, in the early 1980s. It introduced him along with its plant sales and engineering activities into Braham Millar, an ailing listed company, and then gradually reduced its interest.</p>

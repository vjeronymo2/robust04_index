			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Pre-birth technique decides calves' sex THE first calves whose sex was pre-determined at conception have been born in Cambridge, an Anglo-American scientific team will announce today. The ability to choose a calf's gender, long sought by cattle breeders, is likely to transform the economics and management of livestock production worldwide. The Holstein Friesian calves - three male and three female - are the product of collaboration between Mastercalf, a Cambridge biotechnology company, the Institute of Animal Physiology and Genetics Research in Cambridge, and the US Department of Agriculture's Germplasm Physiology Laboratory in Maryland. The scientists are producing pre-sexed calf embryos at a rate of more than 100 per week for use in large-scale field trials under way on farms in England and Scotland. If all goes well, sex determination will be available commercially within a couple of years. Mr Barrie Audis, chairman of the British Cattle Breeders Club, predicts it will make a big impact on the dairy and beef industries. The technique depends on an instrument called a flow cytometer that sorts bulls' sperm into two parts according to their genetic content. Sperm with an X-chromosome result in female calves and those with a Y-chromosome give males. But the sorting process does not give enough sexed sperm for conventional artificial insemination. Embryo transfer and in vitro fertilisation are necessary - cows' eggs are fertilised in test tubes with the appropriate sperm and the resulting embryos used to establish pregnancy. Mr Geoff Mahon, Mastercalf managing director, said sex determination will be combined with other techniques of genetic selection, so that bull calves can be given the characteristics most desirable for beef production while heifers retain the best genes for milking. Male embryos will be most in demand, since beef farmers want only bull calves and an average dairy farmer needs a ratio of one heifer calf to every three bull calves sold for meat. Mr Mahon says the cost of sex-guaranteed embryos is uncertain. Mr Audis, a potential customer, says: 'I could justify buying an embryo for Pounds 50 to Pounds 60 if I am guaranteed that it is a male beef calf.' With a world population of dairy cattle of about 220m - about half of which are born through artificial insemination - Mastercalf sees a large market for the technology. It has already given Mitsubishi Corporation an exclusive licence for Japan.</p>

"We are delighted with the result," U.S. Trade  Representative  Mickey Kantor said in announcing that Washington has decided to  drop retaliatory moves against Japan.    The cellular phone trade agreement, announced in Tokyo on  Saturday, came five days before Kantor was set to unveil a list  of Japanese products that would be subject to punitive import  tariffs.    Kantor hailed the accord, which commits the Japanese  Government to underwrite a commitment from Motorola's Japanese  partner to expand the American cellular system in the  Tokyo-Nagoya area, as the sort "results-oriented" trade pacts  Washington wants from Japan in the future.    "That is what portends for the future in our efforts to open  (the Japanese) markets," Kantor said at a news conference.    The agreement, which Motorola and its Japanese partner  Nippon  Idou Tsushin Corp. (IDO) concluded under prodding from U.S. and  Japanese Governments, has set specific terms the Japanese firm  must meet by December 1995.    Top among them includes a commitment by IDO, which operates  both a Motorola and a rival Japanese cellular system, to build  159 relay stations over an 18-month period.    That infrastructure facility would enable the Motorola  system  to cover 95 percent of the cellular market in a heavily  populated corridor extending from Tokyo to Nagoya.    At present, the Motorola cellular system can be used only in  40 percent of the localities in the Tokyo-Nagoya market.    The Motorola-IDO accord also commits the Japanese cellular  operator to freeze the development of the rival cellular system  developed by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) and  launch a sales campaign to promote the Motorola system.    Under a separate government-to-government accord, the  Japanese Government has also pledged to "monitor and oversee"  the completion of IDO commitments and review progress with the  U.S. Government every three months.    "This agreement validates our results-oriented approach,"  Kantor said.    President Bill Clinton also hailed the cellular phone accord  in his weekly radio broadcast Saturday as "a big win for  everyone."    "Workers in the United States will gain because the  agreement  means more demand for cellular telephones and related equipment  made in America. Japanese consumers win because they'll have  access to better service and better technology at better  prices," the president said.    Motorola President Christopher Galvin, who spoke to  reporters  after Kantor's press conference, said the infrastructure  facilities IDO has undertaken to build will give his firm 300  million dollars in extra business and create "hundreds of jobs"  in the U.S.</p>

			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Swiss stop the clock on Euro integration SWITZERLAND'S rejection yesterday of a free trade area linking Alpine and Nordic countries to the European Community means one small, wealthy nation has virtually ruled itself out as a candidate for EC membership. While Swiss diplomats voiced their dismay at the vote, other members of the European Free Trade Association such as Sweden, Norway and Austria remained confident that the European Economic Area would take effect next year as planned. However, the date for creation of an EEA, originally scheduled for January 1 to coincide with the single European market, will be delayed, probably until the second half of 1993. The British government, currently the EC president, put a brave face on the Swiss No vote. The Foreign Office stressed the benefits of the EEA, but said the outcome would be raised at a meeting of EC foreign ministers in Brussels today. Although the vote is a setback for Community efforts at widening integration, there was some quiet relief in Brussels. Switzerland's predilection for referendums and its entrenched tradition of neutrality have long been viewed with a degree of concern in Brussels. As a result, some diplomats and officials there had expressed reservations about Switzerland's application to join the EC and had been braced for a No vote on the EEA. The vote upsets the Swiss government's decision in May to apply for EC membership. Mr Frans Andriessen, the external affairs commissioner, said yesterday the Swiss had chosen isolation. A community official pointed out that EEA membership required countries to take on all EC legislation. 'It is the best preparation for eventual EC membership,' he said. The Swiss government had been adamant the country could not be content with EEA membership as it would mean taking on existing EC legislation without becoming full 'partners'. Now the dilemma about applying for the EC seems to have been cut short. On the shorter-term question of forging an EEA without the Swiss, the 12 EC member states and other Efta countries are likely to convene a 'diplomatic conference' to amend the treaty. This is a procedure set down in the event of the EEA's rejection by any of the Nordic and Alpine nations. British officials in Brussels say this conference probably cannot be convened in time to pass the revised treaty by March 1 1993, the second date provided for the EEA to start up, as signatories have to re-ratify the agreement once elements in it specifically relating to Switzerland are taken out. Progress on passing the treaty into national law was already patchy; only a handful of EC members have ratified it and, Switzerland apart, Iceland and Liechtenstein among the Efta group have still not pronounced. It was not clear yesterday whether the EC-Switzerland transit agreement  - regulating Community freight and lorry traffic through Swiss Alpine passes - will be a casualty of Switzerland's rejection of the EEA. Sweden, which among other Efta countries had seen the EEA as a stepping stone toward eventual EC membership, said it regretted the outcome of yesterday's vote. But it added it was confident the economic pact would go ahead. Mr Ulf Dinkenspiel, the Swedish trade minister, acknowledged it might take about six months to make the required adjustments for the EEA to come into force. But, he added, it was necessary to 'avoid any uncertainties' by reassuring the financial markets and European industry that the EEA was only being delayed for a limited period. The general view in the Nordic area was that the Swiss decision would not be a serious setback to European business. 'Its economic effects will be limited,' said Mr Dinkenspiel. Mr Bjorn Tore Gordal, Norway's trade minister, gave an optimistic assessment of the delay to the agreement. He believed a revised EEA agreement could come into force within two to three months. Under provisions for the 'diplomatic conference' of nations still involved in the EEA, governments will have to adjust the size of the proposed financial fund covering the EEA to allow for Swiss withdrawal. As part of the agreement, Efta countries joining the EEA had been expected to make small contributions to EC funding for poorer European regions - an annual net figure of no more than Ecu145m (Pounds 117.3m) or an estimated 0.02 per cent of Efta annual income. The Nordic countries have had no difficulty in securing support for the EEA. Only in Norway was there any sizeable opposition and this failed to mobilise a necessary one third of the votes in parliament to block its implementation. For at least the past 18 months the EEA agreement has been regarded increasingly in the Nordic region not as an end in itself but merely a step towards full EC membership for the countries of Efta. Sweden, Norway and Finland are waiting for this week's Edinburgh summit of EC heads of government for what they hope will be endorsement for negotiations to begin early in 1993 on their EC membership applications. Mr Carl Bildt, Swedish prime minister, is drawing comfort from last week's declaration by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand that Bonn and Paris would press for EC enlargement talks to start as soon as possible. The Nordic governments believe that neither the differences inside the EC over the Danish and British ratification of the Maastricht treaty nor the squabble over the EC budget will block the start of negotiations early in 1993.

			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO TEARS AS MARX FAITHFUL GATHER IN LONDON ON HIS 172ND BIRTHDAY  </P> <P> It has been a bad year for Communists, but there were no tears Saturday as the  diminished ranks of the socialist fraternity paid respects to Karl Marx,  commemorating his 172nd birthday.  </P> <P> Delegations from China, Mongolia and East Germany made a pilgrimage to the  London cemetery where the father of communism is buried, bringing flowers and  their versions of the kinder, gentler communism of the 1990s.  </P> <P> "It (Marxism) is not dead. Misinterpretation of Marx is dead," said Joachim  Mitdank, the East German ambassador. "We have more than ever before to make  correct interpretation."  </P> <P> Marx came to London in 1849 after being expelled from his native Germany. He  lived in London's Soho district, researching his criticism of capitalism, "Das  Kapital."  </P> <P> He died in 1883, his writings almost unknown.  </P></p>

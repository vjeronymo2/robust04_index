			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Money Markets: Trading in limbo UNCERTAINTY continued to dog the UK money market yesterday, with trading quiet and volumes low. 'We are in a sort of limbo period,' said one trader. 'What happens next is anybody's guess. But the Bank of England is playing with a totally straight bat, and seems to be saying the 10 1/2 per cent base rate is here to stay.' Sterling interbank rates firmed slightly, with dealers feeling the UK had passed up its best chance of a rate cut before the Budget on March 10 when the Bank of Spain cut its key money market rate on Tuesday by 25 basis points to 12.40 per cent. The key three-month interbank rate opened  1/32 higher at 10 5/16-10 1/4 per cent and later strengthened slightly to 10 3/8-10 1/4 per cent. The March short sterling contract opened one basis point higher at 89.87, but later dropped to 89.85. Overnight rates went as high as 12-10 per cent in the early afternoon before the market showed any interest, dropping back later to 11 1/4-11 1/8 per cent, compared with 10 11/16-10 9/16 per cent on Wednesday. The Bank of England initially forecast a shortfall of around Pounds 1.2bn, slightly higher than expected, owing largely to treasury bills and maturing assistance of Pounds 510m, and bills for repurchase by the market worth Pounds 692m. The Bank did not operate on the market on the early round, but later revised its forecast upwards to Pounds 1.3bn, and purchased bills totalling Pounds 203m. These were Pounds 100m of band 1 treasury bills purchased outright at 10 3/8 per cent, and Pounds 23m of band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent, together with Pounds 80m for resale to the market in equal amounts on March 17 and 18 at 10 7/16 per cent. The forecast rose again in the afternoon to Pounds 1.4bn, and the Bank purchased a further Pounds 841m of band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent and Pounds 12m of band 2 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. The Bank provided late assistance of around Pounds 310m. German call money rates were steady and traders said sufficient end-month liquidity meant rates were more likely to ease than to firm. Overnight rates were at 9.45/55 per cent, unchanged from Wednesday. In the US, the Federal Reserve drained reserves from the banking system through overnight matched sale purchase agreements. Federal funds were trading at 3 7/8 per cent at the Fed's operations time, slightly below the Fed's presumed 4 per cent target.</p>

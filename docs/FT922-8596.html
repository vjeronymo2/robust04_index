			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Kohl plea for German wage restraint MR HELMUT KOHL, the German chancellor, yesterday rejected any attempt to link new private sector pay deals to last week's public sector award of 5.4 per cent, and called for restraint in wage claims and public spending. In an urgent appeal to employers and trade unions, he threw his weight behind the austerity programme of Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, promising savings across the board in the federal budget, but no tax increases. At the same time, he warned that the rapidly rising wages in east Germany were undermining private investment flows and preventing the gradual equalisation of living standards between the two halves of the country. His appeal was launched at a combined meeting of employers, trade unions and the leaders of the 16 German states to discuss the continuing plight of the east German economy and the financial pressures on both public and private sectors. It comes at a moment when further strikes are threatened in the engineering and construction industries, as well as by print workers, in the wake of last week's pay deal for almost 3m public sector workers. It also coincides with crumbling popularity for his ruling coalition and widespread scepticism about the promised austerity programme in the light of the public sector award. 'This agreement was a very hard decision for us to take,' Mr Kohl said. 'Both for the whole economy and for public spending it contains incalculable risks.' Yet the government was forced to go 'beyond the limit' because of an arbitration award of 5.4 per cent, which aroused 'exaggerated expectations'. Mr Kohl also blamed unnamed state premiers and city mayors, who 'stabbed the negotiators in the back' by recommending a deal at the last moment. He rejected any attempt to link the deal with the private sector pay talks under way. 'There can be no pay leadership of the public service for the private sector,' he said. 'Every sector must reach a wage agreement which is bearable in relation both to the challenges of German unity and growing international competition.' He warned that east Germany was falling behind, with private sector investment per capita running at only two-thirds of the level in west Germany. Wages and salaries had reached 44 per cent of the western level in 1991, while productivity was only 29 per cent. The chancellor's appeal was met by stern resistance from the DGB, the trade union federation, whose leader, Mr Heinz-Werner Meyer, rejected any plea for a 'change of course' in wage talks. He also warned against any attempt to put the brunt of public sector spending cuts on programmes for retraining and cushioning the impact of eastern unemployment. The one positive sign for Mr Kohl yesterday was the agreement by the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) to take part in cross-party talks on the growing economic crisis on May 27. The federal budget this year is likely to have a net borrowing requirement of DM45bn (Pounds 15.3bn), and there is widespread scepticism that the government can reduce that to the planned DM25bn by 1995 without supplementary taxes, or without drastic cuts in social spending - both still ruled out by Mr Kohl. German trade surplus soars to DM 4.9bn</p>

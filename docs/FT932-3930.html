			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: ACT advances 20% to Pounds 20.5m ACT Group, the Birmingham-based computer software and services group, yesterday reported a 20 per cent increase in full year pre-tax profits underpinned by strong organic growth in its core financial software products business. Pre-tax profits advanced to a record Pounds 20.5m in the year to March 31, compared to Pounds 17m, which included exceptional investment profits of Pounds 1.04m. Turnover rose 28 per cent from Pounds 119.4m to Pounds 153m, including Pounds 7.11m from acquisitions. Earnings per share increased by 4.6 per cent to 11.33p (10.83p) and an increased final dividend of 3.25p (3p) per share is proposed making a total for the year of 5p (4.5p). Operating profits, including Pounds 1.15m from acquisitions, increased to Pounds 19.1m (Pounds 15m), while net interest income fell to Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 2.02m) mainly as a result of lower interest rates. The group ended the year with net cash of Pounds 25m. Mr Roger Foster, chairman, said the core financial software product companies, ACT Financial Systems and ACT Kindle, had 'an excellent year' with strong organic growth in sales and profits. They now represent more than 75 per cent of total profits. In financial systems a strong performance by the UK division was accompanied by further growth in the international subsidiaries. NMW Computers, which was acquired in November, has been successfully integrated and made a positive contribution in the second half. Kindle, the Irish banking software house, also maintained the strong organic growth experienced since its acquisition in December 1991 and continued its international expansion with orders from 25 new banking customers. Eastern Europe, in particular, was said to be becoming a significant area of new business. ACT's other main division, UK Software and Services, managed to improve its performance 'substantially' in the second half as a result of strong management action and increased demand. Second half operating profits jumped to Pounds 4.2m, against Pounds 1.4m in the first half. COMMENT These results answer some criticism of the group's rapid expansion through acquisition and show that ACT can indeed grow its business organically. Financial and banking software is now clearly established as the core business. The international market for financial and banking software is growing by more than 15 per cent a year and is also very profitable. ACT is itself becoming increasingly international with overseas sales now exceeding Pounds 30m. This year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 24m are likely, producing earnings per share of about 13.2p. Based on yesterday's close of 152p, up 9p, the stock is trading on a prospective p/e of 11.5 and is probably undervalued.</p>

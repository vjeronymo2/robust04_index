[Correspondent Vlada Vishnevskaya] Today the heads of the  state delegations at the Russo-Latvian negotiations, Sergey  Zotov and Martins Virsis, initialled an agreement on the  conditions and timetable for the withdrawal of Russian forces  from Latvian territory, an agreement on social security for  servicemen in the Russian army, military pensioners and members  of their families, and a treaty on the temporary functioning of  the Skrunda radar station.    So, the bilateral talks which have been going on for two  years have entered the concluding stage. The delegations have  managed to reach agreement on the fundamental question, the  timetable for the withdrawal of forces. Ten thousand Russian  servicemen will be withdrawn from Latvia by 31 August this year.  The problem of the lease payment for the use of the Skrunda  radar remains unresolved. Russia is offering 2 million dollars,  but this is not acceptable to the Latvians. However, the  leaders of the delegations believe that these disagreements  should not affect the final signing of the agreements which were  initialled today. The documents may be signed when the Russian  and Latvian presidents meet. According to the head of the  Russian delegation, this meeting could take place as early as  April.</p>

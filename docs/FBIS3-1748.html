With irresistible force, the private sector of  the economy, which started in the course of reform, is surging  ahead rapidly, presenting gratifying results. According to data  provided by the department of industry and commerce, by the end  of 1993 the number of individual businesses had risen from 489,  employing 501 people, in 1980 to 41,830, employing 65,579  people, at present. Their registered capital exceeded 170  million yuan. Total sales volume at rural markets throughout  the region topped 900 million yuan.    What do these impressive figures show?    There is only one answer: The ancient and quiet plateau is  opening its doors to the outside world; the people there are  emancipating their long confined minds and changing their  concepts.    The establishment of a market economy has injected new  vitality into Tibet's long-standing unitary economic mode.    The rapid development of individual enterprises on the  plateau can be attributed to the reform and opening up policies  and the relentless efforts of the regional party committee,  government, and departments of industry and commerce at various  levels. In recent years, in line with the reality of different  situations in different localities in Tibet, careful  preparations were made before any decision to concentrate on  cultivating markets, and this played a role in promoting the  development of individual businesses. By the end of 1993, Tibet  had established 99 markets of various types with a combined  floor space of more than 100,000 square meters. In 1993 alone,  the region invested 11.60 million yuan in building 23 markets,  improving on the previous situation in which stalls were set up  in roads, streets, and open areas.    Emancipating their minds and continually breaking new ground  in their march forward, administrative departments of industry  and commerce have simplified procedures for granting licenses to  individual business applicants, completely changing the old  situation in which friends had to be asked for favors when  people applied for business permits. This has greatly helped  individual businesses. In Lhasa alone, 5,300 new, individually  run enterprises were added last year, an increase of 56 percent  on 1992. As a result, the number of employed people in the  private sector rose by 102 percent while the sector's annual  turnover increased by 126 percent.    Individually run enterprises have flourished in Tibet since  the procedure for applying for a business permit was simplified,  making it unnecessary to ask favors of friends.    On 12 January the regional people's government officially  promulgated "Some Provisions on Accelerating the Development of  Individual Economic Undertakings." Even before the promulgation  of the provisions, though, individual businesses had been in  operation in Tibet for a year. But the provisions have helped  speed up the development of individually run businesses in the  region.    As far as figures are concerned, a characteristic of the  development of the private sector of the economy in Tibet in  1993 was that although the total number of individual businesses  was about the same as that of 1992, the number of workers they  employed rose sharply by 20,000; the net volume of registered  capital increased by over 70 million yuan; and the total volume  of trading at rural and urban markets throughout the region went  up by 21.6 percent, accounting for 47.36 percent of the region's  total retail sales.    This shows that the scale of the private sector of the  economy is expanding and advancing in the direction of intensive  and large- scale operation.    What is worth mentioning is that Chongsaikang market in  Lhasa, which accommodates 1,400 individual businesses, handled a  business volume of 340 million yuan last year. It has become a  large, comprehensive market dealing in both wholesale and retail  sales and handling more than 15,000 types of commodities, which  are distributed to most prefectures and counties in the  autonomous region. The rapidly developing individual sector of  the economy contrasts sharply with state-run enterprises, which  are struggling. Some people feel individual businesses have  edged out state-run enterprises and taken over the market. The  view of one entrepreneur was to the point when he said:  "Individual businesses are using their own money to create tax  income for the state, and the state does not have to bear any  risk or burden." Data show that in 1993 individually run  industrial and commercial enterprises paid more than 26 million  yuan in taxes to the state, accounting for 40 percent of the  region's total industrial and commercial taxes.    In fact, in Tibet, a region where the economy is backward,  transportation and information services are lacking, and which  relies on other provinces for the majority of its daily  necessities, the role played by the private sector of the  economy should not be doubted. In urban areas, rural areas, and  pastoral areas, individual businesses, like the light cavalry,  are playing an undeniable role in enlivening Tibet's rural and  urban economy, improving the circulation of commodities, and  providing convenience in the daily life of the masses.    Taking a look at the development of the region's  individually  run businesses, we can see that their prospects are bright.  However, Tibet's growth rate and scale of development are  insufficient compared to other provinces and regions. The  reasons are: People's awareness of commodities is still rather  weak; the market system has yet to be cultivated and improved;  industrial and commercial administrative departments, although  charged with administering markets, have themselves applied for  land to be used for the construction of markets -- this  continues to be a problem; and some other departments have  collected all types of fees and so "killed the chicken to get  the eggs," thus affecting the development of individual  businesses. Relevant departments have proposed that to boost  the development of individual businesses, we must thoroughly  implement all regulations that help the development of  individual businesses and at the same to strengthen propaganda,  improve management and services, crack down on illegal economic  activities, and encourage fair and rational competition. Only  this way can there be a new breakthrough in the development of  private sector economic undertakings.    It is expected that the private sector of the economy in  Tibet will continue to develop in 1994.</p>

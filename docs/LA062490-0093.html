			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE CELLULAR TELEPHONE INDUSTRY PROVIDES SERVICE AT PRICES THE MARKET IS  WILLING TO BEAR  </P> <P> The comments made by Los Angeles Assemblywoman Gwen Moore in "Cellular  Telephone Blues" (June 10) may be well intended, but she seems to be either  mis- or uninformed.  </P> <P> Cellular telephone service is anything but a fixed-cost business.  </P> <P> For every subscriber added to a cellular system, additional radios in each  cell, more telephone lines (for which operators pay a hefty fee to Pacific  Bell), more microwave equipment to link the cells to the central computer and  ultimately more cells (each at about $1 million) are required. And with the  increasing shift toward portable phones, there must be an investment in even  more cells with no reciprocal increase in revenue.  </P> <P> Cellular service is a premium product. There are a variety of cheaper mobile  communications alternatives; those who subscribe to cellular service do so out  of choice. Since when are we in the business of regulating what the market will  bear for a premium product? Should we regulate the price of a new Mercedes  simply because it has access to the public roads?  </P> <P> Let's also not forget that the street price of a cellular phone has dropped  from about $3,500 just six years ago to about $350 today. Would that have ever  happened in a regulated environment? And how many more people can now afford  this service as a result?  </P> <P> SCOTT GOLDMAN  </P> <P> Goldman Group -- International  </P> <P> Cellular Consultants  </P> <P> Calabasas  </P></p>

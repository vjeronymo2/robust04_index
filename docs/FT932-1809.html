			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help JLI leap 64% - New businesses contribute Pounds 1.16m to operating profits of Pounds 5.95m THREE acquisitions helped JLI Group, the dried fruits, nuts and pickle ingredients processor, lift pre-tax profits by 64 per cent, from Pounds 3.17m to Pounds 5.2m, in the year to March 31. The group bought food processors TG Smith (Fine Foods) for Pounds 800,000 in April and Cadec in June for Pounds 500,000, as well as packer and distributor Brookerpaks for Pounds 2.5m in September. Two rights issues in as many years, which raised Pounds 20.7m net, funded the acquisitions. Gearing fell from about 33 per cent to 14 per cent and interest payments to Pounds 734,000 (Pounds 940,000). The new businesses contributed Pounds 1.16m to operating profits of Pounds 5.95m (Pounds 4.11m) and Pounds 20.4m to turnover of Pounds 104.7m (Pounds 84.3m). Operating margins climbed for the sixth successive year, reaching 5.7 per cent (4.9 per cent). Earnings per share rose to 9.3p (8.8p, adjusted for the rights issues). The final dividend is 3.1p giving a total of 4.65p (4.5p). Mr Yoav Gottesman, chief executive, said: 'Our declared strategy is to improve the quality of our business and earnings through the development of higher margin, value added activities in food processing and distribution.' He said the company was aiming to grow organically and through acquisition. Devaluation of sterling will have an effect as the increase in relative raw material prices collided with the competitive squeeze on retail prices. The group said following the acquisitions its snacks division had 20 per cent of the UK nut market. The snacks businesses were now integrated under the renamed Tee Gee Snacks with a newly appointed managing director, Mr Peter Clee. In the ingredients division, Jack L Israel (Norfolk) and Langwoods, both food processors, had a 'disappointing year' with selling prices depressed by low fresh produce prices. However, Jack L Israel's distribution business performed well and the division benefited from acquisition.</p>

			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Steel rides high British Steel continued to strongly outperform the market, climbing 6 to 171 1/2p as investors took a very positive view of the company's buoyant trading prospects. A big US securities house, said to be Goldman Sachs, did most of the day's more aggressive bidding and 32m shares changed hands as the stock broke through to a new high for the year. On the back of firm steel prices and expanding production - output could rise by 5 per cent this year - the shares have outperformed the market by 12 per cent over the past month and by 34 per cent on a 12-month basis. US production is due to expand very strongly next year and new technology looks set to make British Steel one of the cheapest producers in North America. The talk among analysts is that US buyers of the stock, having run down their portfolios this year, could soon be in evidence. British Airways continued to lose ground, shedding 4 1/2 to 360p as four other major US airlines moved their trans-Atlantic fares down into line with the recent special offer from NorthWest Airlines. Some 3m shares were dealt and the stock was clearly out of favour ahead of next week's traffic figures for September, which are widely expected to make gloomy reading. Conversely, BAA has taken heart from the air ticket reductions, advancing 9 to 487p on the expectation of growing passenger volume. Its September traffic figures are due out on October 13. Shell Transport came in for keen support after a profits upgrade by Nomura, the stockbroker, whose analyst Mr Nick Clayton raised his current year profits estimate to Pounds 3.85bn. The Nomura analyst cited evidence of petrochemicals prices and volumes improving much more rapidly than previously expected as being behind the upgrade. The stock moved up to 697p before closing a net 4 1/2 ahead at 694 1/2p; turnover came to 3.2m. Switching from British Petroleum to Shell and evidence of renewed US selling of BP left the stock a poor performer in the London market at 398p, down 1, after 396p. News of the Pounds 58.4m rights issue saw Unichem tumble 22 to 276p. British Aerospace declined 4 to 464p against the general trend. The company's name has been linked with Fokker, of the Netherlands, over the development of a new 120-seater plane. But the main talk among traders was the possibility of an imminent takeover by the company, with VSEL, up 5 at 973p, said to be a likely target. Smiths Industries dipped 5 to 427p following a large sale order by SG Warburg at 422p, and Lucas Industries also went in the opposite direction to the market in very heavy turnover, easing 2 to 192p on 10m traded. Better than expected results triggered good support for Beazer, the housebuilding group, whose shares settled 8 higher at 131p. Among diversified industrials, Tomkins had another busy day with 7.2m shares traded and leading to a rise of 9 in the share price to 218p as the market took advantage of the clearing of a major stock overhang. Williams Holdings moved forward 7 to 344p following yesterday's presentation to City analysts. Bass, a weak feature after a trading statement from the group on Monday disappointed the market, rose sharply after a leading broker urged investors to buy the stock. It jumped 12 to 526p in trade of 2.4m, when Smith New Court suggested that investors, and income funds in particular, buy the shares for the healthy dividend expected with the group's final results. Bass made an interim dividend payment of 6.6p and Smith is expecting a dividend of 14.4p at the end of the year. Favourable results from property group Frogmore Estates not only boosted the company's shares but also cheered several other stocks in the sector. The shares responded by racing 25 ahead to 444p. A recommendation from Lehman Brothers boosted BAT Industries, which finished 11 ahead at 423p. Hotels group Forte, which reports figures today, put on 2 at 219p ahead of today's figures. Vague talk of a rights issue announcement with today's figures was heard early in the session, putting pressure on the stock. The talk had faded by the second half. The market was disappointed with figures from jewellery group Signet. The decline in the US market was of particular concern to analysts and several brokers downgraded full-year profits expectations by around Pounds 10m to Pounds 16m. The shares retreated 3 1/4 to 28 1/4 p. Other statistics, Page 43</p>

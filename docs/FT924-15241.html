			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Kiss-me-quick gives way to the stiff upper lip NEVER underestimate the dogged loyalty of the Conservative party's poor bloody infantry. Four election victories on, after all, most of those travelling to Brighton had expected this year's conference to be a riotous celebration. But on the prom yesterday, kiss-me-quick hats had given way to stiff upper lips, braced against an equally stiff southerly wind, choppy waters in the stock market and the news that sterling had plunged yet a further few pfennigs. It seems triumphalism has made way for a mood more akin to the Dunkirk spirit. Asked who to blame for the continuing recession, Mr Grenville Horsfall, a dour-faced manager from Halifax's 'amusement industry', was in no doubt. 'It's the Bundesbank,' he said, definitively absolving our embattled chancellor and blaming it on the Germans. Mr Norman Lamont, he insisted, could not be held responsible for the policies of Mr Helmut Kohl, the German leader, adding for comfort's sake that in the long term the downturn would be 'a mere blip on the screen'. And how was West Yorkshire bearing up? 'Well, they couldn't be any more against us than they were at the election,' butted in a companion, clearly trying to be helpful: 'And we didn't do too badly then.' All around the barricades of the Grand Hotel, a thin blue line of Sussex's finest stared out to sea, ready for most eventualities short of a full-blown invasion. Outside brave faces and robust sentiments were the order of the day. A retired test pilot and his wife from Northern Ireland were ready to pay for their patriotism from their pocketbooks. 'I was skiing in France this year with the pound at FFr11, next year it will be FFr8,' the pilot said. 'I think they should raise taxes to give a message to people that we are serious.' However, what was less clear among a random sample of representatives - as Conservatives at the conference are called - was what exactly the grassroots want the leadership to show it is serious about. There was a surprisingly clear message of support for the chancellor with representatives unanimously rejecting the calls for his resignation and emphasising that he had only been acting under prime ministerial orders when he devalued the pound. But views differed strongly over Britain's future relationship with the European Community. In spite of Mr John Major's insistence that the Maastricht treaty must be ratified, many argued for caution. And there was scepticism bordering on outright opposition about any return to the European exchange rate mechanism. Mr Jerry Froggett, a 21-year-old Leeds history student, was typical of many when he argued that Britain should be 'at the heart of Europe' while at the same time staying out of the ERM and rewriting the Maastricht treaty. Councillor David Bradbury of Dulwich, south London, a 30-year-old civil servant dressed in the tweed and brogues beloved by young fogeys, argued similarly that the prime minister should take the ratification of the treaty 'slower rather than faster'. 'Denmark must be accommodated,' he stressed, observing apparently without ironic intent that the party was less ill at ease than during the challenge to the leadership of the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Mr Phil McCullough, a retired Jaguar salesman from Hackney, east London, disagreed at least about Denmark. While emphasising that 'drastic decisions' had to be made, he counselled that the prime minister should proceed cautiously and ratify the treaty. 'There is a lot of support for Major,' he insisted, adding almost as an afterthought. 'The consensus is: we would not like to be in his shoes.'</p>

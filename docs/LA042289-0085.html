			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THE PLAY'S THE THING WHERE ROSE IS CONCERNED  </P> <P> When I first saw Pete Rose play baseball, I didn't like him. I thought he was  brash and arrogant and clumsy, and that nickname of his really grated on me,  "Charlie Hustle," as if nobody else ever hustled before. But then I watched him  dive headfirst and run over people and get a lot of hits and back up his talk  with wins and I started to respect and admire him not because he was perfect,  but because he asked no favor and gave none and always met his opponents head  on.  </P> <P> I would be disappointed if Pete bet against his own team but even that would  not sway my opinion of the man one bit.  </P> <P> Unlike many other present-day professional athletes who are only glad to be  where they are, Pete Rose wanted to be the greatest baseball player ever. And  now, with our goldfish bowl morality, we are trying to stain a legend. As far  as I'm concerned, Pete Rose is guilty of only one thing: living his dream.  </P> <P> LES KAMM  </P> <P> Escondido  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND TV;  </P> <P> IRAQI INVASION OF KUWAIT DOMINATES NEWS SHOWS  </P> <P> Public-affairs programs this weekend will be filled with sobering discussions  of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and what the rest of the world can do about it.  But some entertaining relief is in store Sunday night.  </P> <P> Fresh off 14 Emmy nominations, the two-hour pilot of "Twin Peaks," directed by  David Lynch, repeats Sunday at 9 p.m. on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42. If you  missed it the first time around, now's your chance to see what all the hoopla  is about. The darkly funny mystery stars Emmy-nominees Kyle MacLachlan, Piper  Laurie, Sherilyn Fenn and dozens more.  </P> <P> If you didn't get enough of Madonna when she was in town a few months ago, HBO  presents "Madonna -- Live! Blond Ambition World Tour '90" at 9 p.m. Sunday. The  song-and-dance extravaganza, scheduled to be broadcast from Nice, France, marks  the pop vixen's first in-concert TV performance.  </P> <P> Also Sunday at 9 p.m. on Channels 4, 36, 39, Jeff Fahey stars in "Parker Kane,"  a failed pilot about a zany cop who sets up a private-eye business out of a  Long Beach diner.  </P> <P> And since we all will have to wait at least two more months for a new episode  of "The Simpsons," Sunday's rerun about daughter Lisa's addiction to the blues,  8:30 p.m. (11)(6), stands as one of the Emmy-nominated series' most thoughtful  installments.  </P></p>

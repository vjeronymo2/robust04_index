			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Relying on Deepening Reforms To Solve Problems </F> Arising in Reforms -- On Relations Between Deepening Reforms and  Handling Contradictions Among the People"]    [Text] Reform means self-improvement and self-development  of our socialist system. In accordance with the requirements of  the development of productive forces, it naturally will adjust  the patterns and relationships of interests among various  quarters. Therefore, it inevitably will bring about many  contradictions. Today, in particular, when our reform has been  in full swing and has entered the stage of effecting a major  breakthrough, new reform measures have touched, or will touch  upon the depths of relations of social interests quite  extensively. This inevitably will cause more and more  complicated contradictions. Compared with the past, the present  contradictions among the people are more conspicuous,  widespread, and complicated. We should say that this is a  normal phenomenon that demonstrates a new economic system full  of vigor and vitality. It is advancing more rapidly to replace  the old economic system, which trammeled the development of  productive forces.    Therefore, in the fact of many complicated contradictions,  we  must neither feel puzzled nor shrink back. We must realize that  the old system not only trammeled the development of productive  forces and adversely affected the improvement of the people's  living standards, but also distorted interest relationships in  many aspects. This fostered discontent among the broad masses  of people. Under the old system, contradictions among the people  not only existed extensively, but also faced the possibility of  being intensified at all times. Therefore, at a glance, with  the deepening of reform, there are more and more acute  contradictions among the people. Actually, our production  relations and superstructure have become more suitable to the  development of productive forces. Distorted interest  relationships among various quarters and collectives are being  straightened out. Unity between the state and the people,  between the central and local authorities, between various  departments, between various units, and among the masses is  being strengthened. Facts have shown that reform is beneficial  to the stability of our country, social progress, and unity of  the people. Therefore, no matter how enormous the contradictions  we encounter, we must be firm and unshakable in deepening  reform, and must rely on deepening reform to solve problems  arising in reform. This is our basic idea for handling  contradictions among the people.    Why should we rely on deepening reform to handle  contradictions among the people? This is because complicated  contradictions among the people which have been brought about by  deepening reform are contradictions based on identical interests  of the masses, and contradictions arising in social progress.  However, if we fail to handle them in a timely fashion, there  might be negative results. Those nonantagonistic contradictions  might even become antagonistic contradictions. Leading organs  and cadres at all levels must attach importance to this matter,  and must work conscientiously and seriously to handle it well.    First, we must never waver in persisting in deepening  reform.  In the meantime, we also must control well the weight and pace  of reform, so that they conform with the capability of the  state, society, enterprises and the masses. This will enable us  to limit to a controllable scope the impacts and frictions  occurring in the course of replacing the old system with the new.    Second, reform is a large and systematic social project.  Various reform measures are mutually linked with and constrain  each other. If we fail to attach importance to coordination,  cooperation and mutual care, we tend to deepen reform in  isolation, or feel it difficult to advance or to retreat. This  will trigger thorny social problems. For instance, in reforming  our labor and employment system without the establishment and  improvement of our social insurance system, it will be difficult  for us to take a big step. If we act rashly, we are liable to  lose more than we gain. Let us take another example. If  enterprises fail to make marked progress in transforming their  operational mechanisms, it naturally will be difficult to turn  several large state-owned banks into genuine commercial banks.  If we move too fast, we might possibly "strangle" a number of  enterprises that originally stood a very good chance of success  in invigorating themselves. The examples cited above tell us  the truth: While promoting reform, we must adopt an overall  point of view to control well its progress and weight, so that  we can act in tacit agreement to advance reform in a coordinated  manner. In so doing, we can ease up many contradictions, and  avoid their intensification. This will make the work of  handling them easy.    Third, it is necessary for us to do thoroughgoing and  painstaking ideological work. The reform we are carrying out  proceeds from the greatest interests of the broad masses of  people. If we view adjustment of interest relationships and the  redistribution of certain power in an isolated way, we might  think that some people gain more than they lose, or vice versa.  As a whole, however, our success in reform will greatly  emancipate and develop our country's social productive forces,  and will vigorously arouse the enthusiasm of our entire people.  This will enable our motherland to become strong and powerful  more quickly, and enable our people to improve their livelihood.  Our people are always reasonable. As long as we can state the  reasons clearly, they not only can fully understand certain  inconveniences and difficulties brought to some of them by  contradictions arising in the present-day reform, but also can  actively help the government solve these contradictions, and be  of one heart and one mind to push forward our great cause of  socialist reform.</p>

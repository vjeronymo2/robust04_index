			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> $15 MILLION IN GRANTS AWARDED TO PRESERVE BOOKS, NEWSPAPERS  </P> <P> The National Endowment for the Humanities on Wednesday granted $15 million to  preserve old and rare books, newspapers and other resources that are in danger  of decaying.  </P> <P> The grants, ranging from $2,800 to $2.5 million, have been awarded to 25  institutions in 14 states, including the New England Ivy League schools  Harvard, Dartmouth, Yale and Brown.  </P> <P> The money will help libraries to preserve on microfilm books as well as  photographs, monographs and videotapes used in scholarly research that would  otherwise disintegrate from acid residues and be lost to future generations.  </P> <P> Harvard will receive $1.8 million, which it will use to microfilm more than  27,000 volumes on American and Italian history it began collecting when the  library opened in the 17th Century.  </P> <P> The university also will use the funds to microfilm its volumes on pre-Soviet  Russian law, much of which is no longer available in the Soviet Union, said  Sidney Verba, director of the university library.  </P> <P> "Our books about pre-Soviet Russian law are consulted by people from all over  the world, including Russia," he said. "We have many visiting scholars from  Eastern Europe because these books are either not available or not accessible  in their own countries."  </P> <P> Dartmouth College, in Hanover, N.H., will receive $409,000, which it plans to  use to microfilm some 650,000 pages of state newspapers.  </P> <P> Yale, in New Haven, Conn., was selected to receive $215,000 for the  preservation of some 4,000 volumes from its European history collection.  </P> <P> Endowment Chairman Lynne Cheney said the grants are the largest ever allocated  for preservation projects and will help save some 167,300 volumes nationwide.  </P></p>

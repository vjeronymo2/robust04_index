			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Arts: Smiles with the open-air Shrew - Theatre The open air season at Regent's Park has begun without the overwhelming need for an extra sweater or blanket and a slightly underwhelming production of The Taming of the Shrew which should mature with the summer. To be fair to the company, The Shrew is about the only Shakespeare work where you might have to apologise for the play rather than the performance. Apart from the taming, which even in former times could be seen as going a mite too far in the direction of female submissiveness, there is not much of a plot, there is no obvious motivation and one of the few memorable lines is the title. Yet the piece has always acted much better than it reads and to the credit of Toby Robertson, the director, he does not try to read any significance into the text that isn't there. The aim here is fun: smiles on a summer night. The colours are bright as if the circus or the commedia dell'arte has come to town. One man balances delicately on a large ball. Another is on a pair of stiletto stilts. The pantomime horse is more of a thoroughbred than an old nag. Paul Edwards, the designer, knows how to light up the park. The male and female leads are initially disconcerting. Geordie Johnson's Petruchio has the mid-Atlantic accent of someone slipping in from the movies. In fact, this slightly Errol Flynn approach is a good way of playing the part. Johnson is an experienced Canadian actor. Cathy Tyson's Katherina (the shrew) sounds as if she has come from Lancashire. There is no reason why she should, but equally no reason why she shouldn't. She seems thoroughly to enjoy herself. Petruchio breaks her in as you would break in a horse. At first both he and Katherina have whips: Petruchio ends up with both of them and the promise of a smooth ride - again a perfectly reasonable way to play a not very rational text. Where the production stars is in adding a bit to the induction scene at the end. The piece starts with Christopher Sly being thrown out of a hostelry, taken home by a lord and being induced to believe that he belongs to more aristocratic surroundings. He then watches The Shrew, but disappears from the text. In the Regent's Park version he darts around the audience while the play goes on, and is finally redeposited on the stage, drunk as at the start. When he awakes it is as if he has been through Bottom's dream. This is a wonderful way of demonstrating that Shakespeare really did have something to do with the the text. It also adds to the magic of Regent's Park. Sly is played by Dennis Clinton, who has a lot to do with making the production work: it slows down notably in part of the second act when he is not around. Incidentally, problems with The Shrew are as old as Shakespeare. The play was always being renamed and rewritten, whether as Catherine and Petruchio or Kiss Me Kate. It was not until 1844 that that the original version, including the induction scene, was revived at the Haymarket. No other Shakespeare play underwent such prolonged neglect. You can see why, but you can see also the timeless attraction of the central ploy. Open Air Theatre, Regent's Park, (071) 486 2431</p>

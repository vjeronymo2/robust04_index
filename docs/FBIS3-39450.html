			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Frankfurt/Main/Bonn (DPA) -- After warnings from  Bonn because of the conflict between China and Tibet, the Dalai  Lama, the Tibetan leader, has declined an invitation to the  1,200th anniversary of Frankfurt/Main. The Foreign Ministry had  warned the city that the simultaneous invitation of the Dalai  Lama and the mayor of Frankfurt's Chinese partner city of  Guangzhou could lead to "problems." On Wednesday [16 February]  the Dalai Lama's Swiss representative office declined the  invitation that Frankfurt Mayor Andreas von Schoeler (Social  Democratic Party of Germany) had extended to the Dalai Lama, who  lives in exile in India.    The 58-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner is calling for the  reestablishment of the autonomous status of Tibet, which is  under Chinese sovereignty. The statement of the Tibetan office  in Zurich says the Dalai Lama had been very sorry to hear that  his acceptance of the invitation had led to problems that had  been created without his fault "as a result of obviously  political motives." He wants to spare the city and its  population difficulties. He had been pleased with the  invitation, it was stated. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLYUNSATURATED: A WELCOME WORD ON LABELS  </P> <P> Question: I would appreciate it if you would clear up something that has been  confusing me. If I read a label on a food package and it says that it contains  no cholesterol, is that the same as saying that it's low in saturated fat?  </P> <P> Answer: A food item may not contain any cholesterol and still be high in  saturated fat. For example, baked goods that list either coconut or palm oil,  or a hydrogenated vegetable oil, may be high in saturated fat.  </P> <P> When you check food labels, try to select items that contain more  polyunsaturated than saturated fat, because polyunsaturated fat lowers blood  cholesterol. Vegetable oils high in polyunsaturated fat include corn, soybean,  safflower and sunflower oil.  </P> <P> Q: I have seen situations where a person is awakened at night to take some  medicine, and I could never understand this. I know that when I'm not feeling  well, the most important thing I want to do is to sleep, which I think does a  person more good than any medicine. Can you explain why someone should be waked  to take medicine or is it just foolishness?  </P> <P> A: The reason medicine is taken at specific intervals is so that the proper  amount can be kept in the bloodstream at all times. If there is too much, it  may have an adverse effect on the patient; if there is too little, the  medication may not do the job for which it was intended. Sometimes the exact  intervals are not very important; when they are, however, the patient may have  to be awakened.  </P> <P> Obviously, a little common sense never hurt anyone. I would not wake a patient  to give him a sleeping pill so that he will be able to go back to sleep.  </P> <P> Q: I would like some information about the drugs used to treat depression,  especially their side effects. If these drugs work the way they're supposed to,  won't the person want to take them all the time? To me, this means addiction.  </P> <P> A: There are a number of medications that may be prescribed for depression and,  compared with other drugs, they are rather safe. Moreover, these drugs are not  addictive even if taken for prolonged periods of time, which may be necessary  in some patients.  </P> <P> Antidepressants, like other drugs, do have side effects but these are rarely  serious. For example, the medication may result in drowsiness or cause the  patient's mouth to be dry. One way to avoid these effects is to take the  medication close to bedtime. This way, most of the side effects, if any, will  occur while the patient is in bed.  </P> <P> Q: I know that people can be allergic to drugs, but the only drug I ever hear  mentioned as causing an allergy is penicillin. Why is penicillin singled out so  much for causing allergies?  </P> <P> A: The reason you so often hear of penicillin being implicated in drug allergy  reactions is that it accounts for 90% of all such reactions.  </P></p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / BOC shares fall on flat payout note BOC, the industrial gases and healthcare group, yesterday disappointed the City by saying it would not increase its dividend this year. The company announces its dividend in advance. Its shares fell 30p to 596p on heavy turnover. Mr Patrick Rich, chairman, said: 'We've paid a handsome dividend during recession. We don't know what the future holds in terms of inflation and industrial growth, so the board decided to wait before dividend growth was resumed.' The dividend for the year to September 1994 would be 23.2p, the same as 1992-93. He added that improvement in the world's industrial gases industry 'will lag a more general economic revival. The outlook for business investment looks sluggish in leading markets.' BOC reported a 56 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 215m to Pounds 337m for the year to September 30. But this was flattered by the absence of exceptional charges - goodwill write-offs on disposals amounted to Pounds 117.1m in the previous year. Turnover increased by 13 per cent to Pounds 3.23bn, against Pounds 2.86bn, while operating profits rose from Pounds 412m to Pounds 420m. The results benefited from currency movements, in particular the strength of the US dollar. The changes added 10 per cent to turnover and 6 per cent to operating profit. Mr Rich said the UK upturn had not reached the industrial sector. Engineering output was down between 12 and 15 per cent since 1990. The US was recovering slowly, although there had been some recent acceleration. Japan was drifting, Germany static, Australia deteriorating and South Africa unsettled. The gases division increased turnover by 16 per cent to Pounds 2.29bn, while operating profits rose 5 per cent to Pounds 304m. Sales of liquefied gases grew in most markets, but demand for compressed gases for cutting and welding remained sluggish. Healthcare operations were hit by the expiry of the US patents on Forane, an anaesthetic. Turnover rose 9 per cent to Pounds 576m. Operating profits fell 13 per cent to Pounds 86m. Forane has lost 50 per cent of its US market share to generic competition in the nine months since its patents expired. The results were also affected by the high cost of launching Forane's successor, Suprane. So far it had won about 15 per cent of the Forane market. The vacuum and distribution services division generated operating profits of Pounds 33m, up from Pounds 19.4m, on turnover of Pounds 363m. Earnings per share (before the goodwill write-off) slipped from 44.15p to 42.97p. Lex, Page 26 Market, Page 58</p>

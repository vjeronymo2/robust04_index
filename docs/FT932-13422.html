			<p>930423 FT  23 APR 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Dental work to chew on If you want to prevent tooth decay you should be choosy about the type of artificial sweetener in your chewing gum, according to research from the Central American country of Belize. The 28-month study of 1,000 10-year-olds, conducted by Kauko Makinen of the University of Michigan Dental School, showed that children who regularly chewed xylitol-sweetened gum had half the new cavities of children who chewed gum containing rival sweeteners. The research was sponsored by Leaf, of Finland, which makes gum containing xylitol. Xylitol is found in fruits and plants and produced commercially from birchwood. Makinen says that unlike other sweeteners, xylitol helps neutralise plaque acids and so promotes natural remineralisation. Leaf: UK, 0272 511122.</p>

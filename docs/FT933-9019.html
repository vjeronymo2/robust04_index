			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Letter: Thorp; a testing option, and flawed economics (1) Sir, There is an elegant way to take the economic 'Nuclear decision' (Leader, August 5) to operate or to abandon Thorp. The government should apply its doctrine of 'market testing'. If the profits from Thorp are secure; if the risks are fully covered; if the government needs money to plug its budget deficit; then it should sell Thorp and its supposedly lucrative contracts to the private sector. Let it run the plant, bear the risks, make profits and pay tax. If this privatisation proves difficult, as I suspect it would, the government will have to ask why such an allegedly profitable venture cannot be sold and recognise the exceptionally unattractive risks it bears for the nuclear industry. This has to be better than relying on the conclusions of a report put together by British Nuclear Fuels. Marcus Birsel, 53 Sterndale Road, Hammersmith, London W14 0HU</p>

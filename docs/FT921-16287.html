			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Still alive - and biting VAMPYRES: LORD BYRON TO COUNT DRACULA by Christopher Frayling Faber &amp; Faber Pounds 17.50, 429 pages 'PRIVATE PERSONS may be Vampyres, or Blood-Suckers, ie Sharpers, Usurers and Stockjobbers . . . but nothing less than the Power of a Treasury can raise up a compleat Vampyre.' (Gentleman's Magazine, 1732). Bram Stoker began Dracula one hundred years ago. It was already an enduring and replicable myth, resistant to changing fashion and scornful of parody. Where did Stoker get his ideas? Or, more interesting, why is vampire literature alive and biting? Christopher Frayling has gathered a wide collection of Vampire literature in his Vampyres, a capacious book dripping with suspense and replete with horror. His excellent introduction tracks the history of vampire treatises from 18th-century Serbia to Stoker's 1897 classic, showing how Stoker synthesised elements of the folkloric vampire, the Byronic Lord, and the femme fatale in the same book. The first of these, vampire folklore from Silesia and Bohemia, had surfaced in English periodicals in the 1730s and 1740s, and was available to Stoker. The second, the Byronic figure, dates from 1816, when modern vampire literature began with John Polidori, Byron's physician. His The Vampyre was written in three mornings after spending the summer of 1816 with Byron, Shelley and Mary Godwin (the same party produced Frankenstein). Polidori's hero is an English aristocrat preying on impressionable women and society girls in Athens and London. It was the first Byronic vampire. Goethe had made vampires respectable in 1797 with The Bride of Corinth, but it took Polidori's book to make the vampire upwardly mobile, and Byron's reputation in the 1820s to add a social tang to the taste of blood - thus an 1820 Parisian account of 'ce Don Juan vampirique'. Stoker's third ingredient, the femme fatale Vampire arrived in 1820 with Hoffman's 'Aurelia' (from The Serapion Brethren), the tale of a dark-eyed and deathly-pale baroness who prefers warm blood to cool Chablis. Throughout the 19th century, Poe, Gogol, Dumas, Lynn Linton and de Maupassant produced vampire stories; but none was as chilling as Gautier's erotic La Morte Amoureuse of 'sea-green eyes and teeth of the purest Orient pearl' from 1836. Stoker himself was a compulsive note-writer and list-maker, as the holdings at the Rosenbach Foundation in Philadelphia and the Shakespeare Centre, Stratford-upon-Avon, clearly show. Stoker's environment comes over plainly: a wonderful list of Dracula's characteristics scrawled on Lyceum Theatre notepaper reminds one of his life in the theatre (he was Henry Irving's secretary and manager for 27 years); the 80 pages of notes for Dracula bear the imprint of Stoker's precise mind, right down to railway timetables and weather manuals. Frayling confirms the origins of Dracula ('Count Wampyr') in one of Stoker's dreams, scrawled on a scrap of paper in March 1890: 'young man goes out - sees girls - one tries - to kiss him not on the lips but throat. Old Count interferes - rage and fury diabolical. This man belongs to me, I want him.' (Sic.) As a postscript to the extracts in this crowded book, Frayling includes some revealing excerpts from Krafft-Ebing's 1886 Psychopathia Sexualis on decadence, and Ernest Jones's excellent Freudian account of vampires, On The Nightmare (1920). Frayling can be witty too, describing AN Wilson's introduction to the OUP edition of Dracula as 'anaemic.' One can be much more sanguine about Frayling's book, sharply-written and incisively edited. Psychologically, Vampirism seems to be nothing less than an incestuous, necrophilic, sado-masochistic free-for-all; anything goes, as long as it is taboo. Practically, Vampirism is best expressed by the perplexed lawyer in Dracula who pronounces with professional exactness on the Count: 'he left me under the impression that he would have made a wonderful solicitor.'</p>

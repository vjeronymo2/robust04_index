			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 23 KYODO -- The government's move to  freeze a planned hike in various public services charges will  give a psychological boost to consumers made cautious by the  recession, a senior government official said Monday [23 May].    Tsutomu Tanaka, vice minister of the Economic Planning  Agency, told a press conference that the freeze also will bring  about other favorable effects on the economy, by prompting  public utility companies which had planned to raise their  charges to undergo further restructuring measures.    The government announced last Wednesday that public fees  would not be increased this year, including those for telephone  services, taxis and national highway tolls.    Tanaka said he had been informed of the announcement the  night before.    Asked why Jiro Saito, vice finance minister, was not  informed  of the announcement until the next day, as he later complained,  Tanaka said that he himself was only informed apparently because  he was due to leave Japan on Wednesday for an Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development meeting in Paris.</p>

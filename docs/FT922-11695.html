			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Leading Article: Don't patent human genes THE NATIONAL Institutes of Health, the US government's medical research arm, has created turmoil in the biotechnology industry and outrage in academic science by filing almost 3,000 patent applications for human genes whose function is still unknown. The most prominent casualty of the storm so far is James Watson, who discovered the structure of genes 40 years ago. He resigned last week as head of the US-led Human Genome Project, part of a Dollars 3bn international effort to work out the entire genetic blueprint for human beings. Watson's bitter opposition to the NIH patenting policy was a primary reason for his forced resignation. Although the technical details of the dispute seem esoteric, the financial and medical implications are enormous. A large part of the biotechnology industry in the next century will depend on knowing the detailed sequence of human genes. Converting that knowledge indiscriminately into marketable intellectual property, as NIH is trying to do, would damage the development of the industry. It might also inhibit academic research leading to cures for diseases such as forms of cancer that cannot even be treated today. International action is needed urgently to sort out the confusion caused by NIH's precipitate action - which was taken with the approval of the Bush administration - and create a new framework for genetic patents. The OECD would be a suitable forum in which to develop an agreement outlawing the indiscriminate patenting of genes. It should still be possible to patent the discovery of individual genes whose function and potential commercial uses are specified. Pre-emptive strike Allan Bromley, President Bush's science adviser, defends the US move as a pre-emptive strike to defend the interests of the American taxpayer against private companies which, NIH believed, were preparing to bombard the Patent Office with similar applications. But it has already had a disastrous impact on international co-operation in genetic research. The UK Medical Research Council, backed by the government, is preparing to retaliate by filing US patent applications next month for more than 1,000 genes discovered by its scientists, using automatic sequencing machines like the NIH researchers. The MRC says it wants an international ban on such patents but in the absence of an agreement it has to 'protect the UK position'. Other countries with substantial DNA sequencing programmes - notably Japan, France, Germany and Italy - are not only opposing the US action but also resisting the temptation to retaliate like the MRC by filing their own patents. In characteristic style, Hurbert Curien, the French science minister, took the moral high ground with his declaration that 'a patent should not be granted for something that is part of our universal heritage'. National interests The European countries are angry with the MRC for condemning the NIH and then following its lead. But they are protecting national interests by refusing to send genes discovered by their scientists to an international DNA database which the MRC recently set up in London with EC funding. Their reaction shows how the NIH patent applications are inhibiting the information exchange that should underpin basic medical research. It is possible, of course, that the US Patent Office will resolve the problem simply by rejecting the NIH and MRC applications, on the ground that they fail to specify a practical use for the genes. If so, the biotechnology industry will breathe an immense sigh of relief. But experts say it would be unwise to count on this, because the US is remarkably liberal in its interpretation of what makes a valid patent. Biotechnology is already bedevilled by disputes over intellectual property, which have enriched hundreds of patent lawyers over the past decade while inhibiting the development of the industry. But the NIH move on gene fragments brings a threat of patent wars on an even larger scale. It will be in the interests of all parties - even the US taxpayers whose interests NIH claims to protect - to agree that mass-produced genes cannot be patented.</p>

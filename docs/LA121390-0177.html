			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEST BET  </P> <P> For a sweet taste of Old California, try Saturday's do-it-yourself orange  picking at La Verne's Heritage Park.  </P> <P> Right behind the park's 100-year-old Weber House are about 300 citrus trees,  most fairly bursting with ripe navel oranges.  </P> <P> The entire La Verne area used to be filled with orange and lemon groves, and  the self-serve harvest is meant to remind people of that time, as well as to  raise money for the park, said Craig Walters, president of the La Verne  Heritage Foundation.  </P> <P> In addition to a citrus grove, the park includes a stand of pepper trees, a  children's play area, an expansive, centuries-old oak tree, and a World War I  vintage barn that houses restroom facilities.  </P> <P> The historic house and barn were moved to the site. The orange trees are the  last from an actual grove. They were saved  </P> <P> through the care of a former citrus ranch hand who watered the trees on his own  for years before the city took up active maintenance of the park.  </P> <P> There is no entrance fee, and the oranges are cheap -- $4 for a 10-pound bag  that you can fill yourself or allow volunteers to fill for you. Many oranges  are hanging low enough for small children to reach.  </P> <P> And there is no extra fee should you decide to pick up a paintbrush and help  volunteers whitewash the old barn, an activity also scheduled for Saturday.  </P> <P> The plucking and painting will last from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Because oranges ripen  according to their own schedule, there'll be more picking allowed on Jan. 5,  and on alternate Saturdays until the fruit is gone.  </P> <P> The park is on Via De Mansion, just east of Wheeler Avenue.

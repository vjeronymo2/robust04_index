			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / MPs go shopping among rival plans for Sunday trade: Neil Buckley explains why the issue has prompted a highly unusual move by the government this week THE BATTLE over Sunday trading in England and Wales will enter a new phase this week when the government publishes its long-awaited options bill on Tuesday. About 145,000 shops already flout the 1950 Shops Act by opening on Sunday. Many councils have long since given up trying to prosecute them, even though a European court ruling in December upheld their right to enforce the law. The government's determination to sort out the issue is demonstrated by its decision to take the highly unusual step of giving MPs four choices. They will be allowed a free vote in the autumn session of parliament to decide which of the options forms the basis of new legislation. The issue has caused deep rifts among retailers, as large sums of money are at stake. The John Lewis Partnership says upholding the law and refusing to open on Sundays costs its Waitrose grocery chain Pounds 1m a week in lost sales. Many retailers do not want to be forced by competition to open on Sundays, as they say the extra costs are not compensated for by sales. The options that will be presented to MPs are already well known, as they are largely based on proposals from different lobby groups. They are: Total deregulation, allowing all shops to open on Sundays, as in Scotland. Partial deregulation, based on the proposals of the Shopping Hours Reform Council. This would allow shops below 3,000 sq ft unrestricted opening, but larger shops could open for only limited hours, say from 10am to 4pm. This option is supported by the big supermarket chains including Sainsbury and Tesco, and retail group Kingfisher, which includes the Woolworths, Comet, B&amp;Q and Superdrug chains. Limited opening, based on the proposals of the Retailers for Shops Act Reform (RSAR). Food and convenience shops of less than 3,000 sq ft, as well as DIY shops and garden centres, would be allowed to open on Sunday. Banks, building societies, estate agents and travel agents could also open. Other shops would be barred from opening except for the last four Sundays before Christmas. The option is supported by some of the UK's largest retailers, including Marks and Spencer, Burton, Gateway and House of Fraser. Limited opening, based on proposals of the Keep Sunday Special campaign (KSS). This is the same as the RSAR option, except that it would not allow all retailers to open for the last four Sundays before Christmas, nor would banks, building societies, estate agents and travel agents be permitted to open. This option is supported by many smaller retailers. The publication of the bill is likely to be only the start of an intense round of lobbying and dispute among retailers. The large food retailers have already attacked the RSAR proposals for ignoring the wishes of consumers. The KSS is also angry at the late entry of the RSAR into the debate, with proposals which are similar to its own. It fears the move may split the vote among MPs who support limited opening. One area of continuing debate is likely to be worker protection. The bill is expected to give the right to refuse to work on Sundays, whatever option is chosen, to existing employees. But the KSS is demanding this should be extended to all future retail employees. It is also calling for double-time payments for Sunday working. The Shopping Hours Reform Council has also called for unspecified 'premium' payments for Sunday working, but the bill is expected to make no reference to this. Intense debate is also likely to surround the voting system, which is yet to be determined, with retailers and campaign groups anxious to see a system that gives each option a fair chance of being adopted.</p>

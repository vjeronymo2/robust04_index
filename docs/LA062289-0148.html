			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BERTHING PAINS;  </P> <P> MERCHANT SEAMEN'S FLOATING MEMORIAL UNWELCOME AT PORT  </P> <P> The merchant ship Lane Victory, a hulking, 455-foot-long, 7,000-ton vessel that  had been mothballed near San Francisco for two decades, has made its grand  entrance at the Port of Los Angeles, where it is tied up at Berth 55 and is  creating quite a stir.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Harbor Department doesn't want it there.  </P> <P> But that hasn't stopped a feisty bunch of crusty old seamen who are trying to  convert the former cargo ship into a museum that would honor their comrades who  died at sea. Last week, the group, members of the U.S. Merchant Marine Veterans  World War II, defied port officials and arranged for their ship to be towed to  Los Angeles Harbor, knowing they had no place to berth it.  </P> <P> "They were towed down from San Francisco, essentially without a place to go,"  Harbor Department spokeswoman Julia Nagano said. "They had no prior  authorization."  </P> <P> Confronted with the possibility of having a homeless, non-functional ship in  port, the Harbor Department -- aware of the public relations blunder it might  create by turning the veterans away -- told the seamen that they could use the  temporarily vacant Berth 55 for a week.  </P> <P> The week was up Monday.  </P> <P> But the ship is still there.  </P> <P> And the veterans, claiming port officials are money-hungry and unwilling to  make room for them, staged a press conference on board the Lane Victory on  Tuesday to call attention to their campaign.  </P> <P> "We're going to stay right here," declared 76-year-old Joseph B. Vernick of  North Hollywood, the president of the group. "We have no place to go. We're  orphans."  </P> <P> Replied Nagano: "It is unfortunate that the port is being accused of being  insensitive to this project. We're sympathetic to their needs and we are  concerned, but we do need to maintain the efficient operation of the port."  </P> <P> The standoff between the Harbor Department and the veterans was resolved,  temporarily at least, when the department told the seamen that they could have  until this coming Monday to move. As of Wednesday afternoon, the seamen were  still on board the Lane Victory and Vernick was working the phones, trying to  drum up political support and arrange for a negotiating session with harbor  officials, in an attempt to buy the ship even more time.  </P> <P> Such tactics are nothing new to the Long Beach-based U.S. Merchant Marine  Veterans World War II, a nationwide group of nearly 7,000 merchant seamen. This  week's dispute with the Harbor Department is just the latest twist in a battle  that the tenacious merchant seamen have been waging for years from a cramped  office on the fifth floor of the U.S. Post Office building in Long Beach.  </P> <P> In 1982, the veterans began trying to persuade the federal government to give  them a ship that they could convert into a floating memorial. Last year, after  U.S. Rep. Glenn Anderson (D-San Pedro) took up their cause, Congress finally  agreed. What the seamen got was the 44-year-old Lane Victory, built at Los  Angeles Harbor and used to ferry supplies and ammunition to U.S. troops during  World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War.  </P> <P> The ship's interior is remarkably intact. The bunks are still made up with blue  blankets and white pillowcases, and the file cabinets are full of interesting  finds -- including a nearly complete set of invasion plans, marked "top  secret," for Iwo Jima, Okinawa and the Japanese Islands, and 20-year-old  letters of reprimand in which AWOL merchant seamen had their pay docked at the  rate of $22 a day.  </P> <P> "This here is a treasure trove," said Fred Ripley, a volunteer with the Los  Angeles Maritime Museum who has been working with the merchant seamen.  </P> <P> And so what if its hull is a little bit rusty and its engine doesn't work?  "Cosmetics, that's all cosmetics," Vernick insists. "It's a cream puff."  </P> <P> While that may be overstating things, Vernick and his fellow seamen -- most of  them retired -- believe that they will have no trouble refurbishing the ship  themselves. They want to open the Lane Victory to tourists within a year, in  much the same fashion as their counterparts in Baltimore and Northern  California have done with other merchant marine ships, such as the Jeremiah  O'Brien, which is berthed at Ft. Mason, near San Francisco.  </P> <P> But first, Vernick's group must find a berth. That's where the Los Angeles  Harbor Department comes in.  </P> <P> The seamen have demanded that harbor officials give them Berth 87 at the Port  of Los Angeles as a permanent home for their ship. That berth, in San Pedro, is  near the Los Angeles Maritime Museum and a statue that honors merchant marine  veterans, as well as other tourist attractions, such as the port's World Cruise  Center and Ports O'Call Village.  </P> <P> To the seamen, Berth 87 is the perfect -- indeed, the only -- site for the  memorial, which Vernick said will be "dedicated to the thousands of merchant  mariners that perished fighting for freedom to make this harbor what it is  today."  </P> <P> Port officials, however, are trying to lease Berth 87, which is now unoccupied  but houses a cargo container terminal. The terminal brings about $2 million a  year in revenue to the port, according to Mark Richter, assistant director of  property management.  </P> <P> "But the compensation is not the point," Richter said. "The point is that we  are short of cargo space and we're hardly in a position to declare a terminal  of this kind surplus."  </P> <P> "It is out of the question," Nagano added. "Not a possibility."  </P> <P> Port officials want the seamen to consider a berth in Wilmington, but Vernick  and the others won't hear of it. They say the Wilmington site, in an area that  is slated for redevelopment, won't be ready for tourists for at least another  five years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Offer of Free Tow  </P> <P> The aging veterans don't want to wait. As Vernick said recently: "Let's face  it. I want to see the ship down here before I kick the bucket."  </P> <P> So last week, when the seamen received an offer to have the Lane Victory towed  from Suisun Bay to Los Angeles free of charge, they took it. "Greatest thing  that ever happened to us," Vernick said, although he acknowledged that he is  not quite certain what will happen next.  </P> <P> Port officials say they know what will happen: If the Lane Victory is not gone  from Berth 55 by Monday, they will tow it out into San Pedro Bay and anchor it.  </P> <P> Vernick, however, remains confident that compromise is coming, both on the  short-term use of Berth 55 and the long-term use of Berth 87. "Ultimately," he  said, "we're going to win out. There's no question in my mind."  </P></p>

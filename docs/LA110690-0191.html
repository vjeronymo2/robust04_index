			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> MICHIGAN STATE QB ARRESTED  </P> <P> Michigan State quarterback and co-captain Dan Enos faces a charge of disorderly  conduct for allegedly urinating in public, police said.  </P> <P> Enos was with a group of friends, none of them football players, when arrested  Sunday about 1 a.m. and spent the rest of the night in jail, said East Lansing  police Capt. Richard Murray.  </P> <P> He was released on personal recognizance bond, Murray said.  </P> <P> The misdemeanor is treated the same way as a traffic ticket Enos has 10 days to  appear in court and plead guilty or innocent.  </P> <P> "Everything I asked him he vehemently denied," said Clarence Underwood,  Michigan State's assistant athletic director. "What he's accused of he's not  guilty of. I talked to him for 45 minutes and I do believe his side of the  story."  </P> <P> The university hasn't planned any action against Enos, he said.  </P></p>

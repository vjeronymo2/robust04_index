			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> REDSKINS' GIBBS SETS HIS SIGHTS ON DISCOVERING A BETTER PUNTER  </P> <P> Joe Gibbs has given his punters a blunt public message.  </P> <P> "I think this is an important week for us," the Washington Redskins coach said.  "We've been fooling around here for a while, about four or five weeks. We need  somebody to step up and show us he can do it, or we've got problems. Now is the  time."  </P> <P> As the Redskins begin a stretch of two games in five days -- Monday night  against the Minnesota Vikings in the Metrodome and Friday night against the  Miami Dolphins at RFK Stadium in Washington -- Gibbs' message applies to  several other players besides punters Greg Horne and Richard Tuten.  </P> <P> After the Redskins play these two games, they'll have to make the mandatory cut  to 60 players Aug. 29.  </P> <P> They'll then have only one exhibition game left -- in New Orleans against the  Saints on Sept. 1 -- before they open the regular season Monday night, Sept.  11, against the New York Giants.  </P> <P> The Redskins are getting close to decision time. For players fighting for  roster spots, there's not much time left.  </P> <P> For example, Horne, a Plan B free agent signed from the Phoenix Cardinals, went  into camp favored to beat out Tuten, who was cut by the San Diego Chargers, for  the punting job.  </P> <P> But neither Horne nor Tuten has distinguished himself, and the job is up for  grabs.  </P> <P> Horne said he's been punting well in practice, but he's been pressing in the  games.  </P> <P> "I've got to get over that in a hurry," Horne said.  </P> <P> Wayne Sevier, the special-teams coach, said if neither of the punters steps  forward, "We'll make a decision and we'll live with it."  </P> <P> Sevier hopes one of them will make it an easy decision.  </P> <P> "You'd like to have somebody win it on the field instead of us having to make a  sort of subjective decision," he said.  </P> <P> The punters won't be the only players under the microscope. The battle for the  fourth wide receiver-kick returner spot continues with Stephen Hobbs getting a  look this week. Newcomer Joe Howard also figures to get a look as a returner.  </P> <P> Of course, much of the attention will focus on the quarterback slot, where Stan  Humphries will make his first start in a Redskins uniform, Bill Kenney will  make his first appearance in a Redskins uniform and Mark Rypien will get a  chance to finish up.  </P> <P> Although Rypien is expected to start the season because Doug Williams is  ailing, Rypien really is the only starter on offense who's not entrenched,  except at wide receiver where three players -- Art Monk, Gary Clark and Ricky  Sanders -- are sharing the two starting jobs.  </P> <P> If Williams hadn't suffered a nerve root irritation in his back, he would have  been the incumbent quarterback. But it now looks as if the Redskins will go  into the season without both Williams and running back Kelvin Bryant. Both  eventually may go on the physically-unable-to-perform list and miss the first  six games.  </P> <P> Bryant was ruled out of contact work Saturday for six more weeks after being  examined by a Los Angeles physician. Trainer Bubba Tyer said, "This thing with  Doug and Kelvin hangs over us like a cloud. We need answers, and camp is  breaking within a week. Coach Gibbs has to know how to put this team together."  </P> <P> On defense, there are battles for starting jobs at defensive end (Dexter Manley  vs. Markus Koch), defensive tackle (Curtis Maxey vs. rookie Tracy Rocker),  middle linebacker (Greg Manusky vs. Neal Olkewicz) and free safety (Todd Bowles  vs. Barry Wilburn).  </P> <P> The veteran facing the toughest fight is Olkewicz, because he knows the  Redskins aren't going to keep a 32-year-old, 11-year veteran around as a  backup. He has to win the starting job to keep a job.  </P> <P> Larry Peccatiello, the linebackers coach, said he'll pull Olkewicz after the  first two series again so he can get a long look at Manusky and Don Graham, a  Plan B free agent.  </P> <P> But Peccatiello said the long looks other players are getting doesn't mean  Olkewicz is being phased out.  </P> <P> "The guys (Manusky and Graham) he's competing with haven't exactly reached out  and taken the job. We're not giving the job to anyone. Somebody's got to take  it from Olkewicz, and that hasn't happened yet," Peccatiello said.  </P> <P> He added, "Don't discount Neal. There's a lot to be said for trust and  confidence and experience."  </P> <P> Olkewicz considered retiring in the off-season, but said four factors persuaded  him to return for one more season -- he had a what he called a "decent year"  last season, he was free of injury, he didn't want to end his career with a  losing season, and his wife became pregnant, giving him "another mouth to  feed." His first son -- and second child -- was born during the weekend.  </P> <P> Olkewicz isn't worrying about his fate. "I'm not going to mope around," he  said. "I have no control over it."  </P> <P> He also has no idea what the coaches are thinking. "I'll be the last to know,"  he said. "Team sources will tell the reporters. My goal is to find out who the  team sources are before I leave."  </P> <P> Peccatiello said: "The coaching staff won't be surprised if he's our starting  middle linebacker Monday night (in the opener)."  </P> <P> What happens this week may determine whether Olkewicz can survive his last  challenge.  </P></p>

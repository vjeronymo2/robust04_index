			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> OFFICIALS FLAGGED FOR CALLS  </P> <P> To this day, Dave Parry wonders how he missed the call. The former NFL  official, now in his first year as supervisor of Big Ten football officials,  knows the Houston Oilers were one of the teams involved in his mistake. He  doesn't even remember the other team, but that's understandable, considering he  spent 15 years calling penalties as a side judge in the league.  </P> <P> What he always will remember about the play is that he blew it.  </P> <P> "I don't know if I was daydreaming or just drew a blank," Parry said over the  phone from his home in Michigan City, Ind. "But someone from the Houston Oilers  wound up and threw a haymaker punch and I just missed it. The players came up  to me and complained, and I had to tell them I didn't see it.  </P> <P> "Then I saw the tape of the game, and I said, 'My gosh, how did I miss that?' I  was very embarrassed."  </P> <P> Perhaps this is why Parry reacted not with rage, but with a knowing sigh of  resignation, when earlier this season officials missed an Illinois forward  lateral on an important touchdown against Ohio State, or when they failed to  call pass interference on Michigan State as then top-ranked Michigan went for  -- and missed -- the winning two-point conversion at the end of the game a week  later.  </P> <P> It was a difficult stretch for the Big Ten, just as it has been a difficult  year for officials everywhere. Missed calls, a controversial fifth down,  outraged coaches, enraged players, instant-replay snafus, lengthy delays: it  all has happened in the 1990 football season, college and pro.  </P> <P> "We are not perfect; we are people," Parry said. "I don't know anyone who feels  worse when they make a mistake than do officials."  </P> <P> To some, this might be a revelation: Officials are people too. They are  well-trained but not full-time; they are graded but rarely suspended; they are  paid but not well. They are avid sports fans who weren't quite good enough to  play the game at the level at which they officiate it. They love the smell of  stadium grass; some of their favorite people are longtime assistant coaches  with whom they chat in the hour before kickoff. They crave anonymity in a world  of high-priced headline grabbers, from the field to the owners box. When they  do their best, they go unnoticed.  </P> <P> "When I was on the field, I remember players lining up for a play and saying to  myself, 'God, am I fortunate to be here,' " said Art McNally, the NFL  supervisor of officials since 1973 and a longtime official of football,  baseball and basketball at all levels. "A half-hour before the game, I'd get my  feet down on the grass or AstroTurf and talk to the assistants, like the  Redskins' Wayne Sevier. Not only are the officials my guys, but the coaches are  my guys."  </P> <P> Nice guys or not, there have been a tremendous amount of embarrassing gaffes  this year.  </P> <P> It's impossible to forget the sight of an enraged Boomer Esiason screaming at  the officials during one of several drawn-out rules discussions in Cincinnati's  34-13 Monday night victory over Cleveland last month. The problem, in Esiason's  mind, was the way the crew of referee Bob McElwee decided to take away a  touchdown, then debate the offensive-line formation. A source close to the  officials said they decided to double-check their decision as a courtesy to  Esiason when he became so upset.  </P> <P> In that game they also debated whether a Bernie Kosar pass was a lateral that  could be recovered by the defense. Then the question became whether the play  had been whistled dead with the ball on the ground. And, finally, the crew lost  count of the downs and nearly took a play away from Cleveland.  </P> <P> "The game was way out of hand," Esiason said.  </P> <P> There were problems the week before in the Minnesota-Philadelphia game, with a  quick whistle on a Herschel Walker fumble, a muffed interference call on wide  receiver Cris Carter and a controversial holding penalty on safety Joey  Browner.  </P> <P> And then there were the back-to-back Big Ten games officiated by the same crew  in early October.  </P> <P> Parry attended the Illinois-Ohio State game, watched the forward lateral that  allowed Illinois to put a close game out of reach and joined the crew  immediately afterward.  </P> <P> "Fellas," he said to them, "I saw the replay and we missed it. It was forward."  </P> <P> The officials looked up at him in silence.  </P> <P> "Oh, you could hear a pin drop," Parry said, with sadness in his voice. "They  just felt terrible."  </P> <P> The next Saturday came the non-call on Michigan State's pass interference.  </P> <P> "Two or three officials could have called it, but none did," Parry said. "The  mistake was made when the people looked up to see the status or position of the  football and looked back and saw tangled bodies. I understand the thinking  process of the people involved, but it couldn't have come at a worse time, with  the fifth-down situation as well as the lateral."  </P> <P> (The fifth down came in the Colorado-Missouri Big Eight game of Oct. 6, the  same day as the Illinois-Ohio State game. The officials mistakenly gave  Colorado a fifth down at the end of the game and the Buffaloes used it to score  the winning touchdown on a one-yard run. Colorado now is No. 2 in the  Associated Press poll.)  </P> <P> Parry speaks for his officials because the league asks that they don't speak  for themselves and discuss their work in public during the season. This isn't  unusual. The NFL will not allow its officials to talk to reporters during the  season except after games, and only about specific plays.  </P> <P> "We just make it simple, no interviews," said McNally. "We will not break from  that."  </P> <P> So the people who talk about them, and their profession, are their supervisors  or former officials. Some, like Parry, are both.  </P> <P> Officials say there is a split second to make a call, and no more. It's the  time that differentiates between right and wrong, the time that makes the good  officials good and the bad ones bad.  </P> <P> "There's a moment of truth, and then it's gone," Parry said. "Both the Ohio  State and Michigan situations were like that. It's a moment when all is right  for the right call, or all is wrong for the wrong call. It's all there for you,  and then it's over."  </P> <P> The making of a call is not so quick it cannot be dissected, Parry said.  </P> <P> "Some of it is training, some of it is instinct," he said. "All the years of  training, all the years of meetings, are wrapped into that decision. If a play  is so close it takes time for you to think about it, it's probably not a foul.  A foul should be an instinctive thing."  </P> <P> Said Norm Schachter, a veteran of 23 NFL seasons who now writes weekly rules  quizzes taken by all NFL officials: "I don't think there is a feeling. You see  it, you throw it."  </P> <P> These instincts are honed over time. All officials who make the big time have  been at it for dozens of years. They undoubtedly began officiating high-school  games for $10 or $15 a game, worked their way to college games and, for some,  made it to the NFL. Football wasn't their only game; in one year in the early  1950s, McNally worked 269 games, including some nights of three consecutive  basketball games.  </P> <P> Officiating wasn't their only job, and still isn't. Even in the NFL, these men  are moonlighting. They are school teachers, businessmen, engineers, sales  managers, physicians, insurance agents. NFL officials -- there are 107 of them  -- travel to their game cities on Saturdays to meet and review both their last  game film and a weekly training film. They take the rules quiz Sunday morning,  discuss the teams they will see in very general terms ("They're never allowed  to talk negatives," McNally said), then work the game. They get home late  Sunday or early Monday.  </P> <P> They don't do it for the money: NFL rookies make $600 a game, 20-year veterans  earn $2,000 a game. The top-notch officials, so deemed by a weekly grading  system, get to work the playoffs, where they make $5,000 a game until the Super  Bowl. In that game, they earn $7,500.  </P> <P> Every NFL player makes more than the officials.  </P> <P> In the Big Ten, the 44 officials earn $400 a game and are required to review  their game tape and a training film Friday night and watch a tape of their game  almost immediately after it ends Saturday. Many of them drive to Parry's house  for a weekly Wednesday night meeting in his basement to go over plays,  coverages, mechanics and rules.  </P> <P> "Some drive three to four hours one way and they don't even get mileage," Parry  said. "The fact that they take the time shows you what kind of people they  are."  </P> <P> The fact they don't hate instant replay also tells you something. There are no  formal polls on the subject, but, as Parry said of his NFL officiating days,  "You always hope you're right. You stand on the field and wait and when the  call stands, you feel good. When they overrule you, however, you get a  sickening feeling in your stomach."  </P> <P> "I wish I had had instant replay," said Schachter. "I never would have made a  bad call."  </P> <P> Over the years, quite a few NFL coaches have wondered aloud if officials  shouldn't be full-time. Their criticism is that if the coaches and players work  full-time, the officials should, too.  </P> <P> "This comes up on occasion," McNally said. "But there are some problems with  it. A minimum of 60 percent of our officials could not go full-time, so we'd  probably lose a lot of them. If we played games Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and  Sunday, then I'd say, 'Let's cut the staff down and go full-time.' Right now,  with games just on Sundays and Mondays every week, crews can work just one  game.  </P> <P> "Then there's the problem of what the officials would do during the week if  they were full-time," McNally continued. "I'm not certain it would be best to  have them go to team practices during the week, where they are not working  under game conditions."  </P> <P> So, unlike the officials in professional baseball, basketball and hockey, who  work full-time in season, NFL officials remain part-timers with other lives to  lead.  </P> <P> "It's very tough for the people involved," Parry said. "The loved ones hurt  too. Your wife goes to the grocery store and people point fingers. Your kid  goes to school and other kids make comments.  </P> <P> "Fortunately, we've still got people who are willing to do this. How would you  play the games without them?"  </P></p>

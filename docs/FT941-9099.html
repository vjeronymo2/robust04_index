			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: Regulators lift strict supervision of Citicorp Citicorp announced yesterday that federal banking authorities have agreed to end their strict regulatory supervision of the large US banking group. The decision is likely to pave the way for Citicorp to reinstate its dividend, which has been suspended since late 1991. The strict regulatory surveillance - known as a memorandum of understanding  -was imposed on Citicorp by the New York Federal Reserve and the Comptroller of the Currency in February 1992. At the time, the bank was burdened with billions of dollars of bad loans, and Citicorp was one of hundreds of, mostly smaller, US banks that had agreed to accept exceptionally broad surveillance by industry regulators. Among the restrictions imposed by the special agreement with regulators, Citicorp was not allowed to make acquisitions or add to its assets without the approval of the federal authorities. Also, the bank did not declare a dividend while the agreement was in force. The bank is expected to announce its first dividend payment on its common stock to shareholders in 2 1/2 years. Analysts suggest this could happen as early as the end of the current quarter. Citicorp will be able to consider the acquisition of other banks. Although the group is not believed to be planning any such moves in the immediate future, Mr John Reed, Citicorp chairman, told employees that capital was available for the bank's growth. While the lifting of the memorandum of understanding will not effect the day-to-day operations of the bank, it is a recognition that regulators are satisfied with Citicorp's financial position. In the past two years, the bank's management has worked hard to restore Citicorp's health, slashing costs, beefing up its reserves, selling assets and writing off bad loans. During that period the bank has benefited from low domestic interest rates, which have widened the margin between the interest it pays on its funds and the interest it earns on its loans, and an improvement in the condition of the US commercial property market. The bank is now considered well capitalised by regulators, and last month Citicorp announced record annual profits of Dollars 2.2bn for 1993.</p>

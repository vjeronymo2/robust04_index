			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline of "Israel Shoulders the  Responsibility," TISHRIN says: Within less than two days and  before the Palestinian blood dries in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque  and on the confrontation fields in Gaza and the West Bank,  Israel committed a new massacre in Sayyidat al-Najat Church in  Zuq Micha'il in Juniyah, to overshadow the crime of slaughtering  Palestinian worshipers in Hebron.    TISHRIN says it is not strange that Israel tries to hide the  traces of the dawn crime with another crime also targeting  worshipers in a church in Juniyah. This was exposed by the  similar plans of implementation, which threaten the Arabs in  their homeland, shrines, and even at their prayers.    If the Zionist terrorists managed to enter the Ibrahimi  Mosque and open fire at Palestinian worshipers, their proxy  instruments played the same role in Sayyidat al-Najat Church in  Juniyah when they planted explosive devices in disgusting  timing, because at that time the church is packed with  worshipers on the occasion of Lent.    TISHRIN stresses that the Zionists are masters in  desecrating  shrines and committing blatant aggressions against these  shrines. In this, they do not differentiate between a church and  a mosque. Their objective is to kill more Arabs.    Following the Hebron massacre, it seems that the Israelis  were afraid of the overwhelming popular anger in the occupied  Arab territories, and were affected by the broad Arab and  international condemnation, so they tried through their new  heinous crime in Sayyidat al-Najat Church to overshadow the  denunciation and anger at Israel and Rabin's government caused  by the Hebron crime.    TISHRIN adds: Israel, which thought that by committing the  massacre of Sayyidat al-Najat Church it could alleviate the  effects of the Hebron massacre, is once again deluded.    Concluding, TISHRIN says that Lebanese blood is not cheap.  It is Arab blood the same as Palestinian and Syrian blood.  Israel should not be allowed to continue with its crimes and  massacres before the eyes of the entire world. It should not be  allowed to undermine the will of the international community and  the resolutions of international legitimacy, adhere to its  occupation of the Arab territories, and reject the just and  comprehensive peace. It is impossible to remain silent toward  Israel's terrorist practices. Israel should be deterred and  stopped, and this is an international responsibility as much as  it is an Arab responsibility.</p>

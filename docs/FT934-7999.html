			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of Hungary (2): Poised on the verge of a recovery - Nicholas Denton assesses the mood as Hungarians wait for a turnaround in the economy HUNGARIANS have been waiting for an economic recovery for the past three years and each year the turnaround has been postponed. Finally, industrial activity has begun to revive - but the upturn is asthmatic and its sustainability is questionable. Manufacturing output, excluding the troubled food sector, is 7 per cent higher than a year earlier. But this growth sits uncomfortably with a 20 per cent dip in export volume and a fast deteriorating current account. Production and exports are now coming on stream from the General Motors, Suzuki Motor Corporation and Ford Motor Company car assembly and components plants announced in 1990 and 1991. But manufacturing has not been able to lift the economy as a whole. Drought and confusion over property rights have afflicted agriculture, the pride of Hungary's former communist regime. Cereal production has fallen 20 per cent from last year's already depressed level. The recession is likely to continue. The finance ministry projects a decline in gross domestic product of 1-3 per cent for 1993 and stagnation next year, leaving output 20 per cent below the 1989 level. The real situation is somewhat brighter, the statisticians cannot reach a burgeoning black economy, nor fully account for the quantum leap in the quality of goods produced and bought. 'Something is missing,' says Mr Gyorgy Suranyi, managing director of Central European International Bank. 'The situation is not good, but it is much better than is indicated in the statistics.' One rule of thumb is to add 2 per cent a year to the GDP figures to take account of unrecorded activity. Other indicators also point to a recovery, albeit frail and patchy. Employment appears to have turned the corner. The jobless rate, after rising inexorably from the start of the decade, peaked in February at 13.6 per cent and has settled at about 13 per cent. But the source of the industrial recovery remains more than a little mysterious. Stockbuilding appears to be absorbing some production after companies slashed inventories from the artificially high communist levels. More important, statisticians may be missing a rebound in consumption. Some companies report surprisingly resilient consumer demand. Electrolux, owner of Hungary's Lehel refrigerator maker, feels that purchases began to revive around the middle of last year. Mr Werner Riecke, head of the monetary policy department of the National Bank of Hungary (NBH), confirms 'we now have the feeling that consumption and domestic use are greater than expected'. In financial markets, low deposit rates in the first half of the year induced households to shift to spending from saving. The savings ratio has fallen to about 7 per cent this year, down from 15.8 per cent in 1991 and 13.2 per cent in 1992. But a consumer-led recovery may not be sustainable. The economy is already coming up against balance of payments constraints. Exports are down mainly due to recession in Germany, Hungary's largest export market, and in the rest of continental Europe, while imports are about 10 per cent higher. Food exports have also fallen precipitately, running 38 per cent lower than last year; western European protectionism has not helped. Hungarian officials also confess that some exporters may have been producing at a loss and dumping in the expectation of a bail-out by the state. Last year's spate of bankruptcies put paid to that hope and forced companies to reconsider unprofitable exports. Budapest's exchange rate policy has also left the forint overvalued and inhibited exports, according to the latest report on Hungary by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Hungary pursued a strategy of real appreciation of the national currency until last year. But NBH has made five adjustments in 1993, cutting the forint by 13.4 per cent. The central bank, which managed to borrow a record Dollars 4bn this year through international bond issues, now reckons on a current account deficit of about Dollars 2.5bn for the year, compared with a surplus of Dollars 324m in 1992. But Hungary's gross foreign debt, the highest per capita in eastern Europe, is now growing again and stood at a record Dollars 23.8bn in May, compared with Dollars 21.8bn at the start of the year. The NBH fears that funds will be more difficult to raise in 1994, an election year. Twinned to Hungary's growing current account shortfall is a hefty public-sector deficit. Most of the deterioration in the government accounts is a straightforward concomitant of recession. Mr Almos Kovacs, deputy state secretary at the finance ministry, says public finances have performed no worse than those of western countries afflicted by recessions milder than Hungary's. Hungary's public-sector deficit deepened from 1.1 per cent of GDP in 1990 to a forecast 7 per cent this year. In the same period, Finland's deficit swelled by 14 per cent of GDP and Sweden's by 18 per cent of GDP. The state is also gathering in the quasi-fiscal deficits which have accumulated at state-owned companies and banks. Bankruptcies and defaults by borrowers have wiped out the capital of the largest commercial banks and the burden of recapitalisation has fallen on the state budget. The latest agreement with the IMF, concluded in September, calls for Hungary to rein in the public-sector deficit to 5.5 per cent of GDP in 1994. This will require spending cuts difficult to implement in the run-up to elections. The government's borrowing requirement is putting strong upward pressure on interest rates and threatening to 'crowd-out' private borrowing. Treasury bill yields, which fell as low as 13 per cent earlier this year, have shot back up to 23 per cent. Faced with twin deficits in the current account and the budget, the central bank has tightened monetary policy. The NBH raised its key overnight open-market rates from 17 to 22 per cent between July and September. 'The move is absolutely justified,' says Mr Suranyi. 'But it's about a year too late.' Mr Peter Bod, NBH chairman, says that the central bank will wait and see before acting again. But monetary tightening may be as difficult to sustain politically as the current account is becoming economically unmanageable. The NBH, formally independent since the end of 1991, has come for the first time into open conflict with the finance ministry. 'We are now saying that we cannot refinance our foreign debt with such bad current account numbers,' says Mr Riecke. 'But they (the finance ministry) say they cannot finance the budget deficit through domestic savings.' The danger now is that interest rate rises may snuff out any recovery. Meanwhile, Hungary's politicians are learning the dynamics of political and economic cycles the hard way. 'There are some people within the government who would definitely like to stay the course,' says one close western observer. 'The others think: to hell with it, we've got an election to fight. The temptation is there to let go.' The Federation of Young Democrats, a liberal party with an acute political sense, last month put aside economic orthodoxy and launched a programme for 'modernisation and growth'.</p>

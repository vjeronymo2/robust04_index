			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / When Churchill halted SOE plan: The latest public records to be released WINSTON Churchill's wartime staff at 10 Downing Street were shocked by a suggestion from a minister that the undercover activities of the Special Operations Executive should continue after the war to help maintain control in liberated Europe. The disclosure, along with Churchill's dismissive response, is contained in papers released yesterday for public scrutiny by the Public Record Office. The Earl of Selborne, the economic warfare minister responsible for the SOE, one of the most effective of the covert agencies spawned during the war, sought the backing of the prime minister in May 1944 for the continuation of the organisation's operations after the end of the war. 'In the administration of territories, liberated or conquered, there is great scope for below the surface activity . . . if separatist movements arise in Germany, SOE could pass the sinews of war to them without incriminating HMG,' he wrote. A note to Churchill from his private secretary expresses shock at the 'novel proposal that HMG should take part in commercial bribery and corruption in peacetime'. The prime minister's response was brief: 'My dear Top,' he wrote. 'The part that your naughty deeds in war can play in peace cannot at all be considered at the present time.' Over 10,000 men and 3,000 women worked for SOE at its peak in 1943, running agents and encouraging resistance and sabotage behind enemy lines. Other papers give additional information on the murder of Cora Crippen in 1910 by her husband, Dr Hawley Harvey Crippen, the most sensational murder case of its day, and his subsequent trial and execution. Crippen fled Britain with his mistress Ethel le Neve, 13 years his junior, after apparently poisoning his wife at their home in north London. The couple were arrested at sea after the captain of the liner on which they were fleeing recognised them. Home Office files on Crippen were originally intended to remain closed for 100 years but have now been released as part of the prime minister's push for more open government.</p>

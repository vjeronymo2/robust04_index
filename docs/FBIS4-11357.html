			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maria Teresa Fajardo from the "YSU Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Text] Today, President Alfredo Cristiani said one of the  priorities of the government of the president elected on 24  April will be to promote the country's social and economic  development and to constantly struggle against corruption; this  will ensure the continuity of a government under the  responsibility of ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance],  Cristiani said when expressing his willingness to support and  advise Armando Calderon Sol throughout the next five years.    [Begin Cristiani recording] Making a good government is  obviously necessary, and a good government must attend to the  people's needs. We have made a lot of progress in the political  field. The process is practically running itself. In the  economic area, the new government must continue to promote  development and trust. The macroeconomy has reached a level  where this is possible. I believe the most important thing is to  continue to stress the importance of helping the people, the  social area. Mainly, we must continue to support education,  health, housing, and all those programs aimed at solving the  people's problems.    The other day, when we were distributing checks at the  Reconstruction Secretariat, we said that at the government level  plans, very big plans, are made in general terms; because of  this, many times the people's needs are overlooked. For the  government, these needs may seem very small, but for the people  they are very important. Therefore, it is very important for the  government to continue supporting institutions, such as the  Reconstruction Secretariat, the Social Investment Fund, and the  Family Secretariat. Fortunately, the Social Investment Fund is  negotiating more loans, and the Inter-American Development Bank  seems willing to give this organization a third loan that will  help the Social Investment Fund until it can begin making its  own money.    I also believe we must constantly work to eradicate  corruption. Corruption may not be as common in the United  States, but we are constantly hearing of scandals of corruption  in developed countries. Japan has had serious problems with  corruption. What can we say of Brazil? Therefore, this is  something against which we must constantly struggle to ensure  its disappearance, but we must not only struggle for corruption  to disappear but also so that it will not reappear. Making the  same mistake is very easy. [end recording]    President Cristiani explained his earlier statements on the  Farabundo Marti National Liberal Front's [FMLN] imminent  division in the assembly:    [Begin Cristiani recording] They have kept the FMLN united  due to the need to present themselves as a sole political force  in the elections, not as a divided force. I do believe,  however, everyone here knows there are big differences among the  various factions. We do believe division will eventually occur,  and each group will adopt a more individual position as was  foreseen from the very moment the FMLN registered its charter.  They have described themselves as a party of several  persuasions. There are five different persuasions within the  party, and that is where the problem lies. They will now have  to adopt specific positions, and we will now begin to see those  differences. I believe five factions will be making separate  decisions; this does not mean they will vote together at certain  times, but we will see a difference in the way they make their  decisions.    I believe the parties that form the coalition will have to  make a political analysis for the future. Had the Democratic  Convergence run alone in these elections, it would not have done  very well. They only won one seat in the assembly. If the  coalition breaks up, the Democratic Convergence runs the risk of  losing its status of political party because the votes it would  receive in an election would not be enough. A similar situation  is confronted by the National Revolutionary Movement. If there  is a division within the FMLN where the various tendencies  separate, we would even see a reorganization within the party.  [end recording]    Regarding the abstentions reported during the 24 April  elections, President Cristiani expressed regret this is being  used to hinder the electoral process, adding this is not  something unusual when a runoff is convoked.</p>

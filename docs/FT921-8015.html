			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Hong Kong (3): Visitors spoiled for choice - Hotels: the recent opening of new luxury hotels has triggered a fierce competitive response from older marble palaces which appear regularly among the world's top ten hotels and offer every conceivable service, says David Dodwell THE Gulf War, and a rush of new luxury hotels opening their doors, have given Hong Kong hoteliers an unaccustomed taste of the real world in 1991 as occupancy rates slipped to average 75 per cent. In Europe or the US, many hoteliers would be cracking champagne bottles if they achieved such occupancy rates, but in Hong Kong, after years during which occupancies have averaged close to 90 per cent all year round, this has been a sobering time. Particularly vulnerable have been the newest hotels, and those reliant on the much-depressed US rag trade. The upside for visitors is that room prices have tumbled, allowing a taste of unalloyed sybaritic luxury for the price of an average motel in Europe or the US. Nor has it been essential to make bookings months in advance during the hectic peak of September to December - a hassle that has humbled many a business traveller in recent years if he was rash enough to fly in convinced he would find something on the night. It is often difficult for a business traveller brutalised by the experience of hotels in Europe or the US to anticipate the cossetting that can be assured in any one of 30 of the territory's 81 leading hotels. These marble palaces (heaven knows how many thousands of acres of marble are shipped into the territory every year) house every conceivable service - from meals 24 hours a day to laser disc players, and fax machines in your room with your own personal number. Even Hong Kong's stateliest and most traditional hotels, like the Peninsula with four staff to every guest, are awash with the latest electronic gismos that swish curtains open and closed, dim lights in every nook, pull satellite channels onto the television screen, bring messages onto the screen overriding whatever programme you are watching, and activate personalised answering machines on your room telephone. A decade ago, choice of the right hotel in Hong Kong was a comparatively simple affair. If you were visiting bankers, brokers or government officials your chairman or chief executive stayed at the Mandarin Oriental on Hong Kong island. Other executives would stay at the Hilton nearby. If you were in town to visit industry - whether garments or electronics - your chairman or chief executive stayed at the Peninsula or the Regent on Kowloon side. Lesser mortals stayed at one of the three Omni hotels near the Star ferry, or at the Shangri-la, or a neighbour on the east Tsinshatsui waterfront. All of these hotels appeared regularly among the world's top ten hotels, so even the middle-ranking executive could be assured of uncommon luxury. The only problem was booking a room in the first place. Today, choice is a more perplexing affair. For traditionalists, perhaps there will never be an alternative to the Mandarin, the Peninsula or the Regent. But arriviste hotels like the Grand Hyatt, the Conrad and the Island Shangri-la (all on Hong Kong island) and the Ramada Renaissance and Hotel Nikko in Kowloon can offer services that match, and often better, the territory's grand dame hotels, which must make do, of course, with comparatively older property. The biggest single new influence has been the opening two years ago of Hong Kong's massive Convention and Exhibition centre on the Wanchai waterfront on Hong Kong island. The centre itself houses two hotels - the Grand Hyatt and the New World Harbour View  - with three others at nearby Pacific Place. As the volume of conference and exhibition business grows in Hong Kong, so an increasing number of visitors are likely to shun the hotels of Kowloon and Central, staying instead at one of the five hotels closest by. It is not the Convention Centre alone that will draw visitors away from traditional haunts. The Grand Hyatt has flooded the hotel industry with hype, but has so far offered a quality that lives up to all but its most extravagant claims - such as that which claims it provides a 'neo-nostalgic celebration of the sophisticated turn of the century.' But what exactly is 'neo-nostalgia'? In Pacific Place, a glittering palace to the main Hong Kong religion of shopping, the Conrad and the Island Shangri-la will compete hard with the Hyatt for quality and service. The third hotel, the Marriott, feels modest only when set against the likes of the Grand Hyatt, and anyway has such strong loyalty from among US visitors that it could well maintain the highest occupancy rates of the three. The recent opening of these hotels has triggered a fierce competitive response from older hotels. In Kowloon, the Regent has refurbished suites, and enlarged its gymnasium. The Peninsula is pressing ahead with plans to add a 30-storey extension that will (for the first time) give guests a pool, a health centre and a business centre. Perhaps the most vigorous response has come from the Hilton in Hong Kong's Central district. Having several years ago been the first in the territory to introduce executive and non-smoking floors, it has launched for Japanese guests a 'wa no kutsurogi' service that will allow them to be checked in on their own floor by Japanese-speaking hotel staff, with all hotel room literature in Japanese. A new 'Meetings 2000' service is intended to meet all the high-tech needs of executives wanting to use the hotel as a base for presentations or other functions. It is aimed at warding off fierce competition from hotels like the Conrad, which has a 54-seat lecture theatre along with usual business centre and meeting rooms, and the Island Shangri-la, which has a genteel library as well as state of the art meeting rooms in its expansive business centre. Such new hotels offer extensive in-room facilities like data lines for computers and faxes, and double telephone lines. Nevertheless, for sheer value for money, the Hilton is hard to beat. A second recent development has been the appearance of a host of excellent three- and four-star hotels aimed at tour groups, and visitors with more limited budgets, many from Taiwan, south east Asia, and even China. A total of seven opened in 1991, with a further nine expected to open this year. Perhaps the most ambitious is the 1,000-room Panda Hotel in the outlying area of Tsuen Wan, which may rely heavily on visitors from mainland China and Taiwan. The 500-room Century hotel in Wanchai is certain to attract budget-conscious overspill from the Convention Centre. It opened only a couple of months ago, but has attracted favourable mention so far. Help in picking the right hotel is hard to give, such is the luxury of choice and the wide range of executive services offered by so many hotels. Hong Kong's roads nevertheless become increasingly congested  - particularly around the main harbour crossing  - so an increasingly sensible rule of thumb is to pick a hotel close to the venue of most meetings. Idiosyncratic needs are easier to meet: Transiting overnight  - stay at the Regal Airport hotel. Keen on jogging  - stay at the Regent on Kowloon-side, to jog along the Tsinshatsui waterfront, or the Hilton, Island Shangri-la or Conrad on the island, since these give good access to Bowen Road, one of the world's most panoramic jogs. Keen on swimming  - most hotels have excellent pools. However, the Mandarin pool is a marble-lined puddle, and the Peninsula has none, so sybaritic are its guests. Keen on squash  - the Ramada Renaissance in Kowloon has a good court. Afraid of heights  - stay with traditional stalwarts like the Mandarin, the Hilton or the Peninsula. Many hotels make the most of spectacular views, so you may need to carry sweets in a pocket to help your ears 'pop' as you leap past the 50th floor.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                A SELECTION OF LEADING HOTELS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Name                          Tel.

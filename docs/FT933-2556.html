			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Volcano pushes Patagonian sheep over the brink - After years of struggle the eruption was the last straw for many THE SHEEP farms of Patagonia are gradually disappearing. Sheep farming, the only agricultural activity the barren, windswept steppes can support, has become a ruinously loss-making business. Farmers burdened by rising debts and falling incomes are abandoning their properties in increasing numbers. Patagonia's sheep sector began declining in the 1960s, but the downturn accelerated dramatically two years ago. The collapse in the international wool market - a glut has driven prices to the lowest point in living memory  -coincided lethally with spreading desertification, a radical shift in government economic policy and natural disaster. On August 13, 1992, Mount Hudson, a volcano high in the Chilean Andes erupted, spewing vast quantities of ash over the southern half of Patagonia. The ash ruined the sheep's wool, making it worthless, and transformed areas of the province of Santa Cruz into wasteland. Sheep could not graze on the ash-covered land and slowly died. Mr Jimmy Patterson, a wool trader and descendant of the Scottish farmers who first introduced sheep to Patagonia from the nearby Falkland Islands in 1885, says the ash made his parents close their 30,000-hectare family farm on the east coast of Santa Cruz. Last year, 452 farms covering 8m hectares in Santa Cruz went the same way. For most of them, the eruption was the coup de grace that followed years of mounting losses. Closures are common elsewhere in Patagonia and Mr Juan Ventura, who owns three farms, says they will become more frequent. 'You don't see the effects immediately. What is happening is that farmers are consuming their capital. They're not spending on maintenance. Eventually they go bankrupt.' Many farmers are trying to hang on. Mr Raul Assef, who owns a 1,500-hectare farm on the western edge of Patagonia, says 'both my wife and I work in town and use our wages to cover the loss of running the farm. You never know what might happen in this country and the market might even recover one day'. Patagonia's isolated farms cover huge areas but can only support small flocks, making them expensive to run. In arid central Patagonia a sheep needs 5 ha to graze on and farms of 2,500 ha are common. Few farmers can afford the investments needed to improve efficiency or switch over to more profitable cattle farming. Those who can are expanding their cattle herds, now that Patagonia has been declared free of foot-and-mouth disease. Beef 'imports' from the infected north are banned, allowing local producers to charge premium prices. Others are branching into flower or fruit production. In the watered, protected mountain valleys to the west, strawberries, boysenberries and raspberries grow well. The government is negotiating a joint World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank loan for an irrigation project in the east of the province. Even if wool prices do recover, Patagonia's farmers will not be able to raise output much. A century of over-grazing has devastated the central plateau, which covers about one third of Argentina's territory. Desertification is a serious problem. The arid plains are framed by distant low-lying hills and dotted with occasional termite hills The stony soil is covered with khaki-coloured shrubs and tufts of tough grass. Occasionally, small groups of sheep can be seen searching for foliage. Mr Guillermo Defosse, economic development under-secretary in the province of Chubut, says that although the region's wool is considered to among 'the finest in the world, little consideration was given to the vegetation and the soil which supported that production'. Production this year is forecast at 90,000 tonnes, 13 per cent less than last year. In Chubut, wool production has fallen to 18,000 tonnes in 1992 from 26,833 tonnes a decade earlier. Argentina's adoption four years ago of free market policies compounded these setbacks. The government abolished its hated agricultural export taxes and reduced other taxes. But its anti-inflation policies led to a strong revaluation of the currency, reducing export revenues and increasing costs. These policies hit farmers throughout Argentina, but few are suffering as much as those in Patagonia. Federal and local governments are helping with cheap loans, subsidies, grants and tax breaks worth over USDollars 75m are available to support or convert farms to other activities. Policy is confused, however. A Chubut official said 'one department wants small farms to merge to reduce stocking levels and another encourages them to survive by sharing equipment or through credit unions'. He also recognises that the government has done little to introduce modern farming and water-management methods that are less harmful to the land. Although the disappearance of Patagonia's sheep farms is leading to the depopulation of a vast area of the country and creating serious social problems, it could at least have the long-term benefit of relieving pressure on the land and slow the advance of desertification.</p>

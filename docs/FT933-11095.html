			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Day of turmoil on Europe's financial markets: Future of ERM in balance 07.00: Trading starts in London with intervention by the central banks of Belgium and Spain in support of their currencies. French franc hovers above FFr3.4180 to the D-Mark, the level that the Bank of France has regularly supported. (All times are BST in London.) 9.00: Belgium raises official interest rates by a full percentage point to defend the Belgian franc. 10.00: French franc falls to FFr3.42 to the D-Mark and quickly moves below its exchange rate mechanism floor of FFr3.4305. The Bank of France and Bundesbank launch massive intervention, buying the franc at the ERM floor. 10.15: Danish krone and Belgian franc fall to their ERM floors against the D-Mark. 10.50: Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, a Bundesbank council member, says German call money could fall below the discount rate. Analysts believe this statement could relieve tensions in the system. 11.00: George Soros, one of the leading currency speculators, announces he is ready to sell the French franc, in contrast to statements earlier this week. 12.25: Bank of Portugal intervenes heavily to support the escudo. 13.44: Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, says the ERM is working well but that the continued success of the system depends on the goodwill of everybody. 14.30: Bundesbank spokesman denies a council meeting is being held. 16.00: Official ERM trading closes and central bank intervention is reduced. The French franc drifts well below its ERM floor to a low of FFr3.4330 to the D-Mark but later rises to close at FFr3.42 in London. 16.30: Unconfirmed reports say EC officials are discussing technical methods by which they can preserve the ERM.</p>

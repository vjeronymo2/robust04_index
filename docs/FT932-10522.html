			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Clinton pledges to work for Gatt deal THE US and the EC yesterday renewed their commitment to completing negotiations on the Uruguay Round of world trade liberalisation talks, promising a successful conclusion by the end of the year. President Bill Clinton said after talks with Mr Poul Rasmussen, the Danish prime minister, and Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, that the US was 'prepared to take a lot of trouble to get it done.' He added that he wanted to have tangible progress before the Tokyo summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in July. Mr Delors said the talks concentrated on issues of market access, and set an even more ambitious deadline: he hoped for enough agreement to warrant full multilateral negotiations within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva by the time ministers of the 24-nation Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development meet in Paris in early June. Mr Delors said he was looking for concessions from the US in the areas of customs tariffs, textiles, steel, telecommunications and services. 'This is not only in the interests of the European countries but also in the interests of the developing countries,' he said, noting progress had already been made 'not only in the mood but also in procedure and substance.' Mr Clinton has shown a renewed energy in his pursuit of the Gatt negotiations over the last week, just as some free trade advocates were beginning to despair that he might be bowing to the strong protectionist sentiments among some members of his own Democratic party in Congress. Some foreign trade analysts, too, have doubted the Clinton administration's commitment to multilateral free trade negotiations because of its simultaneous pursuit of aggressive bilateral trade measures. But the Clinton administration argues that the two approaches are not incompatible: that tough enforcement of trade laws and international agreements is not just necessary to placate domestic opinion, but actually helpful to the pursuit of a new and more liberal Gatt. In particular, US trade officials distinguish efforts to gain access to markets they regard as unfairly closed to US goods and services, notably in Japan, from efforts to close US markets to imports.</p>

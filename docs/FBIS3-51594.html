			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Supreme Court of Justice [CSJ] President Edgar  Oblitas Fernandez has blamed the U.S. Government for having been  suspended from his post and his trial by the National Congress.  Oblitas claims that the corruption charges follow political  interests. He said the sole objective was to remove him from  his post. During a news conference he said:    [Begin Oblitas recording, in progress] ... going against  constitutional principles, aimed at myself while I was the CSJ  president. But I decided not to heed the measure because it was  illegal and unconstitutional. I have now decided to deliver a  message to the Bolivian people so that they learn the real  reasons why the current government and Congress began this  senseless impeachment process. This is why I ask you to inform  the citizenry about this matter, because so far the people have  not been told the basic issues of this case. [end recording]    Oblitas later reiterated that the charges against him and  against Justice Ernesto Poppe Zubieta are not based on concrete  evidence and thus violate the Constitution.    [Begin Oblitas recording] The Chamber of Deputies has  committed an unprecedented crime by raising charges against the  CSJ president without any concrete evidence. This can be  written in the book of universal infamy as a monstrous example  of how savage hatred can make men act without caring about  destroying the honor and dignity of others in the fulfillment of  the most [word indistinct] and insane ambitions of  circumstantial power.    January 5 1994 will be remembered as a day of mourning and  shame for Bolivian democracy because the greatest abuse against  the Constitution and the law was committed on this date which,  without doubt, will establish a deadly if not fatal precedent  for this kind of abuse.    The whole country knows that a crime of [word indistinct]  was  invented as a synonym for [word indistinct] to incriminate the  CSJ president. This crime is neither included nor described in  the 7 November 1890 Law, which clearly describes the four types  of malfeasance that can be committed by CSJ justices. [end  recording]</p>

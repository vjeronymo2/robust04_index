			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Clinton steps up healthcare reform drive The Clinton administration and the Democratic party are launching an all-out push to swing public support behind healthcare reform before Congress starts drafting detailed legislation on the issue after this week's recess. The campaign will include speeches by President Bill Clinton, Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton and administration officials, television advertising and a Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.3m) bus tour, financed by backers of reform such as unions, consumer groups and churches. Ms Donna Shalala, health secretary, took to the road on Wednesday to begin underscoring the administration's commitment to universal healthcare, in a message echoed by officials in a series of co-ordinated speeches across the country. And yesterday saw the unveiling of a Democratic party television advertising campaign attacking the opponents of reform and funded from a Dollars 5m war-chest. The coming weeks will be critical for the prospects of reform as the Senate and House leaderships struggle to craft bills approved by the congressional committees with jurisdiction over healthcare into legislation to be voted on by their respective chambers. Voting is not likely to take place until next month, after which the Senate and House versions must be reconciled in conference. Final voting on the completed legislation could therefore come after the August recess, in September or October. All of the four committees that agreed versions of the plan have approved legislation that varies from the Clinton plan. But the main worry for the administration is the powerful Senate finance committee, which was alone in dropping the cornerstone of the Clinton proposal - achieving universal healthcare insurance largely financed by employers. Instead, the finance committee's version seeks to cover 95 per cent of the population by the year 2002 through insurance industry reforms, tax incentives and subsidies to low earners. The committee often accurately reflects the views of the Senate at large, and some House members may also look to it for a lead on health-care. But abandoning universal coverage is anathema to the administration. Fears of having to accept watered-down legislation - or even no legislation at all  -lie behind the publicity onslaught aimed at getting the public to lobby their congressmen on the issue. Opinion polls have produced contradictory findings on healthcare, but an ABC-Washington Post poll at the end of last month found an overwhelming 78 per cent backing a guarantee of universal coverage. Much of the battle for hearts and minds will be fought on the nation's television screens. The Democratic party's advertisements launched yesterday are a parody of the infamous 'Harry and Louise' campaign, sponsored by the Health Insurance Association of America, which attacked the Clinton plan. In the original advertisement a concerned couple picked holes in the Clinton proposals. But in the Democratic version, Harry has lost his job and his health insurance, both partners are sick in bed and complaining of the financial burdens of illness. The health insurance industry threatened to respond to the ads. Also about to enter the battle is Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire and independent runner in the 1992 presidential election. Mr Perot last week offered to fund Republican advertising on healthcare. The Republicans have already run campaigns advocating more limited health reform measures and say they will run more.</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Cementone shares fall on warning Shares in Cementone fell 16p to 80p yesterday as Mr Alan Clements, chairman, told the annual meeting that first half profits would be 'materially lower than market expectations'. The specialist paints and building chemicals maker came to the market in January via a reverse takeover of Multitrust, the property investment company. Its shares, which were placed at 73p, began trading ahead of expectations at 87p. Mr Clements said that intense margin pressure from competitors in conjunction with promotional activities in both the paints and chemicals market sectors had resulted in a continuing squeeze on margins. Management had taken action, he said, which had already resulted in margin and profitability improvements. He was confident that normal levels of profitability would be restored in the second half. For the year to December 31 1993 pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.21m (Pounds 995,046).</p>

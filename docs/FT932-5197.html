			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: Nissan invests in Chinese truck plant NISSAN, the Japanese vehicle maker, is to set up a mini-truck plant in Zhengzhou, capital of central China's Henan province - the company's first direct investment in the fast-growing China auto market. Nissan has signed a contract with Zhengzhou Light Truck Factory to produce 30,000 one-ton pick-up trucks by 1997. The project includes an auto chair workshop and a brake system manufacturing plant. 'What had prevented us from coming earlier,' said Mr Shigeno, Nissan's Beijing manager, 'was the limited market size in China and its different economic system. Compared to the Europeans and the Americans, we were inexperienced in dealing with communist countries such as China.' The first trucks are planned to roll off the assembly line in early 1994. Nissan's investment in China contrasts with European, American and some minor Japanese auto makers. Volkswagen of Germany, Peugeot and Citroen of France, Chrysler and General Motors of the US have all set up car, mini-bus or truck assembly plants in China. Japan's Daihatsu and Suzuki have licenced mini-cars to plants in Tianjin and Chongqing. 'This year, things are different: American and European markets are saturated, Japan's domestic market slumped. But China's demand keeps growing. This is what drew us here,' said Mr Shigeno. Nissan's biggest concern is over China's market size. 'You need a market that could consume 3m units to make a profit, or it's not worth it,' said Mr Shigeno. Last year, China produced 1.08m motor vehicles including 250,000 cars, 100,000 more than the previous year. China imports 100,000 cars a year. China's gross national product growth rate exceeded 12 per cent last year and in the first quarter this year it topped 14 per cent. China is Asia's second largest auto market after Japan.</p>

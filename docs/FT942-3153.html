			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Ashdown hits at claims on jobs Mr Paddy Ashdown said yesterday that it was fraudulent of politicians to pretend that they could deliver full employment - in what amounted to a rebuke of the Labour leadership candidates. The Liberal Democrat leader used a speech in Harrogate to argue that 'full employability' was what was needed. He defined this as a policy geared to 'maximising individual potential'. He said full employment was not a realistic goal with 'open global markets'. It was 'simply fraudulent' of politicians to 'pretend or to promise that they can deliver full employment' in such conditions. Speaking three days after Mr Tony Blair and Mr John Prescott clashed over whether a Labour government should set targets for cuts in unemployment, Mr Ashdown said Britain did not need 'massed armies of road-sweepers or Romanian-style lift attendants, at a cost of massive extra borrowing, rampant inflation and lost competitiveness'. He said: 'If government spends its money on trying to create immediate but transitory low-skilled full employment it will not spend it on creating the conditions in which lasting, high-skill fuller unemployment can prevail later. 'The doctrine of full employability put responsibility on individuals to fulfil their potential and on the state to provide the support that individuals need to survive and succeed.' His comments came as Mr Prescott, a leading Labour 'traditionalist', called for an emergency jobs recovery programme to tackle unemployment.</p>

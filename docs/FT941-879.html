			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Glaxo drug rival wins licence for UK The fortunes of the world's best selling drug, Zantac, the anti-ulcer treatment made by Glaxo of the UK, will come under renewed threat tomorrow with confirmation that a new treatment involving Losec, its chief competitor made by Astra of Sweden, has been licensed in the UK. The new treatment includes an antibiotic to kill bacteria which can cause a relapse of the ulcer. Up to one quarter of Zantac's global annual sales of Pounds 3.5bn is accounted for by patients who take it over the long term to prevent such a relapse, according to stockbroker Lehman Brothers. The Losec-plus-antibiotic combination promises to cut sharply the need for this maintenance therapy. It gives Astra a significant head start over Glaxo, which is filing an anti-bacterial version of Zantac for regulatory approval later this year. The licence is the latest blow to Zantac. Last week, a subsidiary of Ciba, the Swiss drugs company, said it would launch an unbranded version of Zantac that appears to sidestep the company's patent protection. Separately, SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-US drugs company, is preparing to launch non-prescription versions of Tagamet, which was Zantac's main rival for most of the 1980s before the launch of Losec. Further bad news could be on its way with the launch next month of a drug by Japanese pharmaceutical company Takeda that works on the same principles as Losec. Losec and Takeda's lansoprazole are 'proton pump inhibitors'. They can give faster healing and relief from symptoms than older treatments such as Zantac and Tagamet. The bacteria the Losec-plus-antibiotic treatment is designed to combat, Helicobacter Pylori, are increasingly seen as central to a number of gastric disorders including ulcers. Without eradication therapy, ulcer patients require years of regular treatment with Zantac or other stomach acid suppressing drugs to prevent ulcer recurrence and life threatening complications. The UK licence for H. Pylori eradication therapy gives Astra the go-ahead to promote this ulcer management approach to general practitioners. Research suggests it improves patients' quality of life while saving several thousands of pounds on a practice's drug budget. GPs, under pressure to cut drug spending, are likely to find the prospect attractive.</p>

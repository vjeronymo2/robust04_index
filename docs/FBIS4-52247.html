			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 7 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean Government  decided Saturday [7 May] that additional action by the U.N.  Security Council against North Korea is unavoidable if Pyongyang  does not accept by next week an IAEA (International Atomic  Energy Agency) presence during the changing of fuel rods at the  5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon.    The decision was made at a Unification and National Security  Policy Coordination meeting presided over by new Deputy Premier  and National Unification Minister Yi Hong-ku.    "Our government position is that if North Korea presses  ahead  with changing the fuel rods by themselves, it would be  unavoidable to take additional steps against the North," Yi said.    Emerging from the meeting, the deputy premier said North  Korea has thus far maintained that it cannot allow the  collection of samples from the reactor's spent fuel rods.    The meeting also decided to step up the existing system of  cooperation with the United States, the United Nations and the  IAEA with respect to the nuclear question.    As to when any additional action might come, Yi said not  much  time is left.    "The recent U.N. Security Council presidential statement has  set mid-May as the deadline for North Korea's acceptance of  additional IAEA inspections," he said.    Noting that the North Koreans' attitude remained somewhat  ambiguous, the deputy premier said their position would become  clear either this weekend or early next week.    Yi added, however, that if North Korea expressly promises to  allow IAEA sampling of fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor, it  could be taken as a sign of progress.    It is still unclear, he said, whether North Korea has begun  to change the fuel rods on its own.    North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam, in a message to  the IAEA, said Friday his country could allow additional  inspections of its nuclear facilities, including taking samples  from a glove box at the key radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon.    But Kim said he could not promise permission to collect  samples from the fuel rods at the 5-megawatt atomic reactor, a  source said.</p>

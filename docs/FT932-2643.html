			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (10): Taking politics out of economics - The progress of privatisation 'GIVEN another year of political continuity Poland will have advanced to the point where the economy becomes independent of political uncertainties,' Mr Janusz Lewandowski, the outgoing privatisation minister, said only days before the government fell on a no-confidence vote in parliament. That judgment still holds, partly because of a clear majority in the country for a continuation of market reforms, and partly because privatisation of the economy is about to achieve critical mass. Mr Lewandowski is in a good position to judge, because he started the privatisation process as minister in the first post-communist government in 1989, returning to the helm four governments later in the coalition led by Ms Hanna Suchocka. Progress since those early days has been greater than is often realised, despite the sometimes lengthy periods between governments when privatisation seemed as becalmed as the rest of the decision-making process. More than 2,000 of the 8,500 state enterprises have been privatised and by the end of this year more than 50 per cent of GDP and 60 per cent of total employment will stem from the economy's privatised sector. Privatisation has attracted a large part of the Dollars 4bn foreign equity investment commitments to date and has been instrumental in achieving significant structural changes in the Polish economy towards an export-competitive, market-based system. Privatisation is also contributing substantial sums to the Polish treasury, expected to reach Dollars 580m in 1993 alone. Public perceptions of the pace of privatisation have been clouded so far by political delays to the introduction of the mass privatisation programme (mpp) and the time consuming nature of 'sectoral privatisation'. The latter has involved detailed studies of 36 industrial sectors, comparisons with similar industries in established market economies, and the setting up of competitive bidding procedures for potential foreign investors. In April, parliament with tacit left wing support, approved the long-delayed mpp in an amended form. This gave pensioners and public sector employees extra shares in 200 of the 600 state or municipally owned enterprises whose ownership and management is to be transferred to 20 National Investment Funds. Shares in the NIFs, tradeable over the counter to start with and subsequently to be quoted on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, will be distributed to the population for a small registration fee equivalent to Dollars 20, or 10 per cent of an average month's salary. The original timetable for implementing the mpp called for the appointment of fund managers by a state selection committee to be set up by the prime minister this summer. In spite of the dissolution of parliament the timetable will be adhered to, although the five MPs who were to be part of the 19 person committee will not now be appointed until after the mid-September election. By October-November the committee, which includes two trade union representatives and 12 experts chosen by the government in addition to the five late-joining MPs, is scheduled to choose from the growing list of foreign and domestic fund managers who have expressed an interest in managing the new funds. A call for tenders will be sent to the management companies in July. Fund managers will receive an annual fee, topped up by performance-related bonuses and share options at the end of the envisaged 10-year initial life of the funds. New Year's day, 1994, has been set as the launch date for the new funds, with the issue of share certificates to start in the first quarter. Poles will then have six months to register and claim their certificates. The strategic, 10-year, management functions to be assumed by the 20 new NIFs is what most clearly distinguishes the Polish mpp from its closest equivalent, the Czech mpp. In the Czech case the investment funds appeared spontaneously following the launch of the mpp and were not part of the government's programme. The then Czechoslovak government simply arranged for the privatisation of 1,300 state enterprises and issued books of vouchers which could be used to bid for shares in the chosen enterprises. In practice most Czech and Slovak voucher holders, unaware of the identity or potential value of participating enterprises, delegated this choice to the private funds which were mainly created by state-owned banks lacking proven fund management skills or experience. The Polish mpp, however, hangs on the quality and skills of the still-to-be-appointed fund managers whose task will be to convert the enterprises in their portfolios into profitable investments. Mr Lewandowski has long argued that this is most likely to happen if experienced foreign fund managers, backed by management consultants and able to hire managerial talent, are invited to run or assist the funds. Significantly this view is shared by the major left wing groups in parliament, including the former communists. Opposition comes mainly from the xenophobic confederation for an Independent poland (KPN) and the various catholic nationalist and smaller peasant parties and could well become an issue in the election campaign. Another irritant in the smooth implementation of the mpp is President Walesa, who, having promised Poles that privatisation would make them Dollars 10,000 richer during his own presidential election campaign in 1990, keeps re-surfacing with his own mpp proposals. The plans involve bank loans and charges on the budget way beyond the capacity of both sources to satisfy. 'Whatever I can do will be below Polish expectations,' Mr Lewandowski shrugs in mock despair. But the average Polish worker employed by a state enterprise should gain through the mpp or other forms of privatisation. Enterprises privatised by a smorgasbord of different variants have to set aside up to 20 per cent of their shares, or a smaller proportion linked to the average wage, to workers in the enterprise. Up to 10 per cent of these shares are given to the workers and a further 10 per cent can be bought at a 50 per cent discount. Under the terms of the Enterprise Pact recently signed between the government, trade unions and enterprises, representatives of the workers also sit on the supervisory boards of privatised companies. The sting in the tail, however, is that privatisation abolishes workers' councils. This means an end to the cosy alliance between workers and state enterprise managers - the last vestige of old style proletarianism. The enterprise pact, which requires management and workers to submit their own privatisation proposals within six months, is crucial for the smooth privatisation of the heavy industrial sector and big labour or capital intensive enterprises. The sectoral privatisation, under which consultants working for the government have prepared 36 sectors of the economy for sale, is also expected to take off in coming months. The first sectors to be privatised in this way include the detergents, soap and toiletries industry, industrial gases, and cables, in which management consultants Bain and Co, bankers Samuel Montagu and auditors Coopers &amp; Lybrand were involved, and the Pulp and Paper industry, where the government was advised by Hambros bank. Sectoral privatisation has also attracted the attention of the multinationals. Procter and Gamble, Unilever, Henkel and Benckiser, for example, all bought detergent plants, while International Paper corporation kicked off paper sector privatisation by paying Dollars 120m for the Kwidzyn paper plant. All pledged to spend heavily on modernisation and expansion. All these deals, and others including the chemical industry, telecommunications and other strategic sectors, involve substantial investment pledges and employment guarantees, which tend to be decisive factors in choosing between competitive tenders from foreign companies. But, with more than 6,000 state enterprises still to be privatised, large scope remains for traditional Polish state enterprises to be taken over by management or management-worker buy-outs. Turning these enterprises round remains the real challenge facing both sectoral privatisation and the mass privatisation programme.</p>

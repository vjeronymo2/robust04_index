			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Communist leader Gennadiy Zyuganov refuted  in an interview with Interfax the allegations on mass opposition  rallies on May 9. "For our party everything will be within the  scope of law. May 9 will be just Victory Day," he emphasized.    Zyuganov announced that the Communist Party continued to  work  in the conciliatory commission on the final version of the  treaty on civil accord. He repeated that he had submitted the  proposals put forward at the recent conference of the Communist  Party to the Russian president during the signing ceremony in  the Kremlin. Zyuganov himself did not sign the treaty. "We are  waiting for a reply and we are ready to discuss the problems,"  he said. The present text of the document does not conform with  aspirations to the national accord, Zyuganov suggested. "This is  an accord by officers. Social accord is something different.  It must come from the people. There can be no reconciliation  in order to rob the people and to destroy the country," Zyuganov  said.    "On the other hand, it does not give much to entrepreneurs.  At the moment entrepreneurs can only sell money instead of  producing something," Zyuganov remarked.    Speaking at a meeting of veterans of the Great Patriotic War  (as World War II is known in Russia) dedicated to the 49-year  anniversary of victory, Zyuganov repeated that the Communists  were seeking the restoration of the USSR. He also apologized  for the criminals who had been the party members and had  betrayed their supporters. Now only people representing the  cream and the conscience of the nation remain in the Communist  Party, Zyuganov reassured.</p>

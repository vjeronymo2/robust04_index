			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Israel moves to ban extremist Jewish groups Two extremist anti-Arab Jewish groups were banned and branded as terrorist by Israel yesterday, in a move designed to bring the Palestine Liberation Organisation back to the suspended Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. The concession to the PLO came after Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, said a package of guarantees allowing the Palestinians to return to the peace negotiations may be reached at today's meeting in Vladivostok between Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, and Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state. The two countries are co-sponsors of the Middle East peace process. PLO officials said yesterday under the agreement Russia and the US would back a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning last month's Hebron mosque massacre and providing for the deployment of an international force in the territories to help protect Palestinian lives. Israel would promise to speed up the peace talks on implementing Palestinian self-rule and would complete a military withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho by April 13. In return the PLO would resume talks in Washington and Paris next Monday. The outlawing of Kehane Lives and Kach, two militant orthodox Jewish groups which glorify violence against Palestinians in the Israeli occupied territories, has been one of the PLO demands for returning to talks. Both groups, which have only a handful of activists, are followers of Rabbi Meir Kehane, a slain Jewish racist who believed violence against Arabs sanctify Jews, reveal God's glory and bring the coming of the Messiah closer. Kach has been banned from parliamentary politics since 1988 because of its racist electoral platform which demanded prison terms for Arabs and Jews who had sexual relations. Mr Baruch Goldstein, the Jewish settler who massacred 30 Palestinians in a Hebron Mosque last month, was a member of Kach. Mr Michael Ben-Yair, attorney general, compared the two organisations with the Islamic extremist Hamas movement which rejects peace talks and advocates violence against Jews. Mr Ben-Yair said the two groups wanted to create a Jewish theocracy in the biblical land of Israel and force the 2m Palestinians living in the territories to leave. The cabinet unanimously endorsed the ban after reports from the police and internal security that members of the two organisations were involved in murders of Arabs.</p>

This  programme, which was already the subject of an initial  ministerial discussion in October, has two dimensions which fall  in the jurisdiction of the European Community (this part will be  the subject of a Council-EP [European Parliament] joint  decision) and EURATOM (to be approved by a unanimous decision of  the Council, according to Article 7 of the EURATOM Treaty).    The political consensus (which should make possible the  final  adoption of the framework programme before the expiry of the  current Parliament's mandate) is still faced with a series of  fundamental differences concerning three points: the global  amount of expenditure, the breakdown of funds between the  various lines of action, the role of the Joint Research Centre  (JRC). Discussions are looking tedious and will probably drag  into the night. Below are more details regarding the three items.    (1) the overall amount of 13.1 billion ECUs proposed by the  Commission is still considered too high by several delegations,  including the United Kingdom's. On 18 November the EP proposed a  600-million-ECU increase in order to include the THERMIE  [European Technologies for Energy Control] programme. This would  bring the overall amount to 13.7 billion. A compromise could be  reached at the level initially proposed by the Commission, by  "freezing" temporarily part of expenditure, to be released at a  later phase of execution of the fourth framework programme. This  procedure already demonstrated its usefulness on the occasion of  the third framework programme (there was also considerable  difficulty here concerning funding).    (2) the breakdown of funds between the various lines of  action to be achieved through specific programmes. The EP would  like to place particular importance on non-nuclear energies,  socio-economic research, industrial technologies, ECSC [European  Coal and Steel Community] research as well as on the promotion  of international cooperation and the diffusion and  optimalization of research results. Among the national  delegations, there is a tendency in favour of work on the  environment and life sciences and technologies, in parallel to a  certain decline in the primordial interest reserved in the third  programme on information technologies and communications.    (3) the role of the Joint Research Centre (JRC): the Council  is expected to give its political agreement to the guidelines  foreseeing that the JRC's institutional activities will be fully  financed by the framework programme and that the JRC can  participate in Community actions outside the programme (e.g.  PHARE [Poland-Hungary--Actions for Economic Reconversion], TACIS  [Technical Assistance Program for the CIS], etc.) by benefiting  from Community financing linked with these actions in the  framework of a competitive approach. Following on what is the  case with national laboratories, the competitive part should  enable the JRC to offer its expertise for the participation in  actions to be implemented according to the "shared financing"  formula.    The Presidency believes that a political agreement on these  three key problems would enable the Council, as part of the  joint decision-making procedure with the Parliament, to ratify  the 1994-1998 framework programme before the EP is dissolved in  spring and to ensure the continuity of the Community's research  policy. Minor differences in view remain, however, on other  points.    The Council should, moreover, have no major problems in  adopting:    (a) protocol No 2 of the ITER [International Thermonuclear  Experimental Reactor] Agreement on cooperation between EURATOM,  Japan, the Federation of Russia and the United States with  regard to activities having to do with the detailed project  (EDA) of the experimental thermonuclear reactor;    (b) a Council resolution on the future of test reactors.  This  resolution would mark the Community's interest in safeguarding  an adequate and performing potential of such reactors while  underlining its concern for the situation of the fuel cycle. The  Council will also underscore the importance that it attaches in  health care to the medical applications of test reactors,  especially for the production of radio-elements indispensable  for the diagnosis and therapy of certain illnesses, in  particular cancer.</p>

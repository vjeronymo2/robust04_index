			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Leading Article: TV with frontiers The European Commission complains it is often accused unjustly of unnecessary and intrusive meddling. However, proposals for EU audio-visual policy currently being drafted in Brussels appear designed to prove its critics right. They also raise questions about the commitment of the Commission - and notably of Mr Jacques Delors, its president - to putting EU interests above those of individual members. The proposals would modify the EU's five-year-old broadcasting directive, which calls on broadcasters to ensure that half their programming is of European origin. As well as toughening this rule by removing a provision that it be applied only 'where practicable', the draft modifications would narrow the definition of programmes which could be counted as part of the quotas and require half of independently-produced programmes to be recent material. They would also set guidelines for investment in film channels and ban advertising on home shopping services. By any measure, these changes would traduce the Commission's purpose in drafting the original directive. This was to harmonise national rules just enough to remove obstacles to cross-frontier broadcasting. The provision for quotas was inserted at the insistence of France, which threatened otherwise to oppose the idea. How far the directive has promoted a single market in television is unknown. However, the aim of the proposed revisions seems clear: it is to protect production houses and broadcasters from non-European competition, notably from Hollywood. The implied restrictions on free choice are intrinsically objectionable. By seeking to impose a straitjacket on a sector which is exploding under the impact of rapid technological change, the proposals also defy logic. At best, they would be absurdly cumbersome to administer. At worst, they would lock Europe's entertainment industries into the structure of the past and deter innovation and commercial investment in emerging multi-media services. Most damaging of all, the proposals would do nothing to advance the single market. On the contrary, they could further undermine it by legitimising continued protection of national industries. This seems to have been the effect of the existing directive in France, its keenest proponent. Local content quotas have been established by law and freely interpreted as favouring French programming. It is disturbing that much of the drive behind the proposed revisions is from some of Mr Delors' closest advisers in Brussels. That inevitably raises doubts about how far they are intended to benefit the EU, and how far to serve French national interests. Mr Delors' fellow commissioners would do well to remove any such suspicions by voting the proposals down. That would also be the best outcome for Europe's media industry and its customers.</p>

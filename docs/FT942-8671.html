			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Critchley aims to expand with DM27.5m German buy Critchley Group, the electrical cable accessories manufacturer, plans to acquire Idento, a German cable identification products group, for DM27.5m (Pounds 11m) cash. The proposed deal will provide Critchley with a Ger-man manufacturing base, access to the important German market, and a broadened range of cable identification products. Mr Ian McCallum, Critchley's chief executive, said the deal represented 'an excellent opportunity' to expand overseas and to purchase a business with good margins. The deal will enhance earnings immediately. Critchley plans to fund the acquisition of the trade, assets and freehold property of the German company, together with the assumption of about DM900,000 of liabilities, through an open offer to shareholders designed to raise about Pounds 10m before expenses. The exact price of the open offer, which is underwritten up to a maximum of 370p a share by SG Warburg Securities, has yet to be determined. The shares closed up 19p at 431p yesterday. Critchley, which came to the market in November 1992 with a strategy for over-seas expansion both through organic growth and acqui-sition, also announced estimated full year results yesterday. Pre-tax profits are expected to show a 26 per cent increase to Pounds 3.85m (Pounds 3.05m) on turnover of Pounds 28.8m (Pounds 24m) for the year to March 31. A final dividend of 5.5p (4.8p) is forecast. Idento, which was founded in 1976, is owned by Berliner Elektro Holding, a quoted investment fund and associate of Chemie Holdings. In the year to December 31 the company reported operating profits of DM2.46m on sales of DM7.75m. About 60 per cent of its sales were made direct to mainly engineering and electrical customers, and 22 per cent of its turnover was exported, mostly to other European companies.</p>

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / The FT Interview: Germany's young pretender - Rudolf Scharping, leader of the opposition Social Democrats On the wall of the state premier's office in Mainz, capital of Germany's Rhineland-Palatinate, hangs a large and rather faded Gobelin tapestry. It has been there since the days when Mr Helmut Kohl, German chancellor, was the first man in the Land. I confess that I don't find it very beautiful,' says Mr Rudolf Scharping, the current incumbent of the office. 'I'm planning to replace it with this,' he says, producing from behind his desk an austere but striking Andy Warhol original, recently presented by a friend. The painting features three champagne glasses, two of them overturned, one upright. 'It seems rather appropriate,' he says. Just so. For Mr Scharping emerged in June as the clear victor in a three-way race for the leadership of Germany's opposition Social Democrats. Since then he has moved rapidly to consolidate his position, persuading his principal rivals to back him as party candidate for Chancellor. The fact that he has still not quite set his personal seal on his office in Mainz, since he defeated Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union in state elections in April 1991, is also perhaps appropriate. For his sights are now set on Bonn, and the race to displace Mr Kohl in next year's national elections. It is going to be an uphill struggle, the young pretender against the old campaigner. The SPD has been floundering in the opinion polls, locked in inner-party debates, and shaken by the resignation of its former leader, Mr Bjo rn Engholm, because of a local political scandal, just when it should have been leading the CDU. The economy is in the doldrums; unification, Mr Kohl's great achievement, is proving painful in both east and west; and Mr Kohl himself, in office for 11 years, is blamed for lack of leadership. Yet Mr Scharping, dapper, neatly-bearded and articulate, but uninspiring in delivery, immodestly sees his own election as SPD leader  - in the first poll of grassroots party members - as a potential turning-point. He could be right. 'The SPD is suddenly more hopeful,' he says. 'June 13 (the day of the leadership poll) was a great relief. All this discontent and anxiety, if not completely wiped out, has at least become much less important. Now we must try to use this new enthusiasm.' He has to overcome the natural inclination of the left-wing Social Democrats to self-destruct in internecine warfare; to counter the impression that social democracy has no role, since the collapse of communism; and to shake-off an immediate inclination of the media to label him as a mini-Helmut Kohl - a cautious man of consensus and career politician, leading from behind. Since June he has shown he can act decisively, swiftly appointing an election team to unite the the party. Now he has to deal with the issues, and raise his public profile. It is easier said than done. Last week he suffered his first reverse, when his party colleagues refused to back a move to relax their objections to the Bundeswehr (military) becoming a full participant in UN operations. 'It is embarrassing,' he admits, 'but it is also absurd that a significant part of our whole debate on foreign relations should be concerned exclusively with military matters: that is a dangerous limitation. A foreign policy which fails to keep focused on the economic, social and political stabilisation of eastern Europe, which loses sight of the north-south divide, and therefore loses sight of the real causes of worldwide migration of peoples, that is no foreign policy at all.' He argues that the answer lies in strengthening the UN itself. 'As it gets stronger, and its activities become UN activities, and not merely the extended arm of a single member state, then it will be easier to see its activities as part of a genuine common security. That is a concept the SPD has always had in mind.' The next tough issue he has to deal with is the question of curbing the explosion of social welfare costs. He knows that his party cannot continue simply to oppose all cuts in social spending, at a time when the budget deficit, fuelled by the costs of unification, is soaring. 'The government is trying to cut social spending at the expense of the people who can least afford it, the homeless and the unemployed,' he says. 'That is unacceptable. It won't create more jobs or houses. We need to ask what payments are necessary, which people need them, and at what income level should they be paid.' That means more means testing. As a state premier responsible for attracting investment to his own area, he is acutely conscious of the debate over the high costs, and declining competitiveness, of Germany as an investment location. He does not think the answer lies in going back to a 40-hour week. He does think there should be far more flexibility. 'Some international companies are much more imaginative about this than the political establishment,' he says, citing the example of IBM in Mainz. He sees the idea of 'social dumping' - seeking to attract new investment by offering lower wage costs, including social costs, to companies - as self-defeating. 'It won't work in Germany, France, the Benelux countries or Great Britain,' he says. He wants the Maastricht treaty put into effect, and he wants Britain to sign on to the social chapter. 'But I don't have any advice to give,' he insists. 'Britain must decide for itself.' As for economic and monetary union, 'Nobody in Europe should make themselves slaves to a timetable.' What European co-operation needs to focus on is joint action to tackle the technological deficit. 'I remember 15 years ago books appeared in the US calling Europe the sclerotic continent. We were dying of old age, and would perish. It has not happened. 'But I am in favour of the Europeans discovering their common interests. One problem we all share is that in product innovation we must make greater efforts. We should do that together. Our key industries of the future, like micro-technology, computers, electronics, genetic technology and bio-technology, are too weak. We cannot just sit back. If we do, we will learn very painfully that these strengths can be acquired by others, too.' Mr Scharping's predecessor as SPD leader, Mr Engholm, was probably more telegenic. He was also an instinctively gloomy, pipe-smoking northerner. Mr Scharping doesn't fiddle with a pipe. Instead, he sits calmly eating a peach in the middle of the interview. Unlike Mr Engholm, he also knows the dangers of excessive pessimism. It lost the SPD the last election, because they spelt out the costs of unification all too bluntly. 'There are far too many people in Germany who just talk in terms of tasks and problems and difficulties, and not about opportunities and challenges,' he says. 'I don't underplay the problems, but for me, unification is not just an historic opportunity, it is also an extraordinary challenge. 'That should not prevent one saying what needs to be done, in order to turn that opportunity into reality. Most people who vote in elections are voting for a hope, for a vision of a future, not a reckoning with the past. It's the job of the SPD to give a realistic hope for the future.' The media is obsessed with the likelihood of Scharping and Kohl working together in a grand coalition after the next election. But the SPD man won't be drawn. 'The chances are very small,' he says. 'The polls don't tell us much about what could happen next year. If I believed the polls I would never be sitting here. 'Things will only get better in Germany if the SPD gets stronger. That is what I am concentrating on right now. Whoever eventually may offer to help the SPD take power, that can be decided after the next elections.'

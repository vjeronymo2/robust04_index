			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / World Trade News: GEC will build Dollars 1.5bn power station in India GEC, the big UK industrial group, yesterday signed a memorandum of understanding worth Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1.02bn) to build a 1,000MW coal-fired power station in Maharashtra state, India. It will also take a Dollars 100m equity stake in the project which will sell power to the state electricity board. The memorandum was one of three signed yesterday after Mr PV Narasimha Rao, India's prime minister, saw Mr John Major, his British counterpart, in London to review the year-old Indo-British Partnership Initiative (IBPI) established when Mr Major visited India with a group of businessmen in January 1993. Rolls-Royce signed a memorandum of understanding to transfer transformer technology to Kirloskar Electric of Bangalore, and GPT, the telecoms equipment joint venture between GEC and Siemens, signed one for a communications contract in Bombay. Britain is India's largest investor with assets of more than Pounds 2bn. Co-chairmen of the IBPI told a news conference that it had led to a 26 per cent increase in UK exports to India and a 20 per cent rise in imports from India. The two countries also signed an investment protection agreement, including intellectual property rights. The UK is the first country with which India has signed such an agreement. The accord, aimed at nurturing the IBPI - extended for a further year from the original one year - offers two-way protection for a wide range of investments including moveable and immovable property, mortgages, liens, pledges, shares and stocks. Mr Robert Evans, chairman of the British side, said that while the latest Indian budget had been welcomed, there remained reservations in the areas of transfer of capital, industrial relations, the tax regime and intellectual property rights. Dr Jamshed Irani, the Indian chairman, welcomed the initiative's success and denied that there had been complaints from some smaller Indian companies about the inequality of the relationship with British partners. Nuchem-Weir, a joint venture between India's Nuchem Plastics and Weir Westgarth of the UK, is entering the rapidly-growing bottled drinking water market in India, Andrew Baxter writes. They will build a water purification and bottling plant at Nuchem-Weir's headquarters in Faridabad.</p>

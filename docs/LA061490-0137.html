			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> COST OVERRUNS EXPECTED  </P> <P> Construction costs for the new police building and jail could rise by another  $500,000 over the $23.4 million already budgeted, the acting director of the  city's Administrative Services Agency told the Board of Directors Tuesday.  </P> <P> City officials plan to withhold $300,000 from contractors who they say failed  to follow plans.  </P> <P> Another $200,000 in expenses is being negotiated, acting Director Norman Carter  reported.  </P> <P> According to Carter's report, the overruns were because of faulty cost  forecasting by city staff, poor architectural drawings, inadequate management  by the first construction manager and division of the project into three phases  with separate overseers, resulting in duplication.  </P> <P> A $17-million bond issue for the police building was approved by voters in  1986. The directors approved an additional $6.4 million last October.  </P></p>

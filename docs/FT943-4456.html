			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bonds exert varied influence on bourses Bond markets had a more varied influence on equities than on Tuesday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT's bond and equity markets responded only fleetingly to a newspaper int-erview of Mr Hans Jurgen Krupp, a Bundesbank council member, who appeared to be saying that rates could be cut now, allowing Buba room for manoeuvre when the time comes to raise them again. The reaction itself was fairly tepid. The Dax index, which had closed the session down 2.08 at 2,163.82, saw a peak of 2,172.97 in the afternoon but closed the day at an Ibis-indicated 2,167.68, with bonds on their way down again. A little after the equity market ended, the September bund future was back in dangerous territory, below the 90 mark at 89.91 and 15 basis points lower on the day. Turnover rose from DM4.9bn to DM5.4bn. In the automotive sector, BMW pleased analysts with the news that it will introduce extra working shifts and create additional jobs to meet a high level of demand in the second half of the year. On the session, the shares rose just DM4.50 to DM815 but they improved further to DM817.80 after hours. PARIS moved its bonds up and down, rather more gently than their Frankfurt counterparts, and equities ended flat after early gains of around a percentage point. The CAC-40 index finished 2.75 higher at 1,964.20 in turnover of FFr3.46bn. Here, some company results had more effect. Promodes, the retailer, rose FFr12 to FFr936 as it saw an increase exceeding 15 per cent in 1994 net. Total, the oil company, ended FFr3.70 stronger at FFr307.90 on a higher first-half net. Elf Aquitaine went with Total, up FFr4.10 at FFr399, partly on a newspaper report that it stood to make FFr1.3bn on the divesting of part of its stakes in the petrochemical engineering companies Technip and Coflexip. Elf had no comment to make. ZURICH largely overlooked the weak dollar and bond market, foreign demand outweighing profit-taking by local investors as the SMI index climbed 10.1 to 2,662.5. Ciba bearers rose SFr12 to SFr804: Bear Stearns initiated coverage of the major Swiss pharmaceutical stocks this week with a buy rating on Ciba. Ascom, the troubled telecommunications group due to release half-year figures today, fell SFr70 to SFr1,510. MILAN saw a good performance in domestic bond futures, but its equity market was depressed by comments from the treasury minister Mr Lamberto Dini that the country's creaking pensions system faced a higher deficit this year than earlier expected. The Comit index slipped 4.60 to 658.39 in very quiet trading. The mood was also soured by domestic funds lightening their portfolios, after news of a L78bn net outflow from investment funds during August raised worries about liquidity. Generali, a potential beneficiary of pension reform, bucked the downward trend, picking up L318 to L40,764, after testing support at L40,000. Among telecommunications issues, Telecom Italia fell L35 to L4,370 and Stet gave up L80 to L4,750. MADRID seemed to like a commment from the Spanish economy minister Mr Pedro Solbes that interest rates were too high compared with Germany's - at a premium of around 385 basis points - and that it should be possible to reduce them in the coming months. The domestic bond market improved and the general index recovered 3.19 to 298.27. Turnover was much healthier at Pta32.5bn, but a big block trade in Asturiana de Zinc accounted for about a third of that as 7.07m shares, or 23 per cent of its share capital, went through the market at Pta1,500 a share. AMSTERDAM took its cue from the latest round of company results as the AEX index firmed 0.89 to 415.17. Ahold, the retailer, rose Fl 1.30 to Fl 49.70 in heavy turnover after its better than expected second-quarter figures on Tuesday, and Grolsch, the brewer, gained 80 cents at Fl 50.80 after a better than expected first half. Cap Volmac, the computer services group, added Fl 1.20, or 6 per cent, at Fl 21.70 after its upbeat profits forecast. ISTANBUL fell 6.8 per cent on domestic political worries, the composite index closing 1,769.48 lower at 24,347.98 after one Turkish deputy resigned, and another put in a request to do so, bringing the level of vacant seats to 22 - just one below the level at which mandatory by-elections would be triggered. Economists and traders worried that any election campaign could force the ruling coalition to water down its tough stabilisation programme, raising subsidies and easing economic policies to win votes.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Sep 7 Hourly changes           Open       10.30       11.00       12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1373.50     1374.65     1371.42     1369.60 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1430.06     1432.70     1430.74     1429.53  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                         13.00       14.00       15.00       Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1370.06     1370.17     1371.20     1371.13 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1430.62     1430.62     1431.51     1429.33  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Sep 6     Sep 5     Sep 2     Sep 1    Aug 31  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1371.03   1380.11   1401.66   1396.82  1405.52 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1427.57   1438.12   1451.57   1450.09  1480.56  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base 1000 (26/10/90), High/day: 100 - 1374.94, 200 - 1433.43 Low/day: 100 - 1368.83 200 - 1428.39 +Partial  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Written and edited by William Cochrane and Michael Morgan</p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: MICROPHONE IS ON; LET THE CONFESSIONS BEGIN  </P> <P> Remember all the dirty laundry we were never supposed to air in public? Well,  it's now being hung out to dry on television by Phil, Oprah, Sally, Jessy,  Maury and Geraldo.  </P> <P> I've never seen so many people spilling their guts to Chuck Woolery and Barbara  Walters in my life. Not just little bits of family trivia, but deep emotional  scars . . . repressed hostility . . . dark family secrets that you wouldn't  tell a psychiatrist if he or she paid you.  </P> <P> I was watching a couple the other day lay bare her frigidity and his impotence  and couldn't help reflecting how far we have come.  </P> <P> Was it only a few years ago that Bob Eubanks asked a couple on "The Newlywed  Game" which way they were facing when they "made whoopee" -- the Arctic Circle,  South America or Ohio? And the audience gasped?  </P> <P> Hookers want to tell us why they love their work, nuns why they left the order,  fathers why they abused their children, black women what they feel about their  husbands having white mistresses, and children how satanic cults tear their  families apart.  </P> <P> I watched a woman in a talk show audience the other day verbally assault a  guest with, "I knew from the moment you walked in here you were a shiftless,  no-good slime bucket who was stupid and should be put away somewhere." They had  never met until that moment. The audience cheered.  </P> <P> Why are people so eager to dump their feelings on talk shows like bellhops  hustling luggage with bad backs? Many of them are out of control, on an  emotional slalom that leaves them in a teary heap at the end of the show.  </P> <P> It has to be something simple like the appearance of a microphone. When you put  one in front of people or attach it to them, they fall under a spell. It isn't  real anymore. They will tell you anything.  </P> <P> After 11 years on TV, I never got over the shock of taping a microphone on the  guest's underwear (someone I had never met before) and watching the  metamorphosis take place.  </P> <P> Got a problem with your husband, your kids, your boss or your mother? Forget  Joan Rivers and Judge Wapner. Just sit down with them under a bright light,  clip on a microphone and hammer it out.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NCAA POLICIES NEED MAJOR RECONSTRUCTION  </P> <P> As the collegiate football season nears an end, it can be hoped that the NCAA  will now review its policies regarding sanctions against schools in violation  of NCAA rules.  </P> <P> In light of many of the NCAA's actions, one must wonder at the organization's  integrity. Certainly its intelligence is brought into question.  </P> <P> A few years ago the NCAA handed Southern Methodist University's football  program the "death penalty." Not only was SMU, a member of the Southwest  Conference, stripped of all its athletic scholarships and its eligibility to  appear on TV or in postseason bowl games, it was banned from fielding a  football team for a couple of seasons. This was a punishment from which the  university has not yet recovered.  </P> <P> As a result of the harsh sanctions against SMU, the entire Southwest Conference  has suffered. Houston, Florida and Oklahoma are the other schools whose  football teams labored this year under bans denying them eligibility for  postseason play.  </P> <P> Who is really punished by such bans as those administered by the NCAA? When you  consider that Houston, Florida and Oklahoma all finished among the top 20 teams  in the nation, it seems that not only were those schools and their alumni  penalized, but so were football fans everywhere. We will not have the  opportunity to see any of these schools in any bowl game -- because of  infractions committed by players and coaches no longer connected with the  schools.  </P> <P> The legal system of our country does not condemn an entire community because of  the presence of a few criminals. Nor should the NCAA penalize an entire school,  an athletic program, or an entire team because of the presence of a few  violators of the rules. Sanctions should be enforced only against guilty  individuals . . . players and coaches. Sanctions should be strong enough to  remove those found guilty of infractions but should not be of such a nature as  to destroy any phase of a school's program.  </P> <P> There is big money in collegiate sports, and the revenue received from athletic  programs support many academic, non-athletic programs. To deprive any  institution of the maximum income its athletic program can generate is unfair  in that it works hardship on countless students not involved in athletics. It  is time for the NCAA to stop punishing schools and programs and to impose its  bans only on individual wrongdoers.  </P> <P> ART MAGEE  </P> <P> Escondido  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHARGER REVIEW;  </P> <P> REPORT CARD / T.J. SIMERS;  </P> <P> NOTHING AVERAGE ABOUT THESE MARKS  </P> <P> B+ QUARTERBACKS  </P> <P> All those who booed Billy Joe Tolliver may apologize by contacting Stella, the  Chargers' receptionist, at 280-2111. No collect calls, please.  </P> <P> B RUNNING BACKS  </P> <P> Tolliver on Marion Butts: "He'll give you religion in a hurry if you're trying  to tackle him." Amen. Rod Bernstine brings Bucs to their knees.  </P> <P> C- RECEIVERS  </P> <P> Instead of dressing as a ghost for Halloween, youngsters may want to go as  Charger wide receivers. Same difference. Only Anthony Miller stands out.  </P> <P> B- OFFENSIVE LINE  </P> <P> Who are these guys? No sacks. Four rushing touchdowns. What's next? It's like  waking up to discover Rosanne Barr has been selected Miss America.  </P> <P> A DEFENSIVE LINE  </P> <P> Lee Williams drops Howard Hughes imitation and breaks out of hiding to get  first solo sack since Cleveland. Burt Grossman has 17 sacks in last 17 games.  </P> <P> A LINEBACKERS  </P> <P> Asking Gary (the plowhorse) Plummer to cover Gary Anderson is like asking  Buster Douglas not to eat. Fat chance, but then check out the final stats.  </P> <P> B- DEFENSIVE BACKS  </P> <P> All-out blitz backfires, but stats have Chargers tied for NFL lead with 14  interceptions. After the Reds swept the A's, you knew anything was possible.  </P> <P> A SPECIAL TEAMS  </P> <P> Chargers make mulligan count in re-signing John (never a doubt) Carney. Kickoff  unit limits Bucs to average return of 10.8 yards a try. Why bother?  </P> <P> A COACHING  </P> <P> All those who were asking for Dan Henning's firing may apologize by contacting  Stella, the Chargers' receptionist, at 280-2111.  </P></p>

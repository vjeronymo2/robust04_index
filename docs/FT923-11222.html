			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Arts: The Sun that never sets - Records JUST BEFORE Sun Ra and his Solar Myth Arkestra arrived at the Brecon Jazz Festival, to no-one's surprise, a wizard occupied the centre aisle of the market hall venue - crescents, goatee, aromatherapy tackle and all - to await an old man who claims to be from Saturn. Ra and his Arkestra, with imagery which combines Eygptology with pulp sci-fi, has always attracted a jolly lunatic fringe. But his wide ranging writing and arrangements, which mix big band grandeur with quirky and often free improvisation, could command universal appeal. A dearth of easily available recorded material has helped keep Sun Ra in the cult category, however, and until recently his records, many of them released in small numbers on his own Saturn label, were stricly for aficionados or collectors. With Ra in the twilight of his career the situation has been rectified with the release of a series of CDs from Pennslyvania-based Evidence Music Inc and another from Black Saint, Mayan Temples. The five Evidence albums are cleaned up reissues of Ra's own creaky Saturn recordings from the early Fifties into the Sixties, with original liner illustration, good notes and pyschedelically embossed discs. Mayan Temples, recorded only two years ago and covering more recent material, provides the other bookend to a long career. Although he denies it now, he started out as Sonny Blount, born sometime around 1910 in Birmingham, Alabama. He worked his way north, via the southern circuit, to Chicago where, at the Club DeLisa, he met big band leader Fletcher Henderson. Usually cited as Ra's major influence, Fletcher Henderson employed him as pianist and arranger for only two years (1947 - 49) before Ra's own writing and space age pre-occupations began to evolve, first with a trio and eventually with 12 pieces. The Arkestra, often with the same personnel for years on end, has been in colourful orbit ever since. At an Arkestra show Ra's cosmic cadets fill the stage, a constellation of brass, lurex and sequins. Old hands tenorist John Gilmore and altoist Marshall Allen have blasted off alongside alumni such as Clifford Jarvis, Julian Priester and Pharoah Sanders in their time. The leader, stately but fragile after a stroke in 1990, is wrapped in tinsel and half carried to the front of the stage by two acolytes. Between thoughtfully placed chunks of chords he peers wistfully through watery eyes across synth and piano keyboards as younger members of the ensemble turn cartwheels. If the show is out of this world so is the music and the new Evidence discs do it justice, covering a period when Ra's ideas and influences were gelling. Sound Sun Pleasure (ECD 22013), for example, contains what are said to be Ra's first ever seven sides, when the band was the Astro-Infinity Arkestra, and they range from the Gershwins' 'S'Wonderful' to the corn of a crooning 'Dreams Come True'. Five cracking discs are available from Evidence, including Monorails and Satellites, a solo outing for Ra at piano, and five more from the Saturn catalogue are due in October. Holiday for Soul Dance (ECD22011), Jazz In Silhouette (ECD 22012), Monorails And Satellites (ECD22013), Sound Sun Pleasure (ECD 22014), Supersonic Jazz (ECD 22015) are on the Evidence label. Mayan Temples (120121-2) is on Black Saint. All are available from distributors Harmonia Mundi in London (Tel: 071-253-0863).</p>

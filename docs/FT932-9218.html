			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Inntrepreneur needs further Pounds 130m injection GRAND METROPOLITAN and Courage will each have to inject another Pounds 65m into Inntrepreneur Estates, their pubs joint venture, in October to comply with banking covenants. The two companies each paid Pounds 32m into IEL last year to meet the banks' requirements. GrandMet also announced changes in its policy of converting IEL pubs to 20-year leases which has aroused opposition from tenants who claimed that the rent increases involved were forcing them out of business. The failure rate of IEL's pubs has been running at about 9 per cent a year. With 70 per cent of the 6,800 pubs on the new leases, the banks have agreed that IEL will not now be required to convert 90 per cent of the pubs to leases by March next year. Mr David Tagg, chief executive of GrandMet's UK retailing division, said that the move would give 'greater operational flexibility to respond to current trading conditions.' Mr Tagg indicated that hard-pressed tenants of about 10 per cent of IEL's pubs would now be offered three-year leases though the long-term target of converting all the estate to 20-year leases would remain. GrandMet and Courage will share operating losses of Pounds 12m at Inntrepreneur for the six months to March. Operating profits declined from Pounds 83m to Pounds 79m, because of pub disposals, and interest charges amounted to Pounds 92m. Sir Allen Sheppard, GrandMet chairman and chief executive, however, repeated yesterday that the venture was trading in line with expectations. A further revaluation of the estate is due in September. Last year's revaluation showed a reduction of Pounds 234m in the value of the estate to Pounds 2.17bn; IEL's net assets have fallen from Pounds 582m to Pounds 320m over the past year. Disatisfied Inntrepreneur lessees last year formed Nail, a national lobbying group, to press for changes in rents and terms with GrandMet and in the courts. MPs took up the issue in March when the Commons agriculture commitee cross-examined IEL executives about the impact of leases on pub tennants and local communities.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- A blockbuster plan for a  grand alliance of opposition parties and dissident groups is  afoot again following a meeting of representatives of the  Democratic Party [DP] and two minor parties last Saturday.    Reps. Kim Tong-kil of the United People's Party and Yi  Chong-chan of the New Korea Party got together to bid farewell  to Yi Ki-taek, chairman of the Democratic Party (DP), who is  scheduled to visit the United States. It was at this  get-together that the three opposition leaders agreed to form a  working-level body to tackle problems related to formation of a  unified opposition party. The agreement is described by many as  "a step forward" from a similar pact reached last January,  according to political analysts. Since an undercurrent for a  unified opposition party has been flowing for sometime,  discussions on the alliance are expected to pick up steam once  the working-level body is set up, they said.    The need for this grand alliance is being felt by opposition  politicians as they look toward elections for heads of  autonomous local governments, they added. Nevertheless, the  prevailing opinion among independent observers is that the  notion of rallying all opposition parties together under one  flag is easier said than done since each party has its own  built-in problems as well as differences in political colors and  tendencies. The problems would become even more complicated if  the opposition parties were to embrace all dissident groups,  they said.    The key to the proposed alliance is held by the DP and the  United People's Party, whose positions differ considerably. The  New Korea Party, which currently has only two lawmakers, poses  few problems for a union, they said. Within the DP, the various  factions have reportedly reached a consensus on a unified  opposition party.    Chairman Yi Ki-taek and leaders of the "non-mainstream"  factions such as Reps. Kim Sang-hyon and Kim Won-ki are prepared  to play active roles in carrying out the move. Despite their  stated willingness to work for an opposition union, skeptics  wonder what stance each faction leader would take when it came  to nominating candidates for the local elections, for instance.  The skeptics ask: Would they give up the interests of their  factions willingly for the good of the whole? Another area that  would pose quite a problem is inclusion of dissidents, analysts  said.    A merger of the three opposition parties would be much  easier  than a union of all "dissident personalities," some of whom  espouse radical politics. In this connection, keen public  attention was focused on the recent formation of "the new era  plaza," a group that includes DP lawmakers like Yi Pu-yong, Che  Chong-ku and Yim Chae- chong and such dissidents as Kim Kon-tae  and Chang Ki-pyo. A majority of DP members are said to favor  embracing dissidents in a proposed opposition alliance. But  there could be many -- most of them unexpected -- problems as it  would mean a union of establishment politicians with dissidents,  the analysts said.    As for the United People's Party, a merger with the other  opposition parties would present a much more difficult problem.  Party representative Kim Tong-kil has responded to the overture  for an opposition alliance but Rep. Han Yong-su and others are  advocating "a union in stages." In other words, they want their  party to embrace small splinter parties and groups and  independent lawmakers first before talking about an opposition  alliance.    Rep. Han Yong-su said, "We are not against a unified  opposition party, but we believe we have to build our party up  first by absorbing splinter groups."    As these comments indicate, the proposed grand opposition  alliance is still on the drawing board. It can enter the  starting blocks only when all parties and groups arrive at a  consensus on unity.</p>

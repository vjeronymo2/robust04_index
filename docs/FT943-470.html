			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Ministers to review energy trust Ministers will soon consider options for rescuing the troubled Energy Savings Trust, a central component of the government's energy-efficiency policy. A report by officials from the Treasury, the Department of Trade and Industry, and the Department of the Environment on a fundamental review of the trust's long-term funding is understood to be near completion. The trust was established two years ago to promote energy efficiency as part of the UK's international commitment against global warming. Its Pounds 700m budget up to the year 2000 was supposed to be funded by levies on gas and electricity consumers. But this year Ms Clare Spottiswoode, the gas industry regulator, stymied the scheme by refusing to authorise a levy on the grounds that it was a form of taxation. Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, has authorised Pounds 25m a year for four years but recently declined to increase this. Among options considered by the interdepartmental review are new legislation to make it a regulator's duty to raise a sufficient levy to fund the trust in the long term. Ministers made clear yesterday that although the options would include cutting back the trust's activities, they would also explore ways of expanding its role. An early ministerial decision would allow funding measures to be included in November's Budget.</p>

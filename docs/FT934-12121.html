			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Union warns over IBM threat STAFF AT the computer unit of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency in Swansea face losing union recognition if IBM, which does not recognise unions, beats two other bidders to take over the unit. Many of the 360 staff at the computer unit will take industrial action tomorrow against privatisation after an 83 per cent vote in favour among members of the NUCPS civil service union. The union said that if IBM won it would mean further action. The two other US companies bidding for the contract, Computer Sciences and EDS-Scicon, have said they would negotiate with the union if they won. Meanwhile, employees of IBM could wait 10 years for promotion, Sir Anthony Cleaver, its UK chairman, warned yesterday. Sir Anthony, delivering a speech to the Institute of Personnel Management conference at Harrogate, North Yorkshire, said the company's new four-tier management structure meant that there were only three levels between salesmen and the chairman. The company has undergone a reorganisation of management structures, removing tiers of management to produce a 'flatter' hier-archy. The restructuring coincided with IBM reducing its UK workforce from 18,500 in 1989 to 12,000 in a four-year period through voluntary redundancies. Sir Anthony recognised the difficulties of maintaining motivation for employees working in a 'delayered' company. 'A four-tier management structure means a maximum of one promotion every 10 years and even that is for the one man who makes it to the top. I wonder whether we really know how to handle this?' Changes to IBM's revenue base - only 51 per cent came from hardware last year - had meant heavy investment in training.</p>

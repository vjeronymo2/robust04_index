			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Pacific Rim celebrates Chinese new year Major equity market blocs produced a muted performance last week, with the FT-Actuaries Indices for Japan and Europe both down 0.6 per cent, the US up by the same amount and the World Index, in local currency terms, 0.1 per cent lower over the five days. Tokyo started the week well, rising for the third consecutive day after efforts by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the Ministry of Finance to reassure investors that they were concerned about the current slump. Among their proposals were a rise in dividends and a reduction in securities trading tax. However, it weakened from Tuesday, when a fall in futures prices led to selling of the cash market. By the end of the week, criticism had mounted of futures trading and the effect of arbitrageurs on the underlying equities, and institutions were only placing buy orders at below existing market levels. The US rose on balance. Last Friday it went into the weekend depressed after an unexpected decline in employment in January, and no change in monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. Europe would have shown a rise of 0.3 per cent excluding a 1.9 per cent drop in the UK, where uncertainty over Wall Street and the political future at home kept big institutions on the sidelines. The Pacific Rim had an unexpectedly active week, or what was left of it after the Chinese New Year holidays. Hoare Govett notes that Hong Kong had only one-and-a-half trading days last week due to the holiday break, but that bullish sentiment continued. The broker detected increased participation by retail investors and that - in tandem with the Japanese derivatives theme - the more liquid blue chip warrants were heavily chased by local investors. Malaysia was the best performer of the week, although it opened only on Thursday and Friday. Over the two days, traders noted bargain hunting, index-linked buying and Malaysian corporate buyers.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                % change    % change                % change in local currency**    sterling**    in US                                                             Dollars**             1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year  Start of  Start of     Start of                                         1992      1992        1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      +2.13   +8.82   +1.07    +12.70    +11.36       +9.40 Belgium      -0.75   +2.61   +8.87     +3.36     +2.12       +0.32 Denmark      -0.12   +0.43  +13.56     +3.58     +2.91       +1.10 Finland      -0.52   +9.08   +4.89    +18.70    +17.16      +15.10 France       -0.41   +1.76  +17.61     +5.51     +4.68       +2.83 Germany      +0.56   +5.57  +11.65     +7.63     +6.58       +4.70 Ireland      -1.31   +2.47  +18.12     +5.09     +4.35       +2.51 Italy        +1.42   +3.91   +7.40     +9.73     +9.17       +7.26 Netherlands  -0.18   +3.46  +20.02     +5.31     +4.33       +2.49 Norway       -2.15   +2.21   -4.09     +5.14     +4.10       +2.26 Spain        +0.77   +1.27   +9.65     +4.45     +4.44       +2.60 Sweden       +0.83   +2.14   +6.37     +6.09     +5.57       +3.71 Switzerland  +0.98   +2.71  +21.84     +6.68     +5.70       +3.84 UK           -1.95   +1.92  +12.34     +1.40     +1.40       -0.39 EUROPE       -0.64   +2.70  +13.11     +4.27     +3.79       +1.96 Australia    -2.45   -5.52  +17.07     -4.73     -3.80       -5.50 Hong Kong    +2.55   +9.40  +44.41    +10.64    +12.98      +10.99 Japan        -0.63   -2.21   -9.10     -5.65     -4.14       -5.82 Malaysia     +3,43   +6.24   +5.01     +5.91    +12.83      +10.84 New Zealand  +0.70   -3.71   -0.05     -3.75     -1.50       -3.24 Singapore    -0.06   +2.70  +19.41     +2.99     +4.77       +2.93 Canada       -0.09   +1.20   +2.82     +2.37     +2.21       +0.41 USA          +0.59   -0.94  +16.29     -1.17     +0.59       -1.17 Mexico       +1.87   +5.87 +170.50    +12.62    +13.78      +11.77 South Africa +2.51   +0.51  +41.65     +6.78     -0.46       -2.22 WORLD INDEX  -0.06   -0.24   +7.53     -0.88     +0.14       -1.63  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on February 7th 1992.

			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Arts: Better music in the barn - Andrew Clark visits festivals in Montreux and Mezieres MONTREUX and Mezieres both play a part in late-summer cultural life in western Switzerland. Montreux's classical music festival may be the poor relation of the jazz festival, but it has been going for much longer. Mezieres, a tidy farming village with an unheated wooden theatre, is where the Opera de Lausanne decamps for the first production of each new season. By road, Montreux and Mezieres are only half-an-hour from each other, but they are worlds apart in atmosphere and artistic values. Montreux has just opened a flashy SFr 55m (Pounds 26m) lakeside concert hall, the 1800-seat Auditorium Stravinsky - designed and built by local companies, and named after the composer who completed The Rite of Spring at nearby Clarens. The purpose of the new hall is not just to upgrade the festival, but to attract more conference trade. Its tall glass facade blends well into the crowded shoreline of hotels and apartment-blocks. The interior, however, is a shambles. The front-of-house has been fitted out cheaply - neon lights, low concrete ceilings, ugly air ducts. Thanks to the reflecting glass of the foyer, you cannot enjoy the spectacular view of the lake after dark. There is no parking. The cavernous octagonal auditorium - coated with the now obligatory bright wood, reflector panels and lighting gantries - shows how little has been learned from previous concert hall design. It is far too big and spread-out. The acoustic has a quirky resonance, magnifying the tiniest thread of sound, soaking up the loudest orchestral climaxes and turning everything else into an undifferentiated mush. Judging from the concert I attended - a Strasbourg Philharmonic Orchestra pot-pourri - the musicians simply could not hear each other. The snappy chords dotted throughout the Poulenc double piano concerto (Martha Argerich and Alexander Rabinovich) were never synchronised - through no fault of the conductor, Theodor Guschlbauer. Wherever I sat, the platform seemed remote. A waste of money? Not when you consider how truly awful the old Maison des Congres was. But Montreux has missed an opportunity, falling for the myth that a concert hall and conference centre are much the same thing. Multi-purpose halls mean multiple compromise, and compromise never did anything for art. Montreux is also discovering that a new hall does not necessarily transform the content of its festival. The programme continues to be a haphazard collection of touring orchestras, some of them second-rate. It is a relief to move from the superficial glamour of one of Switzerland's principal resorts to the rustic informality of Mezieres, where interval catering is along the lines of a village fete. The 85-year old Theatre du Jorat looks like a big barn. The benches may be hard, but the acoustic is natural and there is almost tangible contact with the stage. Because of the primitive technical facilities, producers are forced to simplify their ideas. This year's opera was Cos fan tutte, with another of the well-chosen young casts for which the Opera de Lausanne has become known. At the heart of the production lay Gilles Cachemaille's Don Alfonso, his stage debut in the role. In common with his Golaud and Orpheus in previous seasons, he showed an uncanny gift for balancing musical and dramatic values - spitting out 'In cor di femmina' with a contempt that belied his vocal control. What an asset he is - always singing with punch, style and natural command, but never upstaging his partners. Despite a fine rendering of his reinstated Act two aria, Richard Croft was a prosaic Ferrando. Manfred Hemm's Guglielmo was nowhere near as effective as his Papageno: the voice sounded poorly supported, the top under strain. The girls were well-contrasted - Martine Mahe's pulsating, trouser-suited Dorabella next to Amanda Roocroft's pretty-doll Fiordiligi. Both came away with vocal honours, Miss Roocroft's luscious chest register underpinning a radiant 'Pieta'. Jeannette Fischer was the spunky Despina. Helmut Polixa's staging, designed by Carlo Tommasi, made a virtue of the bare wooden walls of the stage, confining decor to a few stylised backdrops, a transparent red curtain and a hydraulic platform. The setting demanded, and received, the clearest animation of recitative, with taut human responses from the cast. The curtain opened on a balloons-and-beaujolais student party of the present day. Alfonso was a handsome postgraduate, Despina the college skivvy. Both knew a thing or two about life and love, unlike the four gullible victims of the wager. Polixa played up the comedy and cynicism at every turn, with ne'er a hint of serious emotion. At the end of the evening, the boys retired to one side, the girls to the other - chastened but none-too-hurt by their lesson at the school for lovers. Jesus Lopez-Cobos, conducting the Lausanne Chamber Orchestra, chose sensible speeds, and phrased the recitatives flexibly. The Grange sublime, as the Theatre du Jorat is known, had once again worked its charms, inspiring all who work there. Renee Auphan, director of the Opera de Lausanne since 1984, has been appointed to succeed Hugues Gall as director of Geneva's Grand Theatre in 1995.</p>

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Summiteers harden rhetoric over Bosnia - But accord a far cry from earlier warnings of military intervention PRESIDENT Bill Clinton was not alone in coming to Tokyo in the hope that not too much attention should be paid to the precise wording of summit communiques. But in the middle of yesterday morning there appears to have been a collective realisation by the G7 leaders that there could be no excuse for not finding the right words to use on Bosnia. This was why the summit adjourned temporarily while the foreign ministers were sent off to strengthen the language of the political declaration. If what was finally agreed was a far cry from the stern warnings of military intervention issued in Munich a year ago - and totally ignored ever since - several leaders were able to claim credit for the fact that the G7 did not completely walk away from the Bosnian tragedy. The process started over dinner on Wednesday evening with, according to US and other officials, Mr Clinton's strong intervention and the observation of Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany that Serbian and, intriguingly, Croatian behaviour was 'beyond the pale'. It was continued at a late-night session with Mr John Major at the president's hotel during which the British prime minister echoed Mr Kohl's choice of words, which was duly incorporated into the communique. Yesterday, virtually all the other heads of government chipped in with their own supportive observations. As David Gergen, Mr Clinton's counsellor, put it yesterday, the objective was to strengthen the language 'without raising false expectations'. Another senior US official, speaking off the record and thus perhaps more frankly, agreed that the people of Sarajevo would not necessarily be sleeping easier in their beds as a result of the words of the communique. But, from the point of view of the US and all other participants, the insertion of the sentence 'stronger measures are not excluded' is an implicit reference to Mr Clinton's belief that the arms embargo against Bosnia should be ended. Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, who has argued vigorously against lifting the embargo because it would merely 'level the killing fields', concurred. He even used, by his standards, exotic language in a briefing. The Serbs and Croats, he said, 'are still in the excitement of killing each other and gaining hills and villages. They think they have to hate their neighbours from here to kingdom come.' But he allowed for the possibility that the relief role now being played by British and other peacekeeping troops might become untenable, in which case nothing could indeed be excluded. But another senior UK official speaking after the foreign secretary had left for China, appeared to distance himself from Mr Hurd's 'stand alone' comments. An equally significant concession may have come from Germany, sponsor of the European Community's recognition of Croatia last year. For the first time, the political declaration raised the threat of sanctions against Croatia if, along with Serbia, it continued to push for the dismemberment by force of Bosnia. This meant, as US officials were not slow to point out, that Europe's most influential leaders had committed themselves to withdrawing whatever preferential arrangements Croatia now enjoys with the EC. None of this, nor the other last-minute insertion vowing support, including US air cover, for UN resolution 836 covering 'safe areas', amounts to a girding of the international loins to stop Serbian and Croatian aggrandisement. But as Mr Perrin Beatty, Canadian minister for external affairs, put it, the Serbs and Croats should now be under no illusion that they can go about carving up Bosnia as they wish and find that in six months' time the international community will accept the outcome and help them rebuild shattered communities. Or, in the words of a senior US official, the declaration 'makes clear that there is no chance of the international recognition of whatever entity emerges in Bosnia unless it is agreed to by all the parties.' Again from the US perspective, the political declaration's section on the Middle East also breaks new summit ground. Unlike two years ago, the call for the ending of the Arab boycott of Israel was issued without conditions referring to Israeli settlements policy in the occupied territories. This may help ease some of the latest tensions between Washington and Jerusalem over the course of the Middle East peace negotiations. More significant was the sentence on Iran's behaviour. A senior official, noting the extensive commercial relations between several G7 countries and Iran, including the sale of dual-use technology, described the regime in Tehran as 'an international outlaw' and 'a serious threat to stability' because of its support of terrorism and its determination to disrupt the Middle East peace process. He then put US concerns very bluntly: 'We don't want to look back in five years' time and find we have made the same mistake with Iran that we made with Iraq.' He noted that previous summits had refused to single out Iran and Libya for specific criticism because of the risk to trade with both countries. All the officials representing their national leaders have claimed credit for toughening the language of the political declaration, while Mr Clinton's men generously allowed that the process was 'collegial'. In reality, most of it was drafted months ago, with the exception of the Bosnian segment, left until last because of the fluidity of the situation there. But Mr Clinton's summit agenda seems at least as well served as anybody's, and probably better than most. On Bosnia, the Middle East, nuclear non-proliferation and aid to Russia, all areas of prime US concern but not ones on which there has always been unanimity among the G7, the president has received endorsements appropriate for his status as still the most powerful individual member of the club. They come only in the form of words, many of which have proved empty enough in the past, never more than last year in Munich. But, as the ubiquitous Mr Gergen put it, they were at least the result, for once, of 'productive and free-wheeling' exchanges between the summitteers. And hopes that future summits will be more informal and focused, like this one, have some chance of being realised.</p>

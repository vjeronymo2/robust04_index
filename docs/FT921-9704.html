			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Technology: Early viewing of the finished work All the best innovations in modern manufacturing can be found in the UK somewhere. The trouble is that they are not happening as frequently as they should be. Round the corner from Gloucester's renovated wharfside is mainland Britain's only rapid prototyping bureau. Formation Engineering Services will convert an engineering drawing or 2D Cad (computer-aided design) file into a 3D file and then, through stereolithography, produce a 'hard copy' in hours or days that would have taken weeks or even months by conventional methods such as pattern-making. Last week some 280 engineers from British manufacturing in the south-west and the Midlands had a chance to view the process. The visit was part of a two-day workshop on rapid prototyping, sponsored by the Department of Trade and Industry South-West, supported by the Institute of Directors and organised by the Computer Graphics Suppliers Management Association. For Doug Ponsford of DTI South-West, the aim of the Cheltenham workshop was simple. 'What I want to do is wake people up, by saying 'Here it is, please have a look.' This could have more effect on British industry than anything I have seen in a decade.' Rapid prototyping is important because, like Cad, it promises to be a key element in the spread of concurrent or simultaneous engineering, complementing the interdisciplinary teamwork method of accelerating product development times. Design engineers are used to working in 2D but their customers, in-house or otherwise, usually need to see and hold the real thing to check whether it fits their requirements. If it's wrong, a revised version can be produced through rapid prototyping with little time wasted, and potential tooling expenses saved. There are about 300 rapid prototyping machines in the world, all but a handful produced by 3D Systems of California. Two other less established systems were also represented at Cheltenham: the Solider 'instant slice curing' process from Israeli-US manufacturer Cubital, and laminated object manufacturing from Helisys of California. The systems share one basic principle - conversion of a 3D Cad file into an STL (stereolithographic) file which reduces the design to thousands of layers. There are just six or seven of 3D's machines in the UK, but Ponsford says there is no reason for Britain's manufacturers to hold back just because the rapid prototyping industry is in its infancy. 'If big companies are scared, they can get their feet wet by using a bureau.' The systems cost from about Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 400,000, and prices are falling. Even so, the expense will be too much for some of the smaller companies which attended the workshop. Keith Howell, product manager at Umak, the Birmingham-based agency for Helisys, said 90 per cent of inquiries at the workshop concerned bureau use - a UK bureau for Helisys will be open by the end of May. One of the handful of UK companies with in-house rapid prototyping is Rover. Graham Tromans, principal engineer for stereolithography, recalls turning an STL file of a thermostat housing into a prototype within a day - after leaving the 3D machine on overnight. Conventional prototype development had already taken eight months, with a further nine weeks forecast. Big companies, clearly, can get their money back fast. Roger Holden, applications engineer at Sherbrook Automotive, Lichfield-based agents for Cubital, says its machine will pay for itself in a year if 500 prototypes are produced. The three producers argue fiercely about the relative merits of their systems. None is perfect, and each has its strong points. But at least they all agreed that, simply by explaining what rapid prototyping is, the workshop worked.</p>

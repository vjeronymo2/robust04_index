			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Ushers aims to double pubs after cash raising Ushers, the Wiltshire-based brewer, aims to double the size of its pub chain after coming to market later this month. The group, which publishes its pathfinder document tomorrow wants to clear existing debt before expanding its estate of more than 460 pubs. At present its financing includes Pounds 35m of senior debt and an interest rate 'collar' which cost Pounds 1.6m this year. Further borrowings are subject to the agreement of a syndicate of 11 banks. The cash raising is expected to value the company at Pounds 100m. Ushers, whose Trowbridge brewery dates back to 1824, was formed in 1991 after a Pounds 71m management buy-in from Courage. Mr Roger North, chief executive, said the company would benefit from the large breweries selling pubs in the south-west, where it is the largest regional brewery. 'We are looking for the small town and village community pub, rather than the town centre boozer,' he said. The group has already paid off Pounds 15m of debt in its three years of existence and invested another Pounds 13m in modernising its pubs and brewery. The brewery's first results are also due tomorrow. Analysts forecast operating profits of Pounds 14.9m on turnover of Pounds 54m, compared to last year's profits of Pounds 13.4m on Pounds 48.8m turnover.</p>

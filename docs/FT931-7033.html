			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Letter: The going can get tough when payment of a debt is sought Sir, The battle between the large customer and the small supplier is rougher than Michael Cassell ('The dangers that lurk in delay', February 23) makes out. A couple of weeks ago a colleague and I went to a large customer which owed what was to us a large sum - the debt going back five months. All telephone attempts to get the debt had received the now usual response of 'the cheque is in the post' and similar excuses. We waited patiently for more than three hours until we eventually got to meet the company's finance director. His view was stark - his company had not produced the necessary internal documentation to allow him to pay us. So he was not going to pay us. Bad luck, goodbye] We persisted as courteously as the circumstances permitted, only for me to end up in hospital with damage to my spine resulting from the finance director losing his cool and tipping me on to the floor. And the company still hasn't paid up. Robert Jenkins, managing director, Burnaston Crane and Plant Hire, Worksop Road, Blyth, Worksop, Notts S81 8DX</p>

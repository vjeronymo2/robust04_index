			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Qullu Muherremov] </F>   [Text] Despite the conflicting media reports from Bishkek,  it is clear that the CIS interparliamentary assembly insists at  all costs on the recognition of Daghlyk-Karabakh  [Nagorno-Karabakh] as one of the independent sides in this  conflict. The elevation of the Karabakh Armenians, who at  present have no status at all, to prominence at the Bishkek  meeting shows that the talks are being basically conducted to  put pressure on Azerbaijan. The course of the developments also  shows that Armenia, which avoids heeding the CSCE mission, is  trying to solve the problem speedily and within the CIS  framework at every opportunity and at all costs.    The sudden recognition of Daghlyk-Karabakh as a conflicting  side by Azerbaijan might place the Republic, which has been  waging a war with Armenia for years now, in an inextricable  position. Such a step would not only tie Azerbaijan's hands  militarily and politically, but might also impede the proper  understanding of the nature of this war at the international  level. This is because at the initial stages of the problem,  when talks were being held to put an end to war under the CSCE  mandate, Armenia and Azerbaijan took part as sides in the  conflict and representatives of the Armenian and Azerbaijani  communities of Daghlyk-Karabakh participated as observers.    Why can Azerbaijan not recognize Daghlyk-Karabakh as an  independent side in the conflict? Because such recognition  would in practice mean the recognition of the existence of the  Daghlyk-Karabakh army, regardless of Karabakh's future status.  This could have grave consequences in the future. Also, such  recognition on the eve of the Minsk conference would mean  prematurely determining various parameters for the status of  Daghlyk-Karabakh. And this will eventually entail further  concessions. Most important, the recognition of  Daghlyk-Karabakh as an independent side in the conflict aims at  providing insurance for the aggressor Armenia. Naturally, the  CIS states, primarily Russia, are only trying to shield Armenia.  And the Azerbaijani side's resistance to that approach at  Bishkek would most likely have a bearing on the situation on the  front lines in the near future. However, regardless of the fact  that the aggressor is not being identified at the present time,  the changing atmosphere in the world will probably not allow the  aggressor to remain in the shadows indefinitely.</p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / 'Thank God - thank you all' A CLEARLY relieved Mr Thomas Ward left the Old Bailey yesterday, acquitted of the single charge of stealing Pounds 5.2m from Guinness, John Mason writes. 'Thank God - thank you all,' he had said from the dock to the jury after it had delivered its verdict. Mr Ward remained unrepentant about his role in the infamous takeover of Distillers. He told reporters: 'Not one Guinness shareholder and not one Guinness director came here and suggested I did anything wrong. 'I regret what has happened, but I don't regret the contributions I made to Guinness. I regret the fact that a number of good people have been hurt by a totally misplaced prosecution.' He then signalled his intention to return to practise as a commercial attorney in Washington DC. 'I continue to practise law. It has not always been easy, but I have had great clients throughout this. I will continue to win cases for them and solve their problems. 'I will continue to consult with international businesses in creating more good companies for shareholders - which we did in this case and we were very proud of.' His solicitor, Mr Harvey Rands of Memery Crystal, criticised the prosecution for alleging criminality instead of non-compliance with regulatory requirements and business standards. 'Mr Ward was never an appropriate candidate for regulatory censure - as a foreigner he was entitled to and did rely on the local professionals and practitioners,' he said. 'Who were the victims? Not Guinness or Distillers shareholders, whose fortunes have quadrupled at the highest point on the market. 'It seems that Britain's capacity to regulate and understand its own marketplace has taken the biggest knock, followed closely behind by the public purse, that has carried the cost of a misconceived prosecution.'</p>

In 1988 he returned to Asia, first to Taiwan and then Hong Kong. Hsu likens his task with Hanson to that of a corporate finance practitioner with a difference. 'The merchant bank will spot the undervalued assets, package them and sell them on the market. But at the end of the day, when you unwrap the package the contents are the same. We have the techniques, the money and the expertise to take a company from being grade E to grade B or A' This signals a change in the Hanson approach, at least in East Asia.

And he adds: 'Now we do, especially in this part of the world.'</p>

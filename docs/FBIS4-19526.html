			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by Werner </F> Mueck in Karlsruhe on 19 April -- recorded]    [Text] [Mueck] Judges now have to decide whether recent  German Bundeswehr operations within the UN and NATO framework  were okay. Does this not also mean that they decide on the role  Germany will play in the future in the family of peoples, in the  United Nations, in NATO?    [Kinkel] Of course, they decide on that. Since we failed to  reach a political agreement in the Bundestag on amending the  Basic Law, now, unfortunately, the Federal Constitutional Court  has to decide. At the end of the day, I am glad about it,  because we will finally get a decision.    [Mueck] If the Court comes up with a narrow interpretation,  Germany's desire to get a seat on the UN Security Council would  then be impossible to fulfill.    [Kinkel] Well, I assume and hope that the decision will be  positive, and that it will be a decision that will serve our  foreign and security policy. As far as the Security Council  seat is concerned, I believe that we could only get the seat  after we had become fully capable of taking action, that is to  say after we become able to participate in out-of-area missions.    [Mueck] One will then hardly be able to decide on actions in  which one is unable to participate oneself.    [Kinkel] That is right, that is what I meant before.    [Mueck] You have said that you hope that the judges will not  produce an interpretation that is too narrow. Yet, would it not  be better if they did, because then the pressure might be  greater to amend the Basic Law?    [Kinkel] We cannot have a Basic Law amendment at the moment,  because the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] will not  support it, but is obstructing the process. We need a  two-thirds majority, which is why I do not see any chance in the  foreseeable future. Yet, we need a solution fast. This is why  I am hoping for the decision of the Federal Constitutional  Court. In the election campaign I will of course clearly and  outspokenly refute the SPD when it says that there is no  difference to the coalition government in terms of foreign  policy. This issue shows the most decisive difference, and it  has to be emphasized; besides, the SPD is finding it difficult  to make others believe what it says here; just look at  Scharping's visit to Washington.    [Mueck] You yourself said recently that, in the future,  Germany would more often say yes than no. Is there not the  danger again -- and the German defense minister warned against  it today -- of Germany embarking on a course leading back to  isolation, new nationalism, special status?    [Kinkel] No, no. First of all, one has to say that the  Bundeswehr has participated in all kinds of missions. Three  such missions are to be the topic of this court procedure:  Somalia, AWACS, and the Adriatic. Besides, we participate in  the air drops and in the relief flights to Sarajevo; we are  observers for the CSCE, and are engaged in many other spheres.  One cannot say that the Bundeswehr does not do anything. In  the humanitarian sphere, particularly as far as Yugoslavia is  concerned, we are leading -- thank God. No, I do not see any  danger of isolation. Our practice of being cautious -- I have  said that in my statement today. Of course, we will have to say  no much more often than yes in the future. This will not  change. After all, I pointed out the high number of missions  the United Nations are requesting today. We will not be able to  participate in all of them -- for sheer problems of capacity.    [Mueck] When you speak of this practice of being cautious,  which one can very well understand as a neighbor -- I am  Austrian -- could one not say that it is a kind of fig leaf, an  excuse for dodging all other things, and to send the alliance,  the others, into the fire?    [Kinkel] I beg your pardon? First of all, we want the seat  on the Security Council and, second, the Basic Law amendment so  that we become capable of taking action, do not have to avoid  responsibility, but that we commit ourselves in the community of  peoples and in the United Nations in a way that is appropriate  for a country of 80 million inhabitants.    [Mueck] Yesterday, the German federal president, with a view  to Bosnia, very explicitly said that for him the Bosnian Serbs  are nothing but ordinary war criminals. If one hears that  abroad, then one wonders why people in Germany are now seriously  discussing whether one can participate in AWACS missions.    [Kinkel] You cannot say it that way. Firstly, politically,  we all wanted to participate in the AWACS missions. Only, the  Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] Bundestag group voiced  its legal reservations regarding the legal basis: Paragraph 87  or 24 of the Basic Law. Second, we really did not shirk our  responsibility in this connection -- but quite the contrary. In  the future we want to help avoid such things. In Yugoslavia, we  do have a special problem though as a result of historical  events. So, even if the Basic Law had been amended and if we  were able to participate in a mission under our constitution,  there would probably -- that is my very personal opinion -- not  be a majority in the German Bundestag for the participation of  German soldiers in a mission in the former Yugoslavia.    [Mueck] Do you not have the impression that the scenario  that is currently developing in the Balkans, including the  stronger involvement of the superpowers, such as Russia, might  not once more become a question of security for Germany, and  that your defense policy will be challenged?    [Kinkel] No, not at all. I think that the Russians have  acted most constructively so far. Without their possibilities  of influencing the Serbian side, Sarajevo, Tuzla would not have  been possible. Besides, you certainly heard what Kozyrev and  Churkin said yesterday in connection with the behavior of the  Serbs. The Serbs are the aggressors and they can obviously not  be stopped and impressed by anything. As far as enforcing their  policy is concerned they are obviously absolutely unscrupulous.  They have to be told so, and we still need the Russians who  have to bring their influence to bear, in the same way in which  we need the U.S. influence on the Muslim side.    [Mueck] It cannot be ruled out that, maybe even today,  Clinton will make higher demands on the Europeans and say: You  have to do more than you did in the past. What will you tell  him then?    [Kinkel] I will tell him that, so far, the Europeans have  done much more than the Americans. I am happy about their  commitment. The U.S. commitment is an air commitment, and an  incredible political commitment, which we have always requested.  It has helped bring about Muslim-Croatian rapprochement -- and  we still have to get the Serbs into the boat. Yet, the ground  forces -- this is where it is getting dangerous -- have been  provided by the Europeans: 11,000 plus 13,000 men, which makes  24,000 men.    [Mueck] But no Germans.    [Kinkel] No Germans. This is what is worrying us greatly,  and what is sometimes making life so hard for me as foreign  minister in meetings with my colleagues and partners.</p>

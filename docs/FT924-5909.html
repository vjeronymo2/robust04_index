			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Setback for US mill purchase TOKYO Kyoei Steel, a medium-sized Osaka steelmaker affiliated to Sumitomo Metal Industries, has suffered a setback in its plans to buy Florida Steel, a US minimill, after only 54 per cent of bondholders responded to Florida Steel's buy-back offer. Kyoei's Dollars 343m offer for Florida Steel was contingent on 90 per cent of the debentures being tendered. Kyoei has halted its efforts to raise financing until a sufficient number of debentures are tendered. Either party can terminate the deal if it is not closed by December 15. Florida Steel has extended its cash tender offer of Dollars 125m, the principal amount of the outstanding 14.5 per cent subordinated debentures due 2000, to mid-December. Kyoei's attempts to acquire FLS, parent of Florida Steel, has been rife with problems. Several lawsuits were filed by preferred shareholders who were riled by an offer of only Dollars 24 a share in cash for stock with liquidation value of Dollars 53 a share. Subordinated debt holders were widely expected to accept the offer of par plus accrued. The Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an 'informal inquiry' into some of Florida Steel's financial statements. Florida Steel's problems stem from a Dollars 377.8m leveraged buy-out in 1988. The company has been unable to service its Dollars 289.9m of debt and defaulted on its bank loans and subordinated debt. Kyoei has offered to assume all of Florida Steel's debt. Common shareholders will receive Dollars 30.072 a share.</p>

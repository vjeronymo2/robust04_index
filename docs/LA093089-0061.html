			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS;  </P> <P> 'NIGHT WALK': TRITE PLOT, LANGUID PERFORMANCES  </P> <P> "Night Walk," a TV movie airing Sunday at 9 p.m. (Channels 2 and 8), offers one  of the dustiest plots in the book -- police lieutenant falls for gorgeous  witness he's protecting from hit men -- and doesn't add the slightest wrinkle  to its underdeveloped formula. Stylistically, though, it's far enough off the  usual TV track to be slightly above average for the cathode-ray cop genre.  </P> <P> A half-hour into it, it's not quite clear whether lead player Robert Urich is  turning in a really uninvolved, lethargic, lackluster performance or just  fitting in with the film's unusually relaxed naturalist style. At the end of  two hours, we still aren't sure. You might want to give him the benefit of the  doubt, though, given that writers and executive producers Renee and Harry  Longstreet have concocted a script full of low-key interchanges in which  characters have trouble connecting, and Jerrold Freedman has directed it in a  slow-moving, pause-filled fashion more befitting the European cinema than  slam-bang prime time.  </P> <P> More care has been given to the often surprisingly witty incidental dialogue  (Urich, coming home and finding his kids watching soft-core porn, mocks them:  "Please, Dad, can we have cable? We don't wanna miss all the sports on ESPN,  and the Disney Channel . . . .") than on fleshing out the undernourished  thriller elements.  </P> <P> Lesley-Anne Down is the love interest who, while on leave from her nasty  attorney of a husband, witnesses a murder that seems to have left behind no  clues -- which doesn't stop two triggermen from trying to gun down her and any  badge who tries to protect her. Anyone who can't figure out where this is  headed at least 10 or 20 minutes before it's over probably needs a physical,  yet the oddly real-time, real-life tone of the film puts an intriguing spin on  its trip toward inevitability.

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Airtours deal A large share trading loss was taken yesterday by Airtours, the UK's third biggest tour group, as it sold its 8.2 per cent stake in Owners Abroad. Airtours built up the holding over the past month during its Pounds 290m hostile bid for its larger rival, a move which ended in defeat two weeks ago. Airtours is thought to have paid between 144p and 150p a share for the 12.7m stake. Yesterday, the Seaq ticker showed 20m shares going through the market at around 117p, indicating a substantial loss to Airtours and suggesting some of the stake may still be waiting to be placed. Smith New Court was said to have bought the shares and placed them with institutions. No one was available for comment at either the securities house or Airtours. Airtours firmed a penny to 305p, with Owners steady at 124p. News that advance holiday sales are up at Rank Organisation lifted the shares, although analysts pointed out that the rise still did not compensate the decline suffered last year. The shares rose 14 to 663p. Whisky stocks largely survived appalling export figures and poor results from two of the smaller companies. The export figures showed a 34 per cent fall in value terms during January and February. Burn Stewart was not immune from its disappointing figures, the shares coming off 7 to 128p. But Guinness, helped again by a NatWest Securities note, gained 3 to 486p. ICI fell 15 to 1169p after news that it will demerge on June 1 drew attention to its Pounds 1.3bn cash call. The lack of evidence of chemicals picking up in Europe, and drug stocks remaining under pressure, also contributed towards the weakness. News of a co-promotional agreement with Amersham International helped neither company and Amersham fell 12 to 726p. Mr James Culverwell of Hoare Govett said: 'The market has reacted ungratefully to unexpected good news which makes enormous strategic sense for Amersham.' But the company had not suffered with the rest of the sector and profit-takers were responsible for bringing the price down. Elsewhere, the sector was slightly more buoyant, res-ponding to a better performance in New York on Monday night. Glaxo rose 12 to 588p, and SmithKline Beecham was firm ahead of a meeting at the group's key Philadelphia plant last night. The meeting is expected to contain encouraging reports on research and development and the 'A' shares improved 4 1/2 to 397p and the Units 4 to 348p. Wellcome continued to languish, ending 3 lower at 739p. The two banks with the heaviest exposure to Hong Kong, HSBC and Standard Chartered, were strongly supported as the market reacted to the recent easing of tension between the Chinese and UK governments. HSBC moved forward 12 to 616p and Standard Chartered, the bank now most heavily geared to Hong Kong since HSBC's absorption of Midland, appreciated 7 to 708p. Insurance shares were largely unaffected by news that the recent blizzards which hit the east coast of the United States had resulted in damage claims of Dollars 1.625bn (Pounds 1.14bn), according to the highly respected American Insurance Group. Motors and business services group Inchcape fell 12 to 585p after announcing a Pounds 125m convertible bond issue. Investors sold stock to take up the issue. Taylor Woodrow moved up 4 to 88p, with the market relieved about the level of provisions and happy to focus on the group's recovery prospects. Chemicals group Croda International climbed 17 to 258p after announcing a profits surge to Pounds 29.8m from a previous Pounds 21.3m and delivering an optimistic statement. Jeyes Group, the manufacturer of cleaning products, rose 8 to 414p after revealing a 31 per cent jump in profits for 1992. Food retailing issues came under pressure as Smith New Court became the latest house to turn negative. Smith moved to a short-term underweight stance. Among the leading stocks, Argyll Group declined 7 to 338p, Iceland Frozen Foods 10 to 722p and Kwik Save 15 to 771p. Hillsdown was said to have benefited from a positive note from SG Warburg following a presentation. Two agency crosses at 185p pulled Sims Food back to close 3 off at 189p. News and financial information group Reuters shed 27 to 1328p as a block of shares was sold in a thin market. Trading in Thames Television was suspended at 221p after a report of talks between its parent, Thorn EMI, and media conglomerate Pearson. Pearson, which later confirmed that it was in talks, added 6 at 410p. Thorn eased 2 to 888p. Reports that a consortium led by Carlton Communications will make a smaller equity injection than previously thought for its takeover of Independent Television News today helped Carlton shares rise 9 to 763p. Shares in construction equipment company BM Group continued to slide and closed 6 weaker at 36p, on fears that the company is to issue a profits warning on its full-year results when it reports interim figures today. News that China is to buy 12 Airbus aircraft, with a possibility of a further nine lifted British Aerospace shares 8 to 273p. BAe has a 20 per cent stake in the Airbus consortium and builds the wings on the airbus aircraft. Rolls-Royce improved 3 to 124p. Smiths Industries shed a penny to 323p, with a stock overhang continuing to depress the shares. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew was said to be leading the day's selling, although several other brokers were also reported to be carrying large lines of stock. Weir Group relinquished 16 to 599p, with brokers remaining cautious about the company's first-half trading performance. Turnover in FKI rose to 9.4m after a cross of 4m. The shares closed unchanged at 120p.</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Regulator calls for rules on short selling of shares New rules are needed to govern short selling of a company's shares just before a secondary offering of those shares hits the market, London's chief regulator said yesterday. Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, was outlining the preliminary conclusions from a review of wider market issues which the regulatory body launched in February. Short selling is the practice of selling shares one does not already own in the hope of buying them more cheaply by the time it is necessary to deliver them to the buyer. A secondary offering of the same company's shares could, in theory, allow an investor the opportunity to buy those shares more cheaply than he or she had sold them and use the cheaper shares to cover a short position. Mr Large ruled out significant changes to rules which allow those who commit their own capital to provide liquidity for share dealing to hide some of their deals from competitors for a period. Speaking at a Financial Times conference on international equity markets, he said: 'Few, I think, question the need for requiring less than full transparency where people oblige themselves to put up their capital to deliver liquidity.' But he suggested that in some instances rules allowed dealing to be opaque for much longer than was necessary. Mr Large said SIB had received considerable comment from market participants on the issue of short selling. 'From a regulatory viewpoint, the priority seems to me to be the search for better procedures to cover short selling during secondary offering periods,' he said. He noted that the London Stock Exchange had been examining the issue and said that solutions were 'a matter of urgency'. The question of short selling and outright selling before a secondary offering came to a head last summer before the government's sale of its final stake in British Telecommunications. SG Warburg, the merchant bank advising the government, asked the Stock Exchange to adopt rules for trading in BT shares designed to make short sales or outright sales difficult.</p>

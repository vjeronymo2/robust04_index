			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FAIRWAY TO SETTLE SUIT ON ALLEGED MISREPRESENTATIONS  </P> <P> The Fairway group of automotive dealerships has agreed to pay about $80,000 to  settle a civil lawsuit that alleged it fail to tell car buyers that they were  getting former rental vehicles, the Orange County district attorney's office  said Monday.  </P> <P> Fairway Lincoln Mercury, Toyota, Volkswagen and Ford were accused of violating  a state Department of Motor Vehicles regulation by failing to tell more than 60  customers that they were buying used rental cars.  </P> <P> State authorities also claimed that some salespeople had told used-car buyers  that they were purchasing former company cars or demonstration models when they  were really former rentals.  </P> <P> "Salespeople were picking things out of the air to tell people," Deputy Dist.  Atty. William J. Feccia said.  </P> <P> Although the company agreed to pay a civil penalty of $50,000, it did not admit  to any wrongdoing. The Fairway group agreed to refund 5% of the purchase price  of each car, or a total rebate of about $30,000.  </P> <P> Fairway defense attorney John D. McGuire said that the dealerships were not  aware of the cars' histories and that a prior DMV hearing failed to prove that  they were knowledgeable.  </P> <P> "We are settling this case because it makes economic sense," McGuire said. "The  restitution to the customer is a gesture of goodwill."  </P> <P> Fairway Lincoln Mercury -- now known as Fullerton Lincoln Mercury -- and  Fairway Toyota are both in Fullerton. Fairway Ford is based in Placentia and  Fairway Volkswagen is no longer in business.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Famous Amos Moves Headquarters: Famous Amos Chocolate Chip Cookie Corp. has  moved a "lean corporate staff" of fewer than 20 employees to San Francisco from  Torrance, according to Keith R. Lively, chief operating officer. Famous Amos, a  pioneer in the premium cookie business, will maintain a two-person regional  office in Southern California and will continue to produce its cookies in the  area on a contract basis. Last year, Famous Amos was bought by the Shansby  Group, a San Francisco-based buyout fund. Lively said nearly all the corporate  officers were from the San Francisco area and "wanted to return."  </P></p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / How To Spend It: Designer grunge - Lucia van der Post finds just what you need / a shabby sofa Shabby has long been chic but seldom more than now. As fashion designers scour flea markets for inspiration, as Rei Kawakubo - the name behind the Comme Des Garcons fashion label - goes to infinite (and expensive) lengths to imbue even the newest of her creations with an air of faded antiquity, as dressing down is very much the order of the day, so, too, is dressing down the house. Grunge has hit the drawing-room. For those who find their own grunge hard to improvise a company called Shabby Chic has some of the answers. Shabby Chic sells . . . ready-shabbied sofas. Those of you whose sofas have over the years developed a shabby chic of their very own - dogs, children, buffet suppers - need read no further. Those of you who have (sob) sofas that still look shamingly new might like to hurry down to Shabby Chic. I would not want to mislead you into thinking that just because chic has turned shabby it has also turned cheap - dear me, no. Shabby Chic sofas and chairs, homing in as they do on generosity of size, cost much the same as new ones. What they offer instead is that air of having been bashed about, lounged on, snoozed in by generations of well-upholstered ancestors - with a Shabby Chic sofa, nobody would ever accuse you of being one of those upstarts who had had to buy their own furniture. Shabby Chic's sofas all come covered in loose-covers of plain Jacquard cotton specially dyed to look faded. They are also pre-shrunk and pre-washed so they can just be tossed into a washing machine when the shabbiness finally deteriorates into squalor. Shapes are plain, simple and traditional. Alicia, which is photographed here, is the largest, coming in two, three and four-seater sizes and costing Pounds 1295, Pounds 1394 and Pounds 1495, respectively, for the beech-framed, foam-filled version, including the scatter cushions. When sprung with horse-hair and made entirely from natural materials, the name changes mysteriously to Clarissa and the price rises spectacularly to Pounds 2,530 without scatter cushions. You might have thought, that the British would do shabby better than anybody else. I have to tell you that when it comes to proper shabby chic this first British version is beaten into a cocked-hat by its ultra-chic transatlantic counterpart (to which it is not officially related). When I stumbled on Shabby Chic in Manhattan's cool down-town SoHo last year at first I thought it was a second-hand shop. Seriously faded floral covers, chairs with authentically lumpy seats and bunches of dried flowers that looked as if they had withered on the stem right there were were spread about a suitably tatty interior. Just as I settled in for a good old rummage among the bric-a-brac it came to me in a flash - it was all new. Old 1980s-style glitz and glamour may have gone - but the demand for immediate gratification, it seems, has not. Even shabby can be provided instantaneously - at a price. Shabby Chic is at The Plaza, 535 Kings Road, London SW10 OTZ, tel: 071-352-7768. It will deliver all over the country. A catalogue should be ready in three to four weeks.</p>

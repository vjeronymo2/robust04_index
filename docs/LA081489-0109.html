KOREA TO MELT DOWN $13 MILLION WORTH OF UNSOLD '88 OLYMPIC COINS  </P> <P> South Korea plans to melt down $13 million worth of unsold coins commemorating  the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, a newspaper reported today.  </P> <P> The Kyonghyang Daily News, a Seoul newspaper, said the Bank of Korea was  arranging with a Korean firm to melt down about 2.5 million unsold Olympic  coins whose value was estimated at $13 million. The newspaper accused Olympic  organizers and bank officials of poor promotion and a half-hearted attitude in  selling the coins.  </P> <P> Olympic coins were first issued in February, 1987, and the central bank had to  re-issue the coins four times last year to meet a growing demand. But the  demand fell off sharply in the months after last year's summer games.  </P></p>

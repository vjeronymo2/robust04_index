			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sarah Womack, PRESS ASSOCIATION correspondent] </F>   [Text] Britain has stopped targeting Russia with nuclear  missiles, the Ministry of Defense announced today. The move is  in line with an agreement signed by the prime minister and  President Boris Yeltsin in the Kremlin last February 15 which  involved a thousand Russian missiles and about 160 British  weapons. The United States and Russia also stopped targeting  each this week.    An MoD [Ministry of Defense] spokesman said the computers  which guide British weapons "no longer routinely hold targeting  information." The weapons were detargeted on May 30. Targets  which were "held in readiness for insertion into the missiles"  will be points in the open ocean, he added.    The MoD described the move as a "positive demonstration of  the developing cooperative relationship between the United  Kingdom and the Russian Federation."</p>

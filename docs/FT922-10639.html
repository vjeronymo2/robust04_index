			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: Property write-down cuts Hopkinsons to Pounds 5.16m PRE-TAX profit declined 23 per cent at Hopkinsons Group in the year to January 31. After an exceptional item of Pounds 900,000 relating to write-down on investment property the pre-tax figure came out at Pounds 5.16m (Pounds 6.72m). Sales at the industrial valve and hydraulic equipment maker rose 24 per cent from Pounds 47.8m to Pounds 59.4m, including Pounds 22m from the Carbo industrial abrasives business acquired in October for about Pounds 31m. The final dividend is maintained at 2.5p, for an unchanged total of 3.7p on earnings of 4.57p (8.01p). Mr Tom Weatherby, in his first report as chairman, said shareholders' funds rose during the year to Pounds 30.3m, after writing off goodwill of Pounds 9.2m on the acquisition. Net borrowings stood at Pounds 9.2m. Lower orders, mainly on exports, together with the disruption of the reorganisation, had affected performance at Bryan Donkin, Mr Weatherby said. Turnover in the drinks dispenser business fell significantly and the continued improved profits at England-Worthside offset a disappointing performance at Thermal Refrigeration. The abrasives business continued to be affected by the recession. Action had been taken to cut costs.</p>

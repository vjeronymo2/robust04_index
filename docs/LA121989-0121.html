			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES: IMPERIAL CORP. OF AMERICA REPORTS CAPITAL DEFICIENCY  </P> <P> Imperial Corp. of America said Monday that additional losses sustained by its  already battered junk bond portfolio has resulted in a negative tangible net  worth for the troubled San Diego-based parent company of Imperial Savings of  California.  </P> <P> Federal regulators have been fully informed of ICA's "capital deficiency" but  there are no indications as yet that regulators may seize control of the  S&amp;L, ICA spokesman Bruce Dunn said.  </P> <P> Tangible net worth, or core capital less good will, is one of three capital  adequacy tests applied to thrifts in the wake of last summer's S&amp;L rescue  bill.  </P> <P> According to the minimum standards in the bill, ICA's core capital is supposed  to equal at least $150 million, or 1.5% of its $10.5 billion assets.  </P> <P> Dunn declined to specify what ICA's negative tangible net worth now totals.  </P> <P> ICA's junk bonds declined in value by $51.7 million from Sept. 30 to Nov. 30.  </P> <P> During its third quarter ended Sept. 30, ICA was forced to write down the value  of its junk bonds by a total of $147.6 million to adhere to new regulatory  standards.  </P> <P> The value of the portfolio is now about $860 million, down from $1.2 billion on  June 30, Dunn said.  </P> <P> "Our earnings and capital ratios are captive to the junk bond market right  now," Dunn said.  </P> <P> ICA expects to realize a gain of up to $60 million by the impending sale of its  credit card operation to Wells Fargo, but Dunn could not say whether the gain  would push ICA's tangible net worth back to positive.  </P> <P> Imperial Corp. of America also announced that it has settled five shareholder  lawsuits that alleged that ICA misrepresented and made inadequate disclosures  concerning asset problems that later resulted in significant losses.  </P> <P> The settlement to shareholders totaled $13 million, all but $500,000 of which  will be paid by ICA's insurers, ICA said.  </P> <P> The settlement will be paid, after of legal costs, to shareholders who  purchased ICA stock between March, 1987, and January, 1989, Dunn said.  </P> <P> The settlement also includes the payment to plaintiffs of 1.5-million warrants  for the purchase of one share of common stock.

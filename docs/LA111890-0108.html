			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: FICTION  </P> <P> HOUSES WITHOUT DOORS by Peter Straub (E.P. Dutton: $19.95; 356 pp.). Readers  familiar with Peter Straub's novels, notably "Ghost Story," "Koko" and  "Mystery," won't be fooled for a minute by his latest offering: "Houses Without  Doors," a collection of two novellas and five short stories.  </P> <P> They know full well that with Straub, white may very well turn out to be black,  today may prove to be yesterday (or tomorrow), and what is could very well be  maybe. This is an author who can plop a seemingly conventional character down  in the middle of a seemingly familiar setting and within three pages all hell  has broken loose: Nobody is conventional and nothing is familiar. Be warned  that Straub isn't the easiest read in the world and that, at times, he can  become convoluted and obscure to the point of complete bafflement. Bear with  him at such moments. Don G. Campbell  </P></p>

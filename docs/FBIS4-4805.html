			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pro-Japanese Flunkeyist Treacheries of Traitor Kim </F> Yong-sam Denounced" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Tokyo, April 1 (KNS-KCNA) [dateline as received] --  The Japan mission of the South Korean National Democratic Front  [SKNDF] (Hanminjon) issued a statement on March 29 denouncing  the pro-Japanese flunkeyist treacheries of the traitor Kim  Yong-sam which were revealed during his trip to Japan.    "The traitor Kim Yong-sam blared that he `will work to  strengthen the triangular cooperative system of South Korea, the  United States and Japan' to `get rid of' the North and lay aside  the past history of aggression of Japan, crying for  `future-oriented relations'," the statement said, and went on:    "Kim Yong-sam is trying to slay fellow countrymen in league  with outside forces while turning back on the independent,  patriotic stand and sincere efforts of the North for the peace  and peaceful reunification of the country, and wipe off the  slate the brutalities of Japanese imperialism which we can never  pardon. He is, indeed, a special-class flunkeyist traitor and a  dyed-in-the-wool pro-Japanese element who far outdistances the  successive rulers.    "The Japan mission of Hanminjon bitterly denounces with  towering national resentment a sequence of acts committed by the  traitor Kim Yong-sam during his tour of Japan, branding them as  heinous treacheries and shameless flunkeyist acts.    "By stating that the `Self-Defence Forces' of Japan could be  dispatched to the Korean peninsula in `case of emergency,' the  traitor Kim Yong-sam embarked upon a very dangerous road which  might lead to a nuclear holocaust annihilating the nation,  encouraging the Japanese reactionaries who are dreaming of  overseas expansion."    The statement called upon the entire South Korean people to  reject the dependence on foreign forces and treacheries by  taking the road of independence and patriotism and turn out as  one in the struggle for the overthrow of the Kim Yong-sam regime.</p>

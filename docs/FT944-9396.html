			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Africa leaders bid to salvage Angola peace African leaders met in Zambia yesterday in an urgent attempt to keep Angola's faltering peace accord on track. The meeting of southern African states followed a last-minute postponement from yesterday to Sunday of the signing of the accord, painstakingly negotiated by United Nations mediators over 11 months. The leaders, who earlier this year used both carrot and stick to reverse a coup ousting one of their members in Lesotho, were drafting a tough statement telling Angola's warring sides to stop the bloodletting, officials said. Mr Thabo Mbeki, South Africa's deputy president, has already warned that the leaders will take action - widely seen as including military intervention - should the latest Angolan peace bid crumble as others before it. Although UN officials declined to give reasons for postponing the signing ceremony, officials said it was because Angola's Unita rebels had refused to sign while the government intensified the war. In the past two weeks, after the government and Unita had initialled the pact, Angolan army troops overran Unita's stronghold of Huambo in central Angola, throwing the peace process into doubt. The Lusaka talks are testing the capacity of the southern African states, which originally came together to help in the overthow of white minority governments in Rhodesia and South Africa, to act as guarantors of a regional security pact based on democratic governments. If such a grouping can succeed in southern Africa, it could set an example of conflict resolution from which the rest of the continent can learn. Whether manoeuvres in the field are designed to win advantages at the negotiating table, or the last resort of parties or individuals who fear the outcome of the ballot box, Angola is no different from other African states where an upsurge of violence has frequently preceded peace agreements. This time, however, the MPLA government may have turned the tables on Mr Jonas Savimbi, leader of the Unita movement. Since he rejected his 1992 election defeat, he has tried to win an ascendancy on the battlefield that would be reflected in the composition of the government that would emerge from the Lusaka peace talks. The MPLA, however, seems to have made two critical calculations. The first is that it could take Huambo. The second was based on an assessment of international opinion, in particular Washington and Moscow, the two key outside powers. When Mr Savimbi resorted to war after his election defeat he lost most of his friends in western capitals. Whether the MPLA has broken the spirit of the Lusaka talks or not, Unita's cries of foul play will have little impact. No one underestimates the capacity of Mr Savimbi further to disrupt the peace process. Even if the signing goes ahead on Sunday formidable obstacles remain - not the least of which is the integration of two rival forces into a national army. But regional and international developments are putting him under intense pressure. The prize is bringing peace to a region where the wars for independence began in the early 1960s: even the unpredictable Mr Savimbi, argue frontline officials in Lusaka, knows that sooner or later he has to settle his differences at the conference table and abide by the result.</p>

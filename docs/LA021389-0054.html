			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAKER, GENSCHER CONFER ON MISSILES;  </P> <P> 'GOOD' MEETING HELD ON BONN PROPOSAL TO DELAY NEW WEAPON  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III, seeking to defuse an issue that could  disrupt NATO military strategy, met with West German Foreign Minister  Hans-Dietrich Genscher on Sunday to discuss a Bonn proposal to delay building a  new short-range nuclear missile.  </P> <P> "What we need to do is find out exactly what the position is -- what the German  government position is going to be," Baker told reporters shortly before  landing here on the fourth stop of a weeklong, 15-country tour of North  Atlantic Treaty Organization allies.  </P> <P> But after a two-hour dinner meeting with Genscher, a senior U.S. official  traveling with Baker said only that the two "had a good discussion" of the  issue. The official refused to elaborate, suggesting that the question remained  unsettled.  </P> <P> But the official called the dinner meeting "extremely warm and cordial."  </P> <P> Baker and other U.S. officials were taken by surprise last week when West  German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, under political pressure at home, announced that  he wants to delay an expected NATO decision on modernizing short-range nuclear  missiles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Agreement Sought This Year  </P> <P> U.S. officials hoped that the alliance would agree some time this year to  develop a new version of the current battlefield missile, the Lance.  </P> <P> NATO has deployed an estimated 88 Lance missile launchers with an estimated 700  nuclear warheads in Western Europe, most of them in West Germany. The  battlefield missiles, with a range of 70 miles, are intended to deter an attack  on the West by Soviet tank forces.  </P> <P> But the presence of the missiles has become an increasingly sensitive issue in  West Germany, which is where they are most likely to be used if a general war  breaks out.  </P> <P> Genscher, who leads the small Free Democratic Party in a governing coalition  with Kohl's Christian Democrats, has long favored negotiations to reduce or ban  the short-range missiles.  </P> <P> Kohl, who had previously supported the NATO plan to decide on a modernization  plan this year, said in a British newspaper interview last week that there was  no need to settle the question until 1991 or 1992 -- after West Germany's next  election at the end of 1990.  </P> <P> </P> <P> U.S. 'Needs a Decision'  </P> <P> But Baker told British officials in London earlier Sunday that he "needs a  decision" on the issue to win funding from Congress for the development of a  modernized missile, according to a British aide.  </P> <P> On Saturday, Wolfgang Schaeuble, a Kohl aide who visited Washington last week,  told an interviewer that U.S. officials agreed with Bonn that NATO could put  off a decision on modernization until 1991, but a senior British official  called Schaeuble's comment "an overstatement."  </P> <P> Reflecting the U.S. view that short-range missiles -- those with a range of up  to 300 miles -- are a necessary part of NATO strategy, Baker said the Bush  Administration opposes negotiating a ban on the weapons like that concluded on  intermediate-range missiles in 1987. A U.S.-Soviet agreement banned all  ground-launched missiles with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles.  </P> <P> "We have not changed our view with respect to the inadvisability of  negotiating" an agreement on short-range missiles, he told reporters.  </P> <P> Baker also said he is pleased with West Germany's recent actions to crack down  on West German firms that have been selling equipment for making chemical  weapons to Third World nations.  </P> <P> The Kohl government's plans to crack down on such exports are "quite promising,  in our view," Baker said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lunch With Thatcher  </P> <P> Baker flew to Bonn after spending 17 hours in Britain, including a working  lunch with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at Chequers, her official country  residence, 40 miles from London.  </P> <P> Baker said that he and Thatcher agreed "on a broad range of issues ranging from  broad East-West themes to regional issues."  </P> <P> "We and the British remain very, very close together on all these issues," he  said.  </P> <P> Baker noted, however, that he did discuss one point of disagreement with  British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe: Britain's plea for the United States  to agree to relax a joint Western ban on high-technology exports to the Soviet  Union.  </P> <P> The ban was instituted after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.  Britain has proposed that the curbs be eased slightly to allow for equipment  with no clear military use to be sold to Moscow. But Baker has said he would  like to maintain the ban for the time being.  </P> <P> "They would prefer to see the 'no exceptions' rule lifted," Baker said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> An Open Mind  </P> <P> A British official quoted Baker as saying the Administration "has an open mind  on the question but wants to study it further."  </P> <P> The British official said Baker also assured Howe that the Administration has  decided to continue its dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization,  despite demands from Israel and U.S. Jewish groups that the talks stop.  </P> <P> Howe urged the secretary of state to continue the contacts to "encourage the  Palestinians to sustain their present moderate course," the British official  said.  </P> <P> Howe, speaking to reporters on the sidewalk outside his London residence,  echoed Baker's explanation for the visit, his first overseas trip as secretary  of state.  </P> <P> "This is not an occasion for decision-taking," Howe said. "It is an occasion  for reviewing the agenda."  </P> <P> Baker was staying overnight at Schloss Gymnich, a government-owned castle in  the countryside south of Bonn.  </P> <P> On Monday, he was scheduled to fly on to Denmark and Norway, then to return to  Bonn for dinner with Kohl and Genscher.  </P> <P> The inaugural diplomatic blitz will continue through the week with stops in  Turkey, Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands  and France.  </P></p>

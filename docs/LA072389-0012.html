			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GODDESS THEORY  </P> <P> Regardless of the academic validity of Marija Gimbutas' studies, a case can be  made for the benefits of a female ruler of a culture ("The Goddess Theory," by  Jacques Leslie, June 11). The female, as carrier of future generations, would  be more concerned with promoting a peaceful environment. Perhaps this kind of  thinking may lead some brave women to become presidential candidates. It's  about time.  </P> <P> LINDA UMSTEAD  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

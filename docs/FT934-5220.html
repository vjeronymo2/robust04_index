			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Results of reforms to CAP 'near forecasts' The European Commission yesterday said that the results of the first year of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy came in close to forecasts, and should therefore make it easier to conclude a farm trade deal with the US in the closing stages of the Uruguay Round. As EU and US trade negotiators meet to try to break the deadlock in the world trade talks in Brussels today and tomorrow, the CAP results will be scanned carefully by France and its allies, who claim cuts in subsidised food exports offered within Gatt exceed what CAP reform can deliver. Mr Rene Steichen, EU farm commissioner, said provisional figures for the 1993 growing season showed total cereals output falling to 164.7m tonnes, against CAP reform projections of 166m tonnes. The amount of land taken out of production was exactly as forecast, at 4.7m hectares. He said these figures 'clearly indicate that CAP reform is achieving its most important objective, ie, reducing production,' confirming to Europe's trading partners that the 12 have put in place an effective system to reduce oversupply and consequent dumping on world markets. The 1993 total compares with output of 168m tonnes in 1992, and 180.7m tonnes in 1991. The relatively small drop on last year is seen by some critics of the reform as evidence of its feebleness, and by others as proof that much more land will have to be taken out of production to meet the Gatt cuts, of 21 per cent of subsidised exports over six years.</p>

			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> AIRPORT NOISE LIMITATION LAW POSTPONED TO JANUARY  </P> <P> The Long Beach City Council has postponed until Jan. 2 further consideration of  a controversial ordinance that seeks to limit airport noise to the satisfaction  of residents, airlines and a Los Angeles federal court judge.  </P> <P> The city had been ordered to deliver a new ordinance to U.S. District Judge  Laughlin E. Waters by Nov. 13. Waters has declared the old ordinance, which  limited daily flights to 40, unconstitutional.  </P> <P> The council gave tentative approval to a proposed ordinance last month, which  has since attracted a stack of mail three inches high, said Lee Blackman,  attorney for the city. Airlines say the proposed law is too restrictive while  residents complain it is too lenient.  </P> <P> The court date has been postponed to mid-January, although a firm date was not  immediately set. The council is continuing to field comments about the proposed  law, which would limit cumulative yearly noise to 65 decibels, but not the  number of daily flights.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a verdict is awaited in a separate case in which several Long Beach  residents sued the city for allowing too much airport noise and contributing to  a decline in property values. Testimony recently concluded in a three-day trial  and Waters is considering the matter, said John Schimmenti, an attorney for the  homeowners.  </P></p>

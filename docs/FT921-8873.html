			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Harland shares take a tumble as company issues profits warning SHARES IN Harland Simon, the control systems specialist, yesterday lost more than half their value after the company issued a profits warning and released details of exposure to companies controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. The shares slumped to 253p, their lowest since 1988, after opening at 585p. The company said pre-tax profits for the year to end-March would show 'a significant fall' from last time's Pounds 10.5m. Hoare Govett, the company's broker, cut its forecast from Pounds 13m to Pounds 4m. The company said contracts expected to be placed by Maxwell Communication Corporation and Mirror Group Newspapers had fallen through following the publisher's death and this would reduce profits by Pounds 2m. It has also made provisions of Pounds 750,000 to cover disputed debts due from the two Maxwell companies. Mr John Redshaw, group managing director, said he was 'very saddened' by the announcement. 'Its a short-term problem which has hit us at the end of the year. But we are stronger than before because we have taken out our dependence on newspapers and optical storage equipment,' he said. Newspapers are expected to account for about 20 per cent of turnover in 1992, down from 85 per cent in 1987. Profits will also be affected by delays at Perfect Information, the on-line library service. The delays, and start-up problems, will reduce profits due to the company by Pounds 3m. But directors said they would recommend an unchanged final dividend of 5.5p and turnover is expected to be higher than last year. The company has spent Pounds 1m trying to lift overseas sales and has incurred costs of Pounds 1m on rationalisation. Staff numbers have been reduced by about 15 per cent and further redundancies are likely. Cost cutting will reduce overheads by Pounds 5.5m from next year. It said all established divisions were profitable except for NEF, a Swedish subsidiary, and Pro Aqua, involved in water control. These are expected to announce losses of Pounds 700,000 for the year.</p>

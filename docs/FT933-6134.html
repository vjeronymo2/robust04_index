			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / The Middle East: Signs of progress expose Palestinian divisions IT DID not take long to bring Palestinian rifts into the open, following the signs of progress yesterday in the peace process. Conflicting signals emerged from the PLO itself - euphoria from Mr Bassam Abu Sharif and Mr Yasser Abed-Rabbo, aides to the chairman Mr Yassir Arafat, contrasting with pessimism from political department head Mr Farouk Khaddoumi. Mr Ahmed Jibril's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command was more extreme and threatened to assassinate Mr Arafat. The PLO responded by saying the guerrilla group was out of touch with the needs of Palestinians. The Hamas Islamic Resistance movement, which has its strongholds in Gaza, has said it will do everything to block a deal. The fundamentalist group, which opposes the US-brokered Middle East peace talks, is the main rival of the Palestine Liberation Organisation in the Israeli-held West Bank and Gaza strip. Its main stronghold is believed to be in Gaza. 'This project opens the door wide to inter-Palestinian fighting and civil war because it does not fulfil their aspirations and liquidates their cause,' Mr Mohammed Nazzal, the Hamas representative in Jordan said. Mr Abdel Aziz Rantisi, the spokesman for the 400 deported Palestinian radicals stranded since last December in southern Lebanon, said in a telephone interview with the Associated Press yesterday that Moslems throughout the world rejected any deal recognising Israel. 'This agreement will not prevent the Islamic generation, now or in the future, from fighting to restore its rights in Haifa, Acre, Lydda, Jaffa and Jerusalem,' he said. Mark Nicholson adds from Cairo: The Egyptian government, which has played an increasingly important role in brokering Arab-Israeli talks, yesterday welcomed the 'Gaza-Jericho first' agreement as a move towards achieving Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territories. But it emphasised that this should be seen as a first step. In the first reaction from any Arab government to the proposed deal, Mr Amr Moussa, Egyptian foreign minister, said: 'Any withdrawal from any part of the Arab land occupied (by Israel) since 1967 is a step forward'. It is a step that does not meet all requirements on its own, but is a move towards achieving self-rule in all the Palestinian occupied territories.' He said a full solution should embrace the terms of the original Madrid formula for the peace talks, the full satisfaction of United Nations resolutions and an acceptance by Israel of the principle of 'land for peace'. 'The Gaza-Jericho proposal is under careful study and if the Palestinians approve it, we will approve it too. The decision is a Palestinian one,' the minister said. Mr Arafat was due to arrive in Cairo last night for talks with Mr Moussa and is due to meet Mr Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian president, this morning at the presidential palace in Alexandria. Mr Moussa, before yesterday's talks, put his government squarely behind the PLO leadership in the face of hardline Palestinian opposition to the proposal, praising Mr Arafat as 'working hard to reach a comprehensive settlement'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Katsuhiro Kuroda] </F>   [Text] Seoul, 6 Apr -- An informed source in Seoul  revealed information on 6 April that he obtained from a Chinese  military source in Beijing. According to the information, North  Korea has recently redeployed some of its ground-to-ground  missile units to target China. According to the information,  DPRK border guards along the border between North Korea and  China have recently fired upon North Koreans trying to flee to  China, killing some Chinese, and Beijing has expressed its  displeasure over the casualties.    The Chinese military source did not given details about  which  North Korean missile units have been redeployed to target China.  According to a missile deployment chart in North Korea that  SANKEI SHIMBUN obtained in Seoul, the launch pads for "Nodong"-1  and "Daepodong"-1 missiles are deployed in eastern coastal areas  while launch pads for other North Korean missiles are located in  Chungkangjin (Chagang Province) near the North Korea-China  border, Chulsan in western coastal areas (North Pyongan), and in  Changsankon (South Hwanghae).    Scud-C missiles, with a range of 500 km, would not be able  to  hit Beijing if fired from those launch pads, but industrial  areas in China's three northern provinces would be within their  range.    Nodong-1 missiles with a range of more than 1,000 km are  able  to hit Beijing.    The Chinese military source expressed distrust of North  Korea, saying, "like Vietnam, North Korea is unpredictable and  we do not know for sure what it is going to do."    This comment shows that in military affairs, the Chinese  military is placing more importance on the lessons it learned  from the China-Vietnam war in the 1970's, when its forces  suffered a bitter defeat, than on the Korean war in the 1950's  which paved the way for the blood-tied relationship between  North Korea and China. As a result China, though ostensibly  friendly to North Korea, is guarding against the country.  However, North Korea is believed to be far more distrustful of  China than China is of North Korea. DPRK reporters have said  repeatedly and publicly in Panmunjom: "We do not know what  attitude China will take toward North Korea in the end. China  is not a nation we can trust to the last."    North Korea is believed to be preparing for the time when  its  relations with China worsen in the light of what happened with  the former Soviet Union, which played a key role in founding the  Kim Il-song regime, but then abandoned Pyongyang when its  domestic circumstances changed.    Commenting on the information that "North Korea has  redeployed missiles to aim them at China," an informed source in  Seoul said: "North Korea is deepening its international  isolation and feeling a sense of crisis arising from this.  North Korea's action represents `its resolve and determination'  to maintain its system."    The same source also speculated that the recent North Korean  action may be aimed primarily at using the military to solidify  its system.    Leaders from both Japan and South Korea have visited Beijing  in the hope of asking Chinese leaders to persuade North Korea to  resolve the nuclear issue based on the friendly relations China  is believed to maintain with North Korea. The information that  "North Korea has redeployed missiles and targeted China" reveals  North Korea's distrust of China.    Chinese leaders have frequently said, "China has a limited  role to play on North Korea." This new information and that  remark repeated by Chinese leaders are combining to grab  attention.</p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Fears in Manila for IMF credit CONCERN is growing in the Philippines that failure to meet money supply targets could cut off access to much-needed International Monetary Fund stand-by facilities. The IMF, which last February resumed a stand-by credit facility to Manila, wants the government to keep to its money supply targets, exceeded since May. Failure to do this will halt Philippine drawdowns on the last tranche of the stand-by facility, and could freeze transactions under the Dollars 4.8bn debt restructuring package signed with the commercial bank creditors on Friday in London. Also, official credit, particularly from Japan, the country's main donor, is now linked to Manila's adherence to the IMF programme. However, Mr Ramon del Rosario, the finance secretary, and Mr Jose Cuisia, governor of the Central Bank of the Philippines, yesterday expressed confidence that the IMF ceilings would be met through the increase in Treasury-bill floats starting this weekend. Mr Cuisia acknowledged that currency in circulation had surged since May, thanks to rises in foreign-exchange remittances and in foreign investments in the local stock market. Government spending also rose during May, pushing the budget deficit above another IMF ceiling.</p>

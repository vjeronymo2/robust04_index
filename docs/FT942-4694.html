			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / International Company News: Apple in panel display move Apple Computer is to collaborate with a small US manufacturer of flat panel displays, OIS Optical Imaging Systems, to develop displays for Apple's next generation of notebook computers. OIS will be the first US manufacturer to supply active matrix liquid crystal displays to the computer industry. Sharp, of Japan is the dominant world supplier of these displays which are used in avionics and a variety of electronic instruments. OIS, an affiliate of Guardian Industries, plans to build the first US high volume manufacturing facility for active matrix flat panel displays at a cost of around Dollars 400m. The agreement with Apple follows a recent announcement by the US administration of an initiative to boost US flat panel display manufacturing. The Dollars 600m initiative, which includes incentives for companies that are establishing display manufacturing operations in the US has yet to be funded. OIS plans to seek government support for research and development through the Commerce Department's Technology Redevelopment Programme (TRP). Apple, which currently purchases flat panel displays from Japan, said that it may support OIS in its application for TRP. 'We would like to see a US supply base,' for flat panel displays, Apple said. However, the agreement with Apple and plans for expanded manufacturing were not prompted by the government move, said Mr Ralph Gerson, chairman of OIS. In the first phase of its agreement with Apple, OIS will develop a new, high-performance active matrix display to Apple's specifications and deliver prototype displays.</p>

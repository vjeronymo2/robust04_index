			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOW SEEKS INQUIRY INTO POLICE INVESTIGATIONS;  </P> <P> CRIME: THE POLICE DEPARTMENT'S FAILURE RATE AND ALLEGED INSENSITIVITY TO  VICTIMS ARE TARGETED.  </P> <P> A women's advocacy group this week plans to request investigations of the  Police Department's failure to solve a high percentage of rape cases and  allegations that some officers are insensitive to rape victims.  </P> <P> The local chapter of the National Organization for Women plans to ask the new  Citizen Police Complaint Commission to determine whether the department is  pursuing rape cases as aggressively as it should. Last year, police failed to  make arrests in 74% of the cases of reported rapes.  </P> <P> The 11-member commission, which will be receiving public requests for the first  time when it meets Wednesday, was approved by Long Beach voters last April to  review reports of police misconduct.  </P> <P> NOW will also ask the commission to recommend ways to improve the department's  "attitude and treatment of (rape) victims," said Gerrie Schipske, the group's  president.  </P> <P> "There seems to be an attitude in the department that this is not important  enough," said Schipske, who accused police of being insensitive to the  seriousness of the crime. "(There is) the sexist belief held by many police  that somehow rape is a crime of sexual passion and that the women involved  asked for it."  </P> <P> Department officials would not comment on Schipske's statements but have said  repeatedly that the an understaffed Police Department is the main factor in the  department's poor track record in solving rape cases and other serious crimes.  Officials at one point ordered mandatory weekend overtime to try to reduce the  backlog of unsolved cases in the detective bureau, where some complaints have  sat for months before anyone could get to them.  </P> <P> Schipske, however, questioned whether the understaffing is a valid excuse. "It  can't be that they're just busy doing other things," she said.  </P> <P> Last year, Long Beach police had the worst record of any major city in  California for solving serious and violent crimes.  </P> <P> Police solved 65 of the 247 rapes reported in the city last year, a 74% failure  rate surpassed only by the percentage of unsolved robberies, among serious  crimes. Police failed to solve 87% of the robberies, 52% of the murders and 41%  of the assaults.  </P> <P> A study by the California Department of Justice found that Los Angeles police  failed to solve 51% of the rapes reported to them in 1989, while San Diego  police failed to solve 52%. Oakland police had a failure rate of 34%, Anaheim  police 28% and Santa Ana police 19%.  </P> <P> "Rape is a felony, but it has not gotten the attention of the department,"  Schipske said. "Rape is a crime that is committed against women and for it to  be so neglected, we want it looked into."  </P> <P> Officials of Rape Hotline of Long Beach also are expected to ask the commission  to investigate concerns that disparaging remarks by a few patrol officers have  discouraged some rape victims from pursuing their complaints. Rape Hotline  volunteers answer emergency calls and help victims through police interviews,  doctor examinations and court hearings.  </P> <P> In the past three months, hot line officials referred to the department two  complaints of officers making offensive remarks to rape victims.  </P> <P> In one case, a female officer called a young woman "a little whore" before  realizing the woman had been raped, according to Julie Dodge, executive  director of the Sexual Assault Crisis Agency, which runs the 24-hour hot line.  In another case, a rape victim withdrew her complaint after becoming upset  about a police officer's comments. Dodge declined to discuss specific details  of the incident to ensure the victim's privacy.  </P> <P> Police are investigating both incidents, Deputy Chief Robert Luman said.  </P> <P> Luman insisted, however, that the department generally is doing an excellent  job dealing with rape victims.  </P> <P> "The hot line takes about 200 calls a month. That's two (complaints) for 600  contacts, so it doesn't seem like an overwhelming problem. Obviously, we'd like  it to be zero," Luman said.  </P> <P> Dodge acknowledged that only a few patrol officers may be making insensitive  remarks but argued that more training should be established.  </P> <P> "We need to blow away some of the myths, such as somehow, the victim did  something wrong," Dodge said.  </P> <P> She also expressed concern that officers may not be responding as sensitively  to a rape victim who appears calm after an attack. "She may look as if she's  OK, but she's not. She's in shock," Dodge said. The rape victim who appears  calm is not likely to receive as much support as the victim who is emotional,  Dodge added.  </P> <P> Hot line officials are working with sex-crime investigators to prepare a  training program for all patrol officers, Dodge said. The program would be a  refresher course for officers, who receive training in how to conduct sexual  assault investigations when they first join the force, Luman said.  </P> <P> Dodge has also suggested that detectives from the sex crimes detail, rather  than patrol officers, be assigned to respond to calls about alleged rapes when  possible. A Rape Hotline representative also should be requested, and a police  surgeon, if necessary, she said.  </P> <P> Investigators with the sex crimes detail said department officials had ordered  them not to comment.  </P> <P> NOW also plans to ask the commission to study whether rape cases involving  victims who are poor or minorities are being pursued vigorously, Schipske said.  "Traditionally, if the woman is not a blonde and socially upscale, the rape is  not considered a rape," Schipske said.  </P></p>

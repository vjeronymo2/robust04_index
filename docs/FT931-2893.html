			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / International Company News: Lufthansa's marketing director quits suddenly LUFTHANSA'S passenger marketing and sales director resigned abruptly yesterday, writes Christopher Parkes. Mr Ernst-Adrian von Dornberg, 40, and a full board member for just over two years, quit during a meeting of the state-controlled airline's supervisory board in Cologne. No reason was given. 'The meeting is still going on,' a spokesman said last night. No successor was named. Mr von Dornberg may have fallen victim to in-fighting which is believed to have broken out in the wake of a critical study of Lufthansa carried out by the McKinsey management consultancy. In contrast to the management's forecasts that its current cost-cutting and reorganisation programme would bring the airline back into profit by 1994, the report said it was doomed to making heavy operating losses until at least 1996.</p>

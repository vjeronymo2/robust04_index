			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPPOSITION'S LEADER STIFLED IN MYANMAR;  </P> <P> SOUTHEAST ASIA: THE END OF MILITARY RULE MAY HINGE ON THE STATUS OF THE  DAUGHTER OF AN INDEPENDENCE HERO.  </P> <P> Aung San Suu Kyi, the opposition leader whose party is claiming a landslide  election victory, remained under house arrest Tuesday despite being the pivotal  figure in a pending delicate transfer of power between army and civilian  governments.  </P> <P> As votes from Sunday's election were counted, many said they see the  44-year-old academic as their only hope for a change of leadership free of  bloodletting and revenge in Myanmar, formerly Burma.  </P> <P> "Without Aung San Suu Kyi, we cannot carry the people," said Khin Maung Swe,  committee member of the National League for Democracy. "She is a symbol of our  fight for democracy."  </P> <P> The elections were the climax of 20 months of army rule, imposed after troops  gunned down hundreds of demonstrators to end nationwide demands for political  freedom.  </P> <P> The government-approved National Unity Party has so far won only a fraction of  the vote. Until all the votes are counted, a process the army has said may take  up to three weeks -- or one side makes a move -- Myanmar remains in limbo  between army rule and parliamentary democracy.  </P> <P> The army, which officials said had been caught off guard by the landslide, has  promised to hand power to a government formed after a new constitution is  adopted.  </P> <P> Acting league president Kyi Maung said Tuesday that his party would refine  Myanmar's 1947 constitution within two months after Parliament convenes.  </P> <P> He said his party -- which says it already has a majority in Parliament -- will  meet Thursday to work out how to set up a government.  </P> <P> "At the moment we can't talk about the future. We will sit down together and  come up with a nice list of priorities," he said.  </P> <P> But few expect much to happen until the dynamic, British-educated Aung San Suu  Kyi and party chairman Tin Oo, both detained last July after making fiery  anti-government speeches, are released.  </P> <P> Despite her arrest, the slender daughter of assassinated independence hero Aung  San dominated the elections and is seen as the main reason for the league's  overwhelming victory.  </P> <P> "The army has to release them. They just need a face-saving way out," said one  official.  </P> <P> Aung San Suu Kyi's home, by Yangon's Inya Lake, is still guarded by a battalion  of soldiers who politely but firmly turn away visitors.  </P> <P> On the other side of the lake is the house of Gen. Ne Win, until 1988 the  leader of Burma and still believed to be the power behind the military  government.  </P></p>

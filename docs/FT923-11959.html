			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: BA's high price ticket British Airways' deal with USAir is a vivid illustration of the unique nature of the world airline business. The proposition is that BA should pay Pounds 393m for a 32 per cent stake in a business whose entire market capitalisation on the day before the deal was Pounds 319m. On a voting basis, BA's stake will be only 21 per cent. Granted, BA will get preference stock yielding 7 per cent, whereas USAir's equity yields nothing at all. It is also claimed that putting the two businesses together will produce handsome cost savings, if not for another couple of years. But if yesterday's mere 10 per cent rise in USAir's share price is a guide, Wall Street, with its long and depressing experience of US domestic airlines, is in no hurry to be convinced. The 4 per cent rise in BA's share price yesterday will have been partly due to relief that among the various deals which the company was working on, it has settled for one which will not involve a rights issue. On the other hand, gearing will be pushed to nearly 100 per cent. Given that the deal could ultimately involve a further payment of up to Dollars 600m and that BA plainly has ambitions for other link-ups elsewhere in the world, the threat of a future cash call should perhaps not be dismissed. On the bright side, it should be pointed out that USAir gives BA its entry into the US domestic market, besides offering a leading position in a handful of US east coast airports which account for some 40 per cent of transatlantic travel. It also brings in a business with Pounds 3.8bn of turnover to add to BA's Pounds 5.2bn. It is also plain that the US domestic airline industry cannot continue as it is: it must either get a good deal better or a good deal worse. But it is still sobering to reflect that if BA and USAir had been formally combined last year, their pre-tax margin on joint turnover of Pounds 9bn would have been just 1.3 per cent.</p>

			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / International Company News: Two Japanese regional banks agree to merge TWO Japanese regional banks, Ugo Bank and Akita Akebono Bank, both based in the north-east, yesterday announced an agreement to merge in a move applauded by the Ministry of Finance and likely to be repeated in other parts of the country. Japan's regional banks have come under increasing pressure with the gradual liberalisation of financial markets, while individual banks are reeling from ill-advised stock purchases or lending during the 'bubble era' of the late 1980s. Both of these elements appear to be at work in the merger of Ugo and Akita Akebono, as the latter bank reported a 98 per cent fall in pre-tax profit in the year ended March. The bank has admitted that its earnings were weighed down by huge appraisal losses on securities holdings. Ugo Bank, capitalised at Y3.15bn (Dollars 26.25m) at end-March, has 71 branches, most in the Akita region and had a balance of deposits of Y621.3bn at the fiscal year-end. Akita Akebono, a former 'sogo' or mutual bank, had a capital of Y2.37bn, and deposits of Y403.2bn in its 60 branches. Executives of the two banks said yesterday that the new name is yet to be decided, although Ugo will be the more influential of the partners. The president and chairman of Ugo Bank are likely to retain those positions, while the president of Akita Akebono is expected to be vice-chairman when the merger is formally carried out next April. Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, welcomed the merger and said the country's banks must intensify efforts to streamline operations. He said mergers should be considered as one means of improving efficiency among smaller banks. The Regional Banks Association of Japan also applauded the announcement, and suggested that the merger was a 'way to increase customer services under increasingly tough management conditions'.

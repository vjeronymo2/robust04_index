			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Guatemalan Revolutionary Unity [URNG]  yesterday blamed the Guatemalan Government's "lack of goodwill"  for the failure of the round of negotiations that concluded in  Puebla, Mexico, yesterday.    Miguel Sandoval, member of the URNG's diplomatic team,  criticized the government delegation for "trying to evade the  negotiation, rejecting the civilian society's position, and  refusing to discuss in Oslo immediately the creation of a Truth  Commission."    In a communique transmitted to this newspaper, the CERIGUA  News Agency quotes Sandoval and describes as "tense" the meeting  that closed yesterday without agreements and in which the Army,  the government, and the rebels held contradictory positions on  the displaced population subject. According to CERIGUA, another  point of disagreement was the government's intention to center  the discussion on a cease-fire, which contradicts the already  signed agreements, rather than the proposals of the sectors  involved, proposals outlined in a Civilian Sectors Assembly  document.</p>

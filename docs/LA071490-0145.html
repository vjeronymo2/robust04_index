			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NONTOXIC PEST CONTROL BECOMES BIG BUSINESS;  </P> <P> EXTERMINATORS: TALLON USES NOVEL APPROACHES AND AVOIDS SPRAYING POISONS.  </P> <P> The best way to zap termites, said exterminator Jay Tallon, is to "freeze their  little buns off."  </P> <P> That's just one of several novel ways Tallon and his brother, Joe, have devised  to kill household pests without using poisons that may endanger pets, plants or  homeowners. And it's become big business.  </P> <P> "We have what the consumer wants today. They don't want you to go out there and  spray toxic chemicals on everything in sight," Jay Tallon said.  </P> <P> Tallon Termite &amp; Pest Control, based in Redondo Beach, has developed an  arsenal that eschews toxic pesticides in favor of high-tech devices and  old-fashioned common sense.  </P> <P> Included are a "bug vacuum" for swooshing up spiders and other creepy crawlies,  a steam-based "flea machine" for infested carpets, glue boards for catching  mice and a tiny electric fence that keeps home foundations off limits to  multiple-footed outsiders.  </P> <P> The Tallons have also perfected a way to literally look inside the walls of  homes and pinpoint where termites may be munching away. Using fiber-optic  instruments, pest-control experts peek inside those hard-to-reach places to  find the unwanted denizens.  </P> <P> The voracious termites tend to cluster, Tallon said. Normally, they will be  found in just a couple of walls, congregated in three or four of the timber  support studs.  </P> <P> The first step in getting rid of them is to probe with fiber-optic instruments  to pinpoint their location. Then a dime-sized hole is drilled at the bottom of  the wall and another at the top. Liquid nitrogen is pumped through the holes  into the inaccessible areas, freezing the termites.  </P> <P> "We freeze their little buns off," Tallon said with a grin, noting that  termites are killed by the cold, which reaches minus-20 degrees, and not by the  liquid nitrogen itself.  </P> <P> "Termites will tell you they're 98% water," a Tallon radio ad says. "When we're  done with 'em, they are 200% frozen. The idea is dead simple. We freeze  termites instead of fumigate them."  </P> <P> Eighty percent of the air humans breathe consists of nitrogen, and the freezing  process is environmentally safe, Tallon said. When the temperature returns to  normal, the liquid nitrogen evaporates.  </P> <P> Called the Blizzard System, the eradication process is registered with the  Environmental Protection Agency, and Tallon said the company is the only one in  the nation using the super-cold approach for excising termites.  </P> <P> But some species of termites succumb more easily to excess heat than cold, and  the Tallons last year began marketing a companion system called the HeatWave.  </P> <P> Using a convection heating system, heat strips are applied to the wood  requiring treatment and then the electricity is turned on. About 30 minutes are  required for the heat to penetrate to the center of the wood and reach 135  degrees. The termites die within a minute or two.  </P> <P> Tallon is applying its non-traditional, environmentally safe methods toward the  destruction of all types of household pests, including ants, roaches, spiders,  fleas, mice and rats.  </P> <P> The company, which saw sales jump from $85,000 a month in 1987 to $700,000 per  month this year, is expanding into the San Francisco Bay Area this summer and  is opening offices in Florida and Hawaii.  </P> <P> "We hope to be throughout the United States over the next five years," Tallon  said.  </P> <P> The traditional method of tenting -- enclosing a home and moving everyone out  before spraying for bugs with pesticides -- is becoming increasingly  distasteful in this era of growing environmental awareness, he said.  </P> <P> "We don't want to become spray jockeys," he added. "We've started a pilot  program for comprehensive, non-conventional pest control."  </P> <P> Tallon's war on fleas features a "flea machine" that steams the carpet and  kills the adult wingless hoppers hiding in the fibers. It also includes a  nontoxic "birth-inhibitor" spray that prevents young insects from matriculating  through a complete life cycle.  </P> <P> Rodents get no respite from the Tallons either. The company's crews use  electrical barriers, consisting of a single strand of wire and low-voltage  batteries, to prevent mice, rats and roaches from coming inside the house.  </P> <P> "We first exclude them from the structure," Tallon said. "We trap the ones in  the house with mice glue boards. They have a gummy substance on them that  attracts the mice to it, and (they) go and get stuck and they suffocate."  </P> <P> Then there's the "Bugvac" for spiders. "We vacuum all the spiders up," Tallon  said. "We go outside as well as in the home and vacuum the corners and areas  where spiders are."  </P> <P> The cost of treating a 2,000-square-foot house via the Tallon method ranges  between $1,000 and $1,500, he said.  </P></p>

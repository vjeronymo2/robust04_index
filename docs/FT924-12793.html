			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Survey of International Mergers and Acquisitions (5): OK to sell the silver - Changing attitudes in Germany THERE WAS a time when selling a business in Germany was not merely socially unacceptable - it was a mark of downright social failure. But, says Mr Paul Achleitner, head of mergers and acquisitions for German-speaking countries at Goldman Sachs, this has changed in the two years since German reunification. 'You have the whole economy up for sale,' he observes, referring to the Treuhand's campaign to sell eastern German enterprises to the private sector. So far the Treuhand - the government's privatisation agency - has managed to offload more than 9,000 former eastern German companies, and there are still nearly 4,000 enterprises left to be privatised. As a result of this unprecedented sell-off, Germans have altered their preconceptions about the buying and selling of companies, Mr Achleitner argues. It has become not just socially acceptable, but essential for this M&amp;A activity to take place, for the good of the German economy as a whole. Moreover, the Treuhand has overcome its initial reluctance to use outside advisers and has become a major source of business for large numbers of investment banks and consultants which otherwise would have found it difficult to find a foothold in Germany. In general, German companies employ external financial advisers in some 20 per cent of all transactions, preferring to rely on either in-house expertise or on their commercial banking contacts. Investment bankers believe that the more familiar their services become in Germany, the more business they will be able to do. They are confident despite a perceptible slowing down in the number and size of transactions done by German companies during the past year. Figures from M&amp;A International, a consulting firm near Frankfurt, show that the number of deals involving German companies fell by 9 per cent from 953 in the first half of 1991 to 843 in the first six months of the current year. Without the impetus of privatisation in the east, it is likely that the number of deals would have been down to the 700 or so recorded in the first six months of 1989 and 1990. Large, spectacular transactions have been thin on the ground this year. The Hoesch/Krupp merger is still to be completed, blocked by a technicality, and Pirelli continues to wrangle with the Continental tyre company in which it holds a 39 per cent stake. Aachener &amp; Munchener Beteiligungs, Germany's second largest insurance company after Allianz, came to an agreement with Assurances Generales de Paris, the large French insurance company which holds a 25 per cent-plus in the German company, but up until recently was not allowed to exercise the votes on its full stake. The role played by advisers in these 'situations' was limited. Krupp devised its highly effective strategy to gain control of Hoesch without the help of an Anglo-American investment bank; Hoesch employed S G Warburg after its days as an independent company were already numbered. Morgan Grenfell - the Deutsche Bank M&amp;A subsidiary - continued to advise Continental. Warburg was advising AMB's management on its defence against AGF, but its strategy was undermined after the insurance company's supervisory board cut a deal with the French, over the heads of the management board. One condition of the agreement was that AGF would help AMB find a buyer for its majority-owned BfG Bank subsidiary, and Morgan Grenfell has landed the role as adviser to shareholders in BfG in current sale negotiations. Many transactions receive little or no publicity, and it is these, less sensational deals which keep investment bankers busy in Germany - and give them hope for the future despite the current slowdown in the economy. There are two distinct target markets: the medium-sized companies which constitute the Mittelstand, and the very large conglomerates which may be persuaded to divest a subsidiary or two in the name of greater efficiency. Some 10,000 small to medium-sized companies account for half Germany's GNP. Many of these companies, built up in the decades since the war, are in difficulties because of the economy, others face the fabled 'succession' problem as young inheritors feel no inclination to take over day-to-day management responsibilities. These pressures mean that an increasing number of Mittelstand companies will come up for sale, providing an opportunity for investment banks, particularly those able to scout abroad for potential buyers. The structure of larger companies, meanwhile, often reflects historical accident and the empire-building tendencies of earlier generations of management - rather than hard thinking about strategic priorities. Nowadays, as market conditions deteriorate and company managers begin to feel pressure from institutional shareholders to perform, large companies have good reason to contemplate spinning-off non-core businesses. Goldman Sachs can point to four big transactions this year when it has advised family shareholders on the sale of their businesses: the best-known is that of Hugo Boss, the menswear group sold to the Italian Marzotto group. Another is the Krantz plant construction company acquired by Deutsche Babcock. It is now working on 24 M&amp;A projects in Germany, of which 20 are sales mandates or divestitures. The Krupp takeover of Hoesch has highlighted that hostile bids can be successful in Germany, although no foreign investment bank has dared risk its domestic contacts by bringing in a foreign and unfriendly bidder for a big German company. Morgan Grenfell in Frankfurt is however advising two large, but identified German companies on defence strategies.</p>

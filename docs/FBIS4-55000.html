			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Brcko, May 7 (TANJUG) -- Commander of the Bosnian  Croat Army in northern Bosnia-Herzegovina confirmed on Saturday  [7 May] that joint Moslem-Croat forces were preparing an attack  on the Serb corridor in the north of this former Yugoslav  republic.    "The Serb corridor through (the region of) Posavina must not  exist and its capture is the only objective of Croats and  Moslems," Djuro Matuzovic, Bosnian Croat force commander for the  area of orasje in northern Bosnia-Herzegovina, told the local  Croatian radio. "If this is not resolved politically, we  soldiers expect an order which we shall carry out," Matuzovic  threatened.    Bosnian Moslems and Croats have lately been concentrating  strong forces towards the Serb town of Brcko which is situated  in the narrowest part of the corridor which links eastern and  western parts of the Bosnian Serb Republic. This was confirmed  on Friday also by two members of the 108th Brigade of the  Bosnian Croat Army, the so-called Croatian Defence Council HVO,  which is deployed in the Posavina region. The two soldiers  deserted and surrendered to Serb units with the explanation that  they did not wish to take part in the upcoming attack on Serbs.    Serb military sources said in Brcko on Saturday that the  Croat soldiers also gave a series of facts which prove that  preparations for a Moslem-Croat offensive in the region of  Posavina were proceeding unabated. According to these men,  machinery and equipment have been massively mobilized from  private enterpreneurs in order to step up the preparations for  the offensive.    Bosnian Moslem Army Commander Rasim Delic also said on May 2  that units under his command were preparing an offensive on  Brcko in order to cut through the Serb corridor. The Serb side  has reached agreement with representatives of the U.N.  Protection Force (UNPROFOR) on the deployment of U.N. observers  in the area of Brcko and offered a truce in that region which it  said its forces would carry out unilaterally even if the Moslems  refused to accept it.    Moslems on Friday called off talks between military  commanders of Bosnian Moslem and Serb forces on a cease-fire on  the Brcko front, which had been scheduled for Saturday.</p>

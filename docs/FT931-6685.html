			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Trotting: Losing money on a Welsh Ben Hur 'NUMBER 13 has come off his legs, pull him down will you Mr Lloyd?' THIS curious instruction can be heard echoing from a tinny loud speaker across the purple heather-tinged hills of the Black Mountains during the spring and summer. It tells you the trotting races are close by. Trotting is a form of driven horse racing, in which the pony pulls 9st 7lbs of driver in a two wheeled sulkie, it is popular with gamblers around the world: but it could not be better set than under the black belly of rain cloud, in rolling mid-Wales. Certainly, if betting is a mug's game and psychiatrists are right when they say gamblers only achieve fulfilment in chucking money away, you may as well be ignorant of the workings of the sport when you do it. For the naive punter, these Welsh meetings, often held on remote farmland sequestered for an afternoon, are almost surreal in their impenetrability. At my first meeting I placed a modest 'Pounds 1 to win' with a bookie whose slip bore the stamp, 'M. O'Hair, Cardigan'. Would that the names of drivers were as distinct. Heats for the Penybont W C I Eggerton Memorial Perpetual Challenge Cup (Heat winners: Pounds 50; second: Pounds 10) included six Davies (three from Merthyr, one each from Newcastle Emlyn, Penybont and Plwmp) five Jones, and three Lloyds. The meetings are run by the Wales and Border Counties Racing Association. The association does not follow what Val Jones, its secretary, calls 'Jockey Club rules'. The British Harness Racing Club, the umbrella body for a more organised version of the sport, is negotiating affiliation with the Jockey Club. It describes the mid-Wales racers as 'flappers' and wants nothing to do with them. At a WBCRA meeting the scene resembles a pocket production of Ben Hur. The tubular framed chariots, seemingly held together by baling twine and silage, churn noisily around the short circuit pressed against the wire which marks out the short course. The drivers - men, women, boys and girls - are penalised or 'pulled down', for allowing their ponies to break out of a trot, which is when they 'come off their legs'. Betting is a haphazard business given the scope for baulking, accidental or otherwise, on the crowded course. Often the on-course bookies will refuse to give odds on a competitor which is considered a certainty - if it finishes first they pay winning bets on the second placed horse. However, I have never seen such a pony win. To add to the difficulty, the drivers need not be tugged around the mile in a sulkie. A lone trotting pony may be saddled in the conventional way, giving the impression that its rider has somehow gatecrashed the event and, unencumbered, has an advantage. Bitter experience has proved otherwise. Staggered starts are used in all the races and the programme shows the majority of competitors to be classified as 'Go' and the remainder owed one, two, three or four seconds depending on their records. To the untutored observer the ponies appear to start and finish in a clump - but not to Colin Davies, commentator and all-round controller, who oversees proceedings from the superior vantage point of a flatbed trailer parked among the rusting Suburu and Lada 4WDs of the spectators. (There are few shiny Landcruisers or Discoveries here and you will find scarcely a Barbour in the sea of sensible tweed beside the track.) Davies provides coded illumination to the punters ('Oh and he is going a good little pony]') and, with the help of an invisible factotum known as Yanto, the on-course supervision. One wonders how Brough Scott would cope with the combined responsibility of judging and commentating on the race, describing the whereabouts of the ambiwlans, organising the drivers as well as coordinating the best turned out pony prize. Apart from the gratification of throwing your money at the bookies and gorging on Welsh lamb burgers, what is the appeal of trotting? 'You get addicted to it,' says Jones. 'There's the thrill of the running and it is so pretty to watch. We find that people will follow one horse from meeting to meeting. Aside from the betting, it is also a lovely family day out.' The mid-Wales trotting season runs from March to late September. A programme of meetings is available from Val Jones, 1, Saint Cynidr Villas, Glasbury on Wye, Hereford, HR3 5NN.

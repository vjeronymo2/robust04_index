			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 18 (XINHUA) -- South Korean President  Kim Yong-sam accepted today a proposal made by Kim Il-song,  president of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK),  to hold an inter-Korean summit aimed at tackling the nuclear  issue on the Korean peninsula.    Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who arrived here  Saturday  [18 June] morning following his four-day private visit to the  DPRK, conveyed DPRK President Kim Il-song's proposal to South  Korean President Kim Yong-sam.    President Kim Yong-sam, upon hearing of Kim Il-song's wish  to  meet with him at any time, anywhere and at an early date without  preconditions, told Carter that he will accept the offer  "without any hesitation," presidential press secretary Chu  Ton-sik told reporters.    Carter conveyed Kim Il-song's verbal message when briefing  the south Korean president on the results of his Pyongyang trip.    Making a quick response to Kim Il-song's suggestion that  "the  earlier the summit came the better it would be," Kim Yong-sam  said that "I myself think that the South-North Korean summit  would be better the earlier it came," Chu quoted the South  Korean president as saying.    Observers here believed that barring some unexpected  developments, the inter-Korean summit is likely to be held in  the near future, for the first time in the half-century of  national division on the Korean peninsula. The venue of the  summit can be either in Seoul, Pyongyang or at a third place.    Officials sources said that South Korea and the DPRK are  expected to begin working-level contacts soon to discuss details  of the planned summit meeting.    Carter's shuttling between Seoul and Pyongyang was a bid to  break the deadlock over the DPRK's controversial nuclear program.</p>

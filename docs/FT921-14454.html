			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Pace of wages convergence in EC will slow, report says HARMONISATION of wages within the EC will slow rather than accelerate during the next 20 years, according to a report by Professor Douglas McWilliams for the research group London Economics, David Goodhart writes. The report, which challenges the conventional wisdom on convergence, also predicts that relative labour costs in Europe will be much more stable during the next 20 years as inflation rates and currencies stabilise. The standard deviation of EC wages, a statistical device to measure the degree of dispersion, is estimated to have fallen from 46 per cent in 1974 to 31 per cent in 1991, but will still be as high as 24 per cent in 2010. Spanish wages in 1970 were 29 per cent of those in Germany and are now 66 per cent, while wages in Italy rose from 42 per cent of the German level to 71 per cent. Professor McWilliams, a Confederation of British Industry economic adviser, concludes: 'An investment decision based on the relative wage costs in 1970 might have looked very different had 1990 relative wage costs been taken into account.' The report predicts that German wages, the highest in the EC, will fall by 10 per cent relative to those in other EC countries as a result of unification. Wages in Greece and Portugal will catch up from 45 per cent and 36 per cent of the EC average to 62 per cent and 57 per cent to 2010. The UK, which has labour costs 12 per cent lower than the EC average because of its low non-wage labour costs, is likely to retain its advantageous position on labour costs virtually unchanged. UK wages are actually 8 per cent higher than the EC average, but non-wage labour costs are well below the average. Germany has the highest hourly labour costs (including both wages and non-wage labour costs) at Dollars 24. Denmark is next with Dollars 20, followed by Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands on Dollars 19, France and the UK on Dollars 16, and Ireland and Spain on Dollars 13. The US and Japan have hourly labour costs of about Dollars 14.50.</p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / The Copenhagen Summit: States fail to meet ideal of openness THE Twelve's proclaimed ideal of a more open and accountable Community made only halting progress at the Copenhagen summit, disappointing the Danish presidency, which had championed the cause of transparency and pioneered the televising of parts of EC Council of Ministers meetings. The Council and the European Commission were enjoined to put in place promised measures on access to EC information and subsidiarity - decision-making at the lowest practicable level - by the end of the year. The Commission wants to give the public right of access to all EC information, except where commercial confidentiality, relations with non-EC countries, privacy, monetary stability or national security would be endangered. However, a row between the member states and the European parliament over categorising sensitive information, and the lack of enthusiasm of members such as the UK, Belgium and Portugal on openness, are holding up the much-vaunted plan for 'a Community close to its citizens'. Countries like the UK and Germany are more interested in subsidiarity, in devolving rather than opening up EC decision-making. 'Nothing is more dangerous for the image of the EC than the impression that it is encroaching on the competence of member states,' Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign minister, told the summit. The Commission is to complete a review of 45,000 pages of EC laws and regulations in the light of subsidiarity by December's Brussels summit, and won praise from the Twelve for 'submitting proposals only when it feels they fulfil the subsidiarity criteria'. But the commitment in the summit's conclusions to provide 'the fullest possible access to information' was the sort of compromise which advertised that there is still a long way to go before the EC as a whole will accept much closer scrutiny of its operations.</p>

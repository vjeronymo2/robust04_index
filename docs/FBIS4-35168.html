			<p>BFN     [Text] On the afternoon of 29 June, 40 members of the  Mexican solidarity group, Go for Cuba, arrived in Cuba together  with representatives of the Spanish State Committee for  Solidarity With Cuba. These organizations have put together a  donation, enroute on the vessel (Frimaro), which includes  approximately 400 tons of oil and 100 tons of food, medicine,  toys, and household items earmarked mainly for Cienfuegos  Province.    The Go for Cuba group is a very active solidarity  organization that has conducted numerous campaigns in support of  Cuba and has openly expressed its support for Cuba and rejection  of the blockade. The visitors will stay in Cuba approximately  seven days and will meet with numerous social and mass  organizations and visit sites of economic, social, and cultural  interest.    On 5 July, the Go for Cuba group will be presented an award  by the Anti-Imperialist Tribunal of Our America for its  solidarity work.</p>

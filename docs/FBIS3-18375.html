			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Oskar Lafontaine, deputy chairman of the </F> Social Democratic Party of Germany, by Einar Koch; place and  date not given: "Lafontaine: `Lower Wages Mean More  Unemployed'"]    [Text] [Koch] The wage dispute in the civil service and  the metal industry is escalating. Is there a threat to social  peace?    [Lafontaine] When it is a question of social peace, nobody  should play with fire. Therefore, reason is required from all  sides -- from both employers and trade unions -- in the  collective negotiations.    Everyone knows that a compromise must be finally achieved.  Therefore, I am appealing to both sides of industry: Return to  the negotiating table. Move your positions closer to one other  and achieve a reasonable compromise!    [Koch] The employers are calling for wage cuts. Will we  reduce unemployment in this way?    [Lafontaine] No. General wage cuts and zero-wage rounds do  not fit into the economic landscape: They would further weaken  private consumption and increase unemployment even more.    After the increase in rates and taxes in the past few years,  the breaking-point has been exceeded for the majority of  employees. Rents are increasing. Some families hardly know any  longer how they are to pay for their children's school outings.    General wage cuts and zero-wage rounds cannot be socially  justified either. They would result in pension cuts for the  first time in 1995.    [Koch] The trade unions are calling for shorter working  hours and the employers want us to work longer hours again....    [Lafontaine] There are 4 million people registered as  unemployed in Germany. Therefore, it is precisely now that we  need collective bargaining policies that are oriented to  employment. This includes a fairer distribution of work and  incomes. In the Volkswagen company, both sides of industry  showed how jobs can be secured and mass dismissals be prevented  by new ways.    Finally, the Federal Government also wants more part-time  work. Some years ago, Kohl still rejected it by calling it  "stupid, absurd, and silly."</p>

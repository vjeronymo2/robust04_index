			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> COURT OPENS WAITING ROOM FOR CHILDREN  </P> <P> Children who have to testify in court will no longer have to spend the day  waiting in a dull room with nothing to do.  </P> <P> After two months of collecting toys and furniture from area donors, the  district attorney's office has given a new look the children's waiting room.  </P> <P> A mural depicting a grassy hillside by the beach, painted by a local artist,  brightens one side of the room, while shelves are brimming with new toys.  </P> <P> "We wanted this to be a place where children wouldn't be afraid to come," said  Kate McGoldrick, director of the district attorney's Victim Services Division.  </P> <P> Last year, more than 1,000 children visited the division in the Government  Center's Hall of Justice in Ventura, McGoldrick said. Many of those children  sought out the Wee Witness Waiting Room on the fourth floor while waiting to  testify in court or before an interview with attorneys, she said.  </P> <P> "It's really important to a child to have a place free from anxiety, especially  when many of those who are here have experienced some sort of violence or  sexual abuse in their home," McGoldrick said.  </P> <P> Since the Victim Services Division announced earlier this year the need to  renovate the scuffed-up waiting room, more than 40 residents, businesses and  community organizations responded with board games, fire trucks, dolls, stuffed  animals and books, she said.  </P> <P> One woman who requested anonymity donated $200 worth of toys after winning the  California Lottery, McGoldrick said. Others provided money for new furniture  and shelves.  </P> <P> "The response from the community has been absolutely tremendous," she said.  CAROLYN KUSKY  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HOME SUPPLY UP; PRICES REMAIN LEVEL  </P> <P> San Diego County housing prices continue to be flat, while the supply of unsold  units keeps piling up, a real estate brokerage group said Tuesday. Economic  uncertainty and growing signs of a recession are being blamed by industry  officials for the local market's increasing sluggishness.  </P> <P> The average price of an existing or resold San Diego-area house in October was  $210,711 -- -- about $100 less than the average price in October, 1989,  according to a survey released Tuesday by the San Diego Board of Realtors. The  trade group's survey is of member-brokered deals in San Diego, Chula Vista, La  Mesa, El Cajon and National City.  </P> <P> Prices of the county's new housing are similarly flat. A new, single-family,  detached house sold for an average price of $258,000 over the three months  ended Sept. 30, up from $250,000 for the corresponding three months in 1989,  said Russell Valone, president of Market Profiles of San Diego, a housing  market research firm.  </P> <P> The price of a new condominium dropped to $168,000 during the third quarter,  from $170,000 over the corresponding period in 1989.  </P> <P> Lower demand caused the supply of unsold existing houses in the San Diego area  to jump to 14,000 in October, a 54% increase over the inventory at the same  time last year, according to the Board of Realtors.  </P> <P> The total of new unsold units in the county's subdivisions totaled 4,000 houses  and condos by the end of September, more than double the 1,900-unit total at  the same time last year, Valone said.  </P> <P> However, the unsold housing inventory still does not constitute a glut, Valone  said, adding that last year's market was "undersupplied." And, with  construction slowing because of the lack of construction financing, the local  housing market could face a shortage next year, he said.  </P> <P> "Right now is a good time to be looking for a new house," Valone said. "We  could be short of product next year."  </P> <P> Fixed-rate mortgages now carry interest rates of 10.25%.  </P></p>

They were  airlifted via Djibouti aboard an Italian Air Force C-130.    Among them was the Italian Consul at Aden Maurizio Pavesi,  who called the situation "relatively peaceful" but said that  while all Italian nationals in South Yemen had been repatriated,  those present in North Yemen had not yet been flown out.  [passage omitted]    "The opposing factions are not attacking civilians and the  fighting generally takes place at night," said Pavesi. "Our  embassy at Sanaa will remain open so that the last Italians in  the country will have a point of reference." [passage omitted]    Consul Pavesi said another military flight was expected to  airlift out another 50 Italians tonight. [passage omitted]</p>

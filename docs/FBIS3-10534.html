			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Attorney General's Office of the Republic [PGR]  today remanded 16 people, including officials of the Baja  California Attorney General's Office and suspected drug  trafficker Higuera Guerrero. They are allegedly responsible for  the shoot-out in Tijuana on Thursday [3 March] during which a  Federal Judicial Police [PJF] commander, his assistant, and  three other people were killed.    Agents of the state judicial police in Baja California, who  were protecting drug traffickers, were responsible for the  shoot-out with members of the PJF in Tijuana. In the shoot-out,  Alejandro Castaneda Andrade, commander of the special group of  the PJF in Tijuana; Salvador Miramontes Torres, agent of the  state judicial police; Rayad Abdul Shedar, a Lebanese-origin  professional criminal working for drug traffickers; and an  unidentified individual were killed and five people were wounded.    Regarding this incident, which occurred on 3 March at Felix  Gomez Street and Diaz Ordaz Boulevard in La Mesa District in  Tijuana, Alfonso Cabrera Morales, deputy attorney general for  districts and subdistricts of the PGR, issued the results of the  investigations. He said the participation of some members of the  state judicial police in the shoot-out has been proven. The  motive for the shoot-out was the fact that the state judicial  policemen were protecting Isamel Higuera Guerrero, alias El  Mayel, a lieutenant of the Arellano Felix brothers, when he was  going to be arrested by the PJF. The state judicial policemen  attacked the PJF members, and in the shoot-out drug trafficker  Ismael Higuera Guerrero was able to escape. He has been  identified as the individual who has inherited control of drug  trafficking in Tijuana as a result of the search for the  Arellano Felix brothers.    Eleven [number as heard] individuals identified as people at  the service of the Baja California Attorney General's Office  have been remanded. These include Sergio Ortiz Lara, deputy  state attorney general [subprocurador de justicia del estado] in  Tijuana, and Juan Carlos Guerrero, agent of the Attorney  General's Office for the court of equity [agente del ministerio  publico del fuero comun]. They are accused of abuse of  authority, aiding the mass escape of prisoners, and crimes  against the administration of justice. They are both free as  they filed amparos when they appeared to make their statements.  Arrest warrants have been issued for five group leaders of the  state judicial police and the operational commander of the  Tijuana municipal police for the same crime [not further  specified].</p>

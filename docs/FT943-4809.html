			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK ahead or alone in Europe (1) Sir, Whenever there is talk of a multi-speed Europe ('Europe at odds over integration', September 3/4) there appears to be an automatic assumption that the UK would be in the slow lane. To examine just two areas where the UK is often labelled a laggard: the UK has implemented more social and employment directives than any other member state, and is the closest to meeting the convergence criteria for Emu. The multi-speed approach is already a fact of European life, and its recognition is a pragmatic response to the challenges of enlargement. It is not the multi-speed approach which threatens the UK, but the danger that one of those speeds might be reverse. Richard Brown, deputy director general, Association of British Chambers of Commerce, 9 Tufton Street, London SW1P 3Q8</p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / People: Non-executive directors David Roberts-Jones has resigned as non-executive director from ALLIANCE RESOURCES, the US-based oil and gas company which has been in administrative receivership since October. Roberts-Jones was the last director remaining from the original board which floated Alliance in 1991. John O'Brien, managing director of Manx Petroleum - which put Alliance into receivership - is chairman of Alliance. An attempt by fellow directors to unseat O'Brien failed last year.</p>

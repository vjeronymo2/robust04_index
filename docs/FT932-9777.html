			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: C&amp;W considers Philippines venture CABLE AND Wireless, the telecommunications group, is considering a Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) joint venture which could give it a prime role in the development of the telephone system in the Philippines. The venture would be the latest in a succession of moves by C&amp;W to establish itself as the leading international telecoms operator in the Asia Pacific region. It already has stakes in two network operators in the Philippines. Other investments in the region include a majority stake in Hong Kong Telecom and a 24.5 per cent share in Optus, the main domestic competitor to Telstra (formerly AOTC) in Australia. The other partners are Australia's Telstra International and Benpres of the Philippines. C&amp;W stressed that at present the partners have agreed only to carry out 'feasibility studies' into the possibility of establishing a new company to expand and modernise the telephone network. Analysts believe prospects for the new company would be bright: with fewer than 1.5 fixed lines per hundred people, the Philippines has one of the lowest levels of line penetration in the region and its government is anxious to extend and update the system. About 40 per cent of the venture will be owned by C&amp;W and Telstra, another 40 per cent by Benpres, and the rest by smaller investors. Mr Andrew Harrington, regional telecoms analyst at Salomon Brothers Hong Kong, said the joint venture was 'typical of the growing trend for governments in the region to seek expertise and investment from overseas telecoms companies to help with their network development. It reinforces C&amp;W's pre-eminent role in the region.'</p>

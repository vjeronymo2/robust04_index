			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; Edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] A spokesman for President Guntis Ulmanis  administration told INTERFAX Wednesday that his visit to Moscow  scheduled for April 20 was postponed for an indefinite period.  The spokesman did not suggest any reason for the postponement.    However, Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs made it clear  addressing a briefing in Riga Tuesday, the reason is the  dissatisfaction of the Latvian side by the explanations  suggested by Russian officials for the Russian president's  decision on the creation of military bases.    (INTERFAX Note: The decision of April 5 spread by the media  said about Russia's intention to create military bases in the  CIS countries and Latvia. Later the document was disavowed by  representatives of the foreign and defense ministries and the  Russian presidential structures as a consequences of a  "technical mistake" or even "provocation")    The Latvian leadership insists that Boris Yeltsin personally  disavow the decision which, by Riga's estimates, comes into  force on April 13. Birkavs said that so far the Latvian  government announces a "moratorium" for the negotiations with  Russia on the conditions of the Russian troops pull-out and  preparations for the signing of relevant treaties. The prime  minister also said there is no need in the current situation to  hold on April 15 a special session of the Latvian parliament  which is to debate the package of Latvian-Russian agreements.    He also said that unless the Russian president withdraw the  above document, Latvia will continue negotiations in no way. If  so, Birkavs said, "Latvia will channel its entire activities  towards the West" to obtain Latvia's stance on the swift and  complete withdrawal of the Russian troops and the repatriation  of the retired officers.    Birkavs said that the first step in this direction had been  made by President Ulmanis who left Sunday for a tour of Denmark,  France and Britain.    Birkavs said that Latvia should make the maximal use of the  situation that shaped up after Yeltsin's decision was made  public, and through further talks to achieve that Russia meet  some additional demands, for example, on repatriation of the  retired officers.    Prime Minister Birkavs will meet April 15 his Estonian  counterpart Mart Laar to, what he described as "work out a  common position at the talks with Russia on the troops pull-out."</p>

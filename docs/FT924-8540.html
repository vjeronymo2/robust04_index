			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / UK Company News: VSEL rises 15.6% to Pounds 25.9m VSEL Consortium, the Barrow-based builder of the Trident nuclear submarines, yesterday reported improved profits as a mounting cash pile led to higher interest earnings. Pre-tax profits increased by 15.6 per cent to Pounds 25.9m in the six months to September 30. This was slightly ahead of market expectations and the shares gained 19p to 488p. Profits increased despite a fall in turnover from Pounds 256m to Pounds 234m. Turnover is set to continue to fall for some years as a result of the company's plan to reduce its workforce from its level of nearly 17,000 three years ago to close to 7,000. This is due to falling defence orders following the end of the cold war and the government's Options for Change defence review. More than Pounds 50m of cash was generated during the period, and net cash in-creased to Pounds 160m. Interest receivable increased from Pounds 4.1m to Pounds 7m. The first Trident submarine, HMS Vanguard, is now 90 per cent complete and is due to be delivered next year. The firm order for the fourth boat was confirmed in July. VSEL is studying a number of approaches from potential buyers of the Cammell Laird yard in Birkenhead, which it put up for sale 18 months ago. Mr Noel Davies, chief executive, said the chances of finding a buyer wanting to continue to build ships were 'petering out'. VSEL's small non-defence businesses, acquired to widen the company's experience, were making progress and recently won contracts worth Pounds 3.5m from British Gas and an oil company. Earnings increased 10 per cent to 44p while the interim dividend is raised 12.5 per cent to 9p. COMMENT VSEL's obvious weaknesses mean it is never likely to be a stock market favourite. It is a defence stock with a single customer, the Ministry of Defence, and it builds environmentally unfriendly nuclear submarines. But management seems to be succeeding in its awesome task of reducing the workforce by more than half, and telling workers in advance, without ruining the motivation of those who remain. Despite murmurs of further defence cuts in the Autumn State-ment, Trident must be safe and the second batch of Trafalgar submarines, where the contracts will not be awarded before 1994, are still too far out to offer any cost savings. Forecast profits this year of Pounds 54m put the shares on just over 5 times, with a yield of close to 8. VSEL's cash-flow, and the fact that most of the profits from Trident are yet to come, suggest the dividend is more than safe and make the shares an interesting option for income funds.</p>

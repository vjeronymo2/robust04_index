			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA TRENDS: DEUKMEJIAN CHANGES VIEW ON HOUSING AID  </P> <P> When it comes to housing, there's the new George Deukmejian and there's the old  George Deukmejian.  </P> <P> In a bitter legislative battle in 1973, Deukmejian the assemblyman led the  fight to oppose the creation of the California Housing Finance Agency (CHFA),  which today offers discount mortgages to low- and middle-income families.  </P> <P> That was the old Deukmejian.  </P> <P> Sixteen years later, the new Deukmejian pushed through a major first-time home  buyer package that is expected to increase CHFA's funding by $1 billion in the  next several years.  </P> <P> When Edmund G. Brown Jr. was governor, the state housing department was riding  roughshod over local elected officials who didn't want affordable housing.  After the 1982 election, Deukmejian's transition team vowed that the state  would no longer punish local government for shunning affordable housing.  </P> <P> That was the old Deukmejian.  </P> <P> The new Deukmejian signed a bill 10 days ago that forces local government to  accept low-cost housing developments even when residents in the area don't want  it.  </P> <P> The old Deukmejian vetoed numerous housing bills during his first term as  governor. The new Deukmejian signed bond measures in his second term that  amount to $950 million for affordable housing programs. The funds provide  relief for homeless people, low-income renters and first-time buyers.  </P> <P> The old Deukmejian rarely whispered a peep about the problems of high housing  costs. In the last six months, the new Deukmejian has "jawboned about the issue  more than any governor in recent memory," lobbyist David Booher said.  </P> <P> Deukmejian's transformation on housing is mysterious and subject to various  interpretations. (Deukmejian did not respond to requests to be interviewed for  this column.)  </P> <P> Critics charge that Deukmejian's new-found interest in housing was inspired by  pressure from Republican legislators who were concerned that Democrats would  make the problem of high housing costs an issue in this year's elections.  </P> <P> Supporters say politics had nothing to do with it.  </P> <P> In the aftermath of the federal government's retreat from expensive national  housing subsidy programs, state officials all over the country struggled to  figure out their role on housing. The argument goes that Deukmejian's shift in  policy is a function of that learning curve.  </P> <P> "I don't know of any state that jumped into that void as aggressively as  California," said Maureen Higgins, Deukmejian's housing chief. "And it happened  under Deukmejian's watch."  </P> <P> One explanation for the governor's metamorphosis is that the housing issue has  changed.  </P> <P> "The governor and his key staff people began to understand the linkages between  jobs, housing and the state's economic development," said Newport Beach  planning consultant Susan DeSantis.  </P> <P> "They recognize that without affordable housing, the economy suffers," said  DeSantis who served as Deukmejian's first housing administrator.  </P> <P> The implication is that Deukmejian was uncomfortable with the issue when the  housing problem was cast solely as a social welfare matter.  </P> <P> This may explain why low-income housing advocates have never warmed up to  Deukmejian. They say that he begrudgingly signed housing bond measures and that  his $2-billion home-buyer program serves yuppies who don't need relief.  </P> <P> "Low-income housing advocates had so effectively characterized Deukmejian as  being anti-housing that he was never able to recover from that image, which was  undeserved in my opinion," said housing consultant Ward Connerly.  </P> <P> One explanation for why Deukmejian signed the low-cost housing measure is that  a broad coalition of church groups, real estate interests and business leaders  got behind the bill.  </P> <P> The issue of low-cost housing had gone beyond the question of poor people's  rights. It had become a mainstream issue -- a political plateau that most  politicians, including Deukmejian, are more comfortable with.  </P> <P> * CAMPAIGN PROMISES: What pledges are Dianne Feinstein and Pete Wilson making  to California business?

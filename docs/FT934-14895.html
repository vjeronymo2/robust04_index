			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Unilever The 1.6 per cent bounce in Unilever's shares yesterday in response to perky sales predictions from Procter &amp; Gamble provides another illustration of how closely UK consumer product stocks have shadowed their US peers this year. The rekindling of positive sentiment towards the US soap suds industry was strong enough to over-ride worries that P&amp;G's gains were being made at Unilever's expense. The striking correlation in share price performance between the two sectors is puzzling, however, given that none appeared to exist in the 1980s. Marlboro Friday has set the tone for both markets. Talk of the food industry's long-term secular decline has spread in New York and London. Both national sectors have suffered in common as defensive stocks have fallen out of fashion. Both, too, have faced similar problems with sluggish recovery, rampant retailers, and the turn of the margin cycle. Attention on both sides of the Atlantic is focusing on those companies which can evade such pressures by generating sustainable earnings in emerging markets. Both Nestle and Unilever are well placed to benefit from this perception. The challenge for both will be to stabilise margins in Europe and the US while driving growth elsewhere. As the industrial heir to two colonial empires, the Anglo-Dutch company may have a particular historical advantage. Nestle, though, has been driving especially hard in the Far East.</p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Japan and US edge towards trade pact US and Japanese trade negotiators yesterday headed into a final day of talks to open Japan's markets to US goods and services, having achieved 'big progress' on government procurement. A Japanese trade official in Washington said only one or two issues were outstanding in the dispute over Japanese government purchases of telecommunications and medical equipment. He said these could be settled with the help of Mr Yohei Kono, Japan's foreign minister, who arrived in Washington yesterday afternoon. Agreement was also near on US access to Japan's insurance market. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, said: 'There is much yet to be done.' A Tokyo news report saying that the US and Japan had reached a deal on procurement helped the dollar climb briefly above Y99 yesterday, but official denials later wiped out some of the US currency's gains. It closed in London at Y98.97, up from Thursday's close of Y98.505. Rumours of a deal helped the London equity market, which closed 33.8 points up at 3,026.3, also boosted by reports of a Pounds 100m buying programme from an investment bank. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 11.44 points lower at 3,843.19. However, US and Japanese negotiators have been pessimistic about reaching a deal on cars and car parts. If no vehicle deal is reached, the US is expected to list car parts and flat glass as posing a barrier to US trade. World stocks, Page 19 Lex, Page 22</p>

This is part of the effort by Chinese scientists in recent  years to develop farm products and technology, invigorate the  country's agriculture and bolster the economy's growth.    Great achievements have been made in fertilizers,  pesticides,  breeding of crops and domestic animals, and processing and  storage of farm products.    Changes in farm patterns, economic structures and  development  modes, as well as in the thinking of farmers, are all attributed  to the development in technology.    Figures from a government department show that about 16.8  percent of the country's total scientific awards at national  level last year were given to research projects in agriculture,  stock raising and the fishing industry.    These projects not only help tackle the technical problems  in  agricultural production, but also contribute to bettering  people's life in rural areas.    In east China, over 1,000 scientists from more than 100  different bodies have been involved in a development and  research project to deal with the problem of low production in  the plains of the Yellow, Huaihe and Haihe Rivers.    In the past eight years, some 81 of the 134 results they  have  achieved have been put into use. In some experimental areas,  the annual grain output reached 15,000 kilograms per hectare.</p>

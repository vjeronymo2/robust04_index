			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / 1963: scandal and an ailing 'Supermac': Official documents released yesterday under disclosure rules shed light on cabinet machinations of 30 years ago The year 1963 is often characterised as one when the government seemed to be running out of steam - even before it was rocked by the Profumo scandal. Harold Macmillan's Supermac image looked increasingly jaded as the government stumbled from spy scandals to the French veto on its bid to join the European Economic Community. Before the end of 1963 the ailing Macmillan had been replaced as prime minister by Sir Alec Douglas-Home, who lost the following year's general election to Labour. The year is remembered by many for the assassination of President Kennedy and the great train robbery. But cabinet documents for 1963, released yesterday at the Public Record Office - under the rule that they should normally be made public after 30 years - contradict the image of a government that had gone stale. The final months of the Macmillan years saw a strikingly busy and varied programme of government activity. Ministers approved the Beeching plan which led to heavy cuts in the British Rail network and, with the Buchanan report, took the first steps towards recognising that unrestrained traffic growth in towns could not continue for ever. In spite of the French veto on Britain's application to join the EEC, the cabinet discussed building the Channel tunnel. Thirty years later the tunnel is built but, perhaps happily, another potential project of the era is not. The Macmillan cabinet had ideas for demolishing the Foreign Office in Whitehall, possibly replacing it with a structure of 'fully contemporary design'. At the end of 1963 Reginald Maudling, the chancellor, produced a public spending white paper - the process of relating public spending plans to resources in a co-ordinated way was in its infancy then. Total public expenditure was less than Pounds 11bn, about one-third of today's health budget, but arguments over controlling its growth would be familiar to the present cabinet. Sir Edward Boyle, the education minister, proposed increasing the charge for school meals from 1s to 1s 3d (about 6p): 'I cannot see any obvious justification for allowing people to receive, quite irrespective of their needs, automatic increases in a cash subsidy at a time when real earnings have risen substantially.' School meals were discussed at no fewer than four cabinet meetings before ministers decided against the increase. The future of former colonies took much of the cabinet's time, and 1963 included the celebrated extradition case of Chief Anthony Enahoro, a prominent Nigerian accused of plotting a coup d'etat, who was arrested in London. The papers released today show that Mr Henry Brooke, the home secretary, originally decided against returning Enahoro to Nigeria. This was strongly resisted by Mr Duncan Sandys, Commonwealth secretary, who argued that loss of the Nigerian government's sympathy and goodwill would represent a serious diplomatic reverse for Britain. 'I fully appreciate the home secretary's difficulty,' wrote Sandys, 'but when so much is at stake I trust that every effort will be made to find a honourable justification for sending Enahoro back to Nigeria.' Enahoro was subsequently extradited and sentenced to 15 years imprisonment.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Chinese Embassy Counselor Nie Haiqing told our  correspondent yesterday that the state of investment by Thai  entrepreneurs in China is relatively good. They invested a lot  in China last year. Some investment projects are still under  discussion. For example, Anan Panyarachun, former prime  minister and now president of the Saha Union Group, is  negotiating with China to form joint ventures to set up  electricity generating plants in Tianjin and Zhuozhou in Hebei  Province. He said that China was encouraging the kind of  investments proposed by Anan Panyarachun. China welcomes  investment in such infrastructure projects as power plants,  highways, and ports.    He said that Thai entrepreneurs had achieved good results  from their investments in China. The Zhengda Group [Charoen  Phokhaphan Group] has already invested in 26 [as published]  provinces.    Asked whether or not the recent visit to Thailand by  Taiwan's  Li Teng-hui will affect Thai-Chinese economic relations, the  Chinese commercial counselor said there would be no impact. The  investment atmosphere in China is good; entrepreneurs invest in  areas that have a favorable investment atmosphere. In business  circles, businessmen will not get involved in politics. So he  believes that the visit will not affect investment activities  between the two countries.    He said that China has a population of 1.2 billion people, a  vast market for products.</p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Burn Stewart ahead to Pounds 4.3m BURN STEWART Distillers, the Scotch whisky producer, reported a first half of 'difficult trading' with persistent pressure on prices in both UK and export markets. Pre-tax profits for the six months to December 31 increased 7.5 per cent to Pounds 4.3m due to a halving of interest charges to Pounds 700,000. Higher volume sales pushed turnover to Pounds 20.2m (Pounds 19.4m) but operating profit declined from Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 5m as a result of lower average prices. Volume sales of bulk whisky increased some 18 per cent but prices were 7.9 per cent lower; bottled sales rose 11.1 per cent but prices declined 1.6 per cent. Mr Bill Thornton, chairman, said: 'The pressure on pricing which was evident last year has continued into 1993 and will remain a major issue throughout this year.' Earnings per share fell from 6.1p to 4.9p due to the issue of new shares at the time of the company's flotation in November 1991. A maiden interim dividend of 1.7p is declared. The value of the company's whisky stocks increased from Pounds 41.8m to Pounds 54.4m with a significant purchase of matured whiskies to meet forecast requirements. Export initiatives were being pursued in the US and China, and new distribution arrangements were now in place for the company's brands in a number of other countries.</p>

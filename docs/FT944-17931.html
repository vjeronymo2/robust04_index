			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Swiss set for steady growth Switzerland's gross domestic product is expected to rise 1.5 per cent in 1994 and growth is forecast to accelerate to 2.5 per cent in 1995, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology's centre for economic research said. The centre forecast growth for 1996 of 2.7 per cent. The Swiss economy started to recover in the third quarter of 1993, with demand for exports and private consumption picking up appreciably. The report also forecast that consumer prices, which rose an average of 3.3 per cent in 1993, will increase 0.9 per cent in 1994, but jump to 2.7 per cent in 1995, because of the introduction of a value-added tax on January 1. The report estimated that VAT would add about 1.3 per cent to the consumer price index in 1995. On the unemployment front, however, the report forecast only a gradual decline in the country's jobless rate. It said unemployment, which will rise from 4.5 per cent to 4.7 per cent in 1994, will ease to 4.2 per cent in 1995.</p>

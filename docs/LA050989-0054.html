			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ORTMAYER'S NOT BOTHERED BY BEATHARD'S AVAILABILITY  </P> <P> "No," said Steve Ortmayer, Chargers' director of football operations, he's not  bothered by Charger owner Alex Spanos' interest in Washington Redskins general  manager Bobby Beathard. Beathard's resignation will become official May 31.  </P> <P> Friday night, Spanos said the Chargers would attempt to hire Beathard, who  helped guide the Redskins to two Super Bowl victories in seven seasons.  Beathard owns a home in Leucadia and his parents live in Oceanside.  </P> <P> "It's inappropriate to talk about it, because Bobby's under contract to the  Redskins," Ortmayer said. "And even though he's indicated that he's not going  to be back, he's still under contract to the Redskins.  </P> <P> "The only other thing that I would say is that we've already expressed an  interested in upgrading our team and our club in any way that we can and we  will explore every avenue we can to do that."  </P> <P> Neither Ortmayer nor Spanos has said what capacity Beathard would fill if he  joined the Chargers. Basically, Ortmayer and Beathard do the same job. Beathard  has said he wants to take some time off to spend with his family after his  resignation becomes official. BRIAN HEWITT  </P></p>

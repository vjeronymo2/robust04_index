			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEBATE OVER RAIL LINES  </P> <P> In reading your article regarding transit ("Rail Lines Offered for Sale Are  Focus of Transit Debate," by Ronald Taylor, Metro, July 18), I couldn't help  but notice the comments of Westwood resident Steve Kunin.  </P> <P> If he doesn't believe we should use existing rights of way for rail  transportation, what does he propose we do about the congestion on our  freeways, surface streets and neighborhoods? We got rid of the old rail system  to, among other things, build more freeways and that "solution" has run its  course.  </P> <P> In stating that rail transit isn't needed, he is ignoring the cheapest, most  convenient alternative to a congestion problem the rest of us believe exists.  </P> <P> Steve, maybe the next time you are stuck in traffic along Santa Monica  Boulevard Westwood you could look down between the medians that separate the  street. It may be hard to believe but at one time those rails carried scores of  passengers from the Eastside to the Westside and beyond.  </P> <P> If the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission is allowed to purchase  these rights of way, maybe we can someday ride that line and others like it  again.  </P> <P> NICK SANTANGELO  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

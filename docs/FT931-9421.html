			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Minding Your Own Business: My first taste of an Apple - David Carter finds that there is an accounting alternative to PC 'DEAR Mr Carter, I have read your column for several months with interest. You have constantly been selling the Apple 'Macintosh' philosophy, but don't seem to appreciate the fact. I think it is about time you were indoctrinated. Why don't you come round to our offices and bring yourself up to date?' THE cheeky fellow who sent this letter turned out to be one John Byrom, a Macintosh dealer. But really, what else would one expect from these Apple people? Throughout the world the IBM-compatible PC is standard, but there remains that group of Apple users - 'creative' types, juveniles, people in advertising, people who wear bow ties - in short, people who are not entirely serious. I would be the first to admit that there is a need for computers to design advertisements or produce Sunday colour supplements, and I am sure that the Macintosh does this sort of thing extremely well, but if you are talking about real computing, about number-crunching, about using a computer to manage your whole business, well, I believe that a PC is the machine to get. I am a broad-minded fellow and his office happened to be just next door to a client of mine, so I agreed to pop in. Like most PC users I knew next to nothing about Macs. However, as I was to learn, Apple dealers have one or two sneaky tricks up their sleeves. The first is always to demonstrate on an impressive 22 inch wide screen. One irritating restriction of PCs is that the standard 14 in screen can only display 80 columns at a time. Any PC user who has used a spreadsheet to produce an annual budget will know that it is impossible to squeeze all 12 months on to one screen and see the overall picture. The wide-screen Mac uses a GUI ('graphical user interface') and had no problem displaying all 12 months of an Excel spreadsheet. The DOS 80 column restriction is also a problem for designers of invoicing and order processing systems. I saw a package called Astra which uses the wider screen to show effortlessly all the information an order clerk might need. In spite of one or two limitations - for example you cannot buy stock in outers and sell in inners - Astra on a 22 inch screen Macintosh is essential viewing for any company looking to install an interactive order processing system such as telesales. Not bad. I admit I was getting interested. But the real eye opener was an accounts package called 'Mind Your Own Business'. Quite simply, this is the best accounts package I have seen. As I worked my way through it a host of common design problems were solved with a sophistication and an elegance that had me purring. MYOB is so sophisticated that you have to keep your wits about you. I expressed surprise that the only way I could find to enter a credit note was as a minus invoice. The designers gently set me to rights. MYOB has an 'auto-reverse facility' for any transaction. You do not have to key in credit notes at all; you simply call up onto the screen the invoice you want to cancel, apply auto-reverse, and hey presto, MYOB generates the credit note for you automatically. As I was to find, accounts packages on the Mac are generally of a high standard with their own distinctive 'tradition'. PC accounts packages tend to be formal and designed for accountants, whereas Mac packages are designed to help the people who are actually running the company. Cashflow forecasts, proper analysis of purchases, 'diaries' which summarise what action you need to take today are common in Mac packages but still unusual in the PC world. Using the Mac is a pleasure too. Whereas Windows accounts packages often seem painfully slow, the snappy response times of the Mac feel natural and 'right'. So are there any drawbacks to the Mac? Yes there are. The central problem affecting all GUI-based accounting packages remains - data entry is awkward and slow. Keying a batch of invoices into a GUI package will take 20 or 30 per cent longer than into a traditional package. Mac developers have tried to alleviate the problem, but really it is up to Apple to redesign their interface so that data entry under a GUI is at least as efficient as under a traditional system. When they have, the GUI will become industry-standard, but until then Mac packages can only be recommended for interactive applications or where the volume of transactions is relatively light. In most small businesses the volume of transactions usually is relatively light, and a professional company which buys, for example, a Macintosh LC II together with Claris Works and Mind Your Own Business, is getting one of the classiest combinations of hardware and software on the market. So take a bow, John Byrom. You have more than proved your point. The Macintosh is indeed a serious business contender and some of the most exciting and innovative work in accounting software these days is being done on the Mac. I hope to be reviewing some of it in future columns. John Byrom's company The Training Department specialises in the installation, training and support of Apple accounting packages.

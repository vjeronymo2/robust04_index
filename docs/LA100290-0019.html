			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'JACKSON': THAT RARE SHOW WITH A POINT OF VIEW;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: THOUGH THE HOST IS STILL OVERBEARING, 'JESSE JACKSON' BRINGS FRESH  EYES AND NEW ISSUES TO PUBLIC-AFFAIRS PROGRAMMING.  </P> <P> The Rev. Jesse Jackson is better at using the camera than talking to it.  </P> <P> Yet his new weekly series airing at 5 p.m. Sundays on KCAL Channel 9 -- and  named, of all things, "Jesse Jackson" -- ranks among the most important  additions to television in years.  </P> <P> Not because Jackson has sharpened his enunciation. On the contrary, for someone  known for swaying crowds with fiery oratory, he often slurs his words so badly  that it takes all your concentration just to understand what he's saying.  </P> <P> Not because he's skilled at interviewing and leading panel discussions. He  isn't, as evidenced by Sunday's taped premiere, which focused almost entirely  on the status of North American Indians.  </P> <P> Not because his syndicated series is silky smooth. It has kinks galore,  including an eclectic audience that didn't participate in Sunday's show or even  make a sound. It was nothing more than a multiracial backdrop, a prop.  </P> <P> Not because he totally sheds his self-serving, personal-puffery cloak. He said  Sunday that the Mohawks protesting plans for a golf course on their ancient  burial grounds in Oka, Quebec, "invited us there to hear their story." So . . .  </P> <P> Cut to Jackson being refused entry to the area by Canadian troops. Cut to  Jackson holding an impromptu press conference there. Cut to Jackson visiting a  Mohawk "survivor school." Cut to Jackson receiving a sweat shirt from the  Mohawks. Cut to Jackson making a speech to them. Cut to Jackson with Canada's  Indian minister, who tells Jackson that he warned the local mayor "not to go  ahead with the golf course." Was the story the Mohawks' protest . . . or  Jackson?  </P> <P> What gives "Jesse Jackson" so much promise is obviously none of the above. What  you love about it are its fresh eyes.  </P> <P> It's Jackson the reformer, not Jackson the performer, who stars here. Thanks to  him, this show swims against the TV mainstream by giving voice to the voiceless  in a medium known for its narrow range of opinion in news and public-affairs  programs.  </P> <P> Just think about it. Rarely do Indians get more than sound bites. But on  Sunday, they got almost the entire hour, including a 15-minute package in which  Indian activist Russell Means (who led the Wounded Knee uprising in South  Dakota in 1973) visited three reservations where Indians in the United States  were said to be facing problems similar to those in Oka.  </P> <P> Hearing the Earth described by American Indians as "our mother" puts many of  their conflicts with whites in context, and these visual essays with Means were  an eloquent expression of the Indian outlook.  </P> <P> Next came Jackson leading a panel discussion that included a treaties attorney,  Means and two other Indian leaders. The federal Bureau of Indian Affairs  declined to participate, he said.  </P> <P> In light of this, and the discussion's strong tilt, Jackson should have been a  better devil's advocate. Yet "Jesse Jackson" is intended to have a point of  view, and the Indian views expressed here -- charges ranging from whites  trampling on Indian rights to institutionalized stereotyping -- are valid ones  generally excluded from TV.  </P> <P> Even with its flaws, "Jesse Jackson" promises to be strikingly distinctive and  valuable, affirming this time that there's more than one civil rights struggle  in the U.S.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vadim Yuryev: "We Have Been Offered U.S. Army </F> Know-How"]    [Text] Frederick Shapu, executive of the American  company ICT Group, has brought good news from Los Angeles to  Novosibirsk: Conversion is also under way at military plants in  the United States; of course, it causes many problems of all  kinds. Well, perhaps they are not as serious as here, but  nonetheless it is a pleasure.    Since production at the defense enterprises in America is  being cut back sharply, they are looking for new clients.  Frederick Shapu decided to take advantage of the moment. Just a  few months ago, the U.S. Department of Defense declassified its  technological developments in the area of digital, that is,  wireless telephone communications. Incidentally, they have been  used for a long time in the U.S. Army, but their use was  forbidden for civilian purposes. Such an opportunity has now  appeared. So Shapu flew to Novosibirsk in order to propose his  investment project to develop the same system of  telecommunications here. In his words, the ICT Group company is  in a position to free us of virtually all communication wires  and cables: Telephones, TV channels, and faxes will all be  digital.    In discussing the potential of his company, Frederick Shapu  emphasized the following. First, he said, this is not just  another toy for the rich: For example, the installation of a  digital telephone will cost a client no more than the  installation of a regular telephone. However, the quality of  communications will be absolutely incomparable. Second, local  enterprises would manufacture the equipment; that is to say, new  jobs will appear here. This is to say nothing about Novosibirsk  not being required to make any financial outlays--he will invest  the money.    I do not know if everything is indeed as lucrative as Shapu  says, but the oblast administration undertook to work on the  proposal of the American businessman with local enterprises. If  they turn down this scheme, for some reason, another proposal  may very well be made by the American workers of military  plants: Russian proletarians, let us unite!</p>

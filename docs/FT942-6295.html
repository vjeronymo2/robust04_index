			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / International Company News: Inco agrees terms of settlement with unions Inco, the western world's biggest nickel producer, has signed a tentative three-year labour contract with almost 5,000 workers at its Ontario operations, averting a strike which was due to begin tonight. Uncertainty about the outcome of the contract talks has helped fuel a strong rise in nickel prices this year. But news of the settlement pushed Inco's share price down by 75 cents to CDollars 36 in early trading on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday. Members of the United Steelworkers of America union are due to vote on the agreement today, and union leaders have urged them to accept the terms. The settlement provides for no wage increases over the next three years. However, a union official said that Inco has offered to maintain cost-of-living increases and a bonus scheme which begins to operate when nickel prices rise above USDollars 3.35 a lb. Pensions have also been raised by a maximum of CDollars 300 a month for workers with 30 years' service. 'It's not a great collective agreement but with the recessionary times we're in, it's one we can sell to our members,' the official said.</p>

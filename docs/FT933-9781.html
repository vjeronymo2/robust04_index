			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Increased activity in Tesco THE MARKET tussle over Tesco gained momentum yesterday as Goldman Sachs and UBS added their weight to the view that the stock has been oversold and that the company's latest marketing strategy marks a welcome initiative in an intensely competitive sector. However, the many bears of the sector were still out in force and the stock slipped after an initial strong surge, ending the session 5 ahead at 214p. Turnover was a hefty 7.8m shares. Tesco's 'Value' line strategy, a new line of own-label brands, was launched this week and has raised some fears of a new price war as other retailers react to any further squeeze on margins. Goldman's Mr Philip Dorgan dismissed any notion of a new price war. 'No company will start a price war because no one can win,' he said. He added that Tesco was at a discount to the market of over 30 per cent and that any downside was limited whereas the potential upside was susbtantial. UBS, the house broker, was also reiterating its positive stance on the stock yesterday. Credit Lyonnais Laing had set the ball rolling on Thursday. Analysts said that they hoped the new Tesco initiative marked fresh thinking by the management which some in the market have criticised for being uninspired. Meanwhile, BZW was continuing to underline its caution towards the entire food retailing sector, advising clients to stay 'underweight'. While welcoming the Tesco strategy to reposition itself in the market, the broker warned that a response from its competitors, in particular Argyll and J Sainsbury, could not be ruled out. Argyll shares were a half-penny better at 329p and Sainsbury slipped 2 to 471p.</p>

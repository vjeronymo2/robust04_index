			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WEST TORRANCE GIRLS BEAT JITTERS, THEN BISHOP MONTGOMERY, 75-61  </P> <P> Going into Saturday night's Southern Section 4-A girls basketball semifinals,  West Torrance High clearly had an edge in experience over Bishop Montgomery.  </P> <P> The Warriors had six seniors, including three starters.  </P> <P> The Knights had only one senior, their starting lineup included a freshman.  </P> <P> But as Bishop Montgomery took a 16-14 lead at the end of the first quarter, it  was West that was suffering from big-game pressure, according to the Warriors'  leading scorer, guard Rosa Olloque.  </P> <P> But the rest of the game was a different story. Olloque, who scored 25 points,  led West (23-4) to a 75-61 win.  </P> <P> "I was a little nervous before the game," admitted Olloque, who had only five  first-quarter points.  </P> <P> She was at her best when it counted the most, though. Olloque scored 17  second-half points, including 12 in the fourth quarter, when she went 5 for 5  from the floor.  </P> <P> The Knights (17-10) were led by freshman Natalie Graham's game-high 27 points.  </P> <P> A Graham free throw gave Bishop Montgomery its last lead of the game at 19-18  with 4:55 left in the second quarter. The Warriors followed with an 8-0 run,  capped by Olloque's driving layup.  </P> <P> The Warriors led 31-28 at the half and 51-38 after three quarters.  </P> <P> Senior forward Mary Litzenberg added 19 points and nine rebounds for the West  Torrance. Carolyn Sumida came off the bench to add 10 points.  </P> <P> The Knights' last gasp was a three-point play by Mirlen Martinez that cut the  lead to 58-51. But they never got any closer, and West made seven free throws  in the last 1:21 to seal the win. DAVID RAATZ  </P></p>

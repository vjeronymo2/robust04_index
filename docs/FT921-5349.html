			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Management: The multinational myth explodes - A controversial theory which sets out to re-write conventional wisdom Managers and politicians take note. The term 'multinational company' has become so embedded in our business language over the last 30 years that few people now question what it signifies. But they should, for it is either meaningless, misleading, or both. You can certainly forget everything you have read about the emergence of 'stateless' corporations with their activities spread in balanced fashion across a 'borderless world'. Contrary to the new conventional wisdom, such enterprises do not exist: with a handful of exceptions, so-called 'multinational', 'global' and 'transnational' companies are merely national entities with foreign operations. This is the controversial thesis of Yao-Su Hu, an ex-World Bank economist who combines his vice-presidency of a Hong Kong college with visiting professorships at Sussex University and Henley. In arguing his case, Hu may be stretching a point or two. He also makes a few factual errors. But, in direction if not in degree, his argument is closer to the truth than most 'multinational' companies would admit. Writing in the issue of the California Management Review which is about to be published, Hu argues that there are precious few real multinationals. At the very furthest stretch of his definition, they include ICI, Nestle, ABB, Shell and Unilever - though he says the last three should be classed as 'binational'. Hu's argument has several strands. Geographic spread and scope. Most so-called multinationals - such as General Motors, Du Pont, and US General Electric - have less than half their operations and employees abroad. The only ones which do are British companies such as ICI, plus some from smaller European nations. But, just as home country economics and politics are of overwhelming importance to GM and co, so they are to ICI: the company 'owes more loyalty' to the UK than to any other country. ICI's case is typical of most 'multinationals', claims Hu. Ownership and control. At the level of the parent company, these remain heavily national (or binational), rather than multinational - however much the company may strive to attract foreign shareholders and stress 'good citizenship' within its various host nations. People. Foreigners usually occupy a 'minuscule' fraction of the most senior positions in top management - much lower than the percentage of foreigners in the total number of employees. The national character of top management is especially pronounced in Japanese companies. Legal nationality and taxation. In law, there is no such thing as a multinational or global company. So the multinational is exposed to many jurisdictions around the world. But it usually has a home government and a home tax authority - that is, a legal and a fiscal nationality that matter to it more than others. In many cases, the home government can choose to tax it on its worldwide earnings. Hu then assesses the various implications of all this. First, the primary source of a company's international competitive advantage lies in its home nation, he argues. Foreign sources can supplement national ones but not replace them. Even Nestle, with 95 per cent or more of its assets and employees outside Switzerland, gains considerable advantage from being perceived as Swiss. Moreover, most 'multinationals' for which data are available do the bulk of their research and development in the home nation: both IBM and Du Pont, for example, have a higher proportion of R&amp;D personnel at home than their domestic ratio of total employees and assets. The nation where the bulk of a company's R&amp;D takes place is where strategic and integrated decisions can be taken rapidly, Hu says. It is its 'locomotive'. Second, Hu concludes that his analysis demolishes Robert Reich's highly influential 'Who is Us?' article in the Harvard Business Review two years ago. This claimed that foreign (especially Japanese) companies which undertake manufacturing in the US - and, in some cases research, design and development as well - may be more 'American' than American companies with international operations. In this part of his argument, Hu is certainly correct. On the other hand, he vastly underrates the significance to a company, and to the nations concerned, of a divisional headquarters being transferred away from the home base. Where that division is given a global mandate, the parent company - or at least part of it - does justify the epithet 'transnational' that has begun to be applied to it. IBM, Unilever, and ABB can all rightly claim this status. Nor does Hu recognise that a few companies are starting at least to try to disperse various corporate head office activities around the world. This trend, albeit nascent, is another way of becoming 'transnational'. Hu also underestimates the growing proportion of non-home nation managers at senior levels in many multinationals, especially European ones but also some American. The article contains a few erroneous assertions, such as that multinationals almost always account internally in their home currency and that the citizens and institutions of host nations cannot participate directly in the ownership of multinationals' local subsidiaries. (What about Shell's many local minority stakes around the world?). But, apart from such deviations, and the tone of exaggeration that runs through his article (just like Reich's), Hu's basic drift is correct. An image of multinationalism, globalism or 'borderlessness' can do wonders for a company's public relations, especially for an emergent Japanese enterprise faced with western suspicion. But there is almost always less to the image than meets the eye. The substance may gradually catch up with the image, but only over the next 30 years. Meanwhile, Hu has his feet reasonably well rooted in today's reality. By comparison, Reich is a hopeful time traveller trying to shift the distant future into the present.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 ICI: THE SHAPE OF A TRUE 'MULTINATIONAL'?  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                Per cent of total  Per cent of total  Per cent of total             net operating assets*   employees**        turnover**  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK (Home base)      43.9              40.1              20.8 Overseas operations of which:           56.1              59.9              79.2 Continental Europe  16.6              14.0              25.8 The Americas        23.4              24.1              30.7 Asia/Pacific        13.6              12.8              17.2 Other countries      2.4               9.0               5.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * 1990  ** 1991  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (30): International investors stay wary - The stock exchange is undergoing important changes Few people were happier with the outcome of South Africa's elections than the country's stockbroking community. While market players may be used to life on a roller coaster, investing in South African financial markets in the run-up to April's poll at times seemed more akin to bungee jumping. In rapid succession, the market rose, fell, and rose again, almost entirely focusing on political sentiment rather than economic fundamentals. To make matters worse, the renewed volatility came after an excellent year for the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. In 1993, it seemed that little could go wrong for the market as the overall index increased 50.1 per cent and net foreign purchases reached R2.8bn in the year to February 1994 after years of disinvestment. Highlighting the return to favour of the South African market in the international arena was the creation of several investment funds targeting South African equities, bringing hundreds of millions of dollars into the market. But in March and April, responding to fears of civil war, foreigners beat a mass retreat, becoming net sellers once more. The result was soaring gilt yields, a sinking stock market and a plummeting currency. The combination, which shifted almost daily, was wearing. 'It was like being in a ring with Mike Tyson every day,' reminisces one not very nostalgic broker. Following the successful and remarkably peaceful elections, however, local investors have returned to the market to pre-empt the expected flood of new international fund money. After South Africa was included in the International Finance Corporation's global index with a hefty 13 per cent weighting, local brokers are expecting some leading international investors to adjust their emerging market share-weighting accordingly, with the potential windfall for the Johannesburg exchange running into billions. So far, however, despite the return of fund managers and investment analysts to Johannesburg's biggest hotels, little new money has been forthcoming. Part of the problem stems from a general disenchantment in emerging markets after several top players got burnt in countries such as Mexico, Poland and Turkey, but most of it depends on South Africa itself. Despite a conservative budget and numerous statements by President Mandela and his economic team professing their adherence to free market discipline and macroeconomic stability, many investors seem to want to see how successfully the encouraging rhetoric is put into practice before taking the plunge. International investors also cite some continuing structural flaws with the market. Mr Frank Savage, chairman of Alliance Capital management, one of the big southern Africa fund managers, singles out the presence of big conglomerates without a proper anti-trust legislative framework and the low tradeability of shares, as among the most important problems. Although liquidity on the JSE improved to 7.14 per cent in 1993 from 4.76 per cent in 1992, it still remains far below other comparable markests. Under pressure from foreigners and local banking groups who have long railed against the Johannesburg Stock Exchange's restrictive operations, the exchange has recently announced a plan for restructuring to improve both efficiency and accountability. In addition to proposals related to affirmative action and the encouragement of black share ownership, the report recommends the revision of existing capital requirements and suggests that non-residents be allowed to act as brokers and that local firms can sell up to 30 per cent of their equity to institutional investors. Foreign firms have been quick to respond, setting up partnerships with local brokers even before the recommendations have been endorsed and legislated. In the past year, Robert Fleming, Smith NewCourt and SG Warburg have all made domestic alliances in the South African market, and more are expected to follow. To many, however, the proposals do not go far enough and critics are pressing for an end to the maintenance of single capacity trading, urging full corporate membership, and pushing for a move to screen trading from the current system of open outcry. But despite threats from disgruntled bankers to open a rival exchange, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange seems unlikely to budge further at the moment. 'If exchange control goes, then we would obviously have to reappraise the situation, but under current circumstances we feel that an evolutionary approach is best for the stock market,' notes Mr Roy Anderson, stock exchange president. Nonetheless, it is clear that the stock exchange, like other South African institutions, is undergoing important changes in the new environment and will continue to restructure further over the next few years. 'One way or another I think we're going to have move to a fully deregulated market in the not-too-distant future,' predicts one leading fund manager.</p>

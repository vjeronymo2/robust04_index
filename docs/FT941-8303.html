			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Ulster talks 'will not wait' for DUP The British and Irish governments yesterday insisted that neither Sinn Fein nor the hardline Democratic Unionist party will be allowed to hold up the next phase of talks on the future of Northern Ireland agreed at the weekend by the two countries' prime ministers. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said he believed there were 'still grounds for reasonable hope' that Sinn Fein would respond positively to the Downing Street peace declaration. But he stressed that talks - to be based on the document - would not wait for its decision. He added: 'We are ready to go at any time.' His suggestion that Mr Ian Paisley's DUP would also be unable to veto political progress was immediately backed by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary. Sir Patrick said: 'We should not permit the process to be halted by the action of those who are eligible to join in but who say, 'No we are not coming'.' The DUP has refused to join the talks unless the British government abandons the Downing Street declaration. Mr Reynolds, speaking on BBC television, said his meeting on Saturday with Mr John Major, the prime minister, had allayed concerns that future talks might be narrowly based on an internal political settlement in Ulster. Mr Reynolds said both sides now had a clearly agreed starting point for the next talks, which would embrace the so-called three-stranded process. He said he believed the mainly nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, which has not yet committed itself to the talks, would be 'content and happy' with the outcome of the weekend talks. It is understood that the SDLP, in an unpublicised session, met Sir Patrick last week to discuss his 'check-list' of ideas for political progress which have been submitted to Dublin. Although London has, in return for assurances about the scope of the talks, persuaded Dublin to commit itself to pressing on with them, both governments will maintain a low-key approach at least until after Sinn Fein's annual conference outside Dublin next weekend. The next inter-governmental conference is scheduled for March 10.</p>

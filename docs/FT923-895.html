			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / International Company News: Credit Agricole optimistic on growth CREDIT Agricole, one of France's largest banks, expects net profits growth of between 4 per cent and 6 per cent this year, despite the competitive state of the French financial markets. The announcement lightened the mood of the French banking industry, which has been clouded by concern about the impact of the economic slowdown on its exposure to small businesses and the property sector. Credit Lyonnais, another leading French bank, recently disclosed a sharp fall in profits for the first half of 1992 following a steep increase in client risk provisions. Credit Agricole, which has expanded rapidly from its roots as a co-operative of banks for French farmers to become Europe's biggest single bank, according to The Banker magazine, made net profits of FFr4.9bn on net banking income of FFr57.5bn in 1991. Mr Philippe Jaffre, chairman, said the bank would be forced to raise provisions this year, probably by FFr1bn or FFr2bn on last year's total of FFr14bn. The bank does not disclose figures for its performance in the first half of the year. However, it announced yesterday that gross operating profits had risen by 19 per cent on the preceding interim period. Credit Agricole anticipates continued growth in gross operating profits at a similar rate of between 19 per cent and 20 per cent for the full financial year. Similarly, net banking income is expected to show growth of 8 per cent, with the increase in costs restricted to 5 per cent below last year's level. Societe Generale, another leading French bank, yesterday announced a rationalisation plan to cut staffing levels in its domestic retail banking network by 2.5 per cent over the next three years. This will involve shedding 1,600 of the bank's 23,000 staff.</p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / International Company News: Bid by Spanish bank to sell network delayed A BID by Banco Central Hispano, the big Spanish commercial bank, to sell its main nationwide subsidiary network to Banque Nationale de Paris has been delayed indefinitely, a spokeswoman for BCH said yesterday. BCH, however, denied press reports that the French bank had pulled out of protracted negotiations to acquire the 165-branch Banco de Fomento in a deal that has been valued at up to Pta47bn (Dollars 398m). 'The talks are on standby,' the spokeswoman said. The delay is a blow for the Spanish bank's attempts to streamline its business and boost its liquidity following disappointing 1992 results. Fuelling the BCH's discomfort is the fact that Germany's Deutsche Bank, which had expressed interest in Fomento at an earlier stage, last week acquired Banco de Madrid, the subsidiary network owned by Banesto, a rival domestic commercial bank. BCH, posted a 22 per cent drop in net profits last year to Pta52.6bn despite a sharp increase in extraordinary income from disposals.</p>

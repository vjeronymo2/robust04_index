			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Under this approach, beneficiaries will continue to make use of existing CHAMPUS rules and administrative structures to receive their medical care and have medical claims paid. This feature will allow enrollees to make use of discounts and reduced copayments and provider arrangements already part of CHAMPUS in some locations. As previously noted, a third party administrator (TPA) will act as a central agent for the program. The functions of this TPA will be to: receive applications for enrollment of beneficiaries; verify eligibility and approve enrollment; notify the Defense Enrollment and Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) of enrollment; collect premiums; and provide administrative services. CHCBP eligibles will obtain information concerning the program and the application process and other TPA functions at their local base transition office or through the nearest military treatment facility's (MTF) Health Benefits Advisor (HBA). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congressional legislation caps premiums at a level equal to that of a comparable mid-range Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) program offered in the FEHBP. These premium rates were determined by category plan_either self or family and are not age/sex adjusted. (Similar to FEHBP premium schedules). Quarterly premium rates for fiscal year 1995 will be: $410 for self and $891 for family. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following is a discussion of the comments we received regarding the Continued Health Care Benefit Program, and the action we are taking in response. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> 1.

OPM opposed this request. Additionally, the requirement to cover preexisting conditions for new enrollees would make FEHBP private insurers unlikely to enroll CHCBP beneficiaries. Therefore, standard CHAMPUS was considered the most feasible means of ensuring entitled care. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 19, 1988, (53 FR 1343), the Department of Defense published a rule, ``Voluntary Private Health Insurance Conversion Program.'' This subject has been incorporated into 32 CFR part 199, section 199.20. Therefore, 32 CFR part 104 is removed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II.

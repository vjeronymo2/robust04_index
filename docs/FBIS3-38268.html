			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Miquel Roca Junyent, Convergence and Union </F> leader, by Anabel Diez and Camilo Valdecantos in Madrid; date  not given--first paragraph is introduction]    [Text] Madrid -- In broad sections of Spanish society, the  idea has taken root that the support which CiU [Convergence and  Union] gives the Socialist government rests solely on quids pro  quo for Catalonia.    [EL PAIS] How would you explain CiU's cooperation with the  PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] to a citizen of Ribadeo  or Jerez?    [Roca] It can be explained very easily: Spain has a  government thanks to us, and if there were no government, we  would be much worse off than we are. The mere announcement of  the agreement between CiU and the PSOE was sufficient for the  Bank of Spain to lower interest rates the following day. If  there is any kind of measure to encourage the productive  economy, job creation, or tax improvements for enterprises, it  will be thanks to the proposals which we have introduced into  the overall budgets. Much remains to be done, and we cannot be  completely satisfied, but it is clear that all this shows quite  a favorable balance sheet and, if recovery begins in 1994, the  effort will not have been in vain.    [EL PAIS] Are you saying that accusations that everything  you have done was in return for quids for quo for Catalonia are  untrue?    [Roca] It is terribly irritating and unfair to accuse us of  acting with only Catalonia in mind; nobody has been able to  present evidence to substantiate it. The famous transfer of 15  percent [of personal income tax revenue to the autonomous  communities] benefits everybody: Everybody approved it, and  there is Galicia, which now wants more, and the Balearics, which  said no and then changed their mind. This is a bad way to  conduct politics, and a dangerous way.    [EL PAIS] Have you anybody in particular in mind?    [Roca] I have somebody in particular in mind, but I will not  say who, because that would be rising to the bait they wish to  set for us. I will have a clear conscience not to have  responded to that falsehood. It was very rough play, of a kind  that is hard to forget.    [EL PAIS] Are you pointing at the People's Party?    [Roca] They will know. I will not say, but you cannot tell  lies with impunity or try to create a bad image in the rest of  Spain without any restraint in generalizing about all Catalans,  which is even more offensive, because it also includes those who  voted for them.    [EL PAIS] Why do you not defend yourselves against the  accusations of blackmail?    [Roca] It is not for us to defend ourselves. That would be  accepting a strategy that seeks to put us on the defensive. Let  the PSOE explain why it is demanding our cooperation. A few  months ago, the People's Party would not speak of pacts, and now  it is very eager. The United Left [IU] is also attempting this;  whether it would be sensible to accept its terms is another  matter. CiU does not reject extending the pact, but let it be  clear to everybody that reaching agreement means forgoing taking  advantage of the crisis. Those who reach agreement courageously  accept the aim of emerging from the crisis -- not benefiting  from it.    [EL PAIS] It is asserted that Jordi Pujol is more chary of  cooperation with the government than you.    [Roca] When Pujol said he was not entering the government,  he was accused of being unsupportive; when we give support from  outside the government, we are called Phoenicians [fenicios --  allusion unknown]. Is it not our participation in  decisionmaking that some people find hard to accept? Is it or  is it not possible that there is a blueprint of a strong and  legitimate state for the whole of Spain on the basis of a  Catalan nationalist vision, or can we only have a blueprint for  Catalonia, because we are a Catalan nationalist party? We have  already given the answer: Catalan nationalism is also an idea  about what Spain can and should be like -- certainly more  pluralist than others see it.    [EL PAIS] If the People's Party wins the next election  without a majority, will you give them your cooperation?    [Roca] We will speak when the next legislative term comes.  In any event, you will appreciate that it must be very awkward  to demand cooperation of somebody who is so reviled. Look, in  Europe 12 heads of government of all ideologies meet and reach  agreement on an economic action and job creation program that  should be implemented in their respective countries. In Spain  it is not possible to reach agreement on this same policy with  the People's Party, which does not accept what its ideological  families advocate there.    [EL PAIS] For how long will you continue to support the  Socialists?    [Roca] Our support will always be given in terms of the  agreement of aims. If the agreement disappears, we will see.  It is for the Socialists to administer this stability which we  have made possible in order to seek new areas of agreement. The  change in economic policy is not complete; more things are  needed. Is there or is there not a desire to carry on? It is  for the Socialists, not ourselves, to reply. We are affected by  neither the criticisms nor the difficulties: Are they prepared  to accept the correction which economic recovery will require of  them?    [EL PAIS] The Socialists are accused of winning the election  with a left-wing vote only to reach agreement with the Catalan  right.    [Roca] The current political situation requires strong and  sound leaderships. Society wishes to feel it is involved in a  project which those directing it believe in. This injection of  conviction could be even more important than the actual success  of the measures contained in the project. Spain lacks guidance  and leadership; there are contradictions, apprehensions, and  hesitations, and an impression of lack of conviction about the  measures proposed is being conveyed. That is Spain's most  important deficit. It is up to the government and Felipe  Gonzalez to rectify the defici.    [EL PAIS] So do you believe the IU's reproaches are giving  the government a complex?    [Roca] I do not know whether or not what the IU could say is  giving it a complex. It should have no reason to have a  complex. I know of no government in Europe the reaches agreement  with the IU's counterparts; that is why Julio Anguita accuses  Gonzalez of doing the same as the other European governments are  doing.    [EL PAIS] How could internal clashes in the PSOE affect  emersion from the crisis?    [Roca] The PSOE is too important for its problems not to  affect the country's own image, its reputation, and even the  ability to create confidence in the future. The Socialists must  understand this. How can they call for efforts while they  themselves simply cannot reach agreement? If their congress  does not go well, the consequences will affect everybody.    [EL PAIS] How is your cooperation with the central  government understood in Catalonia?    [Roca] What we are doing is understood very well.  Everything is being done very comprehensively, without any kind  of specific repercussions for Catalonia. There may be people  who tell you: "You could take advantage of the situation," but  we have not done so, and we are glad that this is so, although I  will not disguise the fact that we feel dissatisfied at not  having made progress in the autonomy field. There is a false  impression, as if autonomy were a Catalan or Basque matter. I  believe that none of what Catalonia demands in the field of  implementing autonomy is rejected by the others. We have  undertaken the role of promoting the implementation of autonomy  in Spain from which everybody later benefits.    [EL PAIS] The impression is that you people feel comfortable  in your role of assisting the government.    [Roca] We are very bad at handing out criticism; our sense  of responsibility gets the better of us. We like to take part  in decisionmaking, but, moreover, the house's political makeup  is being forgotten here. We are the only ones who can do what  we are doing. The People's Party feels it is the alternative,  the IU believes it must constantly oppose, and the others are  too small to muster the seats which bring stability. We have  not fared badly. We have already supported the Union of the  Democratic Center, and CiU is the only political force in the  whole of Spain that has increased its number of voters in every  election since 1979 -- from 500,000 votes in 1979 to 1.16  million in last October's election.</p>

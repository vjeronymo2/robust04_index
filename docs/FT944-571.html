			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / TV Highlights: Seasonal retrospectives heave into view With its hunt meets, sporting fixtures and panto openings, Boxing Day is traditionally frivolous, as opposed to the spirituality and gravitas we have so far observed. Watchable films start at 8.05am (BBC2) with Little Women, 1949 vintage, when the young Elizabeth Taylor gave signs of becoming a delightful comic actress. Good films on all four main channels; my selection would include True Grit (2.55pm, BBC1), veteran John Wayne and enchanting Kim Darby in the western with the quaintly formal dialogue (and at least one pentameter worthy of the Jacobeans: 'He never played me false until he killed me'); Valentino in The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (3.25pm, C4); and Bergman and Peck as shrink and possibly murderous patient in Hitchcock's Spellbound (12.30am, BBC1). Pride of place goes to the posthumous premiere of the late Dennis Potter's last completed work, Midnight Movie, a story of obsession and tortuous longings. I know Potter is canonised, but will this redeem his latterday tendency to lugubrious self-indulgence? And so to post-Boxing Day Tuesday. BBC2 rather pusillanimously schedules Baa Baa Black Sheep for 3pm. Michael Berkeley's opera blends an unhappy episode from Rudyard Kipling's childhood with his later creations from The Jungle Book. Jonathan Moore's original production for Opera North was highly praised. Barrie Gavin does it for tele-vision. Elsewhere seasonal retrospectives heave into view. Films of the Year (10.50pm, BBC1) is for those who can stand Barry Norman's unremitting autopilot chirpiness. Video Nation Review of the Year is much more absorb-ing - all human life is there. Talking of distinctions, the film alleged to have lost more money in America than any other arrives on C4 when The Adventures of Baron Munchausen takes the air - cast including Alison Steadman, Oliver Reed and an un-Faginesque Jonathan Pryce. And the originally derided but fascinatingly alive film of Othello, directed by Orson Welles, surfaces in a restored version (C4, 10.35pm). Welles himself plays the Moor to Michael MacLiammoir's Iago. Setting Roderigo's murder in a Turkish bath was necessitated by the shoestring budget and lack of costumes. Like much else in the film, it works brilliantly.</p>

Alekseyev: "Private Property--A </F> Factor No Less Powerful Than State Dictatorship"]    [Text]  <H5>  Thus far privatization in Russia has failed </H5>   What could explain the fact that "radical" economic reforms  launched in January 1992, despite a number of positive results,  still did not produce the anticipated changes and, on the  contrary, certain tendencies appeared that could bring Russia  more trouble?    The decisive factors, consideration of which may yield an  answer to the question that was raised, are the unusual and  historically unprecedented complexities of the economic and  social situation in Russia, a country that is yet to make a  final break with totalitarianism, one which is entirely  nationalized and ravaged, where the foundations and culture of  "normal" private ownership were wiped out and private property  lost its significance as a natural base of economic development  and where monopolistic state ownership, authority for the sake  of authority, imperial state dictatorship, and a system of  compulsory and semicompulsory stimulation of labor by the state  was established.    "Free" prices and other monetary measures on the whole  eliminated state dictatorship from the sphere of prices and  trade turnover. On their own they are incapable of transforming  the totally nationalized, bureaucratic, prosocialist economy  into a free market economy, eliminating state pressure from it  (which in many ways has changed its form: from a distributor of  resources and goods the state became the distributor of  subsidies and credits, which, by the way, requires huge taxes).    Radical reorganization of the entire Russian economy may be  attained not only through monetary measures and market freedom,  but primarily through the revival of private property as a  natural basis of economic relations, production, and the entire  economy, under conditions of competition, i.e., a factor, which  is no less powerful than state dictatorship but one that has an  inexhaustible reserve of creative energy, promotes natural  motivation of labor and responsibility, while stimulating  investments in production.    At the same time such a revival of private property capable  of taking the place of the main regulator of production in a  competitive environment did not occur in Russia. Official  privatization, which it would seem should perform that task, was  mainly limited to the sphere of trade and structures  specializing in the marketing of natural raw material and  currency operations abroad. With regard to the rest, however,  attention in such "privatization" was focused on a prosocialist  partition of a portion of state property among all  fellow-citizens with the aid of vouchers (which, alas,  intensified parasitical tendencies of "factory socialism") and  sale of state property in the interests of the state budget as  well as "general auctioning" promoted by the success of the  partition of property using vouchers, which to a great degree  acquired a formal character and often merely consolidated the  status of "red directors," promoting the growth and legalization  of our comprador bourgeoisie.    It was specifically because of the fact that privatization  in  Russia did not succeed and the dictatorial state command system  was not replaced with another, natural, system of regulation and  stimulation in the form of private ownership, that there was a  failure in the economy, and formation of a void. It was  specifically this failure which sent the parasitic "market"  element spinning and churning, directed at quick and speculative  profits achieved through the channeling of natural raw material  abroad, resale, foreign currency operations, and machinations  with vouchers, stocks, and credits.    Such a situation, a situation involving failure of the  system  of economic regulation and labor stimulation, precipitated  processes leading to the destruction of the economy, a decline  in production and labor productivity along with other alarming  phenomena indicating the possibility that Russian society could  degenerate into an unfavorable, tragic variant of capitalist  development.    The alarming facts of our current reality are clearly  evident, anyone can see them. Adherents of orthodox communism  and a nationalized economy, as well as "proponents of the state"  are utilizing these facts in full to substantiate the ideology  of "turning back" to a "regulated" market, to a "mixed economy,"  or, in any case, to the "correction" and "slowing down" of  reforms, and an intensification of state regulation in economic  life. Unfortunately, under conditions of a disastrous situation,  such moods have gained a certain popularity and even the support  of some official circles. Even though, there is no doubt that  such a policy would merely strengthen state-nomenclature type  structures in the economy, increasing the state-capitalist tilt  of one of the most unfavorable, dead-end variants of capitalist  development.    One should assume that the way out of the situation which  has  been created must be a radically different one. Not "curtailing"  or "slowing-down" of reforms but, on the contrary, attribution  of a cardinal character to them and extension of reforms, their  decisive conduct and involvement of the entire energetic, active  population of Russia in that truly reformative process.    The key to such large-scale reformative activity is the  revival of private property in a competitive atmosphere. Its  revival in all of its forms -- individual, family, and private  -- collective forms.    The very concept of privatization being conducted in Russia  must be changed radically on the basis of these positions.    It is necessary to be firmly aware that under Russian  conditions the revival of private property is impossible if  privatization is concentrated on the free distribution of  property, on the partition of even a segment of state property  with the help of vouchers. By contrast with other countries,  where truly private property already existed and privatization  with the aid of vouchers merely consolidates and expands its  subjective composition, under Russian conditions such a  privatization policy only breeds consumer-parasitic moods, an  aspiration of becoming a nonworking investor, along with  elements of "factory socialism."    The direction which is presently coming into being in  privatization -- the auctioning of items of state property on a  competitive basis, can also hardly be recognized as satisfactory.    The optimal path for development of privatization, which  revives productive private property and competition -- is the  transfer of it to "real owners" and the acquisition of property  by them for work. For work, that is for organization and  modernization of rational modern production and a growing output  of goods (services) in demand on the market. Perhaps the only  obligation of the owner, naturally, along with the payment of  taxes in such a transfer and such an acquisition, must be the  obligation to modernize production and make mandatory  investments of his own revenue in production.    It is necessary to note that with all of the alarming  phenomena of the current period, favorable conditions still  exist in Russia, probably uniquely favorable ones, for the  economy to start working and take a path of dynamic development.  They include the existence of significant material means,  resources, and advanced technical and scientific potential in  many areas.    Naturally, all of these are merely conditions, premises,  which, in addition to everything else are being consistently  lost, in the current crisis situation, as our economy is being  destroyed, (they will not even be required very much in our  Homeland if Russia slips into the unfavorable variant of  capitalist development, the raw material periphery of the world  capitalist system).    But the opportunity has not yet been lost and amazing  results  are still possible if our principal hope is realized -- the  power of the Russian spirit and selfless labor.    We are all witnesses to how the elimination of the coercive,  enslaving burden of the state, and the acquisition of freedom  and private property are rapidly releasing labor energy,  tumultuous and frenzied -- like everything Russian.    When production cooperatives and leased enterprises got the  freedom to acquire private property in 1989-1991, the national  economic sector formed by them, in the situation created by the  disintegration of the entire Soviet economy which had already  started, proved to be the only one (the only one!) that  manifested economic growth, including a rise in investments in  production. It is sufficient to recall the amazing success  attained by the Pechora production cooperative, headed by  Vladimir Tumanov, as well as the fruitful work done by other  vigorous supporters of a realistic cause (Svyatoslav Fedorov,  Nikolay Travkin, and others) in order for it to become clear  that even at that time our national economy was on its way to  resolving the crisis and heading toward a general economic  upsurge. Who knows, that may have occurred if the reformist  forces would have been firmer and more systematic and if Russia  was not overwhelmed by political passions and the merciless  struggle for power.    This is why it is necessary to have a clear understanding at  present as well that revival of private productive property has  been called upon to become the decisive ennobling factor,  unleashing creative economic energy.    A daring and decisive step is required by the government and  the president. By those who can and must assume responsibility  for the fate of Russia, for making it possible to withdraw from  the brink of disaster and begin healthy economic development.</p>

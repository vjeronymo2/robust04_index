			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 17 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu, currently on a tour of Southeast Asia, stopped over in  Seoul to attend a garden party for foreign diplomats hosted by  the president Tuesday afternoon.    Han, who completed the schedule at his first stop in Manila,  will leave for his next destination, Bangkok, after the event at  Chongwadae (presidential residence) so he can get some rest on a  trip that also takes him to Vietnam and Indonesia.    Ministry officials explained that it is customary for the  foreign minister to attend the annual party for foreign envoys  at this time of the year. They made it clear that there was no  urgent reason for Han to fly back home during his overseas trip.  The minister's one-day return was scheduled long before he  embarked on his tour and, therefore, Thursday was left free,  they said.</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Observer: Plumb job After last week's Euro-election debacle, it might be thought the remnants of the Tory MEPs would hunker down and pull together. Instead, they are now squabbling about who is to be the chairman of their ever-dwindling group. Will it be Edward McMillan-Scott, ex-PR man and former adviser to the Falkland Islands? Or perhaps the bearded MEP for Surrey, who caught Observer's eye by signing off his election literature with an endearing 'love, Tom Spencer'? And they are not the only ones bidding for the chair. Given that the 18 Tory MEPs have already anointed dear old Lord Plumb as their leader, why on earth do they need a chairman as well? Are we talking power politics here or jobs for the boys?</p>

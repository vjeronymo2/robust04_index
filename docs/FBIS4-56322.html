			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena -- According to Foreign Trade Minister  Juan Manuel Santos, if the Constitutional Court does not approve  the investment protection treaty signed with the UK, they will  have to reform the Constitution. In his opinion, the government  has the necessary legal arguments to help the treaty pass the  juridical test, and it cannot sit back with its arms crossed  while other countries are signing investment protection  treaties. "The new Constitution is being tested, and if the  treaty with the UK is not approved, Colombian will be left in a  very complicated position."    Santos defended the Foreign Investment Protection Agreement  signed with the UK. He added, however, that the Shell Company  cannot use the treaty to support its case in its conflict with  the government over the termination of Shell's contract in  Neiva. The oil company has already presented its legal case on  the basis that an acquired right has been violated. The treaty  cannot be applied to such a case. "Colombia did not yield when  it signed the treaty with the UK. It only put the regulations  currently in effect into one agreement to provide greater  stability for investors," Santos added.  <H5>  Free Commerce </H5>   As new ECLA [Economic Commission for Latin America]  president  in the 25th period of sessions, Foreign Trade Minister Juan  Manuel Santos will establish a hemispheric free trade zone, the  inclusion of the social sector in the economic opening process,  and the recovery of ECLA's leadership his priorities    According to Santos, ECLA can become a vital force to  promote  social development in the region. He said: "The benefits derived  from development programs must be distributed equitably. If they  are not, the programs lose legitimacy."    Approximately 200 million Latin Americans and Caribbeans  (out  of a total of 450 million) currently live in a state of absolute  poverty. According to Santos, this indicates that although "the  opening has been implemented and there are interaction  agreements between 22 countries, the importance of the social  sector has not been emphasized."    Regarding the Latin American integration agreements, Santos  asserted that they must converge in the establishment of a free  trade zone at the continental level, a process in which ECLA  could play an important role. "We must confirm the agreements so  all countries are speaking the same language. We have to find a  common denominator for rules on the origin of merchandise and  antidumping [previous word in English] laws, among other  topics," Santos stated.    Regarding Colombia's entry into the NAFTA signed by Mexico,  the United States, and Canada, Santos said they will leave  everything ready for the new government to enter that group.  "We have already agreed that Colombia is an ideal candidate to  enter the treaty, and we want to be on the list of countries  that will enter it first. The next administration, however,  will set the date and the conditions for our entry," the  minister stated.    On the Group of Three problems, he reported that they will  hold a meeting next week to reach an agreement on the two areas  that have sparked differences: rules on origin of merchandise in  the textile and chemical sectors.</p>

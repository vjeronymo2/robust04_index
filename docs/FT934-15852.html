			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Labour council launches partnership with private sector PRIVATE-sector companies are to be given a central role in formulating the economic development policy and practice of Labour-controlled North Tyneside Council under a partnership launched yesterday. Nearly 40 manufacturing, energy and service-sector companies have agreed to join the North Tyneside Economic Partnership, which aims to enhance business success, employment and investment in the borough. As well as influencing council economic strategy, the companies will help it bid for UK and European grants, including funds from the new Urban Regeneration Agency. Other Labour-controlled councils are seeking more private-sector involvement. Newcastle City Council has established a steering group, involving private companies, to prepare its economic development strategy. The North Tyneside partnership builds on the government's City Challenge concept, in which private-sector involvement was necessary for selection. Partnership members include government departments, academic and training institutions and economic development agencies. It demonstrates how far North Tyneside Council - once reviled by Conservative ministers as a 'far-left' authority - has moved towards a pragmatic approach to its role. Mr John Foster, council executive director, said: 'It's a change, but a change people are recognising is necessary and moving in the right direction.' He hoped it would strengthen North Tyneside's grant bids. Mr Ralph Iley, the partnership chairman, is a former managing director of the Cookson Group and a lifelong local resident. He said businesses which argued they lacked the time to get involved were short-sighted. 'If you want good people, good services, you have to have a good area,' he said. 'Good staff aren't going to move to an area which is broken down.' The Insurance Service, part of the Royal Insurance Group, yesterday announced that it was basing its second regional service centre at the Doxford International Business Park in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear. The centre, to begin operating in the new year, is expected to employ 100 staff by the end of next year, rising ultimately to 350, all full-time. The Insurance Service, a direct, telephone-based insurer, is based in Bristol, where it has its first service centre. The new Sunderland site will deal with new business, policy maintenance and country-wide claims. Sunderland won the investment against competition from Peterborough and the West Midlands. The Insurance Service said the financial package available at Doxford was a key factor.</p>

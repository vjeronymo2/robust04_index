			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mikael Holmstrom report: "Secret Group Shapes Baltic </F> Policy"]    [Text] With the greatest secrecy Sweden regularly brings  together an informal working group of diplomats from 10 Western  countries to coordinate action vis-a-vis the Baltic states.    These activities go under the name of "The Ad Hoc Stockholm  Group." In addition to Sweden, the United States, Canada,  Britain, Italy, France, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and  the EU [European Union] Commission take part in the group's  regular meetings.    The group was formed in the summer of 1992 after the CSCE  meeting in Helsinki.    At the meeting the Russian troop retreat had been an  internal  Baltic bone of contention and had been resolved through the  mediation of Prime Minister Carl Bildt.    How the Russian withdrawal is to be facilitated through  support for retraining and homes for Russian officers has been  just one of the topics on the group's agenda.    All questions with a Baltic connection are discussed -- for  example, the position of the Russian-speaking population in the  three Baltic states, economic and social development, and  environmental problems.    When Prime Minister Carl Bildt declared on 17 November 1993  that Sweden could not remain neutral in a crisis in which Russia  threatened the Balts' freedom, his statement must been seen  against the background of the informal responsibility which  Sweden has assumed.    The message was that the Baltic region is not only Russia's  "nearby foreign countries," it is also West Europe's "nearby  foreign countries." From the Swedish viewpoint, Sweden has a  very strong interest of its own in involving other Western  countries in the Baltic region.    "The important thing is that through this group we can make  sure that Sweden and Finland are not left alone with the Baltic  states in a crisis. We have now built up a working network of  those dealing with the Baltic region in various countries; they  simply have to lift the telephone receiver to consult each  other," a Swedish government source said.    The "interim" Stockholm group's meetings are held at least  quarterly. Diplomats of head of department rank from the  countries' foreign ministries take part in the meetings. Sweden  is represented by the Foreign Ministry's political department  and Carl Bildt's Cabinet Office.    The existence of the group has never been acknowledged in  public. Representatives of the Swedish Government confirmed its  existence only after SVENSKA DAGBLADET learned about the group  through foreign sources.    The existence of the group has not even been common  knowledge  at the Foreign Ministry; from the beginning, the information was  kept to a very limited circle. This high level of secrecy is in  strong contrast to the government's policy of constantly  stressing its active involvement on behalf of the Baltic region.    The government is unwilling to comment on the group:    "We do not want too much fuss about this," said one of  SVENSKA DAGBLADET's sources. Another source explained why:    "This is work that is being done on a very informal basis.  It is supposed to be consultative and to leave a free hand for  initiatives, and not be anything more official.    ``Through the exchange of information, the group is a  source of productive cooperation for the actions of the various  countries: What talks people want to try to hold, how to  proceed on certain issues, and how to act in various  international forums.''    While one person in the Cabinet Office has stated that the  group is a purely consultative body and does not coordinate  policy, another centrally placed source says that in practice  the group has drawn up the tactics for Western action.    On the Swedish side, the view is that Moscow too takes a  positive view of the Stockholm group, in part because of the  interest in the Russian-speaking population in the Baltic states.    "On the Russian side too the Swedish involvement is viewed  as  natural. We are not interested in pursuing a provocative  policy. Our interest is to make a contribution to stability in  our immediate environs," is the summary of one Swede with a  knowledge of the group's work.    The Stockholm group also functions as a complement to the  talks Carl Bildt has with the heads of state and government of  other countries.    One example of this is his contacts with U.S. President Bill  Clinton over the Russian troop retreat from Latvia.    In February, the leaders of all eight parties in the Latvian  parliament visited Washington and were received at the very  highest level. This was done to persuade the Latvians to accept  a U.S. compromise on the Russian troop retreat and on the  Russian radar station in Skrunda (as they subsequently did).    The Latvians traveled home through Stockholm. At the Swedish  Government's information briefing for the mass media on 3  February, no mention was made of the fact that Assistant Under  Secretary Lars Freden, the prime minister's expert on the Baltic  region, had accompanied the Latvians to Washington at the  invitation of the United States.    Neither was there mention on that occasion of the fact that  the Latvians used their stopover in Sweden to discuss their  situation with 10 Western diplomats from the Stockholm group.</p>

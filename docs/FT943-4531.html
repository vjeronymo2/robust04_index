			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Hillsdown beats tough markets with Pounds 65.6m Hillsdown Holdings lifted pre-tax profits by 5 per cent from Pounds 62.3m to Pounds 65.6m in the first half of 1994, on the back of an increase in sales from continuing operations from Pounds 1.94bn to Pounds 2.03bn. Sir John Nott, chairman, said the group's restructuring had lopped Pounds 1bn off turnover in the past two years, with very little effect on profits. 'We have had a reasonable six months given the very difficult food markets in the UK and in Canada.' Mr David Newton, chief executive, said the results marked the third half-year in a row when the results were broadly in line with expectations. 'We are not there yet - but we are moving in the right direction.' Total turnover, including Pounds 9.7m from discontinued operations, was 2.04bn, down from Pounds 2.27bn previously, when discontinued operations accounted for Pounds 331.8m. Operating margins improved from 3.6 per cent to 4 per cent. Sir John said the group was assuming no food price inflation, and was looking for further efficiency to improve margins further. It was also seeking bolt-on acquisitions similar to this week's purchase of Materne-Fruibourg, the French jam maker, from Groupe Danone. The operation would give Hillsdown a manufacturing and a distribution base in France. Operating profits in four of the six divisions improved. The exceptions were the ambient and chilled foods division, where profits fell by Pounds 1m to Pounds 15.3m on sales of Pounds 307.6m, and the meat and produce division, where profits declined from Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 7.8m on sales of Pounds 363.4m. The former was hit by a baked bean price war, which more than offset good results from the continental chilled salad operation. Mr Newton said profits from canning had fallen by 60 per cent, mainly because of a 50 per cent rise in the price of navy beans. The group, which supplies supermarkets with own-label baked beans, is phasing out one of its canneries. The beverages and biscuits division raised profits by Pounds 2m to Pounds 5.9m on sales of Pounds 137.5m, helped by increased spending on brands. Sales of Typhoo tea were 26 per cent ahead. Profits in the poultry division improved from Pounds 12.3m to Pounds 14.2m on sales of Pounds 245m, as its switch from frozen to fresh chicken production started to reap benefits. In the non-food division, where profits rose to Pounds 14.7m (Pounds 13.7m) on sales of Pounds 209.3m, Fairview New Homes improved margins. Net interest payable fell from Pounds 18.5m to Pounds 15.6m. Earnings per share rose to 5.5p (5.1p). The interim dividend is unchanged at 2.2p. Sir John said he hoped for 'a more positive dividend policy at the end of the year,' given the group's performance and cash generation. See Lex</p>

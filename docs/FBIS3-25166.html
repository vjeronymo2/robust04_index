			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] has called for the  scrapping of Section 29 of the Internal Security Act, which  allows for detention without trial, and castigated the  Transitional Executive Council for not abolishing the  legislation. This followed the TEC's decision to retain  provisionally Section 29 of the Internal Security Act. IFP  spokesman Ed Tillet said in a statement in Durban that the TEC's  decision made a mockery of the lengthy campaign fought by the  ANC [African National Congress] and its allies to have the  legislation removed from the statute books.</p>

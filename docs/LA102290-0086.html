			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOOT BEAT;  </P> <P> ANAHEIM POLICE HAVE TAKEN A PERSONAL, HIGH-PROFILE APPROACH TO CUTTING CRIME IN  10 AREAS  </P> <P> The first time officers Tim Wylie and Karen Schroepfer saw an outdoor card game  on Sabina Street, they thought it was a harmless way for some laborers to relax  after work.  </P> <P> But after a few weeks of watching the area up close as part of the Anaheim  Police Department's new Community Action Policing team, the two officers soon  realized that some card parties actually were ploys to conceal drug  transactions.  </P> <P> "The card games and the drinking are fronts," Schroepfer said recently as she  broke up one such congregation, dispersing the crowd and emptying beer bottles.  "This is where the contacts are made. A guy walks up to the table like he's  part of the game and a (drug) deal is made."  </P> <P> Whether it's breaking up clandestine narcotics operations or knocking on  residents' doors to ask them about the problems in their neighborhoods, Anaheim  police are trying a personal and concentrated approach of policing the city's  10 worst crime areas.  </P> <P> "I like it," said Leopoldo Gonzalez, a nine-year resident of Sabina Street. "We  really need their help."  </P> <P> Gonzalez watched from his yard as Wylie and Schroepfer detained a convicted  drug user who they suspected was trying to buy drugs.  </P> <P> "I'm glad the police are making an effort to come around here more," said the  37-year-old father of two. "There's a lot of drinking, drugs, and fighting  around here. It's very unsafe."  </P> <P> For years, similar programs have been used by other departments in the county  with varying degrees of success.  </P> <P> "It's a very vogue form of policing right now," said James Lasley, an assistant  professor of criminal justice at Cal State Fullerton who helped the Los Angeles  Police Department form a community policing program called Operation  Cul-de-sac. "It's the wave of the future . . . it can be very effective."  </P> <P> Anaheim's $360,000, two-year program is staffed by four officers, a sergeant  and a lieutenant. It is modeled after a successful pilot program in the  Jeffrey-Lynne area earlier this year which incorporated several city  departments, including code enforcement, community services and other sections  within the Police Department.  </P> <P> The unit uses foot, bike and vehicle patrols to comb through certain parts of  the city to make their presence known to residents as well as miscreants.  </P> <P> After breaking up the card game, Wylie and Schroepfer continued to walk around  the predominantly Latino neighborhood, greeting residents and asking them if  anybody was out to sell drogas.  </P> <P> Schroepfer, who was followed around by several barefoot children as she walked  toward an alley on Sabina Street, found a discarded hypodermic needle lying on  the ground near some trash cans.  </P> <P> "This is why parents around here are afraid to let their children out," she  said as she picked up the needle and threw it away.  </P> <P> A short distance away, she stopped and questioned a suspected drunk who had  just urinated in an alley in a spot where it appeared others had done the same.  Using a neighborhood teen-ager to translate in Spanish, she told the man to go  home or face being arrested.  </P> <P> He left.  </P> <P> Throughout the night, the officers walked and drove through Sabina, Rose and  Bush streets, stopping suspected gang members, drug dealers and users and beer  drinkers.  </P> <P> "Instead of going from one call to another across the city like regular patrol  officers, we're afforded the opportunity to really take the time and talk with  the people," Wylie said. "It goes a long way toward getting them to trust us."  </P> <P> Developing a good relationship with the business owners, community groups and  residents will determine the success of the program, according to Lt. Ray Welch  and Sgt. Mike Hannah, the two men who run the month-old unit.  </P> <P> Once residents begin to trust the officers, they will be more likely to call  the police when problems develop, they said.  </P> <P> "We want to go from crisis management to a long-range proactive service," Welch  said. "We need to educate them on the system so they can use us to help them  better."  </P> <P> The trust the officers are seeking may be tough to develop because of cultural  and language barriers, Welch and Hannah admit. All four officers in the unit  have some working knowledge of Spanish, but only one is fluent.  </P> <P> One recent weekend night, Wylie and Schroepfer went door to door with the other  two officers in the unit, Hank Fantes and Fred Pittington, and did some good  old-fashioned handshaking with residents and listened to their concerns.  </P> <P> "Many of the families told us they don't let their children go outside to play,  or want their wives to go by the stores themselves" because of drug dealers and  gang members loitering in the neighborhood, Pittington said.  </P> <P> After talking with the residents, Pittington said he felt "a certain  indignation and outrage" at their plight that he didn't get while "working  regular patrol."  </P> <P> "You simply don't have that same reaction, the same feelings, because you can't  allow yourself the time to do that," he said. "I think we're finally talking to  people and finding some way to get a link across between the Police Department  and the citizens that just wasn't here before."  </P> <P> In the Jeffrey-Lynne pilot program, crime dropped significantly as police made  230 arrests for such crimes as drug possession, drunkenness and urinating in  public. The police are hoping to see the same results in the target areas.  </P> <P> Crime in Jeffrey-Lynne has increased somewhat since the program was stopped,  but not to the level it was before the community policing began, police  officials said. No comparative statistics were available.  </P> <P> Anaheim Police Chief Joseph T. Molloy said the program should work, but results  won't occur overnight. "I think we can have an impact in all (10) of the  (target) areas," he said.  </P> <P> The concept of community policing is an old idea that "got lost somewhere" when  officers became more mobilized and more demands were made on their time, Molloy  said.  </P> <P> "We kind of lost touch," he said. "We're revisiting these programs . . . we  want to show the people they can take control of their neighborhoods."  </P></p>

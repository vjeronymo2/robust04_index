			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading A LARGE single trade in conglomerate Hanson's stock options ahead of today's figures was the main feature in the derivates market, writes Joel Kibazo. The Hanson trade contributed significantly to total turnover of 30,161 lots in traded options, just ahead of Friday's figure. However, business in the FT-SE 100 option was modest, volume reaching only 9,334 contracts. In Hanson, a leading securities house was reported to have bought a large quantity of the February 240 puts, and by the close of business Hanson options had traded a total of 6,232 contracts. It was followed by Glaxo at 1,849 lots, Asda at 1,833 and then by Lonrho, which was also busy in the equities, at 1,681 contracts. In stock index futures, an initial sell-off after the March contract on the Footsie opened at 2,842 was followed by a gentle squeeze which drove it forward. March remained at the higher levels for most of the session and touched the day's peak of 2,858 around lunchtime, although actual buying remained thin. With little in the way of economic features, and Wall Street closed, the earlier interest in the contract waned and it drifted lower for the rest of the day. It finished at 2,853, a premium of one to the underlying cash market, with volume coming to a meagre 4,488 trades, well below Friday's total of 12,521 lots.</p>

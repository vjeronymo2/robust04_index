			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Australia coal plan 'high-risk' The creation of a national coal marketing board to offset the negotiating tactics of Japanese buyers was yesterday described as an inappropriate and 'high-risk' strategy by a report into Australia's coal industry. Mr Rae Taylor, a former civil servant, was called in to review the coal sector after the last annual round of coal price negotiations between Australian producers and Japanese buyers. In the 1993-94 round, Australia accepted price cuts for the fourth successive year, provoking two national strikes by miners and costing the industry hundreds of millions of dollars in lost production. Coal is Australia's largest single export, and the country is the world's biggest coal exporter. More than 40 per cent of Australian exports go to Japan and the annual Australia-Japan negotiations serve as an international price-setting mechanism. In submissions to the Taylor inquiry, coal unions argued that since the Japanese buyers were in effect working as a cartel, Australian producers should also negotiate collectively. However, Mr Taylor said such a move could jeopardise the significant coal trade between Australia and Japan and added there was no conclusive evidence that Japanese buyers' practices had been detrimental. 'Under existing arrangements, the Australian industry has achieved significant growth and a high market share,' he said. In wide range of conclusions, he suggested that there was scope for improving 'price transparency' and export control administration, and for achieving efficiencies in transportation both on the rail and shipping fronts. Another area highlighted for reform was industrial relations, where he urged devolved enterprise-based wage-bargaining. He also recommended efforts to develop export market diversification over the medium to long term  - with markets such as India, China, Thailand, the Philippines and Pakistan being identifiable targets. The findings will be discussed at the Australian Coal Industry Council, a tripartite body involving unions, companies and federal government, on Sunday. However, the initial response from employers and unions yesterday was cautious. The Australian Coal Association said the study was 'forward-looking' and the industry needed to concentrate on making the sector more competitive. The mineworkers union said Mr Taylor had not gone far enough, noting that on pricing 'the report doesn't say that the union's goals are wrong  - only that the union's approach is high-risk'.</p>

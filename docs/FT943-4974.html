			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / International Company News: Revenues at Schindler fall 2.4% at midway Schindler, the world's second largest elevators and escalators group after Otis of the US, said its revenues in the first half dropped 2.4 per cent to SFr2.16bn (Dollars 1.5bn). No profit figure was published, but the group said it expected net income for the full year to be slightly below the SFr168.6m reported for 1994. It predicted that full-year operating profit would be broadly in line with last year's SFr150.5m because of continuing unfavourable market conditions. Sales of elevators and escalators fell 7.5 per cent in the first half to SFr1.81bn, sales of rolling stock gained 15.3 per cent to SFr158m and revenues from the recovering Also computer services subsidiary jumped 64 per cent to SFr187m. Total new orders were up 4.9 per cent to SFr2.2bn, and orders on hand at the end of June were SFr2.65bn, 0.4 per cent lower than at the end of 1993. The group said the SFr51m in new orders for rolling stock was nearly double the level in the year earlier but was below expectations.</p>

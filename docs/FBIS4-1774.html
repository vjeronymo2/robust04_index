			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Liang Chao: "Emergency Funds To Combat Drought"] </F>   [Text] The central government yesterday approved a 28  million yuan ($3.2 million) emergency fund to fight the severe  drought devastating North China.    The money will go to cash-strapped local governments and  farmers who cannot afford to pump water to their fields, said an  official of the State Anti-Drought Office (SADO) who declined to  be identified.    The drought has affected more than 17 provinces, regions and  cities since last autumn and poses a major threat to spring and  summer crops.    North China's major grain producing provinces will be  particularly hard hit, said the official.    The severe drought threatens to destroy over 4 million  hectares of wheat and made it difficult to sow 9 million  hectares last month, SADO said.    Meanwhile, more than 6.8 million people and over 34 million  heads of livestock are suffering from a severe shortage of  drinking water.    Some rain is expected this month in North China, according  the latest weather forecasts.    But it is too early to estimate its impact, the official  said.    The affected crop land accounts for 4.5 percent of China's  farmland, the official added.    But its impact on crops has been much greater.    Beijing and Tianjin and Hebei and Henan provinces have been  plunged into the worst spell of dry weather.    Hebei Province has only received 3.8 millimeters of  precipitation -- 68 percent less than in normal -- since last  December.    And the soil moisture content there has dropped sharply due  to dry and windy weather. Many plants are dying right after  they sprout.    At least 30 percent of the province's wheat farms have been  badly affected, SADO's statistics said.    The province's major reservoirs contain only 700 million  cubic metres of water, while many small reservoirs in the area  have dried up.    Ground water has even dropped three metres in some parts of  the province.    Similar reports have come from Beijing, Tianjin, Henan,  Shaanxi and Gansu. Barely any rain has fallen west of Qinghai  Province.    To fight the drought, local authorities have renovated  irrigation ditches and conserved water.    To date, they have brought badly needed water to more than  3.2 million hectares of wheat farms.</p>

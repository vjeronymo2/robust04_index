			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 2 KYODO -- The chance of an immediate  cabinet reshuffle planned by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is  getting slim because of tight political schedules and opposition  from some coalition parties, coalition sources said Wednesday [2  March].    Hosokawa said he will make up his mind Wednesday on whether  to push for shaking up his nearly seven-month-old cabinet after  hearing final responses from leaders of the seven coalition  parties to his scheme, the sources said.    "I'd like to make a final decision (on the matter) during  Wednesday after judging the situation as a whole," he said at a  session of the House of Councillors' panel on political reform,  which started deliberations on amendments to a package of  political reform legislation.    Hosokawa is eyeing the cabinet reshuffle possibly Thursday  after the upper house panel has approved the amendments, the  sources said.    The primary purpose, it is widely believed, is to replace  top  government spokesman and chief of staff Masayoshi Takemura, who  has been in discord with Hosokawa since late December over such  important government political themes as the partial opening of  the rice market and the abortive imposition of a "national  welfare tax," the sources said.    Takemura, the chief cabinet secretary, told Hosokawa in a  meeting Tuesday that a cabinet reshuffle could lead to the  collapse of the coalition government, other coalition sources  said.    Takemura maintains that he will not take another cabinet  post  if the premier reshapes his cabinet, they said.    Among the coalition partners, a pessimistic view has begun  to  prevail that Hosokawa may have to give up the plan because of a  tight Diet business schedule and strong opposition from three  coalition blocs.    Hosokawa and three cabinet ministers will make major policy  speeches to both houses of the legislature after the cabinet  submits to the Diet the 73.08 trillion yen state budget for  fiscal 1994.    The full upper house is expected to endorse the amendments  to  the political reform package designed to help clean up Japan's  politics Thursday or Friday. The more powerful House of  Representatives approved them Tuesday.    Among the seven coalition parties, the Social Democratic  Party (SDP), Sakigake (Harbinger), headed by Takemura, and the  Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) are opposed to a hasty cabinet  reshuffle, while Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and Komeito are  endorsing the plan.    In a series of talks with Hosokawa on Tuesday, SDP chairman  Tomiichi Murayama asked the premier to drop his intention for an  early shake-up, pointing to the need for the cabinet to be  united to tackle economic issues such as strained economic ties  with the United States and the enactment of the fiscal 1994  budget.    Murayama, head of the largest coalition component, told  Hosokawa that the party opposes the replacement of Takemura,  warning that such action will damage the coalition foundation,  the sources said.    DSP chairman Keigo Ouchi, who serves as health and welfare  minister, also expressed objection to a hasty cabinet reshuffle.    Ouchi told reporters that the premier cited as a major  reason  for the plan growing complaints within the ruling coalition and  from bureaucrats about Takemura's work as the top government  spokesman and chief policy coordinator.    Shinseito leader and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata,  meanwhile, told Hosokawa that the party will support the plan to  reshape the cabinet.    Hata told reporters he has notified Hosokawa of his backing  in a meeting at the premier's official residence.    "Behind the premier's plan is his desire to run the cabinet  more smoothly. We support that kind of notion," said Hata, who  is leading Shinseito along with Ichiro Ozawa.    Ozawa, who is regarded as the coalition's chief strategist,  has expressed support for Hosokawa's plan to reshuffle the  cabinet.</p>

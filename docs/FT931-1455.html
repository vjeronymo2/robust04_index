			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Town Centre Mr Arnold Ziff, chairman of Town Centre Securities, the Leeds-based property investment and development group, yesterday launched a stinging attack on government policy regarding the rating of empty premises. 'This is probably the first time in history that any government has been so stupid as to put a tax where there is no income. 'If the powers that be cannot realise the consequences of this iniquitous tax . . . then there is little hope for the future of the building industry in this country.' Mr Ziff's statement accompanied the group's results for the six months to December 31 which showed profits ahead 10 per cent to Pounds 3.65m (Pounds 3.31m) before tax. The interim dividend goes up to 1.1p (1p), payable from earnings of 2.4p (2.21p) per share.</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / International Company News: Norsk Hydro slides into the red and cuts payout NORSK HYDRO, Norway's biggest stock-listed company, slid into a net loss of NKr498m (Dollars 77.2m) in 1991 from a profit a year earlier of NKr2.9bn, the company reported yesterday. Hydro's poor result was due to a non-recurring NKr2.9bn charge against accounts for the restructuring of its agriculture and magnesium divisions. In 1990, the company charged NKr200m against accounts for restructuring. Local analysts had expected Hydro to incur net losses of between NKr400m and NKr500m. The company is cutting its dividend from NKr4.25 to NKr3.50 a share. Operating revenue was little changed at NKr61.4bn against NKr60.9bn, and operating income fell sharply to NKr922m from NKr6.7bn. 'All of Hydro's activities showed a weaker operating income in 1991 than in 1990 - even before taking 1991 restructuring charges into account - due mainly to weak demand and lower product prices,' the company explained. In the final quarter, Hydro made a net loss of NKr1.53bn, against a profit of NKr1bn in 1990. The fourth-quarter operating loss was NKr2.08bn, in contrast to profits of NKr2.1bn a year earlier. Hydro said its agriculture division would achieve an annual cost reduction of NKr800m from restructuring, while efficiency efforts in other divisions are expected cut total annual costs by NKr1.5bn 'gradually' during the next couple of years. Our most cyclical businesses - aluminium and petrochemicals - are holding up much better than in previous recessionary periods,' said Mr Egil Myklebust, Norsk Hydro's president. On a divisional breakdown, agriculture slid into a net operating loss of NKr649m from a profit of NKr1.29bn. Oil and gas, the group's best performer, saw operating income fall by NKr823m to NKr2.49bn. Light metals made an operating loss of NKr1.18bn against a profit of NKr1.28bn. Petrochemicals saw operating profits fall to NKr432m from Nkr1.01bn.</p>

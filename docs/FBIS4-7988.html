			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Crvenkovski Meets With Businessmen"] </F>   [Text] Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] businessmen met with Prime Minister  Crvenkovski in the Chamber of Commerce yesterday. They  discussed the situation and problems in the economy and the  enforcing of the government stabilization program in the first  three months of the year. They said the situation in the  economy was extremely difficult. Some firms' reproduction  processes are highly endangered by financial instability. The  total production is on a decrease due to high working  expenditure and foreign blockade. The decrease is even up to 40  percent in some companies. All this is accompanied with big  losses, debts, no current reproduction, considerable unpaid sums  by foreign firm, restrictive monetary and interest rate  policies, public expenditure, and absence of foreign  investments. The situation is most difficult in agriculture,  the metallurgy, production of the means of transportation, the  textile industry, construction, and trade.    Prime Minister Crvenkovski agreed the situation is alarming  and pointed out government's readiness to react daily to it, but  said long-term solutions must be sought. Macedonia must produce  high-quality products and find markets for their distribution,  Crvenkovski said.    As for the reconstruction of 25 Macedonian firms, Minister  Jovan Andov said the World Bank would aid only those with  programs which guarantee the firms would work effectively in a  market economy after the reconstruction.    Chamber President Dusan Petreski said Macedonia still has no  market economy and businessmen must sit down and work out a way  out, instead of only criticizing.</p>

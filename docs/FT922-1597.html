			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / People: Building up Amec construction John Dean, joint managing director of BICC's Balfour Beatty construction arm, has taken over as chairman of Amec's mechanical and electrical activities in a move to strengthen the management of a part of the Amec group which has been hard hit by the recession. Dean, 51, replaces Mike Kersey, 50, who becomes deputy chairman. Kersey, a veteran Mathew Hall man, joined Amec after it acquired Mathew Hall in late 1988. Amec's mechanical and electrical businesses account for an estimated 25 per cent of the group's profits and turnover and Dean's appointment suggests that Amec is anxious to take a tighter grip on what is one of its toughest businesses. Malcolm Hawe, architect of Amec's ill-timed expansion into housebuilding, has also been replaced recently. Kersey surprised some analysts, they noted that Amec and Balfour Beatty share similar cultures and often work as partners on the same construction projects. Dean has spent 18 years with Balfour Beatty including stints as managing director of Balfour Beatty Engineering &amp; Services and chairman of Balfour Beatty America. Balfour Beatty itself has been undergoing a management shake-up following the surprise departure of chief executive David Cawthra last September. However, Dean resigned in January, and says that his decision to quit had nothing to do with BICC's decision to look outside the group for Cawthra's replacement. He describes his departure as 'very amicable'. However, as part of the re-organisation, the old Balfour Beatty top management organisation has been disbanded. Haro Bedelian has become deputy to Peter Mason, the new chief executive hired from Norwest Holst last month, and Ian Carroll has been put in charge of all the group's channel tunnel power activities and made chairman of Balfour Kilpatrick. BICC says that Dean is not being replaced.</p>

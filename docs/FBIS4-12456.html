			<p>BFN     [Text] Sidon, Lebanon, April 8 (AFP)--Two radical  Palestinian factions said they attacked a militia patrol in  south Lebanon Friday.    The Popular and Democratic Fronts for the Liberation of  Palestine said in a joint statement that they fired on a patrol  of Israel's proxy South Lebanon Army (SLA) in the west of  Israel's self-declared security zone.    The statement said the factions blew up an armored vehicle,  killing or wounding its crew.    Voice of the South radio said a civilian vehicle had been  attacked close to Shqif al-Naml without causing any victims.    Security services confirmed an SLA patrol had come under  fire  but could not give details of any casualties.    The two factions are opposed to the Middle East peace  process  and the Israel-Palestine Liberation Organisation autonomy accord  signed in Washington in September.</p>

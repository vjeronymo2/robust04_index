			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Afghan hostages to go free Pakistan yesterday confirmed that an Afghan warlord is due to release 11 Pakistani and two Chinese hostages today or tomorrow in a Saudi-brokered deal. Mullah Abdul Salaam 'Rocketi', as the warlord is popularly known, ordered the kidnappings in retaliation for a Pakistani security forces' operation at his stronghold in Afghanistan's south western Zabul province, almost three years ago, in which three US-made Stinger missiles were recovered. The anti-aircraft missiles were supplied under a CIA covert operation to back the Afghan mujahideen against Soviet occupation. US officials have been trying to recover them and western diplomats have been concerned over the possible threat to aircraft. It is not known how many missiles have been returned.</p>

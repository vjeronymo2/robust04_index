			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Brussels shelves measures to harmonise drug prices MEASURES to harmonise European Community drug prices have been shelved by the European Commission. Although such measures were desirable, they were not possible at present, Sir Leon Brittan, Commission vice-president responsible for competition, said yesterday. He suggested that subsidiarity, the principle of allowing decision making at the lowest possible level, influenced the Commission's decision. The immediate effect of the decision is likely to be an increase in the level of parallel imports - shipments of identical drugs from lower price countries, outside manufacturers' official distribution channels. This would work to the advantage, for example, of drugs wholesalers and big customers such as the National Health Service. Pharmaceuticals companies had feared harmonisation would force prices down to the lowest levels in any EC country, hitting profits in what is intended soon to be the world's largest unified market. Governments, however, had been concerned that prices might be harmonised upwards, stretching already limited healthcare budgets. Sir Leon said drug prices in countries such as Portugal, France, Spain and Greece were often half those for products in Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands. 'With such disparate forms of pricing regulation, markets remain resolutely national, and consumers are not able to reap the benefits of a free market. Thus the present situation runs counter to the most basic objectives of the Treaty of Rome,' he said. Sir Leon said the Commission would now consider the best way to encourage price harmonisation through an evolutionary process. There was a strong case for abandoning all direct price control. Such controls were an ineffective means of controlling healthcare expenditure because they did not limit the volume of drugs prescribed by doctors. The Commission, he said, was likely to recommend measures to prevent national price-setting bodies favouring domestically manufactured products. A much-delayed document on the means national governments use to set drug prices is expected to be published before the end of the year. Increased use of parallel imports was one means of encouraging competition, Sir Leon said. Parallel trade presently represented only 2 per cent of EC prescription drug sales. Sir Leon also stressed the need to substitute branded drugs with cheaper unpatented generic products which he said was common practice in the US.</p>

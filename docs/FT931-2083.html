			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / International Company News: State to float majority stake in Dutch telecoms THE DUTCH government has decided to sell a majority stake in the state telecom company PTT, ending months of speculation over what proportion of the company would be privatised, Reuter reports. The first tranche of the flotation will be offered to the public next year. The exact amount to be sold, who will arrange and underwrite the offer and what level the company will be valued at remain the subject of debate, financial sources said. But at an estimated total value of Fl 15bn (Dollars 8bn), the fight for rich adviser fees is under way. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, was named adviser to the company at the end of January. Dutch, British and US firms head the field of contenders for the more lucrative underwriting and co-ordinating roles. PTT will have to jockey for postition in an already-crowded European privatisation calendar. In addition to the third tranche of British Telecom, PTT is competing against several at least three other groups, including Germany's Deutsche Bundespost Telekom and Sweden's Procordia.</p>

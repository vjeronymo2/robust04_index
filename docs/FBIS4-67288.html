			<p>Prosecute   MP   <F P=102> BK1905051694 Bangkok THE NATION in English 19 May 94 p A4 </F> <F P=103> BK1905051694 </F> <F P=104>  Bangkok THE NATION </F> <F P=105>  English </F> BFN     [Text] Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut yesterday  ruled out the possibility of embattled MP Thanong  Siriprichaphong being prosecuted in Thailand unless Washington  provides more evidence to substantiate drug trafficking  accusations against him.    Chawalit said after meeting with other senior officials  concerned that the U.S. government had only provided a copy of  its indictment against Thanong. That was not sufficient to  prosecute a case before a Thai court, he said.    At the meeting with Chawalit were Deputy Permanent Secretary  Ari Wong-araya, Interior Ministry legal adviser Chailoet  Ditsamnat, national Police Chief Prathin Santipraphop, Deputy  Police Chief Pol Gen Phot Bunyachinda, Assistant Police Chief  Thanu Homhuan and Chawalit's personal secretary, Sonchai  Montriwat.    "The copy of the U.S. indictment cannot alone be used as  evidence to substantiate drug allegations against Thanong. The  police cannot do anything at present," Chawalit said.    The minister has ordered Prathin to ask the Drug Enforcement  Administration (DEA) for more details relating to the charges.    Chawalit also said he wants more information from Washington  about Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri's revelation that 17  other Thai MP's stand accused by the U.S. of being involved in  drug trafficking.    Chawalit has ordered the Office of Narcotics Control Board  to  gather evidence related to the Thanong issue. Prathin said he  is awaiting additional information from the Foreign Ministry.    Asked to confirm a Chat Thai Party statement that Thanong  faces only six months in jail if convicted here of drug  trafficking, Chawalit said he does not know the penalty involved.    Given adequate evidence, Prathin said, Thanong would not  escape prosecution on any drug charges just because of his  stature or influence.    Attorney General Ophat Arunin said yesterday the government  should decide quickly whether to extradite Chat Thai MP Thanong  Siriprichaphong to face drug trafficking charges in the United  States.    Ophat will testify today before the House committee on  parliamentary affairs which is investigating the issue. He  would infomm the committee of all information he received from  U.S. officials.</p>

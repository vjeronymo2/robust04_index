			<p>BFN     [Text] The first joint army exercise between Singapore and  the Philippines, a combined battalion live-firing exercise,  ended yesterday with the successful capture of "enemy"  objectives.    Singapore's Chief of Army, Brigadier-General [BG] Lim Neo  Chian, and the Philippine Army's Commanding General,  Major-General Romulo Yap, jointly officiated at the closing  ceremony at the Safti [Singapore Armed Forces Training  Institute] live-firing area, after witnessing the assault.    The live firing was the climax of the week-long combined  land  exercise involving the Singapore Armed Forces [SAF] and the  Philippine Army, held under the Anoa-Singa series of exercises.    It was the first bilateral army exercise between the two  countries to be held in Singapore.    Anoa-Singa 2/94 is conducted under a Memorandum of  Understanding the two countries signed earlier this month. It  provides for regular joint exercises between the two armed  forces.    A 200-strong Philippine Army contingent took part in the  exercise, with 600 SAF personnel from the 1st and 2nd  Battalions, Singapore Guards.    Speaking at the closing ceremony, Maj. Gen. Yap said that  the  exercise had forged closer understanding and cooperation between  the two armies.    He said that it had also provided the Philippine Army with  its first opportunity to train with a "fellow Asian".    Its previous army exercises have been with only the United  States.    Maj. Gen. Yap added that Singapore's Total Defence concept  was useful to note at a time when the Philippine Army was itself  strengthening its reserve force.    On the Singapore end, BG Lim said that the SAF troops found  the lectures given by their Filipino counterparts on  psychological operations beneficial.    Major James Lim, the Commanding Officer of 2nd Guards, said  that the exercise gave the troops the chance to familiarise  themselves with each other's doctrines and operating procedures.    He said the live-firing exercise was a display of mutual  trust and respect for the skills of the soldiers of both armies.    The exercise, a battalion attack mission, went smoothly,  although the soldiers carried it out with men whom they were not  thoroughly familiar with, he added.    He said: "The element of trust comes in because live rounds  are being used. The exercise requires the soldiers to depend on  others who give support fire with artillery and tanks.    "Doing it with your own men requires trust, what more, doing  it with soldiers from another army whom you don't know as well."    Maj. Lim said that the battalion live firing was also a show  of respect by the soldiers for their counterparts'  professionalism and skill.    Soldiers going into a live-firing exercise must have a high  level of individual skill before they take part.    He said: "Obviously, the soldiers saw for themselves how  proficient the Filipinos were.    "I think they felt the same way about our SAF soldiers too,  after interacting with us."    The most important outcome, Maj. Lim said, was that after  practising and going through the live firing together, the men  have come out better friends.    The next bilateral exercise between the two armies is  scheduled to be held next year in the Philippines, at the Fort  Magsaysay training area.</p>

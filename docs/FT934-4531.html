			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Treasury to repay Pounds 380,000 lost taxes The Treasury has agreed to pay the Inland Revenue Pounds 380,000 after financial irregularities by its catering arm involving payments to staff over 10 years, John Willman writes. The sum will cover tax and national insurance contributions which should have been deducted from the pay of casual staff employed by Forward Civil Service Catering, a Treasury agency. The National Audit Office last year revealed financial irregularities in the agency, including mismanagement and fraud. Sir John Bourn, head of the audit office, says in his report on the Treasury's 1992-93 accounts that the total loss to public funds could be Pounds 900,000.</p>

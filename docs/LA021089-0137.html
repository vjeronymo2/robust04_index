			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> POLICE ARREST 23 IN ANTI-GANG SWEEP  </P> <P> A police anti-gang task force of two dozen officers arrested 23 people in a  sweep of the Venice area, authorities said Thursday.  </P> <P> About half of the suspects arrested during the seven-hour operation that ended  early Thursday were gang members, Sgt. Robert Tumas said.  </P> <P> The sweep was conducted despite a storm that drenched the region.  </P> <P> "Normally, the rain keeps people inside. (But) when you're talking narcotics  and gangs, weather doesn't keep them in," Tumas said.  </P> <P> The operation involved officers with the department's Pacific Division and  anti-gang investigators. The 23 suspects were arrested on a variety of charges  including possession of narcotics and outstanding warrants. Officers also  confiscated a double-edged dagger from a gang member, Tumas said.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, police ran two similar task-force operations in Venice and  have arrested a total of about 60 people in the area since Jan. 1, Tumas said.  </P> <P> The operations are much smaller than the highly-publicized sweeps in South  Central Los Angeles involving as many as 1,000 officers. But the goal is the  same -- "To keep the gang element off balance," Tumas said.  </P> <P> Gang-related violence in Los Angeles County claimed a record 452 lives in 1988,  surpassing the previous record 387 killed in 1987.  </P> <P> Police Chief Daryl Gates named 1988 "The Year of Gang Enforcement" and sent  hundreds of officers on weekend sweeps through gang-infested areas of the city.  In a series of sweeps from February 1988 through last November, police arrested  more than 24,000 people, including about 13,500 gang members.  </P></p>

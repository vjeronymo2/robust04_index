			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MICHICAN STATE AND SMITH WIN ALASKA SHOOTOUT 73-68  </P> <P> The story of the championship game of the Great Alaska Shootout was too much  Steve Smith and not enough Steve Henson.  </P> <P> Michigan State had Smith, and that proved pivotal as the Spartans beat Kansas  State 73-68 in Monday night's championship basketball game.  </P> <P> Smith, named the tournament's outstanding player, scored 17 points, handed out  11 assists, grabbed 6 rebounds, made 2 steals and blocked a shot in the final.  </P> <P> "Smith obviously really controlled the ballgame and dictated a lot of things,"  Kansas State Coach Lon Kruger said. "They're big and strong and whipped up on  us."  </P> <P> Henson, who had directed Kansas State to two comeback victories earlier, was  hampered by a thigh injury and spent most of the day in bed with the flu. He  finished with 14 points but played only 28 minutes.  </P> <P> Kruger refused to use that as an excuse.  </P> <P> "He was not quite himself, but that's part of the game," Kruger said.  </P> <P> Michigan State Coach Jud Heathcote, who says Henson reminds him of the great  Spartan guard Scott Skiles, admitted that he was worried when Henson's jump  shot made it 65-60 with 1:21 to go.  </P> <P> "We were concerned -- I don't think panicked, but concerned," Heathcote said  after watching his team fritter away most of a 16-point lead in four minutes.  </P> <P> But Kirk Manns sank six free throws in the final 81 seconds to enable the  Spartans to hold on.  </P></p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Equity Markets: Bonds hold key to price endurance - New York Investors this morning are wondering if the market has finally established a floor to support share prices. If so, will it eventually provide a platform for a sustained upturn? The answers, as usual, may lie in bonds. The direction which stocks took last week, in the days following Mr Alan Greenspan's Monday morning surprise, has encouraged a few more market observers to raise their heads above the parapet and look optimistically toward the horizon. The big lift came Thursday, when news of IBM's robust first-quarter results inspired a 53-point blue-chip rally. The surge suggested a mild reaction to the Federal Reserve's third move to tighten money at the beginning of the week. A steady market on Friday reinforced that view. In the short-term, Mr Gregory Nie, technical analyst at Kemper Securities in Chicago, sees good potential for a 'limited upside' this week, with the Dow industrials possibly testing the 3,700 level if bonds continue to firm. 'My hunch is that we are at the beginnings of trading range that could easily take up the rest of the second quarter,' says Mr Nie, although he cautions there is still evidence to suggest the correction in share prices is not over. The key remains long-term interest rates, as reflected in the yield bid on the benchmark 30-year US Treasury bond. Mr Nie believes blue chips could move higher if the yield approaches the 7.00 per cent level. Late Friday, it was hovering near 7.22 per cent, down from 7.41 per cent at Monday's close. Mr Hugh Johnson, chief investment strategist at First Albany, agrees rates will continue to rule, but he sees the likelihood of more volatility ahead. 'Where we go from here will depend very much on how the leading indicators of inflation play out of the next two weeks,' he says. The direction of oil and industrial material prices and manufacturing data from the National Association of Purchasing Management due next week was particularly important. 'My guess is that we are likely to see more unsettling news,' he says. 'For that reason, the correction in stock prices is not over.' Mr Johnson says the issue is not whether the Fed will again raise rates, but how much it will need to do so before inflation expectations recede. The issue is likely to shape Wall Street's reaction to this week's batch of corporate earnings, in particular results from General Motors. Ms Mary Farrell, PaineWebber's market strategist, says IBM last week brought a change in psychology which allowed the market to refocus on corporate earnings, which have generally exceeded even the most optimistic forecasts By contrast, Mr Johnson believes investors are too concerned about the impact of higher rates on future profitability to pay much attention to first-quarter news. 'You simply cannot conclude as blandly as we once did that the earnings momentum will continue.'</p>

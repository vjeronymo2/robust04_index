			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / International Company News: Magnetic agrees second TT bid TT GROUP, the rapidly-expanding conglomerate run by Mr John Newman, former acquisitions manager at Hanson, has launched an agreed Pounds 11.8m bid for Magnetic Materials, the Slough-based manufacturer of magnetic components. Last year MMG fought off a hostile bid by TT. The offer is three new TT shares for every 10 MMG, with a partial cash alternative which allows accepting shareholders to receive approximately 50 per cent of their consideration in cash. At last Friday's closing price of 215p per TT share, the bid values MMG group shares at 64.5p, compared with the closing price of 54p. TT already speaks for just short of 40 per cent of MMG's shares, as a result of its unsuccessful bid in 1991 which was worth Pounds 9.9m. Mr Brian Morris, chairman of MMG, said because of TT's resources 'MMG will be better placed to exploit the growing worldwide markets for our products.' TT also revealed that it had held preliminary talks with the board of AB Electronics, the electronics group in which it recently bought a 7.41 per cent stake. TT described the talks as 'constructive' but said discussions regarding its proposed merger are at an early stage. In March TT bought a 7.5 per cent in ML Holdings, another electronics components manufacturer.</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Pressurised gas There are signs that the government may be hesitating about deregulating the British gas industry. A long-awaited Gas Bill has yet to emerge, and reports suggest that the Cabinet may have decided to demote the subject on its agenda. If this is the case, something must have deflected the government from the course it adopted at the beginning of this year when it set a clear timetable for reform of the gas market. One guess is that ministers have taken a closer look at the price implications of deregulation, and heeded the warnings from British Gas that millions of households would end up with higher gas bills as a result of greater competition. This is because an open market would drive out the cross-subsidies which have kept the bills of more modest consumers of gas low at the expense of larger users. But it is late in the day for a change of heart. Last year's thorough report by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission concluded that deregulation would be in the national interest. And although the arguments have received a further airing since then, no fresh problems have surfaced that could not be dealt with by the market regulator. It is true that, from the government's point of view, there is little short-term mileage to be had from deregulating gas: there are no privatisation proceeds, and any price rises that do occur will be unpopular. But this anxiety has to be set against the longer term economic benefits of improving the efficiency of Britain's energy infrastructure by encouraging competition. Ministers should not give up just as they enter the last lap.</p>

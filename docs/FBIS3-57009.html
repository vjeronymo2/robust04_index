In his  words, Kravchuk is to assess the results of the first round of  voting in Crimea shortly. The pro-Russian candidate Yuriy  Meshkov won that round, collecting twice the number of votes  (about 40%) than his runner-up Nikolay Bahrov, the Crimean  Parliament's Chairman.    In Jamilev's opinion, the Ukrainian leadership "made several  mistakes in regard to Crimea." The main error, according to  him, was "Ukraine's recognition of Crimea as an autonomous  republic after a referendum on January 20, 1991."    The Majles leader foresees possible conflicts in the  peninsula, if Meshkov becomes president of Crimea. He called  Meshkov "a hypocrite without principle" and said that "Kiev is  aware of that." He revealed that "the Majles leadership has been  in close touch with Kiev by telephone."    He believes that "Crimean chauvinists are backed up by some  elements in Russia morally and materially." "To avoid tension  with Ukraine," he stressed, "Russia should somehow restrain the  Crimean separatists." One such measure, in his view, could be  Moscow's pledge not to make territorial claims to Ukraine.    At a session in Simferopol today, Majles is to announce its  position toward the second round of presidential elections  scheduled for January 30 in Crimea.</p>

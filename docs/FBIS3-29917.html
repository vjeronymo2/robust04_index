After 30 minutes of fighting, the invading troops were  dispersed and forced to retreat. We killed five enemy soldiers  and wounded 18 others; and we seized 15 AK rifles, three B-40  rocket launchers, a B-41 rocket launcher, a 60-mm mortar, a  field radio, and some ammunition.    On the same day, the people and NADK attacked and routed  Vietnamese communist puppet soldiers at the checkpoints on the  stretch of Route 3 between L'ang and Phnum Thvea in Chhuk  District. We destroyed two military tank trucks and killed two  enemy soldiers and wounded five others.    The Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed government  on  11 February mustered and sent 300 soldiers from the 9th and 6th  Regiments of the Province and District of Battambang and the 5th  Military Region to plunder property of the residents living in a  Democratic Kampuchea-controlled area east of Battambang. They  attacked us from two Directions: The first was from Pralai  Thmei to Ta Hen along the Stoeng Chas River and the second was  from Khvang to (Rohai Chhak Tea). The people and NADK, however,  ambushed, routed, and forced the invading forces to retreat. We  killed five enemy soldiers and wounded eight others.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jarmo Aaltonen and Mikael Pentikainen: </F> "Finland's EU Membership Won't Reduce Domestic Farm Subsidies --  Draft of Government's Decision: 12-Billion Agriculture Package  Next Year"]    [Text] The volume of Finland's farm subsidies will not be  reduced in conjunction with European Union [EU] membership.  About 7 billion [Finnish] markkas [FMk] a year in farm subsidies  will be necessary even after the transition period.    There will, however, be a bigger bill during the first year  of membership: About FMk12 billion will be needed for the food  industry as well as for farming and truck farming.    These figures are included in the draft of the Council of  State's decision in principle prepared for cabinet ministers by  committees of government officials.    "The farm sector won't be imposing a greater burden on  taxpayers than at present after the second year of membership,"  they estimate in the government.    According to the draft of the government's decision, FMk2.7  billion in domestic subsidies will be needed for the food  industry next year. Of that figure 2.2 billion will go toward  compensation for the sharp drop in value of food stocks.    Without the subsidies to compensate for the drop in value of  stocks, subsidies would total 1.8 billion over the five-year  transition period for the industry, 600 million of which we will  try to obtain from the EU.    No more than FMk500 million of the aid money would be used  for research, product development, the promotion of exports, and  marketing. A national structural subsidy of 700 million will be  required for investments and to eliminate overproduction.    It is estimated that state grain reserves will account for  FMk1.4 billion of the losses attributable to stocks. Valio, for  example, will need 70 million for the change in the stock  situation.  <H5>  Farmers Compensated by Strengthening of Markka </H5>   According to the draft, FMk5.8 billion a year of tax revenue  will be set aside for long-term national farm and truck farm  subsidies. EU approval will be required for these subsidies.    "A sufficient portion" of the 1.7-billion-markka EU farm and  truck farm environment subsidies will be set aside "for  especially sensitive areas and special measures." The EU will  pay for half of these subsidies, or FMk850 million.    Farmers are promised compensation in the form of possible  changes in currency exchange rates at the rate of 1 ECU = 6.30  markkas. If the markka is strengthened by 10 percent, this will  mean an estimated increase in value of FMk400 million.    Farmers are promised that compensation for vacation  substitutes and social security will remain unchanged. At the  present time over a billion markkas a year goes for vacation  substitutes and a couple of billion for pensions. These  expenditures are not included in the 12-billion package.    Farms would also receive compensation for marketable crops  right from the start of membership in the EU. The lowering of  costs in the livestock industry would be subsidized with a price  supplement system that will, according to the decision, be  "remarkably high," especially next year. If the EU does not  allow it, the subsidy will be paid as a livestock subsidy.    To be approved annually, the price supplements for special  crops and livestock products will be paid until 1999. A  supplementary allowance for reducing [cultivated] surface area  would be paid for just as long a period. The truck garden  industry would get a separate subsidy package.    The government estimates that transition period subsidies  would cost FMk3 billion the first year, 1.3 billion the second,  and 800 million the third. The subsidies would be terminated by  the end of the century.    During the transition period we would try to use the EU  early  retirement system to our advantage, especially as concerns the  hog-raising and poultry industries. Furthermore, an  interest-rate ceiling of 4 percent would be imposed on loans  granted to farmers between 1977 and 1991.    Forty million markkas a year would be allocated for interest  subsidies for truck garden enterprises and 20 million for  abandonment [of farms] arrangements.    The total cost of transition period structural subsidies  would come to from FMk200 to 500 million a year until the end of  the century.  <H5>  Top Tax Rate for Food Products </H5>   A value-added tax of 22 percent would be imposed on food  products in the model presented by government officials. The  current sales tax is about 16 percent after the primary product  deduction. Opportunities to provide for farmers will be  increased, and farm property will be assessed on the basis of  the value of the income it produces as concerns inheritance and  gift taxes.    The energy tax on greenhouses would be eliminated or  credited  as refunds.    During the transition period farmers would be given the  right  to a retroactive deduction of the value-added tax on investment  commodities. As concerns farmers and truck farmers' income tax,  they could deduct half of what they owe, which exceeded  FMk300,000 at the end of last year, over a period of five years.</p>

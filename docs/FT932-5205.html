			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Survey of Mid Glamorgan (2): Old industrial image dies hard  -The south and the north of the county are two very different areas MID GLAMORGAN has an image problem. It is still widely perceived as heavily industrialised, with old coal tips and abandoned ironworks scarring the countryside. In many ways this impression is understandable. The county has had a proud industrial history and its core activities are in terminal decline - there is now only one coal mine operating in the whole of south Wales compared with 70 at the time of nationalisation in 1947. The county remains the most industrialised part of Wales, and in parts it has some of the poorest housing stock and lowest living standards in the UK. Yet it is in many respects two counties, a curious mix of industry and agriculture, mountains and seashore, wealth and poverty. The business profile has changed dramatically in recent years as high tech has replaced high stack. The main boundary line is the M4 motorway which acts as a life line and deliverer of inward investment, but which effectively divides the county in two. To the north lie the former coalmining valleys of the Rhondda, Rhymney and Taff, potentially attractive with hills and woods, but where the scars of the industrial revolution and the loss of jobs have brought the main challenge of regeneration. To the south lies the other Glamorgan, a lush coastal plain of rich farmland and pretty villages, and a varied coast with great tourist potential. To the east of the Ogmore river is an attractive heritage coast of cliffs and coves centred on Ogmore and Southerndown, where development is strictly controlled and where it is easy to escape the crowds by walking a few hundred yards. To the west is the traditional family holiday resort of Porthcawl, with a big caravan park recently upgraded, good sands and one of the best golf courses in the country. Porthcawl, where visiting international rugby teams once stayed before big matches in Cardiff, is now faded, and has been in decline since its Victorian and Edwardian heyday, but the local Ogwr borough council has put forward a tourism strategy to revive its attractions. Studies show that tourism, particularly in Porthcawl, with its Coney Beach funfair attracts over 1m visitors a year, to the borough, contributes Pounds 25m to the local economy and supports 2,000 jobs. It is, therefore, too important a facility to lose and plans have been put forward for a town centre development at Porthcawl, including an inner harbour for 200 boats, a swimming pool and residential and commercial developments. The borough of Ogwr, Welsh for Ogmore, is centred on Bridgend and is in many ways quite different from the rest of the county. A study by Glasgow University in 1990 on quality of life ranked Ogwr first among all Welsh districts surveyed and among other districts along the M4 corridor. It was seen as above average in its low-cost owner-occupied and private rented accommodation, its cost of living, health and education provision, and sports and shopping facilities. Although the borough has a relatively high level of unemployment, this is largely because of the influence of the north of the county, where relatively few jobs have been created in the industrial valleys. The corridor along the M4 has been a magnet for new industry, and inward investment has held up remarkably well during the recession. Big multinational names like Ford and Sony have led the move into Mid Glamorgan. Ask any inward investor about the attractions of the area, and you will hear of good communications, and a stable workforce. On the map, south Wales might appear isolated and on the fringes of the European Community, but from Tokyo or Detroit an uncluttered motorway, generous grants and a relatively cheap workforce are more relevant considerations. A recent example is Sony, which has completed a Pounds 150m television factory and research centre at Pencoed employing 1,400 to complement its 20-year-old facility at nearby Bridgend which now concentrates on the production of cathode ray tubes. Although few places in Mid Glamorgan are further than 30 minutes from the motorway, there remains a perception that the valleys are isolated and it has been much harder to attract new jobs. The valleys remain the heart of south Wales and of Mid Glamorgan, however. Because of their geological structure the valleys look south to the plain of the Vale of Glamorgan. They rarely look east and west towards each other and can therefore be self-contained and isolated. A government report on Wales 20 years ago said that new industry in the valleys had only partially replaced the old economic base of coal and steel. In many valleys it was physically impossible, because of the lack of flat land in the steep-sided terrain, to provide jobs on the necessary scale. The conclusion was that the valley communities were likely to rely to an increasing extent on work within reasonable travelling distance, and this remains the view. The valleys are bound to be at a relative disadvantage in attracting development compared with the coastal plain, and the future must lie in linking into the relative economic prosperity of the M4 corridor. The valleys are no longer a separate economic entity; the two parts of the county are set to become more interdependent.</p>

			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / World Trade News: US plans to broaden trade index - Private sector services and merchandise trade balance to be combined MR Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, is to clarify the US trade picture by ordering a new quarterly index which will combine private sector services and the merchandise trade balance. He said in a letter to Mr Harry Freeman, executive director of the MTN Coalition, a US business group, that this would allow the US to move beyond the conventional definition of the trade balance. The department's statisticians were also 'assessing the feasibility of producing monthly estimates of trade in goods and services,' he added. The new index, which will be introduced in June, will demonstrate the point that services lobbyists have long been stressing: that the US trade deficit is not as bad as it looks. From the quarterly current account figures a new entry - called private services - will collate exports and imports from the US services sector, bringing in air passenger travel, inbound tourism, professional services, financial services, audio/video rentals, construction and engineering services, education of foreign students, and insurance and medical services. In 1992 the trade in private services between the US and the rest of the world gave the US a Dollars 59bn (Pounds 38.3bn) surplus. If this is subtracted from the Dollars 96bn merchandise deficit, the trade deficit was Dollars 37bn. Trade in services is an important issue in the US relationship with Japan. In a defence of its trade regime, released last week by the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, Tokyo claimed its surplus had failed to take into account services, such as transport and travel. The US surplus in the services sector would grow, it added, as Japan was not competitive there. Indeed, the US has been making slow gains in the balance of its trade in services with Japan - the surplus rose from Dollars 8.9bn in 1989 to Dollars 13.2bn in 1992. This is likely to continue. The US had a Dollars 10bn surplus last year with Japan in travel and passenger fares, one of the biggest growth areas for receipts. As long as Japan remains prosperous and expensive it is unlikely to draw more American tourists than the US does Japanese. The US ran a Dollars 2.7bn surplus with Japan on 'other services' - which include telecommunications. Most telephone calls and data transmissions are initiated from the US, where the industry is deregulated and its services comparatively cheap. The fifth largest US services export is education, a sector which includes thousands of students studying at US colleges and which holds growth promise. Mr Freeman sees a time when US - and perhaps Canadian - schools will form consortiums to bring foreign students to North America for study in programmes funded by development banks or governments.</p>

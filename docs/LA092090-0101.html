			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: FILLMORE;  </P> <P> COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUS CONSIDERED  </P> <P> Fillmore is being considered by the California Community College state  chancellor's office as a site for a community college center branch to be built  between 2001 and 2005.  </P> <P> The recommendation came as part of a study released this week that says 25 new  college sites and centers are needed to accommodate student growth over the  next decade.  </P> <P> Community college enrollment is expected to jump from 1.4 million this year to  1.9 million by 2005, state officials said.  </P> <P> Last year, Ventura College had 461 students from the Fillmore area. About 564  Fillmore residents attend classes at the three-college district, with another  200 attending off-campus classes, according to the district.  </P> <P> Barbara Derryberry, Ventura County Community College District chancellor, said  the district recommended to the chancellor's office in January that additional  campuses be considered in the Conejo Valley, Camarillo and Fillmore.  </P> <P> "With 25 campuses and centers being considered, we were certainly pleased one  of those is in Ventura County," she said.  </P> <P> Public hearings on all the sites are scheduled Oct. 23 in Los Angeles and Oct.  24 in Sacramento. Afterward, the chancellor will make recommendations on the  expansions to the board of governors, said Ann Reed, a spokeswoman for the  state chancellor's office. The board is expected to act by January.  </P> <P> The Fillmore campus would be a small learning center that would offer general  education courses in addition to vocational education programs, said Lyn  MacConnaire, vice president of instruction at Ventura College.  </P> <P> Eventually, it would become a full-service campus with broad course offerings  and facilities such as an auditorium, library and counseling staff.

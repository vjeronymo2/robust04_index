			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: Varig offers board seats for financial aid Varig, Latin America's largest airline, has proposed offering board seats to McDonnell Douglas and General Electric in return for their help with its financial restructuring. The Brazilian carrier said it had signed letters of intent with the two US companies to restructure its payments to Eximbank of the US for aircraft. Varig owes Eximbank more than Dollars 600m. A board seat will be given to Varig's Brazilian creditor banks and one more will be decided by Varig, McDonnell Douglas and General Electric. The other five board seats will remain under Varig's control. Varig said the proposals did not involve changes in the shareholding of the airline, which is controlled by an employees' foundation. General Electric has agreed to buy Varig's six Boeing 767 aircraft, which had been purchased with Eximbank funding, for Dollars 204m. Varig will continue to use the aircraft. McDonnell Douglas, which sold Varig four MD-11 aircraft, will pay the principal on the debt for the next 18 months, totalling Dollars 72m, while Varig will continue to pay the interest.</p>

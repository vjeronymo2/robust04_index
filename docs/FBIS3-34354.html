Meanwhile Sudanese opposition sources have said that  the gunmen, two of whom were killed and a third wounded, are  "Arab Afghans" [Arabs who fought alongside Afghan mojahedin  against Soviet forces]. [passage omitted]    Mubarak al-Mahdi, official in charge of external action in  the opposition Ummah Party and former interior minister, has  said that the mosque incident was carried out by a Sudanese  group whose members' features indicate that they are either from  western or southern Sudan, according to the testimonies of some  eyewitnesses. They were wearing Sudanese costumes. Their faces  were veiled. [passage omitted]    In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday, Mubarak  al-Mahdi said yesterday that the al-Riyadh district incident  differs from the Shaykh Abu-Zayd Mosque incident. It can be  said that the former (the al-Riyadh incident) is linked to a  process of settling accounts and disputes within the "Arab  Afghans" groups present in Sudan, which are armed.    He said that linking the al-Riyadh incident group and the  al-Thawrah incident group "is an attempt to conceal the  operation carried out by security services to terrorize citizens  and oppositionists, especially as mosques have become platforms  for the opposition."    He added that "the government is responsible for the two  incidents, because it allowed these elements to enter Sudan.  And its attempt to lay the responsibility on foreigners is  unacceptable. It opened the door to foreigners, the Arab  Afghans, and others, granting residence, citizenship, and the  right to carry firearms." [passage omitted]</p>

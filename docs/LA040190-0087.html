			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GIVE YOUR HOME A LIGHT TOUCH ALL OVER  </P> <P> Good lighting has emotional as well as physical rewards, according to an  article in House Beautiful, and there are many ways you can upgrade your  lighting with a minimum of fuss or expense, says the magazine.  </P> <P> Kitchen: If kitchen lighting is not directly over work surfaces, you're  probably standing in your own shadow. If the room has one central ceiling  fixture, you probably never have sufficient light on any work or cooking area.  Here are some options:  </P> <P> Track lighting may be the easiest remedy; you can install it yourself. Placed  directly over the edge of counters, it will provide essential task light for  cooking and cutting surfaces. If you have an island work center, you can  connect adapters to the track and mount hanging fixtures directly overhead.  </P> <P> Under-cabinet lighting, either incandescent or fluorescent, is another option.  Incandescent can be easily and inexpensively dimmed. Always mount under-cabinet  lighting as far forward as possible, away from the back wall, so light is  focused directly on your work rather than behind it.  </P> <P> Consider over-cabinet lighting, if your ceiling is high enough. You can install  individual fixtures or continuous lighting strips -- incandescent, fluorescent  or halogen.  </P> <P> Halogens offer white light and longer lasting bulbs, but will usually require a  transformer for household use.  </P> <P> Build a cove or soffit around the upper reaches of your room and install small  continuous-lighting sources that will provide up-light, which bounces off the  ceiling.  </P> <P> Standard recessed fixtures are available that don't require ceiling demolition  or special installation. They are called "install from below" or "old-work  housing." The only problem may be feeding in the necessary wiring. Check with  your electrician.  </P> <P> Dining room: If your dining room is like most others, it is lit by a single  chandelier, placed dead center. If the dining table must share the room with a  china cabinet or sideboard, chances are it is off-center from the chandelier.  </P> <P> Consider replacing it with surface-mounted or recessed ceiling fixtures. Or you  can install several semi-recessed fixtures arranged in a square, circle or  triangle pattern over the table.  </P> <P> Another option is to mount sconces on either side of French or sliding doors, a  china cabinet, an important painting or a doorway leading to another room.  </P> <P> Living room: In addition to table and floor lamps, consider adding up-lights  that sit discreetly on the floor to light dark corners, highlight plants or  create a warm glow behind a chair or table. Installing opaque shades on  traditional lamps will cut glare without seriously reducing overall light.  </P> <P> In rooms with high or cathedral ceilings, try adding up-light wall sconces or  floor lamps.  </P> <P> Bathroom: The best way to light a bathroom mirror is by mounting one or more  incandescent fixtures on the same wall as the mirror. If your present fixture  is in the ceiling right over the vanity, you're getting a distorted mirror  image with strong, unnatural shadows under your eyebrows and chin.  </P> <P> Bedroom: Unless your bedroom also is your dressing area, general illumination  may be less important than mood lighting, which can be achieved with up-lights  or strategically placed table and floor lamps.  </P> <P> Bedside light should be amiable, so you can adjust it to suit any reading  position, and highly focused, so neither spouse is disturbed if the other stays  up late to read.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME RENOVATION  </P> <P> A designer who is unfamiliar with building codes or refuses to adhere to  recognized minimum standards of life safety does a disservice to his or her  client. A case in point is the "whitewashed temple of light" designed by  Schweitzer.  </P> <P> It may be a piece of sculpture, but it is in violation of many minimum  building-code requirements.  </P> <P> Each stairway is approximately twice as steep as is allowed, neither has a  handrail, and open sides require guardrails. The one guardrail shown is much  too low to be in compliance with the code.  </P> <P> This remodeling job (I assume) had to have been done without the benefit of  plans being reviewed by the local building department or a permit being issued  because these violations are so flagrant. These are the types of improvements  that have to be listed as non-conforming when trying to sell a house and may  have to be corrected. A client would be pretty distressed in later years to  learn that he couldn't sell his house (or piece of art) as is.  </P> <P> If a client brought this article to me and asked for something similar, I would  have to tell him it couldn't be done. I don't know of any contractors that  would jeopardize their licenses by building this space.  </P> <P> RICHARD K. PETERSON  </P> <P> Alta Loma  </P></p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): AEU vote lessens likelihood of strikes at Vauxhall THE LIKELIHOOD of strikes at Vauxhall, the General Motors subsidiary, diminished yesterday after a vote against such measures by AEU engineering union members at the Luton manufacturing and parts plants, Michael Smith writes. Although all unions at the company's other plant in Ellesmere Port, Merseyside, voted to strike, it is unlikely that union leaders would sanction stoppages which do not involve all workers at all sites. Nonetheless, limited industrial action against a pay offer remains a possibility. Virtually all unions at all three plants have voted for action short of a strike. The exception is the EETPU electricians' union at Luton, but it has relatively few members there. The ballots were ordered in protest against the company's offer of a two-year pay deal in which basic pay would rise by 5 per cent in the first year, starting last October. The second-year rise would be pegged to the inflation rate and workers would also receive a one-off payment equivalent to 0.5 per cent of pay. Unions believe the offer, marginally less than that won by Ford workers, is too low. They are also angry about the company's refusal to include a cut in working hours in the package. At Ellesmere Port, members of the TGWU general workers' union voted by 4-1 to strike and 57 per cent of AEU members were in favour. Shop stewards at Ellesmere Port may press for one-day strikes at the plant but it is unlikely that national union leaders would sanction such action. One reason why Luton workers are less militant over the proposed deal than their colleagues on Merseyside is that they are in line for further increases of 5 per cent on top of the national pay deal. The payments are linked to, and conditional on, acceptance of changes in working practices and bargaining procedures. Ellesmere Port workers agreed to similar changes last year and received 5 per cent rises then.</p>

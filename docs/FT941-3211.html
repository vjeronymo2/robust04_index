			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Scottish unemployment forecast to exceed 10% Unemployment in Scotland, which fell 0.1 per cent in February to 9.3 per cent, was yesterday predicted to rise to 10.1 per cent by the end of the year. The rise will come as companies responded to increasing price competition by shedding permanent staff and making more use of overtime, says the prediction, which comes from the Fraser of Allander Institute of Strathclyde University, Scotland's main economic forecaster. It implies that Scotland will have a slightly higher unemployment rate during recovery than it experienced during the recent recession. Seasonally adjusted unemployment peaked early last year at 9.9 per cent. The institute believes that the number of people employed will fall by about 20,000 by the end of 1994, with service industries losing 11,000 jobs and manufacturing shedding between 4,500 and 5,000 jobs. The institute says falls in employment are not matched by equivalent rises in registered unemployment, possibly because of people going into part-time work, or retiring. It expects unemployment to rise by about 5,000 by the end of the year. The unemployment rate will fall again in 1995 as output increases further. Manufacturing output, which grew by 2.2 per cent in 1993, should rise by 3.3 per cent in 1994. While the Scottish economy would benefit from improved export prospects and lower interest rates, the benefits would be offset by the effect of value added tax on heating bills and proportionately greater curbs on public expenditure.

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Tapie arrested in dawn raid on his Paris home: Marseilles MP-businessman held on fraud and tax charges In the latest act of France's most watched politico-judicial soap opera, Mr Bernard Tapie, the Marseilles MP-businessman, was taken by police at dawn yesterday before a magistrate to be put under investigation for fraud and tax evasion concerning his yacht. The police swooped on Mr Tapie's Paris mansion at 6.05am, five minutes after the earliest time at which they are allowed to enter private houses, and were greeted by a string of obscenities by Mr Tapie, whose French parliamentary immunity against prosecution in this case was removed by the National Assembly on Tuesday evening. After being charged with 'insulting representatives of the law', Mr Tapie appeared before Mrs Eva Joly, an investigating magistrate. She placed him formally under investigation and released him after impounding his passport and identity card and confining him to France until July 18. This is the day before Mr Tapie is due to be sworn as a new Euro-MP, granting him fresh parliamentary protection. Mrs Joly is understood to have feared that Mr Tapie might leave the country until July 19 to cover his temporary lack of immunity. The latest allegations against Mr Tapie relate to ACT, a company ostensibly set up to manage his four-masted yacht, the Phocea, as a commercial enterprise. Investigators allege that Mr Tapie systematically failed to bill ACT properly for his use of the yacht, thereby artificially increasing ACT's deficits which Mr Tapie used to decrease his own tax liability. As a result, the French tax authorities accuse Mr Tapie of underpaying his 1989-91 taxes by FFr12.4m (Pounds 1.46m). The other main allegation concerns a FFr80m loan by a Credit Lyonnais subsidiary in 1992 to ACT, of which FFr55m is said to have been funnelled to other Tapie companies, with FFr9m going to increase Mr Tapie's stake in the Olympique-Marseille football club. On Tuesday, Mr Tapie went before the National Assembly to deny 'any deliberate action on my part' to defraud the French tax authorities. But French deputies voted massively, by 462 and 465 votes to 10, to remove his parliamentary immunity on the two charges. The vote came after Mr Tapie sought to raise the political stakes as high as he could. Warning his colleagues of a backlash from the nearly 2.5m people who had voted for his 'Energie Radicale' list in the June 12 European election, the leftwing populist politician said that 'if you agree to remove my immunity, it is to some extent your own immunity that you would be removing'. French deputies are only covered by immunity during parliamentary sessions, and the assembly's regular summer session ends today. But European parliamentary immunity is full-time, once it starts. However, the Strasbourg assembly's lawyers admit there is a 'grey zone' about when this immunity begins.</p>

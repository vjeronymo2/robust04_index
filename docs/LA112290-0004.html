			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAMES BAKER'S STATEMENT ON JOBS AND IRAQ  </P> <P> Baker implies that military action against Hussein would be justified to  prevent Iraq from controlling much of the world's oil supply, thus leading to  "the loss of jobs on the part of American citizens" (Nov. 14).  </P> <P> What a Faustian bargain this is, trading jobs for lives! Think of the irony if  Hard Hat Harry spends his overtime pay on a new TV in time to see his son or  daughter on the evening news being killed or mutilated on the sands of Arabia!  </P> <P> In the name of sanity, let's raise our voices against this grotesque trade-off  while there's still time.  </P> <P> ROBERT ENGLISH, Santa Barbara  </P></p>

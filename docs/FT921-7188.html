			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Army to shed 3,350 uniformed personnel THE ARMY will this week send redundancy notices to 3,350 uniformed personnel ranging in rank from sergeant to brigadier in the first wave of armed-forces cuts under the government's Options for Change review. Further personnel cuts are planned in the next two years, each about twice as large as this year's and bringing total army redundancies to about 16,000. The first wave is already bigger than the redundancies across all three services which followed Labour's 1974-75 defence review. Those were the last significant redundancies, although there were also several hundred in the early 1980s. The Army, faced with much heavier cuts than the RAF or Navy, is pressing ahead while the other services are still considering their own measures. It aims to achieve the remainder of its planned 40,000 reduction by recruiting 8,000 fewer soldiers a year than regularly leave its ranks. This will leave it with 104,000 trained personnel in three years' time. Almost all those being made redundant have volunteered, except for 160 of the 850 officers involved. For the 2,500 redundancies among other ranks, 4,000 applications were received. Voluntary redundancy was offered to non-commissioned officers between the ages of 30 and 40 and officers between 40 and 52, depending on rank and specialisation. The army is giving six months' notice, extended to one year for those facing compulsory redundancy. The compensation package includes up to 18 months' pay and a gratuity of three times annual pension, in both cases tax free. Those who have served 12 years or more are entitled to an immediate pension. General Sir David Ramsbotham, the adjutant general (the army's personnel chief), said assistance would have to be extended to families, including training for wives, housing and in some cases a boarding-school allowance. At a meeting organised by Drake Beam Morin, the out-placement consultants, last week, he said the deal was 'quite as good as anything anybody else offers' but added that he expected some appeals against the decisions.</p>

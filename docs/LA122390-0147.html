			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN OLD SONG ENDED  </P> <P> By J. D. McCLATCHY  </P> <P> at Christmas  </P> <P> All earthly pomp or beauty to express  </P> <P> Is but to carve in snow, on waves to write.  </P> <P> Celestial things, though men conceive them less,  </P> <P> Yet fullest are they in themselves of light;  </P> <P> Such beams they yield as know no means to die,  </P> <P> Such heat they cast as lifts the spirit high.  </P> <P> Your tire tracks have spoiled the snow outside,  </P> <P> And inside, where there's something wrong, the stem's  </P> <P> Corrupt but slick subtext is magnified  </P> <P> In the vase beneath a Star of Bethlehem.  </P> <P> If nature disappoints, as it appears,  </P> <P> Whom do we trust when each the other fears?  </P> <P> When once the stars had crossed themselves to light  </P> <P> A way for kings, or show as angels to the boy  </P> <P> Minding his flock, who stares to see the night  </P> <P> All changed into a story quick with joy,  </P> <P> Now is nothing but fire, nothing but air.  </P> <P> The only pattern here's this view, this chair  </P> <P> It's difficult to look for long at snow,  </P> <P> When most of heaven's fallen to earth out there.  </P> <P> A scalding brilliance poured over the cold.  </P> <P> Trees, the road, your car -- lost in the glare.  </P> <P> To steep myself in light, then close my eyes . . .  </P> <P> These winter days are darkness in disguise.  </P> <P> Sunlight and snowlight streaming in behind.  </P> <P> Is blindness, then the gift you give before  </P> <P> The rest? -- forgiveness, say so hard to find  </P> <P> In what's at hand, the common day which seems  </P> <P> At last the light that yields such heat, such beams.  </P> <P> From "The Rest of the Way" (Alfred A. Knopf: $18.95; 80 pp.). copyright 1990 by  J. D. McClatchy. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.  </P></p>

The Korea Labor Institute (KLI) has recommended the step and  Labor Minister Nam Chae-hui has approved it, KLI President Kim  Tae-mo said Tuesday.    President Kim Yong-sam ordered humane treatment of illegal  foreign workers Jan. 13, when the Labor Ministry reported on its  new year agenda, and Nam instructed KLI to study the matter, Kim  said.    The recommendation is based on Article 5 of the Labor  Standard Law, which says that a foreign worker in the country  and with a contract, even if it is illegal, cannot be treated  unfairly on the basis of nationality or religion.    There are some 56,000 illegal alien workers in the country  and most work for small- and medium-sized industrial companies.    It is KLI's argument that the government tacitly approved  their contracts by overlooking their illegal presence and  employment and it must therefore take the responsibility.    Before the Ministry can take any action, it must discuss the  matter with the Justice Ministry, which opposes labor rights for  illegal aliens under Article 15 of the Immigration Control Law,  which says foreigners without residential qualifications as  stated by the president may not be employed.</p>

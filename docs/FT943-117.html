			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Credito Italiano shares hit by fund-raising plans Shares in Credito Italiano, the recently privatised Italian bank, fell nearly 5 per cent yesterday after it announced plans to issue new shares and warrants to raise up to L1,520bn (Dollars 975.6m) for acquisitions. The decision to raise more capital - announced late on Wednesday - comes four months after Banca Commerciale Italiana, also privatised earlier this year, decided to raise L1,575bn with a similar discounted share issue. The BCI issue was fully subscribed when it closed last week, but investors in both cases have demonstrated their disappointment that the banks want to raise capital so soon after privatisation. Credito Italiano's issue will be priced at L1,500 a share, compared with Wednesday's closing price of L2,246. Yesterday the shares fell to L2,140. BCI shares also slipped yesterday, from L4,081 to L3,950, as the market absorbed news that Consob, Italy's stock exchange watchdog, would not call for a formal bid to be launched by corporate investors who bought stakes in the two banks after privatisation. Critics of the sell-off claimed that allies of Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank, had taken effective control of Credito Italiano and BCI. However, Consob said on Wednesday there was not enough evidence of a secret pact between the company's large shareholders to prompt an obligatory bid. Credito Italiano also announced a fall in the parent company's net profits, to L83.5bn for the first half of 1994 from L133.5bn in the same period last year, after incurring paper losses on its share and bond portfolio. Financial operations reported a loss of L215bn in the first half, compared with a profit of L176bn in the first half of 1993. As well as the issue of new shares and warrants - on the basis of two new shares for every five held - Credito Italiano is to issue one new bond with warrants attached for every five shares held, raising a further L1,120bn. Separately, Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, the state-controlled Italian bank, has announced a rise in parent company net profits to L40bn from L27bn in the first half of 1994, although the poor banking climate meant pre-tax profits were lower than in the equivalent period. The first-half results of Banca di Roma, another of Italy's biggest banks, have also been affected by difficult trading. Gross operating profit fell 20 per cent to L788bn, after write-offs and provisions of L571bn.</p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Wealthy backers share high cost of going to law JUDICIAL REVIEW of the Maastricht treaty's ratification does not come cheap. Lord Rees-Mogg has been able to bring his application to the High Court only because he has financial backing from wealthy opponents of the treaty, particularly Sir James Goldsmith. This week's High Court hearing will cost tens of thousands of pounds a day, with the final cost of the case multiplying if, as expected, it goes on to the Court of Appeal. Mr Jeremy Nieboer, a senior partner at solicitors Gouldens which is handling the case, said a limit had been set for the cost of the case. Lord Rees-Mogg's case was put by Mr David Pannick QC, yesterday, supported by three other barristers. Normal charges for top barristers taking the brief would suggest fees of Pounds 25,000, with further charges amounting to Pounds 3,750 for each day of the hearing. Putting the case for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is Mr Sydney Kentridge QC, supported by three other barristers. This is likely to cost a further Pounds 25,000 in brief fees and Pounds 3,500 a day to appear at court. Lord Rees-Mogg might have to pay the Foreign Office's costs if he loses the case. Three other eminent - and expensive - barristers have been involved in preparation of the case: Mr Leolin Price QC, who represented Lord Rees-Mogg at the first application for judicial review, Mr John McDonnell QC and Sir Patrick Neill QC, warden of All Souls, whom the anti-Maastricht camp had originally hoped to make their lead counsel for the hearing. Mr Jeremy Nieboer said he had become involved in the case in February and it had taken up most of his time since June. The services of a leading solicitor costs upwards of Pounds 180 an hour, so the practice account could total tens of thousands of pounds.</p>

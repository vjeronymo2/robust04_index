			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Ye. Taran: "Such Diplomatic Bankers"] </F>   [Text] A press conference of specialists from the  largest Dresdner Bank in Europe and Banque Nacionale de  Paris--here to participate in the seminar on banking  business--was held yesterday in Kazan.    Naturally, journalists were interested not so much in the  fine points of the banking business as in the prospects of  cooperation between European banks and Tatarstan enterprises,  and the possibility of receiving secured loans. However, neither  the Dresdner Bank representative, Dr. Martini, who essentially  answered all correspondents' questions, nor the rest of the  press conference participants said anything specific in this  respect. Western bankers intend first to study the situation in  the Russian and Tatarstan economies and identify preferred  investment projects, and only then to talk about money.    It seems, though, that even after the "study" one can hardly  count on loans. For instance, according to Tatsotsbank Chairman  of the Board Lyudmila Kitaitseva, Dresdner Bank representatives  already had studied the possibility of extending credit and have  not discovered any obstacles, but are in no hurry to begin  working together. Interestingly enough, the Tatsotsbank still  found foreign currency loan money for its clients--right here in  Tatarstan.    Or this fact. During the Republic of Tatarstan delegation's  visit to Germany a protocol of intentions was signed with  Dresdner Bank on providing loans to Tatarstan for specific  projects. Either the projects are not ready yet, or the German  side has its doubts, but we still do not have these loans. At  least Dr. Martini was unable to answer why intentions remained  on paper.    By the way, foreign bankers did not conceal that right now  they can only help us verbally and with papers (that is,  educational materials on banking business); as to more  substantial cooperation, this is a matter for the future.  However, the possibility of opening branches of Dresdner Bank  and Banque Nacionale de Paris in Tatarstan is currently under  study.    Overall, however, our guests have displayed a truly  diplomatic finesse: They answered journalists' questions for  more than 40 minutes but said very, very little.</p>

The invitation came from Burmese Foreign Minister U Ohn  Gyaw,  and was delivered to Squadron Leader Prasong after he returned  from Hanoi on Saturday, the officials added.    Burma's Ambassador to Thailand U Phone Myint delivered the  invitation the officials noted.    Sqn Ldr Prasong spoke of the invitation from Rangoon during  talks in Canberra yesterday with Australian shadow foreign  minister Andrew Peacock.    As part of a four-day visit to Australia, Sqn Ldr Prasong  also met Defence Minister Robert Ray and paid a courtesy call on  Prime Minister Paul Keating yesterday.    According to a Thai Foreign Ministry report, Mr Peacock  expressed the view that Sqn Ldr Prasong should accept the  invitation from Rangoon.    Officials in Bangkok said details of the trip would be  worked  out after Sqn Ldr Prasong returns this weekend from visits to  Australia and New Zealand.    Senior officials of the Association of Southeast Asian  Nations (ASEAN) two weeks ago agreed to invite Burma, in the  capacity of a non-participating "guest", to attend the annual  meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers in Bangkok in July.    The ASEAN ministers made clear that Burma's foreign minister  would be a "guest" of host country Thailand, not of the grouping  as a whole.    During talks in Canberra yesterday Foreign Minister Prasong  called the ASEAN decision the start of an effort to bring Burma  out of isolation, the Thai Foreign Ministry report said.    The minister made the point when the Australian side raised  questions about "constructive engagement" with Rangoon, the  report added.    "On the question of Burma, Australia and Thailand do not  differ on principles of democratic government and problems of  human rights," the report noted. "However, methods may differ  because Thailand has a common border with Burma," the report  said.    On Cambodia, Foreign Minister Prasong reiterated that  Thailand recognises the elected government and supports a  political solution to the current strife in the country, the  report noted.    "The Thai side believes political means should be applied to  solve problems in Cambodia because there will be protracted  fighting if the government side seizes territory and the Khmer  Rouge employ guerrilla tactics to resist," the report added.</p>

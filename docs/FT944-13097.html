			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Russians fear for health in wake of oil spill For Mrs Cheslava Potova, mayor of the tiny settlement of Kolva on the river of the same name, the amount of oil that has seeped into the land around her village recently has been a difference only of degree. 'The pollution in the river is such that there are hardly any fish left  - it had been a staple food here. Now, when you catch one, it reeks of oil,' she said. The oil spill from a temporary dam, caused by a ruptured pipe, prompted international fears this week of an environmental disaster in the Arctic. But the reaction by the authorities has been slow - oil oozed into the river a month ago and it took three days for 'specialists' to arrive for the clean-up. 'I don't say people were afraid, but they do think of the future and want to make sure this does not happen again. People were very unsettled and upset,' Mrs Potova said. 'We drink milk from the cows and we eat food grown in the soil all about us. We do not know how much oil it might contain. The banks of the river are already polluted with oil, and people are worried about their health.' In Usinsk, the nearest large town, 40km from the spill, Mr Yevgeny Leskin, director-general of the Komi Arctic Oil joint venture, revealed why the area's inhabitants are right to worry. 'Such accidents are not uncommon in Russia, although this one was more serious than most. The accident happened in mid-August, but the rains broke the dam only in September. The oil flooded the marshes. The workers tried to dam the flow into the Kolva river but we reckon about 2,500 tonnes got into it.' Mr Leskin, whose company helped with the clean-up, said about 11,000 tonnes of oil remain in the marshes. He said it would be cleared before the April thaw, which could spread it again. The Russian environment ministry said yesterday that offers of help from abroad would not be taken up until the scale of the accident was fully known. However yesterday an appeal for help was made by Mr YA Spiridonov, president of the Komi republic, to the Northern Forum, the multinational Arctic group. Accounts of the amount of oil leaked range from the official inquiry report of 14,000 tonnes to US calculations of 100,000 tonnes. Komi authorities estimate that the clean-up could cost Rbs60bn (Pounds 12m), while western estimates have put the figure as high as Pounds 62m. The official news agency Itar Tass took the unusual step last night of publishing a list of fires, oil spills and pipeline breaks affecting the Komi Republic's oil complex. It said 8,000 tonnes of oil leaked into the Pechora River in June 1992 - 18 months after a fire had destroyed an oil well in the region. In March 1988, 20,000 tonnes of oil leaked from a corroded pipe and, in 1986, a pumping station fire caused damage worth Pounds 120,000.</p>

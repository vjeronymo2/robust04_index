			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Banks close to deal on property bad debts LEADING Japanese banks are close to agreeing their first concerted action to deal with their huge property-related bad debts. These debts, caused by the steep fall in property prices over the past two years, could handicap the banking industry for several years. The banks plan to set up a joint body which would purchase from them property used as collateral for non-performing loans. It is understood the banks reached an outline agreement yesterday on the structure of a joint company. Mitsubishi Bank is believed to have played a leading role in the talks, and the Bank of Japan has been kept fully abreast. Official estimates have put bad debts at about Y7,000bn to Y8,000bn (Pounds 33.8bn-Pounds 38.6bn). However, revised figures, due for release by mid-October, are likely to show a sharp rise, and banking industry executives admit privately that bad debts may amount to between Y30,000bn and Y60,000bn. The possibility of the banks receiving government help has met with heavy criticism in the popular press. A joint organisation in which the banks are seen to be taking the lead in sorting out their problems is widely seen as a pre-condition for any tax concessions to ease the bad debt burden. The proposed joint body would play a vital role in establishing the extent of bad debts and thus helping the banks to cleanse their balance sheets. As the property market is so sluggish, many banks have been unable to sell their holdings and establish the scale of their losses. Banks would jointly finance the company, which they would own in proportion to the extent of their bad debts. It would initially purchase relatively marketable property used as collateral on non-performing loans at a price set by independent assessors. The joint company would then be responsible for eventually selling the land in the open market. In addition the company would be allowed to buy and sell claims on loans which have real estate as collateral. Meanwhile, the government yesterday began transferring public funds into bodies which will invest in the stock market through trust banks to help underpin share prices. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications trans-ferred Y1,000bn into the Postal Life Insurance Welfare Corporation. Disappointment that more public money has not yet flowed into the stock market helped to push the Nikkei average below 18,000 yesterday. The stock market has rallied strongly since the government announced an emergency economic package in late August. The package, which is due to be approved by the Diet later in the autumn, increases the ceiling on public investment via trust banks from Y1,700bn to nearly Y2,800bn.</p>

Sha'th told reporters that the two  sides formulated proposals to transfer powers of 12 Israeli  Civil Administration departments to the Palestinians. He felt  that within two days the entire issue could be finalized.    The Palestinian delegation head said also there had been  some  progress on security issues, but nothing was final on the  question of the Jericho enclave area, and on the border crossing  points. He said that the negotiations were taking place in a  positive atmosphere.</p>

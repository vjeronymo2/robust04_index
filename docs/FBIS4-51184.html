			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Meng Ming (1322 2494) and reporter Peng Zecheng (1756 </F> 3419 2052): "While Inspecting Troops, PLA Logistics Department  Director Fu Quanyou Calls for Persisting in Rigorous Troops  Management and More Effective Logistical Support"]    [Text] Wuhan, 28 April (JIEFANGJUN BAO)--Today, when  inspecting a military unit in Wuhan, Fu Quanyou, member of the  Central Military Commission and director of the General  Logistics Department of the People's Liberation Army [PLA],  required the logistics units to follow the guidance of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and building the armed forces in the new period,  to carry out Chairman Jiang's general instruction of "measuring  up to standards politically, mastering military skills  perfectly, keep the fine style of work, enforcing discipline  strictly, and ensuring logistical support effectively," to  effect rigorous troop management, to build and manage strategic  warehouses according to high standards and with good quality, to  properly manage strategic materials, to improve supplies for the  troops, and to comprehensively enhance the troops' fast reaction  capacity and strategic support capacity.    Fu Quanyou said: To effect rigorous troop management, we  should first give top priority to the work of enhancing the  political and ideological integrity of the troops; closely link  study of the third volume of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping  with the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, with  the study of Chairman Jiang's important speeches and the  principles and policies laid down by the party Central Committee  and the Central Military Commission, and with the study of the  theories and basic knowledge about the socialist market economy;  link such studies with the thinking and routine work of the  troops; enhance the consciousness and firmness of officers and  servicemen in carrying out the party's basic line; keep a high  degree of uniformity ideologically and politically, and act in  unison with the party Central Committee and the Central Military  Commission; and firmly obey the orders of the party Central  Committee and the Central Military Commission with Comrade Jiang  Zemin as the core at any time and in any circumstances. It is  necessary to strictly enforce discipline and take this as the  central link in routine troop management. Routine troop  management should be combined with routine ideological work.  Resolute action should be taken to correct the loose and lax  conditions in troop management, discipline enforcement, and the  work style of the troops. Troops must act strictly according to  orders and instructions issued by the upper commanders. Leading  organs and officers must set a good example for their  subordinates and men in this regard so that "iron units" in the  logistics front will be created. The behavior of the troops  must be strictly brought into line with the relevant orders,  rules, and regulations so that a regular and orderly condition  can be established in war preparations, training, routine work,  and daily lives. Management of war materials must be  strengthened, construction and management of infrastructural  facilities must be improved, good state of war preparations  should be kept for all types of materials, guarantees should be  made that necessary materials and equipment will be delivered to  the right places as soon as the orders are received, and efforts  should be made to ensure implementation of the "Program for the  Building of Grass-Roots Units." Fulfillment of all tasks for  the logistical organs will eventually be dependent on the work  of the grass-roots units. Party committees and commanding  organs at all levels should, according to the "Program for the  Building of Grass-Roots Units" and Chairman Jiang's five-point  general requirement, regularize and guide the work of  grass-roots units, attach importance to their work, concentrate  attention on their work, guarantee various services for them,  improve the ability of the grass-roots party branches to  exercise comprehensive leadership, help grass-roots cadres  command their men, and improve the material and cultural lives  of officers and men so that a solid foundation can be laid for  troop building.    Fu Quanyou emphatically pointed out: Party committees and  leading organs at various levels of the logistical front should,  according to the instructions of Comrade Deng Xiaoping and  Chairman Jiang, give education to cadres and soldiers with  regard to outlook on life, values, and morals in connection with  new conditions and problems; deepen education in patriotism,  collectivism, and revolutionary heroism; effectively carry out  the activities of "loving the valleys, loving the warehouses,  and loving the work posts;" extensively carry out the activities  of emulating such heroic figures as Lei Feng and Xu Honggang;  guide officer and men to carry forward the "five revolutionary  spirits" advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the  "64-character pioneering spirit" advocated by Chairman Jiang, to  willingly resist the corrosive influence of the decadent  ideology, and to make themselves revolutionary soldiers meeting  the "four requirements."    Zhou Youliang, deputy director of the General Logistics  Department, accompanied Fu Quanyou to inspect the work of the  military unit in Wuhan.</p>

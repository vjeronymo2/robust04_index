			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gabriella Farkas, outgoing deputy executive </F> chairman of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, by Rita Csik; place  and date not given]    [Text] In the future, the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]  will rely more on party members' voluntary work. As a result of  the member survey, it will soon become clear how many people  have left the party. We spoke about this and about possible  cooperation among the opposition in the course of the coming  local government elections with Gabriella Farkas, the outgoing  deputy executive chairman of the MDF. The Executive Committee  has put Gabriella Farkas in charge of guiding the party machine  until the national conference scheduled for the autumn.    [Csik] The MDF Executive Committee asked its members in  writing to indicate whether they continue to feel themselves as  party members. What is the reason for this survey of members?    [Farkas] The results of the recent elections and the  subsequent slightly bitter mood of the members justifies the  question of whether we can and want to continue working. This  way, we can see who are the members that we can count on both in  the course of the experts activity helping the party's  parliamentary group and in the local government elections.  There will, obviously, be people who say that they no longer  want to continue with us, but I do not think that there are many  of them. If we did not take the risk in facing up to this, we  would be having to build on sand.    [Csik] The party will have to say goodbye to 320 paid  employees out of a total of 400. Does this mean that the  structure developed in the past four years will also change?    [Farkas] According to our election results, our budget  support will decrease considerably. This is why we have to  reduce the apparatus both in the central office and the  provinces. Although we are streamlining our party, the system  and principles will remain the same; we will be able to rebuild  all of this without special restructuring when we have the means  to do so.    [Csik] The opposition, including the MDF, will now represent  a much smaller weight in parliament than in the past four years.  Will there be any possibility of opposition politics at all?    [Farkas] If the government coalition wants it, they can pass  almost everything through voting. However, I think that,  through the committees, we will have the chance to assert our  opposition position. The composition of our parliamentary group  is fortunate too, because we can send expert and well-trained  deputies to every parliamentary committee. I simply do not  believe that it can happen in a democratic parliament that a  better proposal than that of the government party is rejected  merely because it comes from the opposition.    [Csik] Local government elections will be held in this  autumn. Can you envisage cooperation between the opposition  parties to defeat the government parties?    [Farkas] I am convinced that there is a need for local  cooperation. Not only because this is a possibility that brings  results, but also because only this can be a successful policy  in local political activity. Local political activity should be  "above" the parties participating in the election struggle. One  of the most important principles is who can do most for the  given town or village. I can envisage a situation in which the  opposition parties will run with a common candidate in many  places or they will support each other's candidates.    [Csik] The MDF will hold a national conference in autumn. To  what extent will the leadership change?    [Farkas] The MDF national conference will have to complete  the "documentation" of the election defeat. We will not be able  to start building if we drag out this analysis for too long.  Our election failure was not only due to human error or  mistakes. The kamikaze role that the party accepted in 1990 is  among the major causes of our defeat. I hope the causes will be  examined honestly and the election of a new leadership will be  made accordingly. If we do not do this, we will be going the  wrong way. It is absolutely certain that part of the leadership  will change. Obviously, the members are dissatisfied with some  leaders, but some members of the leadership will be needed for  continuity. This will not be another party. This will remain  the Hungarian Democratic Forum.</p>

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Clearing a path to the facts: How to avoid being fobbed off when seeking access to official information One of Whitehall's best kept secrets over the past seven months has been the government's guidelines on access to official information. Launched in April amid claims that it would open up to the public previously secret documents and research, the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information has so far proved to be a damp squib. Figures on how many requests have been made under the code are not yet available but officials believe the number is tiny. Most of the publicity the code has received has been negative. Last week, for example, the Campaign for Freedom of Information released details of a survey which found that some departments are demanding money up-front before they even agree to handle inquiries. In spite of this Mr Maurice Frankel, director of the campaign, wants to encourage wider use of the code. He said: 'Try not to be put off by the charges as they can be appealed against.' Mr Frankel argues that though the code has obvious flaws, the presence of a referee - the Parliamentary Ombudsman - to rule on disputes between individuals and civil servants is a big step forward. Below is the Financial Times's seven-point guide for businesses and individuals wanting to make the best use of the code: 1. Starting out Get a list of the departments and quangos covered by the code, contact names and addresses, and a copy of the code by telephoning 0345 223242, or by writing to Open Government, Room 417b, Office of Public Service and Science, 70 Whitehall, London, SW1A 2AS. Also request a copy of the detailed guidance on the code the cabinet office has produced for other government departments. This is called Guidance on Interpretation. Departments are likely to send you an application form on which to make your request. Ask for a copy of the department's guidelines for dealing with requests under the code, including charging. 2. Charges You may be charged a fee before your request is even looked at. For example, the Foreign Office will demand a Pounds 15 non-refundable fee which must be sent in with the request. However, certain types of request must be granted free, such as those relating to social security benefits and government grants, and you will always be told of the charges in advance and asked if you will agree to them. Ultimately you can appeal to Mr William Reid, the Parliamentary Ombudsman, via an MP, against any unreasonable fees. 3. Penning the request If it is not already stated on the department form, add to the top of it: 'This is a request under the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.' This will ensure that you are able to appeal to the Ombudsman later. Also ask for the information to be supplied 'within 20 days as required by the Code'. 4. What to ask for Make your request as specific as possible to reduce the chances of your request being turned down. Information available under the code is meant to be in the form of summaries of government documents. However if you want to see a particular report which you know exists, try asking for it. If you do not have any specific documents in mind, ask for a list of all the relevant reports and records which the department holds relating to the issue which interests you. When the government announces a new policy or decision ask for the 'facts and analysis' behind the decision, as this information has to be provided under the code. 5. Personal Files Officials believe that most requests by individuals will relate to personal files held by government departments and quangos. You should be able to obtain non-computerised files under the code, but will still face restrictions on accessing pre-1991 medical records. The government has said it intends to create a new legal right of access to non-computerised files, thus bolstering rights of access under the code, but no timetable for legislation has been announced. 6. Following up Challenge any refusal. This may apply when you have been denied access to a particular document or when you believe you have not been given a full and accurate summary of a report. Insist on being told which of the code's exemptions has been used. You can then go for a departmental appeal. This will involve an inquiry by another civil servant checking your case and will cost nothing. Try arguing that disclosure should be made in 'the public interest', as the code allows. 7. Complaints to the Ombudsman If you are not satisfied by the departmental appeal you can appeal to the Parliamentary Ombudsman through any MP.</p>

In Blagoevgrad on 19 and 20 February 1994, a meeting was  held  of people's deputies who, by their boycott of parliament and  refusal to sign the Constitution, contributed very greatly to  the victory of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] in the  elections to the 36th National Assembly.    This was a meeting of people of like mind who were and are  united in the struggle against the Communist Party. Having  preserved human relations between one another and united under  the motto: "I am not a Communist and will never be one,..." we  shared our alarm and concern for the fate of democracy in  Bulgaria.    In Bulgaria an active process of recommunization is under  way, and the most retrograde circles of the former Communist  Party are increasingly raising their heads. At the meeting we  shared information about the intention of the Bulgarian  Socialist Party [BSP] to undertake actions in parliament before  the elections aimed at repealing the main laws on restitution,  chiefly those regarding town property. At the same time, it is  expected that the process of the return of farmland to its  owners will be halted and blocked throughout the country.  According to reliable data, an open attempt is being made to  take control of the judiciary, and then the Constitutional  Court. Information coming in from all over the country shows  that preparations are being made to settle accounts everywhere  with SDS members and sympathizers, which includes dismissals  from jobs for political reasons.    We are even more alarmed by the fact that BSP circles are  preparing to strike against all democratic forces in the country  by adopting a new electoral law. They continue their attacks  against SDS-controlled local authorities, blocking their work  and trying to eliminate them before the elections. Recently  they have been holding numerous meetings and talks with high  state officials at which they openly discuss ways to deal a blow  against the parliamentary system. At the same time, we cannot  fail to look the truth in the eye and see that thousands and  millions of people in Bulgaria are living in even greater  poverty and hardship under the fear of the increasing crime rate.    The entire responsibility for all of this falls upon the  unreformed BSP -- the opponent of the democratic processes in  Bulgaria -- and on the leaders for whom the word communist  continues to be sacred. Even today, this party -- the chief  culprit responsible for Bulgaria's national disaster --  continues to rule Bulgaria.    In this complex and exceptionally demanding situation, the  issue arises of the unity of the SDS and of dialogue with all  noncommunist political and trade-union organizations in  Bulgaria. The SDS should form the basis and motive force for  the democratic process, and not become a place for personal  attacks, intrigues, and seeking "the enemy within the party,"  like the Bolsheviks.    In the period left before the early parliamentary elections,  the SDS parliamentary group must devote all its efforts to  preventing the success of the attempts at recommunizing  Bulgaria. The SDS parliamentary group must defend the most  precious achievements of democracy achieved through the laws  passed by the SDS. It must continue to work actively on the new  SDS program and make its contribution toward solving people's  everyday problems.    While defending democracy in parliament, at the same time  the  SDS should start mobilizing and organizing its forces to demand  and win the future elections by actions within and outside  parliament.    The participants in the meeting are convinced that all  efforts must be made to ensure that the SDS wins the elections  and assumes the responsibility for ruling the country.</p>

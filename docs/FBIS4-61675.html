			<p>BFN     [Text] Turkmenstan's President Saparmurat Niyazov has  notified his Ukrainian counterpart Leonid Kravchuk of Ashgabat's  desire to resume gas supplies to Kiev.    As the acting Ukrainian Premier Efim Zvyagilski has told  journalists in Ukraine's capital, Kiev set a counter term to cut  the cost of gas from 52.5 dollars per one thousand cubic meters  down to 40 dollars. However, Zvyagilski believes "Ashgabat is  unlikely to accept the offered price." In his opinion, $50 for  one thousand cubic meters (the price that Ukraine pays for gas  from Russia) "can satisfy both sides."    Turkmenia discontinued gas delivery to Ukraine in February  because of Ukraine's failure to pay off $650 million in fuel  debts.    Meanwhile, according to Zvyagilski, Ukraine has enough gas  today. More than that, it has been able to save up to 20-25  million cubic meters of gas a month for a rainy day.</p>

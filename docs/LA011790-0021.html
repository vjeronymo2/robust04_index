			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLONEL ORDERED JESUIT MURDERS, CRISTIANI SAYS;  </P> <P> EL SALVADOR: THE PRESIDENT CITES TESTIMONY FROM SOLDIERS WHO ALLEGEDLY TOOK  PART.  </P> <P> President Alfredo Cristiani on Tuesday said that junior officers arrested in  the slaying of six Jesuit priests have told investigators their colonel  specifically ordered them to commit the murders.  </P> <P> Col. Guillermo Alfredo Benavides, head of El Salvador's military academy, has  denied the charges against him, Cristiani said in an interview.  </P> <P> "But the testimony of the lieutenants is that they received a direct order from  him to go and shoot the priests," he said.  </P> <P> This is the first public suggestion that orders for the killings had been  issued.  </P> <P> Cristiani announced last week that Benavides, three lieutenants and four  soldiers had been detained in connection with the assassinations. Benavides was  commander of the zone where the murders took place, and the soldiers were based  at his academy that night.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the case was turned over to a civilian judge, who has 72 hours to  decide if there is enough evidence to continue holding the men and proceed to  trial. The eight suspects appeared briefly at the judge's chambers in the  afternoon but refused to comment to reporters.  </P> <P> Benavides, who arrived in full military uniform, is the first high-ranking  officer ever accused of a political murder by the government. Military and  paramilitary "death squads" have been blamed for thousands of civilian deaths  during the country's 10-year civil war, but the tightly knit military has been  virtually immune from prosecution.  </P> <P> Cristiani said he is optimistic that this case will be brought to trial  "because of the amount of proof" against the suspects.  </P> <P> The priests, along with their cook and her 15-year-old daughter, were  assassinated at their residence at the Central American University on Nov. 16,  five days after leftist guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation  Front launched a massive urban offensive. The university is near the military  academy.  </P> <P> Cristiani admitted that the arrest of Benavides has created tension within the  armed forces but said he does not consider that a threat to his seven-month-old  government.  </P> <P> "Tensions now don't mean what they did in the 1970s and early 1980s. I don't  fear a coup," Cristiani said.  </P> <P> Benavides is a member of the powerful tandona, the military academy class that  controls most of the important military commands in the country. Col. Rene  Emilio Ponce, armed forces chief of staff, is a member of that class, but  Cristiani insisted that he and the rest of the high command backed the  investigation.  </P> <P> Some in the military are concerned that the case will fuel the guerrillas'  strategy of trying to divide the army. In their latest peace proposal, the  rebels called for the removal of members of the tandona.  </P> <P> Last week, army commanders received anonymous packets in the mail containing an  article on corruption in the military and a report by captains and majors  criticizing the high command's management of the war and alleged corruption.  </P> <P> In the hourlong interview, Cristiani said that a lieutenant and a second  lieutenant from the Atlacatl Battalion reported receiving the order from  Benavides. Another lieutenant based at the Gen. Gerardo Barrios Military School  said he was simply told by Benavides to "accompany them on the mission,"  Cristiani said.  </P> <P> Under Salvadoran law, the testimony of an indicted suspect is not admissible  against another defendant. Sources close to the case say other soldiers who  allegedly participated in the action have been detained but will not be charged  so that they may serve as witnesses.  </P> <P> Cristiani said those arrested participated in a Nov. 13 search of the  university and the priests' residence, which he said he had authorized.  </P> <P> "Obviously, I would not have liked it, but they (the military) said, 'Look,  we're being fired on.' I did say, 'Well, go ahead,' " Cristiani said.  </P> <P> Sources familiar with the case said that Benavides may have been pursuing  intelligence reports that guerrillas or members of the leftist Salvadoran  National Workers Union were meeting on the campus. No such meeting was  discovered.  </P> <P> A source familiar with the case said the Nov. 13 search of the campus and  Jesuit residence appears in the army high command's records of military  operations but that no action on the campus was recorded on Nov. 16, when the  killings occurred.  </P> <P> Cristiani said the army was listed as a possible suspect from the beginning of  the investigation.  </P> <P> "We were expecting anything to come up. We jotted down different possible  motives. Obviously, elements from the armed forces were under duress, and with  the tensions of war, sometimes people get things on their mind that are not  rational," he said.  </P> <P> Some observers are skeptical that the military had intended to take the blame  all the way to Benavides. The colonel's name did not surface until another  Salvadoran colonel leaked the information to a U.S. military adviser.  </P> <P> The U.S. adviser, a major, held the information for nearly two weeks before  passing it on to his superior. Col. Ponce, the armed forces chief, reportedly  was stunned when U.S. officials confronted him with the suspicions about  Benavides.  </P> <P> Col. Carlos Armando Aviles, who fingered Benavides, had been detained, but  Cristiani said he is no longer confined to quarters. But he confirmed that  Aviles will not be sent as military attache to Washington, as he had been  ordered before the controversy began.  </P> <P> Some political observers suggest it is unlikely that Benavides would have acted  alone to order what clearly would be an internationally repudiated political  crime. They also question whether other mid-level officers -- majors and  captains -- were involved.  </P> <P> Cristiani said the investigation has been straightforward and that it will  continue. He said the armed forces willingly pursued the investigation and that  he did not have to negotiate with the military for it to proceed.  </P> <P> Rather, Cristiani said, the recent events have provided an opportunity for the  army to show its development as a democratic institution.  </P></p>

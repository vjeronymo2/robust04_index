			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Privatisation companies lined up Indonesia plans a privatisation drive as part of its 1995-96 budget, with international equity offerings and flotations on the Jakarta stock exchange, Manuela Saragosa reports. Mr Mar'ie Muhammad, finance minister, said yesterday that Telkom, the domestic telecommunications company, PLN, the electricity company, and Jasa Marga, the toll road operator, were the three state-owned companies most prepared to 'go international'. He also admitted that Garuda, the state-owned airline which some brokers said was being groomed to go public, was not yet ready to be sold on the international market. The government also plans to reduce its stake in Semen Gresik, one of the country's largest cement producers, which is already listed in Jakarta, and sell shares in two other state-owned cement producers, the South Sulawesi-based Semen Tonasa and the West Sumatra-based Semen Padang. Mr Andrew Vaughan, director of research and sales at stockbroker G K Goh Ometraco, said the privatisations 'have been on the launch-pad for a long time'. Telkom is thought likely to sell at least Dollars 500m (Pounds 312m) worth of shares in its initial public offering. It is estimated that each of the companies will have to float at least Dollars 20m-worth of shares to make the exercise worthwhile. But it is not clear yet whether Jasa Marga will issue bonds overseas rather than selling shares. The companies are expected to give domestic exchanges a boost by floating some of their equity on the Indonesia market. 'Long-term, this is exactly what the Jakarta market needs, to have more large blue-chip companies,' said Mr David Oxtoby, research director at Asia Equity Jasereh. 'The size of their cash call may have a short-term depressing effect, but it will simply be a case of short-term pain for long-term gain.' Mr Muhammad's planned privatisations follow the flotation of shares in Indosat, Indonesia's telecom satellite enterprise, on the New York Stock Exchange last month which raised at least Dollars 800m for the Indonesian government. Indosat sold 25 per cent of its shares in New York and 10 per cent on the Jakarta and Surabaya stock exchanges. Merrill Lynch was the global underwriter for the offering, while Danareksa Sekuritas underwrote the domestic share sale.</p>

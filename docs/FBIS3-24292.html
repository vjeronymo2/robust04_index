			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Rogov, president of the National Security </F> and International Relations Center: "The Near Abroad Is  Interested in the Far Abroad: What Were the Reasons Behind  Kravchuk's and Shevardnadze's Visits to Clinton"]    [Text] The recent visits to Washington by leaders of  Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Georgia show that Washington's attitude  toward the former Soviet republics is beginning to undergo a  serious change. On the one hand, this stems from the fact that  the conduits of American foreign policy have found out that a  number of new independent states can play a visible role in the  international arena. This comes first and foremost from these  states' claims on entire components of the Soviet nuclear  legacy.    Ukraine and Kazakhstan have demonstrated that they are in no  hurry to fulfill their commitments to turn into non-nuclear  states. The Lisbon protocol on nuclear arms, in keeping with  which Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus were supposed to become  non-nuclear states, remained unimplemented. A real prospect  emerged of the former Soviet republics nationalizing not only  conventional arms and armed forces, but also strategic nuclear  arms. These arms would enable Ukraine and Kazakhstan to become  major nuclear powers and to a certain extent (since  intercontinental ballistic missiles on their territory were  intended during the Soviet period for the conduct of war against  the United States) to present a threat to the United States as  well.    It was the realization of a possible development of events  along this scenario that prompted the Clinton administration to  develop a more active policy in this direction, using mostly  "the carrot method."    One has to say that the leaders of Kazakhstan and Ukraine  have been quite successful in using the United States' interest  in resolving this issue to obtain the economic and political  support they need and raise their status in the international  arena.    In the case of Kazakhstan, President Nazarbayev's  willingness  to sign a nuclear nonproliferation treaty opened him the door to  the White House. The Ukrainian position turned out more  controversial. At the trilateral meeting of Presidents Clinton,  Yeltsin, and Kravchuk in Moscow in January of this year, Ukraine  reaffirmed its commitment to give up nuclear weapons, but has  managed to successfully avoid precise formulae that would  specify the time frame for making good on this commitment. It  took additional efforts on the part of American diplomacy,  including doubling the volume of economic aid that will be  provided to Ukraine--to $700 million--to get President Kravchuk  to give more precise assurances regarding keeping his old  promises during his visit to Washington.    The second factor that compelled Washington to invite the  leaders of several new independent states is the emergence of a  sort of an instability belt on the territory of some former  Soviet republics. Acute political conflicts and civil wars in a  number of them are beginning to affect the international  situation as a whole. These conflicts are taking place along  with the bloody war in Yugoslavia and show that with the end of  the Cold War a greater part of the former socialist countries  may become seats of tension, undermining the stability of the  entire system of international relations.    At the same time, Washington is very suspicious of Russia's  attempts to take upon itself the functions of a guarantor of  peace and stability in the CIS countries, including the use of  military means. The participation of the Russian Armed Forces in  peacekeeping operations in the Dniester Republic, Abkhazia,  South Ossetia, and Tajikistan raises fears in Washington that  our country may be trying to restore the empire.    Many American politicians demand of the Clinton  administration to make it clear to Russia that restoration of  the empire by force is impermissible.    Shevardnadze's visit to Washington is a testimony to the  United States' willingness to take a more active position with  respect to conflicts on the CIS territory, and in particular in  the Transcaucasus. Such an approach may eventually produce  considerable problems in Russian-American relations. After all,  Russia today claims at an official level a "special role" in the  CIS, proclaiming practically all the former Soviet republics a  zone of its vitally important interests. Naturally, the entry of  a third country into Russia's bilateral relations with Georgia  or any other republic will be perceived in Moscow with great  dismay, even if that third country is the United States, with  which Russia is, as was announced at the latest summit, in a  "mature strategic partnership."    Judging by all signs, there has emerged a considerable gap  between the declarations of strategic partnership between Russia  and the United States and the real mechanism of interaction  between the two states, a mechanism for reaching agreement on  their interests. It appears that this gap not only is not  diminishing, but keeps growing, making relations between two  former Cold War adversaries extremely fragile. As the scandal in  connection with the arrest of the Ames family on the charges of  espionage in Washington showed, despite assurances of strategic  partnership, Russian-American relations may be turned back and  enter a period of cooling and alienation. And the recent visits  to Washington of the presidents of Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and  Georgia may present a cause for further complications in the  relations between Moscow and Washington.</p>

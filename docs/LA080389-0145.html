			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> Actor Rob Lowe's insurance company says his home and personal liability  insurance policy doesn't cover sex tapes, and it wants a judge to free it of  any obligation for claims if Lowe has to pay damages in a lawsuit over his  alleged videotaping of a sex act involving a teen-age girl. Chubb Custom  Insurance Co. of New Jersey filed a complaint in U.S. District Court in  Atlanta, saying Lowe's policy doesn't cover "intentional actions" such as using  "celebrity status as an inducement to females to engage in sexual intercourse,  sodomy and multiple party sexual activity for his immediate sexual  gratification and for the purpose of making pornographic films."

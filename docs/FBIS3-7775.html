			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, Feb 17 (TANJUG) -- Paul Beaver, a  prominent British military expert said Thursday that Bosnian  Serbs possessed a series of anti-aircraft systems to respond to  NATO air strikes in case they are launched against the Serbs'  positions around Sarajevo.    The analyst of the British Jane's defence military magazine  in an interview to the VOA monitored in Belgrade, said that the  Bosnian Serbs not only possessed missiles with a 40-km range and  a number of anti-aircraft and shoulder rocket launchers, but  also a completely new Russian system called SA-16. NATO says  the system is difficult to counter.    Beaver said Bosnian Serbs possessed a large number of  anti-aircraft cannon and added that most of the aircraft in the  Gulf war as well as in the Falklands war 12 years ago, were  known to be shot down by the infantry fire from the ground.    The analyst thus warned that the West should not be led into  believing that the war planes would be able to launch attacks on  the Sarajevo surroundings without being exposed to danger.    He said that on top of that NATO did not have the best  trained pilots in the world. Last Wednesday NATO threatened the  Bosnian Serbs and Moslems they would be bombed unless they  withdrew their heavy artillery in and around Sarajevo or place  it under U.N. control.    Although the NATO ultimatum concerns all three sides to the  Bosnian conflict, many Western politicians and media regard the  ultimatum as directed to the Bosnian Serbs alone.</p>

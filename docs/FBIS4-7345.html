			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 28 (KCNA) -- We who regard the  dignity of the country and the nation as our life and soul  demand that the Japanese authorities immediately stop the  repressive campaign against Koreans in Japan and the General  Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and warn  that their indiscreet acts may cause grave unpardonable  consequences against history and the times.    This is stressed in a statement issued today by the  Korea-Japan Friendship Association.    The police authorities in Osaka Prefecture, Japan, some time  ago surrounded the Osaka prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon  with the mobilization of 1,300 police before forcibly searching  the hall of the headquarters and its four branches in Osaka.  And members of the "Kanto Council of the Union of Patriots of  Great Japan" staged an anti-Chongnyon, anti-DPRK campaign in  front of the headquarters of Chongnyon and organs under its  affiliation.    This hostile campaign came at a time when the United States,  Japan and the South Korean authorities were rendering the  situation on the Korean peninsula extremely strained over the  "nuclear issue" and the Japanese Government authorities were  openly calling for setting in-motion an "international  cooperation system" to stifle the DPRK, says the statement,  bitterly denouncing it as an intolerable provocation against the  DPRK as well as Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan.    The statement continues:    The Japanese authorities' repressive campaign against  Chongnyon is a mockery of and an insult to the far-sighted and  conscience-minded personages and people of Japan who are making  all sincere efforts to establish relations of good neighbourhood  with the DPRK and live on good terms with it.    We expect that the Dietmen's League for the Promotion of  Japan-Korea Friendship and conscience-minded personages and  other people of Japan will pay deep attention to the grave  situation and take resolute measures lest the DPRK-Japan  relations should deteriorate and lead to an unpredictable  misfortune.</p>

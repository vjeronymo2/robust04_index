			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Money Markets: Ignore the bad news BULLISH sentiment dominated most of Europe's money markets yesterday, with the short-dated sterling and D-Mark futures all showing strong rises, writes James Blitz. However, some dealers thought that these moves, reflecting confidence that interest rates will soon come down, were flying in the face of reality. In Britain, the political crisis is reaching a climax. Today's vote in the UK parliament on whether to move towards ratifying the Maastricht treaty looks set to be close, leaving the future of Mr John Major's government very uncertain. In Germany, the Bundesbank shows a new unwillingness to lower official rates. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, said yesterday that further cuts in interest rates depended on success in reducing the budget deficit for 1993. However, dealers in Europe's futures and cash markets seemed blissfully unaware of the darkening clouds. Cash rates in the sterling money market dropped sharply, with three-month interbank rates offered at 7 7/16 per cent, their lowest level since 8 per cent base rate was introduced. Three-month certificates of deposit were as low as 7 1/8 per cent, discount-ing a full percentage point cut in rates. December short sterling was up 20 basis points on the day, closing at 93.60. In Euromark trading, the March contract was 10 basis points higher on the day, at 92.55, pricing in a drop of 145 basis points in three-month rates by the spring. Dealers doubtless had reasons for taking an aggressively bullish view. In Britain the assumption was that another cut in UK interest rates will be announced with next week's Autumn Statement. The small shortage of Pounds 200m forecast by the Bank of England yesterday also helped sentiment. A report yesterday from the German Federation of Chambers of Commerce pointed to increased economic gloom, implying the need to stimulate the economy. The federation said that a third of western German firms expect to cut their workforce next year. The wonder was that French franc futures closed unchanged at 90.81, in the market's first full trading day following Monday's reduction in French official rates.</p>

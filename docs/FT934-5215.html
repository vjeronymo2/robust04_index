			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Output fall adds to fears on economy: Figures on Japan's manufacturing, employment and business gloomy Japan's industrial output fell 5.1 per cent in October, the largest month-on-month decline on record. In part, the slide reflected the fall-off from a sharp increase in September as companies tried to boost output before the end of their half-year accounting period. But it was only one of several figures published yesterday which added to doubts about the country's economic recovery. Deteriorating conditions of the labour market were highlighted in a 2.7 per cent rise in unemployment in October, a six-year high. The ratio of job offers to job seekers fell to a six-year low of 0.67, that is, 67 jobs for 100 seekers. A quarterly survey of business conditions by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry indicated that 65 per cent of more than 160 leading Japanese companies did not expect a business recovery until late 1994 or later. Only 15 per cent forecast a recovery in conditions in the next six months. The Nikkei 225 average, which plunged to a year's low Monday, recovered 327.83 points, or 2 per cent, to 16,406.54 after government officials and financial authorities yesterday pledged to implement measures to boost the economy. Mr Yasushi Mieno, Bank of Japan governor, said the central bank was ready to take additional monetary action if the underlying economic conditions warranted. Ms Manae Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning Agency, called for income tax cuts and an expansionary budget for the next business year to support consumer spending, while Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister, and Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade and industry, said the government would consider easing land taxes and action to reinvigorate the property market. The worsening economic outlook came as parliament began debate on the supplementary budget announced in September. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, prime minister, may be forced to extend the parliamentary session as approval of the budget is likely to take about a week, blocking discussion of his political reform package in the upper house of the Diet until December 8. Mr Hosokawa has pledged to introduce political reform bills before December 15.</p>

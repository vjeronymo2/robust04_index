			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES OF THE WEEK  </P> <P> Unconquered (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie based on the story of  Richmond Flowers Jr., an Alabama youth who overcomes asthma and bigotry to  become a world-class athlete. Dermot Mulroney, Peter Coyote and Tess Harper  star.  </P> <P> Michael Keaton stars in Ron Howard's amusing but overly stereotypical 1986  comedy Gung Ho (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.), playing a Pennsylvania plant foreman who  persuades a Japanese conglomerate to buy the bankrupt local auto company only  to find that he and his pals have a hard time hewing to no-nonsense Japanese  methods.  </P> <P> Arnold Schwarzenegger manages not to take himself too seriously, but that's  about the only redeeming virtue of the ultra-violent, ultra-complicated 1986  Raw Deal (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.), which features Schwarzenegger as the least  conspicuous sheriff in all rural North Carolina, recruited by FBI veteran  Darren McGavin to infiltrate Chicago Mafia lord Sam Wanamaker's inner circle.  </P> <P> 9 1/2 Weeks (Channel 5 Monday at 8 p.m., again Saturday at 8 p.m.), based on a  woman's pseudonymous account of a masochistic love affair, became a swooningly  silly cautionary tale about the bad (Mickey Rourke) and the beautiful (Kim  Basinger), a pair whose sexual tastes might have surfaced after a night of  watching Bo Derek's "Bolero" on videocassette.  </P> <P> The 1984 film of The Little Drummer Girl (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m. and  Saturday at 10 p.m.) squeezed the life out of the John le Carre novel -- a work  of much psychological complexity, richness and subtlety -- leaving only the  most mechanical kind of suspense. Diane Keaton is game but thrashes about in a  one-dimensional part as an actress recruited by Israelis to snare a Palestinian  terrorist leader.  </P> <P> The Cover Girl and the Cop (NBC Monday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie, a comedy  about a beautiful actress/model (Julia Duffy) and a tough policewoman (Dinah  Manoff) forced to live and work together when they are pursued by killers.  </P> <P> The Ryan White Story (ABC Monday at 9 p.m.) is another new fact-based TV movie  in which Lukas Haas stars as a youth barred from school because he has AIDS.  </P> <P> Rebel (Channel 13 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is a dynamic, ambitious World War II  musical fantasy-romance from Australia that overreaches yet leaves us better  nourished than the usual run-of-the-mill movie. In essence the 1986 film is a  backstage musical in which the brassy, gutsy star (Debbie Byrne) of a Sydney  nightclub revue becomes involved with a troubled young American Marine (Matt  Dillon).  </P> <P> Still another new TV movie based on actual events, Desperate for Love (CBS  Tuesday at 9 p.m.) stars Christian Slater and Brian Bloom as Georgia teen-agers  whose attraction to the same girl (Veronica Cartwright) has tragic  consequences.  </P> <P> The Adventures of Mark Twain (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), made in 1985, is  of more interest for its claymation techniques than as a Twain pastiche  exploring the darker side of his personality.  </P> <P> Lawrence Kasdan's 1981 Body Heat (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is an amusing  and very steamy contemporary variation on "Double Indemnity" with William Hurt  and Kathleen Turner in the Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck roles.  </P> <P> Director John Carpenter made a nifty 1978 TV movie debut with Someone's  Watching Me! (Channel 13 Friday at 8 p.m.), which stars Lauren Hutton as a  career woman who can't convince the cops that somebody is stalking her.  </P> <P> Husbands (Channel 28 Friday at 10:30 p.m.), John Cassavetes' powerful comment  on the failure of American men to grow up, stars Ben Gazzara (never better),  Peter Falk and Cassavetes himself as three suburban New York family men on a  binge in the wake of the death of one of their friends.  </P> <P> The Defiant Ones (ABC Saturday at 8 p.m.) is a so-so remake of the 1958  classic, with Robert Urich and Carl Weathers in the roles created so memorably  by Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier.  </P> <P> The ratings checks on movies in the TV log are provided by the Tribune TV Log  listings service.  </P></p>

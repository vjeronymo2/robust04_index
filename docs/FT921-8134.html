			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Turkey plans Eurodollar offering TURKEY plans to return to the international bond market for the first time since the Gulf war by launching a Dollars 150m bond issue in the next two to three weeks. Mrs Gulnur Ucok, head of capital markets at the central bank, said in London yesterday that the country faced a 'severe credit crunch' during the Gulf war, but planned to launch a Dollars 1bn international borrowing programme this year. The country's last Eurodollar issue was in March 1990, five months before Iraq invaded Kuwait. Although it has since borrowed in the German and Japanese domestic bond markets, a Eurodollar deal is seen as vital to attract a wide range of international investors. In addition to the planned five-year Eurodollar deal, which will have an investor put option after three years, Turkey is also planning a yankee bond issue in the US domestic bond market. To facilitate US borrowings, a rating is being sought from Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency. A long-term debt rating of around triple-B, the lowest investment-grade category, is anticipated. Before the Gulf war, Turkey's new Eurodollar bond issues were trading at yield spreads as low as 220 basis points over US government bonds. However, yield spreads for three-year maturities have since widened to around 270 basis points. Mrs Ucok said the new issue, lead-managed by Bankers Trust International, would be priced to reflect current secondary market levels rather than the cost of funds available when Turkey last tapped the market. Turkey has Dollars 45bn foreign debt outstanding but this is amply covered by foreign currency earnings. Interest payments and principle repayments amounted to Dollars 7.5bn last year, against foreign exchange earnings of Dollars 28.79bn. This year, debt service payments will peak at Dollars 6.89bn, before declining to the end of the decade.</p>

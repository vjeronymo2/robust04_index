			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on environmental issues monitored through 26 May.  <H5>  Bolivia </H5>   The Bolivian Forum on Environment and Development, Fobomade,  charged that the indiscriminate cutting of trees such as the  mara, oak, and other species makes them increasingly close to  extinction in the Terevinto and Ayacucho cantons, adjacent to  Amboro National Park, Santa Cruz Department. Fobomade Secretary  General Loida Rodriguez said this situation is reflected in the  increasing transportation of trees to various markets. (La Paz  PRESENCIA in Spanish 14 May 94 p 6)    Alternative Development Under Secretary Raul Enrique Ugalde  Castro stated that the Chapare region could disappear in 10  years because of deforestation and pollution, and that "urgent  measures must be adopted to avoid this disaster." He said the  "worrisome" exploitation of forests has reached an "alarmingly"  irrational level. He noted that another "serious" problem is the  pollution of rivers and the area as a whole. He said: "Coca  maceration pits have contaminated everything," and that a study  shows that 50 percent of the fish in Chapare are no longer  fertile. (La Paz PRESENCIA in Spanish 18 May 94 p 1)    Paraguayan Ambassador to Bolivia Julia Velilla agreed that  the Pilcomayo River is becoming a sewer due to the mineral waste  spilled into it from dozens of mines. (La Paz Radio Fides in  Spanish 1100 GMT 24 May 94)  <H5>  Brazil </H5>   On 15 May, 2.5 million of liters of oil spilled from a  pipeline linking the Almirante Barroso terminal with the  Presidente Bernardes refinery in Cubatao. The oil already has  affected the Parequecaba, Guaica, Cigarra beaches in Sao  Sebastiao and the Clube and Saco da Capela beaches in Santos,  Sao Paulo State. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2340  GMT 19 May 94)    Approximately 10 metric tons of oil spilled from a truck  owned by the Transomega Transportadora company that was parked  in the company compound in Santos' Estuario neighborhood. The  oil leaked into Channel 5 through rainwater pipes. Efforts are  being made to prevent it from reaching the beaches. (Sao Paulo  AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2340 GMT 19 May 94)    Air pollution has doubled in Sao Jose dos Campos. Lycia  Maria  Moreira Nordemann, National Institute of Space Research expert,  reported that 85 micrograms per cubic meter of particles were  detected in the air in 1993 compared with 1992 when it was 42  micrograms. She said that on 9-13 August 1993 the average air  pollution was 190 micrograms per cubic meter. She added that  only 25 percent of the air pollution is caused by local  industry, and 75 percent by other regions of Sao Paulo. She  noted that rainwater is registering very high acidity levels.

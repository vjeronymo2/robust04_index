			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICHIGAN BOND EXPERT ASSUMES TASK;  </P> <P> CITY TAKES DEBT MEDICINE: LOSES ITS POWER TO GOVERN  </P> <P> The public library, once the pride of this gritty, blue-collar city, is locked  up tight. Behind bolted doors and plywood-covered windows, dusty rows of  imprisoned books, thousands of them, go unread.  </P> <P> The shuttered library, just a few blocks from the Ecorse City Hall, stands as a  symbol of both the city's past and its present.  </P> <P> It first gained notoriety as a safe harbor for Prohibition smugglers bringing  booze across the Detroit River from Canada. Today Ecorse has a new distinction.  The 2.2-square-mile city just south of Detroit is home to one of the most  severe remedies ever forced upon an American city to save it from bankruptcy.  </P> <P> "Draconian," is how Standard &amp; Poor's municipal finance expert, Hyman C.  Grossman, described the extraordinary measure.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tax Base Undermined  </P> <P> Ecorse found itself in trouble because of the Midwest's changing economy.  Suppliers for auto factories closed up shop or moved away, its one steel mill  teetered on the brink of closing, its housing stock aged along with its  population, all helping to undermine the city's tax base while a long series of  inept politicians, many of them accused or convicted of corruption, occupied  City Hall.  </P> <P> Burdened by $6 million in debts, beset by lawsuits seeking to collect unpaid  utility bills, and paralyzed by bickering officials unable to agree on a  budget, Ecorse, with a population of about 12,000, was stripped of its local  government by a Michigan judge in December, 1986.  </P> <P> Authority and responsibility normally held by elected officials were handed to  Louis H. Schimmel, a municipal finance expert who lives in a different county  and never visited Ecorse before being named receiver. The chief judge of the  Wayne County Circuit Court gave Schimmel total power to operate the city  unhindered by politics, voters or history.  </P> <P> In 30 months, he has sharply lowered the cost of running Ecorse and almost  wiped out the debt by almost wiping out government. He has cut the municipal  work force of 140 almost in half and, more important, hired private companies  to provide normal city services. And what he could not privatize was closed,  sold or scaled back.  </P> <P> He even tried to cut out salaries for the mayor and the six city councilmen  before learning such a step was prohibited by state law.  </P> <P> "There is something wrong . . . when you have one guy come in who's almost like  a dictator and take home rule away from people," said Schimmel, who is also  executive director of the Municipal Advisory Council of Michigan, a municipal  bond evaluating service. "You can justify it . . . . when somebody is  flagrantly abusing the system, which is what was going on here."  </P> <P> "The receiver is the absolute chief executive officer," said Mayor Larry B.  Salisbury, who was elected after Schimmel was appointed. "The council, by court  order, yielded all the power vested in them. The receiver doesn't have to  discuss what he's going to do with anybody. But he's a polite enough person  that he does."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Large, Small Cures  </P> <P> Polite, but tough. In the last 30 months, Schimmel has turned a chronically  cash-short city into one that is living on much less than it is collecting.  He's done this in ways large and small, including:  </P> <P>  -- Firing 40 political appointees who, Schimmel said, "weren't doing anything"  and either eliminating or consolidating their jobs.  </P> <P>  -- Abolishing the department of public works, forcing 27 workers to retire  early and selling the public works garage and all the heavy equipment. A  private contractor was hired for snow removal, tree trimming, debris removal,  weed cutting, street sweeping, water and sewer system maintenance and street,  alley, and sidewalk repairs -- saving Ecorse $1 million a year.  </P> <P>  -- Renegotiating contracts, including the rubbish collection pact, with a  private company. Garbage pickup now costs the city $120,000 a year less.  </P> <P>  -- Installing new water meters throughout the city increasing revenues by  $500,000 a year for a one-time $370,000 investment.  </P> <P>  -- Phasing out full-time firemen and replacing them with volunteer and  part-time paid firemen.  </P> <P>  -- Closing a variety of public facilities, from the ice rink (built when there  were 6,000 children in Ecorse schools compared to an enrollment of about 1,600  now) to the library, which costs $40,000 each year to operate, a minute portion  of the city's annual $6.5-million budget.  </P> <P> "The library costs too much for a city that has such a small tax base. There  are loads of other libraries nearby Ecorse," said Schimmel. "And they built the  ice rink when they had lots of kids and it wasn't a senior citizen community.  There's nobody who wants to ice skate now."  </P> <P> Ecorse was once one of the richest communities in the industrial strip south of  Detroit. "In the 1950s we had more money to spend per capita than almost any  other city this size in America," said Mayor Salisbury.  </P> <P> A major steel mill, salt mines and a shipyard where giant Great Lakes iron ore  carriers were built all contributed to the city's prosperity. The legendary  Edmund Fitzgerald was the last ship launched in Ecorse and like the library,  the freighter, which sank in Lake Superior in 1975 with all 29 crew members, is  a symbol of what Ecorse was and is today.  </P> <P> Virtually all of its industry -- and its tax base -- is gone now except for the  steel mill, which has been upgraded but employs thousands fewer workers than it  did in the past.  </P> <P> The city's population has slipped from 20,000 to 12,000. More than half of them  are senior citizens living on fixed incomes in tract houses built after World  War II for returning GI's and factory workers. The town is divided evenly  between blacks and ethnic whites and divided by a wide band of railroad tracks  with blacks living largely to the west and whites to the east.  </P> <P> Ecorse is nestled in a strip of other equally small cities, some of which are  also beginning to experience financial problems for some of the same reasons.  </P> <P> Although he has saved the city and believes that when he leaves later this year  it will be only $1 million in the red and able to be out of debt within a year,  Schimmel says in the end the city may fail anyway.  </P> <P> "I'm glad I did it once," he said. "I think I've blazed a trail for others to  follow." But, he added, "I don't think when a municipality gets in the kind of  shape that Ecorse was in, to send someone like me in to bail it out does any  good because now, when I leave, it is just going to fall apart again."  </P> <P> Not everybody in Ecorse is pleased with Schimmel's work. In fact, half the  elected city council opposes his cost-cutting.  </P> <P> "Look man, I can't go along with nothing he's trying to do," said James W.  Parker Sr., a veteran Ecorse city councilman. "The man came into this town to  destroy Ecorse, and he's doing a damn good job."  </P> <P> Schimmel said the city ought to be merged into another neighboring city.  "Ecorse ought to disappear," he said.  </P> <P> Michigan officials agree. They are working on legislation providing a formal  mechanism for dissolving cities in the kind of fiscal trouble Ecorse was in at  the end of 1986, in effect forcing them to merge with neighboring communities.  </P></p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: Mobil steps up restructure and takes Dollars 315m charge Mobil, the US energy group, continued recent cost-cutting efforts with an announcement that it would shed one in five jobs in its chemicals business and take after-tax charges of Dollars 315m in the current quarter. The actions, though anticipated, came earlier than expected, and appeared to indicate an acceleration of restructuring initiatives under way since before Mr Lucio Noto took over as chairman in March. Mobil said Dollars 95m of the charge related to its chemicals businesses. The workforce would be reduced by 2,300 and some plastics fabrication capacity would be closed down. However, the steps do not include the closure of any ethylene or polyethylene capacity, areas where Mobil has built up capacity rapidly since the end of the 1980s but which have been hit hard by the cyclical downturn in the chemicals industry. Mobil's chemicals operations contributed Dollars 15m in the first three months of the year, compared with Dollars 44m in the whole of 1993 - well below the Dollars 558m recorded in 1989. The company said the restructuring would 'improve earnings significantly'. A further Dollars 185m of the charge stemmed from a write-down of some natural gas properties in the US, and non-producing properties in Canada. These properties were all acquired in the early 1980s, when the company anticipated strong oil and natural gas prices. A write-down of some US marketing assets accounted for the remaining Dollars 35m of the charge. Restructuring and cost-cutting has already brought down Mobil's costs substantially since the early 1990s. Speaking at the annual meeting last month, Mr Noto said operating costs were reduced by Dollars 325m last year, and Dollars 250m in 1992. Exxon's domestic exploration and production unit, Exxon USA, said it will cut production offices in three states and consolidate them into Houston, AP-DJ reports from Irving, Texas. Exxon said it expected the moves to eliminate about 430 positions.</p>

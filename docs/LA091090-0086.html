			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHORT FUTURE FOR FUTURISTIC COFFEE SHOP?;  </P> <P> ARCHITECTURE: ALTHOUGH THE WICHSTAND WAS GRANTED HISTORIC LANDMARK STATUS BY  LOS ANGELES COUNTY, THE GOOGIE-STYLE BUILDING MAY STILL FACE THE WRECKING BALL.  </P> <P> In 1957, Jackie Robinson retired from baseball, Humphrey Bogart died of cancer,  Ford launched the Edsel and the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, black students  were barred from Little Rock's Central High by the Arkansas National Guard, and  the Wichstand coffee shop opened on Slauson Avenue in Windsor Hills.  </P> <P> The Wichstand's sweeping roof design reflected the essential buoyancy of the  1950s, despite the era's mixed signals about the future. Its design matched the  boisterous Chrysler Imperials, the Buick LeSabres and the upswept tail fins of  contemporary Cadillacs that trumpeted America's post-World War II confidence  that the sky was the limit.  </P> <P> "The Wichstand captured the anti-gravity architecture of the Atomic Age," wrote  architectural historian Alan Hess in his book "Googie: Fifties Coffee Shop  Architecture." "Through its tilting roof plunges a large slanting dart . . .  (and) only the momentum of the Space Age seems to hold it in place."  </P> <P> In a recent interview Hess stressed his opinion that the Wichstand is "one of  the finest designs we have left among the remaining 1950s coffee shops."  </P> <P> Now the Wichstand, a unique example of the 1950s coffee shop style known as  "Googie," is threatened with demolition. Closed for two years, it faces the  possibility of being replaced by yet another faceless mini-mall, following the  fate of other 1950s coffee shops, such as Westwood's beloved Ship's, demolished  in 1984.  </P> <P> The county of Los Angeles granted the Wichstand historic landmark status in  March, 1989. However, this status can only delay, not prevent, the owners,  Shilyco Inc. of Century City, from developing the property as a potential strip  shopping center.  </P> <P> Shilyco, which is offering the site for sale, has filed an application for the  Wichstand's demolition. Because of the building's historic landmark  designation, the county must delay permission for demolition for six months to  give any interested parties a chance to find ways to save it. This grace period  is already more than half over.  </P> <P> The application for historic status, submitted to the L.A. County Landmarks  Commission by a group of concerned individuals before the coffee shop finally  closed its doors in late 1988, pleaded for its protection as "the best  remaining example of postwar roadside architecture in the unincorporated area  of Los Angeles County, and one of the few remaining excellent examples in  Southern California."  </P> <P> The Wichstand is unique because it is the only known coffee shop to include a  cocktail lounge and carhop service in its parking lot. Designed by Los Angeles  architects Armet &amp; Davis, who also created the late, lamented Schwab's  Drugstore on Sunset Boulevard, the Wichstand embodies all the unself-conscious  verve of its era.  </P> <P> The 35-foot "slanting dart" Hess describes is the Wichstand's illuminated pylon  sign. Resembling a rocket ready for launching, the pylon is stayed by guy wires  that anchor it precariously to the earth.  </P> <P> The blue roof fascia undulates weightlessly over the glass walls below.  Rectangular light boxes stuck to the fascia were once dotted with plastic  stars. Posters advertised "Fresh Eggs with Trout Jelly" and other such  fast-food delights, and carhops scurried across the parking lot balancing  trays.  </P> <P> Inside the coffee shop curving booths and a boomerang-shaped counter made all  the surfaces seem fluid. Bright spotlights, lightweight metal tables and chairs  and floating circles of painted canvas gave a festive air, as if life were one  long outdoor barbecue.  </P> <P> To give some substance to the structure, the architects added stone piers,  metal I-beams with circle cutouts, and fragments of solid wall. The cocktail  lounge, a dark space in the rear, was a refuge from all this brightness. Yucca  plants and palms added a tropical air.  </P> <P> Put all together, the architecture created a large advertisement for the  Wichstand.  </P> <P> "The coffee shops of the period had an overriding aim -- to capture the eye of  passing drivers with as much zooty verve as possible," Hess said. "They were  three-dimensional billboards, using powerful design gestures, lighting and  color to punch home their message."  </P> <P> Coffee shop design drew its inspiration from many often disparate sources. Its  mannerisms mixed the hotly emotional elements of Frank Lloyd Wright's "organic"  architecture, which favored the use of natural materials like stone, with  Bauhaus Modernism's predilection for cool, smooth surfaces. To this heady style  blend was added details from popular U.S. roadside diners and Las Vegas neon  extravaganzas, jazzed up by images derived from Space Age rocketry.  </P> <P> The effect was often wonderfully weird. In many a Tiny Naylor's, Norm's,  Ship's, Ben Frank's, Coffee Dan's and Googie's futuristic architectures of  neon, steel, plastic and glass sprouted in beds of primeval cactus among  rough-hewn rockeries.  </P> <P> Coffee shop designers were clearly gifted. Armet and Davis, Stanley Mestim,  Wayne McAllister and Martin Stern, among others, created a popular architecture  that was purely American in its confidence in a techno future unencumbered by  history or elite (read European) notions of taste.  </P> <P> The connection of this "low art" style with the "high art" architecture of the  period, which was also the heyday of the Case Study House program sponsored by  Art &amp; Architecture magazine, was both direct and tenuous.  </P> <P> While coffee shop designers were clearly inspired by such Case Study Houses as  the famous high-tech home designed by Charles and Ray Eames in the Pacific  Palisades, few of the 1950s leading avant-garde architects in Los Angeles  condescended to create coffee shops.  </P> <P> John Lautner was a notable exception. The architect of the dramatic Chemosphere  House in the Hollywood Hills also designed the first Googie's in 1949 alongside  Schwab's Drugstore on Sunset Boulevard. Both designs reveal Lautner's  fascination with both Frank Lloyd Wright and Space Age technology.  </P> <P> The theme linking "low" and "high" architecture of the period was an urge to a  direct kind of design Expressionism -- a sense that the building's shape and  style should directly and dramatically express its structure and its function.  </P> <P> Such dramatic Expressionism was as much a motivation for the Eames House design  as for Googie's. It also made a strong showing in airport architecture,  including Los Angeles International Airport's futuristic Theme Restaurant and  Eero Saarinen's concrete "launching eagle" design for the TWA terminal and New  York's Kennedy International.  </P> <P> Historian Hess traces the genesis of this architectural Expressionism to  several sources, including post-World War I German designer Erich Mendelsohn  and 1920s Russian Constructivism. He also looks to the radically streamlined  transcontinental trains of the 1930s and '40s designed by Americans Norman Bel  Geddes, Henry Dreyfuss and Raymond Loewy.  </P> <P> Despite is highly eclectic origins, coffee shop architecture is very much its  own style, Hess said. "Googie design defies gravity. Walls vanish, planes curve  and wrap around one another with a sense of weightlessness. The coffee shop  manner is all flyaway energy, free of the Earth's inertia."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Googie aficionados hope that the Wichstand will not fly away into  oblivion.  </P> <P> "We can't afford to lose this unique example of the style, that recalls an L.A.  past more innocent and likable than the present," said Eugene Polk, a member of  the Los Angeles Conservancy's Fifties Task Force, which campaigns for the  preservation of period architecture.  </P> <P> "Surely an imaginative developer could find a way of recycling the Wichstand to  appeal to our rapidly reviving interest in everything to do with the 1950s?"  </P></p>

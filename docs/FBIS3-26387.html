A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Wu Jianmin, made the  remarks here today when asked to comment on the report that Li  Denghui [Li Teng-hui] of Taiwan plans to spend "holidays" during  the spring festival in Indonesia and Thailand.    Under the disguise of "holidays" trips, the Taiwan  authorities are trying to develop "substantive relations" with  some countries, thus creating a situation of "two Chinas" in the  world, Wu said. This is something the Chinese Government and  people are strongly opposed to and can never accept.    Should the governments of the countries having diplomatic  relations with China endorse Li Denghui's trips, in whatever  name and form, it will deeply hurt the feelings of the Chinese  people and damage the friendly relations and cooperation between  China the and countries concerned, he stressed.    The spokesman noted that the Chinese Foreign Ministry has  respectively expressed to the countries involved the serious  concern of the Chinese Government.    "It is our hope that the countries concerned will cherish  the  overall interest of their relations with China, and stand on  guard against the political schemes of the Taiwan authorities,  so as to protect the hard-won friendly relations and cooperation  between them and China from any disruption and sabotage," the  spokesman said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On the morning of 4 March, Mongolian President  Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat, his wife, and other distinguished  Mongolian guests now on a visit to Vietnam laid a wreath paying  tribute to President Ho Chi Minh at his mausoleum. The wreath  carries the following inscription: A respectful Tribute to  President Ho Chi Minh -- Glorious Man of the Vietnamese Nation.    The delegation also visited President Ho Chi Minh's  residence  and office. At Uncle Ho's stilt house, President Ochirbat posed  for a while before some memorabilia that conjured up the image  of the great leader of the Vietnamese people. He was apparently  moved when Mr. Tran Viet Hoan, director of the late president's  heritage complex, recalled a statement by President Ho Chi Minh  that, although living far apart, the Vietnamese people and the  Mongolian people love each other dearly and they have always  supported each other. I firmly believe that the friendly and  cooperative relations between the two countries will certainly  develop with every passing day, thus contributing to the  maintenance of peace in Asia and the world.    President Ochirbat entered his thoughts in a souvenir book  and signed it.    After leaving Uncle Ho's stilt house, President Ochirbat and  his wife visited the Ho Chi Minh Museum where he was welcomed by  Curator Cu Van Truoc and the museum staff and was guided by them  on a tour of various galleries.</p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / International Company News: Kersaf leisure group lifts profit by 4% to R443m Kersaf Investments, the South African-based leisure group, which has widespread interests in hotels, casinos and cinemas, boosted after-tax profit by 4 per cent for the year to June to R443.4m (Dollars 124m) from R427.6m. Turnover increased 8 per cent to R2.22bn from R2.05bn, while operating profit rose 7 per cent to R574.2m from R536.1m a year ago. The dividend was raised to 150 cents a share from 147 cents. Although analysts regarded the results as satisfactory, most were disappointed at the final figures in light of the 15 per cent rise in pre-tax profit reported at the half year. The group attributed the drop in the second-half earnings largely to unrest during March in the former homeland of Bophuthatswana where Sun International's Sun City and Lost City, the largest contributors to group revenues, are based. The trouble deterred tourists.</p>

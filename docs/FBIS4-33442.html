			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 6 Jun (AFP) -- The Cuban Police have  tightened security around several diplomatic missions and  residences in Havana, while 124 Cubans continue to occupy the  residence of the Belgian ambassador hoping to obtain political  asylum.    Security has been beefed up, particularly around the  Argentine Embassy, some 100 meters from the Belgian residence,  in Miramar District (western Havana). A special brigade truck  and two patrol vehicles are blocking the street by the mission.  Also, dozens of security guards, some armed with AK-47 rifles,  were seen guarding the area for the first time since the  beginning of the crisis. The intense deployment apparently is  due to rumors of the imminent departure of would-be emigres to  Argentine diplomatic missions.    The situation appeared to be at a standstill in the Belgian  residence, which has been occupied for 10 days by 68 men, 32  women, and 24 children. Belgian and Cuban representatives have  been in daily contact, while Belgian special envoy Willy  Verriest is intent on trying to convince the refugees to leave  the building.</p>

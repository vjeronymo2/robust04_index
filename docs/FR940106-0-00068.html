			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. 1994 Management Measures_Recreational Fishery <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The recreational size and bag limits in 1994 are the same as in 1993 except for the bag limit for black rockfish off Oregon. The State of Oregon is concerned that numbers of black rockfish on the north Oregon coast are declining and has reduced the State bag limit from 15 rockfish of any species, to 15 rockfish of which no more than 10 may be black rockfish. The Council recommended that the same change be made to the bag limit in Federal waters to conserve the species and maintain consistency with Oregon regulations. The commercial fishery is not restricted at this time because the commercial catch of black rockfish is low, and commercial vessels have voluntarily agreed to avoid the nearshore areas where black rockfish are found. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Secretarial Actions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons stated above, the Secretary concurs with the Council's recommendations and announces the following management actions for 1994, including those that have not been changed since 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. General Definitions and Provisions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following definitions and provisions apply to the 1994 management measures, unless otherwise specified in a subsequent notice: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> A trip limit <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is the total allowable amount of a groundfish species or species complex, by weight, or by percentage of fish on board, that may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed per vessel from a single fishing trip. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> A daily trip limit <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is the maximum amount that may be taken and retained, possessed or landed per vessel in 24 consecutive hours, starting at 0001 hours local time. Only one landing of groundfish may be made in that 24-hour period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> A cumulative trip limit <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is the maximum amount that may be taken and retained, possessed or landed per vessel in a specified period of time, without a limit on the number of landings or trips. Cumulative trip limits for 1994 initially apply to calendar months. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Unless the fishery is closed, a vessel which has landed its cumulative or daily limit may continue to fish on the limit for the next legal period so long as the fish are not landed (offloaded) until the next legal period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) All weights are round weights or round weight equivalents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Percentages are based on round weights, and, unless otherwise specified, apply only to legal fish on board. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Legal fish means fish taken and retained, possessed, or landed in accordance with the provisions of 50 CFR part 663, the Magnuson Act, any notice issued under subpart B of part 663, and any other regulation promulgated or permit issued under the Magnuson Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Closure, when referring to closure of a fishery, means that taking and retaining, possessing or landing the particular species or species group is prohibited. (See the regulations at 50 CFR 663.2.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) The fishery management area for these species is the EEZ off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California between 3 and 200 nautical miles offshore, and bounded on the north by the Provisional International Boundary between the United States and Canada, and bounded on the south by the International Boundary between the United States and Mexico. All groundfish possessed 0&hyph;200 nautical miles offshore, or landed in, Washington, Oregon, or California are presumed to have been taken and retained from the fishery management area, unless otherwise demonstrated by the person in possession of those fish. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) Inseason changes to trip limits are announced by notices published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Information concerning changes to trip limits also is available from the NMFS Northwest and Southwest regional offices [see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  above]. Changes to trip limits are effective at the times stated in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notices. Once a change is effective, it is illegal to take and retain, possess, or land more fish than allowed under the new trip limit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena, Colombia, 14 Jun (AFP) -- Honduran  President Carlos Roberto Reina, during the first working session  of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena today, called  for a human-oriented economic integration process. He pointed  out that the foreign debt continues to be a heavy burden for the  Central American nations.    The leader seemed less optimistic about the region's  economic  recovery during the last few years than his other 20  Ibero-American colleagues. Reina said that it was still  impossible to speak of the expansion of economic recovery.    The Honduran president said "we must recognize that poverty  has increased in the region." This is the first Ibero-American  leaders' meeting he has attended, as the group has already  gathered in the previous three consecutive years: in Guadalajara  (Mexico), Madrid (Spain), and Salvador de Bahia (Brazil).    He added that "we must work toward an Ibero-American  community with organizations that have the power to decide." He  stressed that regional economic integration must not be the only  priority, as the process must also include other important  social issues.    Reina demanded "equal treatment" from the international  financial institutions for Central America, whose leaders he  encouraged to unite and to negotiate trade and commercial  agreements with the rest of the continent as a bloc.</p>

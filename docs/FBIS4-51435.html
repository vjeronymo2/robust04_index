			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 26 (XINHUA) -- Build a bridge so that  you can cross a river, build electric power so that you can no  longer be poor -- it is a saying being passed on throughout  China from village to village.    To the farmers living in mountainous regions and wishing to  have enough to eat and wear, this will not be just a dream. The  Chinese Government has vowed to redouble efforts to send  electric light to every county, to 95 percent of rural  households by 2000.    "China will make preferential policies concerning loans,  taxation and revenues in this regard to speed up electric power  projects to aid the poor in the vast countryside," said a  government official.    Meanwhile, China will implement a "source plan" to make  comprehensive use of water sources in mountainous areas, for  meeting the needs of people and livestock, for irrigation and  for generation of electricity.    According to statistics, 97 percent of the country's towns  and 89 percent of its rural households had been electrified by  1993. Per capita consumption of electricity in the countryside  rose to 275 kwh from less than 65 kwh in 1978, bringing the  gross figure to 249 billion kwh, or 35 percent of the country's  total consumption.    However, 28 counties and some 120 million of the rural  population in China remain without electricity, mainly in eight  areas such as eastern Inner Mongolia, Guizhong and the Three  Gorges. Among them, some eight million people even don't have  enough to eat and wear.    It has become obvious that the construction of hydroelectric  power facilities and the electrification of China's rural areas  have become priorities for farmers to overcome poverty.    China announced the building of facilities to electrify a  batch of counties in the early 1980s. By 1989, altogether 109  counties had met the requirements for rudimentary  electrification. The second batch of 200 counties is now  constructing power grids.    As a result, more than 33 million rural people have  benefited  from the projects in getting electricity and drinking water.  Moreover, government revenues of those counties doubled within  the five years of the electrification campaign, and redoubled in  the ensuing three years.    The ongoing National Electrification Work Conference has set  the target of building a total of 1,000 electrified counties  across the country by the turn of this century.    However, the shortage of capital, among others, is seriously  threatening the realization of this objective. "Despite  increased investments in the construction of electric power for  rural areas," explained an official, "The gap between supply and  demand expands."    Wang Shucheng, vice-minister of power industry, said that  about 30 billion yuan is needed simply to get electric power  through to the areas and households without electricity --  averaging more than four billion yuan each year in the next  seven years.    The State Planning Commission, the State Economic and Trade  Commission and the Ministry of Power Industry proposed phased  arrangements of construction projects after careful planning and  selection.    They suggested the expansion of big grids be the main trend  for covering the rural areas with electric power and reasonable  increases in investment be made to innovate rural power grids  and small hydroelectric and coal-fired power stations and to set  up demonstration projects in using new sources of energy.    In addition, they said, more channels should be opened for  the flow of capital in this direction and joint power  construction should be encouraged.</p>

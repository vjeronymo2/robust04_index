			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Gan lags midway but sees gain for year GAN, the French state-controlled insurance group, yesterday announced a fall in first-half net profits, to FFr372m (Dollars 64m) from FFr487m. However, it forecast an improvement in full-year results compared with 1992. Mr Francois Heilbronner, chairman, said the group was well-prepared for privatisation. Gan, one of the 21 publicly-owned groups due to be sold by the government, could be privatised next year. The group, which suffered a sharp fall in profits in 1992  - to FFr402m from FFr2.32bn  - because of substantial property provisions and depressed insurance markets, said it was on the road to recovery. Group turnover rose 8.6 per cent to FFr62.3bn. Insurance activities returned FFr43.7bn, of which 26 per cent came from overseas activities. The company said the fire and accident insurance businesses had shown a healthy improvement over 1992, and that CIC, its banking subsidiary, had lifted net profits from FF91m in the first half of 1992 to FFr235m this time. Mr Heilbronner's comments about the remainder of this year and the improved outlook for 1994, suggest the French insurance market is beginning to recover after a sharp decline in 1992. Industry analysts said, however, that recovery was likely to be gradual.</p>

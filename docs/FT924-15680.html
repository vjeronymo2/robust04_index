			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee prices up after pact talks WORLD COFFEE prices rose yesterday following marathon talks on a new International Coffee Agreement, which ran through the night to end at 7 am yesterday. Delegates to the International Coffee Organisation appear to have succeeded in wiping out the bitter aftertaste of their last meeting in July. Progress towards a new coffee pact has been exceedingly slow, but enough has been achieved in the past 10 days to reassure the markets, analysts believe. Producers and consumers have agreed a definition of the universal quota, which will be the foundation of a future pact using export quotas to support prices. But they failed to reach definitive agreement on controlling the quota system or on selectivity - under which consumers would be able to choose the type of coffees they wanted to import. The two sides were able to agree only on the broad principles. In London yesterday the November robusta contract rose Dollars 16 to Dollars 794 a tonne, and in late trading in New York the December arabica contract was 1.15 cents up at 56.85 cents a lb. One London trader said yesterday the more positive close to the ICO talks had helped market sentiment, 'but whether there will be a new agreement I still have grave doubts'. Ms Judith Ganes, analyst with Merrill Lynch in New York, said great strides were not made by the ICO, but it had accomplished something. 'At least they didn't strangle each other like they did in July.' The markets are also responding to the firmness of the internal coffee market in Brazil, which could herald a downturn in exports, and there is talk of an attempt by a large trade house to spark technical buying and short covering. The ICO will meet again from November 23 to December 1, and it has left open the possibility for a further meeting from December 9. Delegates now have a chance of agreeing a new pact by the end of the year. But they have yet to broach the potentially divisive subjects of price levels and market share.</p>

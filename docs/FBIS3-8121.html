The Czech Government already officially recognised Macedonia  and announced its intention to set up diplomatic relations on  ambassadorial level on March 2. In fact, the Czech Republic has  practically recognised Macedonia by voting for its acceptance  into the United Nations.    The note was extended to the Macedonian side today by  Director of the Czech Foreign Ministry Euro-Atlantic Division  Ivan Busniak. He also handed his Macedonian colleagues a  message from Czech President Vaclav Havel, Premier Vaclav Klaus  and Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec.    Macedonia won independence two years ago after the breakup  of  the former Yugoslavia. It was practically the only Yugoslav  republic which gained independence in a peaceful way. The  position of Greece, which objects to the use by Macedonia of the  name "Macedonia" and the state symbols which are considered by  Greeks as their historical heritage prevents more rapid  international recognition of Macedonia.    "Given that the Czech Republic has resorted to this step  under a certain concrete situation existing in the Balkans and  especially in the southern part of the region, its decision to  establish diplomatic relations with Macedonia is a recognition  of the balanced, sober and realistic politics of the current  Macedonian leadership," Busniak said.    At the same time, he noted that the decision was not taking  sides in the dispute between Macedonia and Greece, which has  been going on for over two years. That is why the Czech  Republic recognised Macedonia as the "former Yugoslav republic"  and at the same time the Czech Government stated that it  recognised Macedonia in its current borders.    It is impossible to expect opening of embassies in Prague  and  Skopje in the near future primarily due to economic reasons, he  said.    "We are really greatly interested in opening an embassy in  Prague. However we are building our diplomatic service  practically from scratch and we have neither sufficient  financial means nor necessary cadres," Macedonian Foreign  Minister Stevo Crvenkovski said, adding that his country was  able to open 25 representative offices abroad at the most.</p>

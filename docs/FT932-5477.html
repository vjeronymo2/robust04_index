			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / International Company News: Accor interested in merger of Sofitel, Meridien chains ACCOR, the French hotel, catering and tourism group, says it is keen to merge its luxury Sofitel establishments with the Meridien chain, in which Air France has a majority stake. Accor said yesterday that the French government's privatisation programme and pressure on Air France to dispose of its hotel interests would result in Meridien needing a private sector partner. However, Accor said that its current financial state meant it could not afford to pay for the Meridien hotels. Accor's net profits fell 15.5 per cent last year to FFr870m (Dollars 159m). Instead, it said, the Sofitel and Meridien hotels could form part of a new luxury hotel company. Accor said it did not yet know how much of the merged group it would end up owning, but added that its preference would be a minority stake of between 35 and 45 per cent. Accor owns 85 Sofitel hotels, the majority in Europe. There are 58 Meridien hotels, mostly outside Europe. Accor said the two chains would complement each other geographically. As well as their European interests, the merged group would have a presence in the US, Africa and Asia. It said neither chain was big enough on its own to compete internationally with the large hotel groups. A merged hotel company would be sufficiently big to hold its own, it said. Sofitel is Accor's most luxurious hotel brand. The group owns a range of other hotel chains, including Novotel, Ibis and the budget Formule 1 hotels. In 1991, Accor acquired Wagons-Lits, the Belgian travel group, and added its Pullman luxury hotels to the Sofitel chain. Air France yesterday refused to comment on the Accor proposal. It said others had expressed an interest in the Meridien hotels in the past and that no decision had yet been taken on the future of the chain. The discussions with Accor are believed, however, to be at an early stage.</p>

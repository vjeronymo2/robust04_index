			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: Viacom sues to block QVC bid for Paramount VIACOM, the US cable television company bidding for entertainment group Paramount Communications, yesterday launched a legal broadside aimed at blocking a higher bid from television shopping group QVC Network. In a suit filed in the Federal District Court in New York, it alleges the QVC bid is the latest in a series of monopolistic actions by Mr John Malone, president of Tele-Communications Inc (TCI), the largest cable television service in the US, aimed at controlling the cable industry. Mr Malone also heads Liberty Media, a cable programmer spun off from TCI, which in turn has a large stake in QVC, which is headed by Mr Barry Diller, a leading film industry executive. The suit seeks damages for the harm done to Viacom by these alleged monopolist practices and an injunction to stop the practices, including the QVC bid. In a statement, TCI said it had 'anticipated the possibility of frivolous lawsuits', even though it had no involvement in any Paramount takeover activity. Viacom's action came four days after QVC launched a hostile Dollars 9.5bn bid for Paramount in response to an agreed bid from Viacom, which was worth around Dollars 7.4bn on the basis of yesterday's stock market share prices. However, Viacom maintained its suit had been planned long before QVC launched its offer. The action seemed to rule out for the time being a higher offer by Viacom for Paramount. Viacom is best known for its cable programming, such as the pop music network MTV, but it is also a substantial cable service business. The suit says that TCI, which covers about 20 per cent of the US cable market, reaches a critical mass of viewers that are essential for the success of any cable programmer and that Mr Malone uses that power to ' extract unfair and anti-competitive terms and conditions from cable programmers, including Viacom.' To support its case, it cites several examples of negotiations between the two companies over programming in which TCI is alleged to have acted in a threatening manner. 'Malone's monopoly power has intimidated the entire cable industry, but we could no longer sit idly by as he and his controlled companies excluded competing programmers from his cable systems and undermined our services and those of other programmers,' Viacom added.</p>

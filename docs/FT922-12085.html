			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / International Company News: Hyundai to shift PC management to US KOREA'S Hyundai Group is to shift management of its worldwide personal computer and computer peripherals operations to the US to improve its response to rapidly changing market conditions and to gain earlier access to advanced technologies. In an unusual move for an Asian company, full management control, marketing, product development and product assembly for the group's Dollars 750m personal computer and peripherals business will be moved from Seoul to San Jose, California. The decision reflects Hyundai's recognition of the critical value of day-to-day contact with suppliers and customers, said Mr Edward Thomas, the newly appointed president of Hyundai's Information Systems Division. Mr Thomas, a veteran of the US computer industry, said his mandate was to create an autonomous business unit with global responsibility for expanding Hyundai's personal computer sales. Last year, Hyundai sold about Dollars 300m-worth of personal computers in the US. 'We should be able to double that in a few years,' said Mr Thomas. 'We fully expect to have our next generation of desktop and notebook computers - designed, engineered and assembled in America - shipping to US and world markets by the end of the year,' he added. The move would enable Hyundai to reduce the time it takes to bring a new product to market by more than 30 per cent, Mr Thomas said. The relocation would not displace Korean workers, Mr Thomas stressed. Circuit board manufacturing would continue to be performed at Hyundai's Korean factories, he said. However, a US assembly operation would enable Hyundai to compete more effectively with US computer makers through a quicker response to customer requirements. A further advantage is that Hyundai would be able to react more rapidly to price trends, Mr Thomas said. Once the US operation is in full swing - probably by year-end - Mr Thomas plans to turn to the European market and establish European sales, service and assembly operations.</p>

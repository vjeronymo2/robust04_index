Using the recognised yardstick of total regular premium business plus 10 per cent of single premiums, volume declined from Pounds 228.2m to Pounds 227.7m. Total annual premiums fell from Pounds 88m to Pounds 85.6m, but single premiums rose by 3 per cent to Pounds 409.6m, and single premium life business grew 5 per cent to Pounds 956.7m, mainly on the back of single-premium unit-linked bond sales.

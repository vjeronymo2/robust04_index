			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Relayed by Warsaw TV Polonia Network] </F>   [Text] [Announcer] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the  fascist-oriented Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, is --  according to GAZETA WYBORCZA -- to visit Poland in a few days'  time. He has been invited by one of the activists of the  Samoobrona National Front.    [Jacek Hugo-Bader, GAZETA WYBORCZA] The activist is a very  rich man who has known Zhirinovskiy personally and who boasts  about the fact that a few days before the elections in Russia he  had congratulated Zhirinovskiy on his victory in these  elections. I think that this man's motivation is to capitalize  on Zhirinovskiy's name for publicity purposes in order to enable  his grouping, which is new and unknown in Poland, to get into  politics.    [Correspondent Monika Sieradzka] The author of the  invitation, a rich entrepreneur, is convinced that Zhirinovskiy  will win the future presidential elections in Russia. He wants  to give him his financial support by, among other things,  investing in Russia.    The invitation emphasizes that various things happened in  the  history of our nations but that this was the fault of  politicians. In his opinion, the views of Zhirinovskiy and those  of the Samoobrona National Front are convergent and the two  parties should cooperate with each other.    [Hugo-Bader] The person who invited Zhirinovskiy said that  he  wants to arrange a meeting between Zhirinovskiy and any  politician, so that they can talk to each other.    [Announcer] It is still not known whether Polish politicians  will want to meet Zhirinovskiy. According to Lech Falandysz  from the president's Chancellery, it is better to talk to  Zhirinovskiy than to isolate him. It is better to let him into  Poland than to refuse him entry into the country as the Germans,  the French, and the Australians have done.</p>

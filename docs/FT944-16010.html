			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Cost cutting planned at Royal Insurance Royal Insurance, the composite insurer, yesterday confirmed that it had begun a reorganisation programme intended to cut overheads as well as improve customer service. The company said its plans to increase specialisation at 12 regional offices covering non-life business and improve work processes might lead to fewer jobs though it had set no figure. It did not rule out compulsory redundancies but hoped staffing levels could fall as a result of staff turnover. Mr Roger Prideaux, public affairs manager of Royal's general insurance division, said that in an increasingly competitive sector 'we must be more open-minded and flexible than we have been before'. Royal Insurance said that from next year regional offices would no longer handle all aspects of its businesses, from business development to claims settlement. Instead they would develop expertise in working with particular customers such as national brokers dealing in 'big ticket' commercial insurance policies, financial intermediaries, and private individuals. Mr Prideaux did not envisage large-scale movements in staff, although management responsibilities would change. Many backroom staff would be offered retraining, he said. Royal suffered heavy losses in the early 1990s but recently reported a Pounds 139m increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 191m for the first six month of this year. The shares fell 9p to 290p.</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Mouse that roared: Small fire can destroy a small prime minister This was no Geoffrey Howe; his quarry no Margaret Thatcher. The ultimate effect could, however, be the same. Yesterday's resignation speech by the former chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, lacked the subtlety, and the force, of Lord Howe's remarks of November 14 1990. As was evident within seconds of its launch on that fateful day, the former foreign secretary's verbal Exocet devastated the House of Commons and destroyed the prime minister who had so recently forced his resignation. His final words, those that triggered the explosion, still ring in political ears. 'The time has come for others to consider their response to the tragic conflict of loyalty with which I have perhaps wrestled for far too long,' he said. It was amazing, coming from a soft-spoken diplomat whose previous political assaults had been likened to attacks by a dead sheep. Mr Michael Heseltine sat just a few feet away. The eternal pretender was quick to seize the moment. The drama of November 1990 began. Its denouement was certain. Within eight days the huge figure of the Iron Lady crashed to the ground. Less predictably, Mr John Major, not Mr Heseltine, was selected to replace her. We cannot expect the history of 1990 to repeat itself, except perhaps as farce. Lord Howe commanded the sympathy of many in the Conservative party, then at least outwardly united under a strong leader. Mr Lamont may win a more appreciative audience from historians than he presently enjoys, but for the moment the sad truth is that he is a discredited figure, with relatively few friends even among his own colleagues. However powerful his words may be, the fact that they are ut-tered by him weakens their impact. Against that, you do not need the full blast of a Howe resignation speech to cut the ground from under the feet of a John Major. The smaller prime minister can be destroyed by smaller fire, aimed by smaller fry. Mr Major is the opposite of a strong leader; the Tories are not one but two parties. Their anti-European Bolsheviks, still wedded to their great heroine, are engaged in deadly battle with their conservative Mensheviks. Everyone will have heard the ex-chancellor's observation that the government gives the impression of being 'in office but not in power'. It was a perfectly-aimed rifle-shot. In a few short sharp sentences Mr Lamont painted an unforgettable picture of a frantic prime minister dominated by opinion polls and his party managers. There is some self-serving intent in this. Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman, and Mr Richard Ryder, chief whip, are regarded in the Lamont camp as the former chancellor's direct assassins. His call for an independent central bank, now becoming a tradition in chancellors' resignation speeches, served to underline the impression of a nervous head of government manipulating both the extent and timing of interest rate changes in order to manipulate public support. This will be remembered. Mr Lamont's advice to Mr Major to consider what is right before deciding on the manner of its presentation, to have thought for the good of the country rather than the headlines of the next 36 hours, may reverberate long after some of the more arcane apologias on his conduct of economic policy have faded away. 'Unless this approach is changed,' said the ex-chancellor, 'the government will not survive - and will not deserve to.' Mr Major's subsequent explanation, that he is supported by a small majority in the House of Commons, revealed his continuing inability to understand why people hold his ministry in such low esteem. Certainly he is obliged to trim his sails to the realities of the Commons, but he must also indicate, by spoken intent always and by deed where possible, that he is guiding us in some established direction. This, the electorate told him by its votes in the recent Newbury by-election, he has failed to do. What may save the prime minister is that there is no obvious pretender, no Michael Heseltine, waiting to challenge him for the leadership. Mr Kenneth Clarke, who is often spoken of as such, has first to prove himself as chancellor. He is anyway no friend of the Bolsheviks; he announced firmly yesterday that he stands at the 'hard centre' of his party - pro-European, fiscally responsible, and socially aware. His address to the parliamentary press gallery was an object lesson in how these things should be done; Mr Major could never be so articulate, so frank, and so clear in so short a speech. The voters of Christchurch may now have the prime minister's political life in their hands. A by-election in that archetypically safe Conservative seat is expected to be held on July 8 or 15, unless the government gets itself into a blue funk and holds off for longer. A Liberal Democrat triumph in Christchurch could not be blamed on the incumbency of Mr Norman Lamont, as was the loss of Newbury. There is only one man who could carry the can for such an electoral disaster. It is still prudent to aver that if the turn in the economy begins to be felt by the electorate, the Conservatives' fortunes will improve and with that Mr Major's chances of survival in office. Who knows, with the good candidate they have put in, the Tories might even hold Christchurch. Against that, a more deadly intention of fate is beginning to become apparent. Only a year or so of demonstrably competent government can erase the image of Mr Major's style of administration held in so many people's minds and etched in our memories by Mr Lamont yesterday. It is not clear that a year is available.</p>

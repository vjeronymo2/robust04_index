			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Political observer Vitaliy Golovachev article: "The </F> Economy Has Stumbled on the Threshold of the Market. And Hurt  Itself Badly"]    [Text] Whatever people say, signs of market relations  (both positive and, alas, more clearly, negative signs) are  still appearing in Russia, attesting to complex processes in the  economy. Let us take the production slump, for example.  Whereas at the beginning of last year the shortage of supplies  of raw materials, semimanufactures, and fuel was the predominant  cause of stoppages, in the first quarter of 1994 quite a  different factor is already coming to the fore -- demand. That  is, the most important thing today is whether the output of a  given enterprise is in demand.    This would appear to be entirely a market trend. But this is  what is alarming. Month after month passes, but many "drowning"  enterprises have no intention of engaging in structural  restructuring and do not have survival plans.    More and more new sections and shops and entire plants are  falling prey to paralysis. There were lengthy stoppages of  individual production processes or of an entire plant at 3,800  enterprises in January, at 4,300 in February, and at almost  5,000 in March. Losses of worktime exceeded 60 million man-days.    The most alarming thing is the scale of the crisis. The fall  in production is increasing every month: The physical volume of  production fell 23.1 percent in January (compared with the same  period last year); 24.1 percent in February; 27.4 percent in  March. There has not been such a collapse in all the time of  implementing the reforms. If we compare the situation  with 1989, we will see a striking picture: Production of  industrial output has been more than halved and now stands at  just 49.6 percent. You cannot envy our government, since Russia  seems to be crossing a dangerous, critical line, approaching the  large-scale destruction of its industrial potential.    This is largely connected with the snowballing crisis of  nonpayments. Operational materials just received from the  Russian State Committee for Statistics attest that the problem  is being exacerbated, jeopardizing the country's economic  security. As of 1 January creditors' defaulted arrears amounted  to 16 trillion rubles [R]; as of 1 February -- R20 trillion; as  of 1 March -- R25 trillion. The fact that nonpayments are  increasing at a faster pace than inflation attests to a  deepening crisis.    Meanwhile, many millions of Russians are feeling this  problem  very directly in their family budget. In Russia, contrary to  common sense, the flawed practice of nonpayment (or incomplete  payment) of wages and other payments is assuming an increasingly  wide scale. Thus, it turns out that someone has worked in a  shop for two weeks, he goes to the cash desk and sees an  announcement: "In connection with the fact that the state has  not settled up with the enterprise for the state order, the  plant has no money, and wages for this month will be issued  later." Is this not absurd, is it not humiliating? Millions of  Russians live without wages for three weeks, for a month, for  two months. They sell things, get into debt....    I had hoped that, in connection with the fact that there had  been a considerable transfusion of money into the economy in  February (R1.6 trillion), the notorious knot of nonpayments  would be untied little by little. But no, it turns out that  everything is the other way around -- the defaulted wage arrears  are not diminishing but increasing. As of 1 January, they  totaled R766 billion; as of 1 February -- R1.681 trillion; as of  1 March -- R2.085 trillion; as of 1 April (according to  preliminary operational data) -- R2.374 trillion. In other  words, during the first quarter the total of wage debts  increased more than threefold, noticeably overtaking the rate of  inflation.    The situation is becoming dangerously explosive. The  miners' pickets outside the White House are being replaced by  nuclear scientists, students.... Will we live to see the day  when working people of all the 30,000 enterprises where workers  are owed wages will rise up?    In an attempt to avoid this and to strengthen the legal  base,  on 10 March 1994 Russian President Boris Yeltsin issued the  edict "On Liability for Violations of Citizens' Labor Rights,"  which instructs the Prosecutor's Office to pay "special  attention to preventing cases of delays over paying wages." But  the edict has essentially never worked. First, as frequently  happens, there is no sufficiently clear mechanism for  implementing it; second, in our crazy economy it is by no means  always possible to find the specific guilty persons; third, what  can the Prosecutor's Office or a court (which, in any case, are  swamped with cases) do if an enterprise is up to its eyes in  debt?    In order to ease the acuteness of the situation at least in  some way, specialists propose temporarily, pending the  elimination of the nonpayments crisis, to introduce a procedure  for reserving certain funds for wages in the accounts of  enterprises (let us assume four to six times the minimum wage  for each working person). The idea is as follows: Let us say  that money has come into a plant from a client, the necessary  sum is at once transferred to a special account, and it is not  allowed to spend the money on anything but wages -- neither on  taxes nor for other purposes. According to Valeriy Kolosov,  Russian Federation first deputy minister of labor, the Ministry  of Labor sent similar proposals to the Ministry of Finance, and  the acting minister of finance apparently supported the idea,  but the matter went no further than this.... Maybe this was  because the wages of Finance Ministry employees are never  delayed?    Nobody today can say exactly which part of the wages has not  been paid through the fault of the state (by "clamping down" on  budget funds -- for the state order, grain sold to the state,  etc.) and how many debts have arisen because of clumsy  commercial and economic activity. If, let us assume, a nonstate  firm is a potential bankrupt and credits [nachislyayet] its  working people with money which it cannot pay, this is, after  all, a matter for the firm itself -- think, bustle, restructure  yourself, find your niche on the market. But when the state  starts engaging in deception -- that beats everything, as the  saying goes.... So I ask: For how much of the debt of more  than R2 trillion is the state responsible? No idea. How is it  possible to manage the country without knowing such very  important, fundamental things?    In any case the government is obliged, finally, to  vigorously  set about resolving these very painful problems. Industry bears  the lion's share of the wage arrears (according to preliminary  operational data -- R1.332 trillion). What awaits these  enterprises? Will state debts be paid, will the process of  effective structural restructuring, clearing up of finances, and  bankruptcies of drowning enterprises begin? We cannot go on  swimming with the tide, hoping that somehow everything will be  all right of its own accord. The disease is intensifying and  going deeper, and without effective treatment it could turn into  a great calamity. Analyzing the first quarter's results and  observing the government's passivity, you catch yourself  thinking: Are the premier and his team capable of providing  such effective treatment? If so, it would be a good thing to  demonstrate this in practice. I will remind you, incidentally,  that, as the State Committee for Statistics bears witness, there  are already 4.4 million unemployed in Russia today (according to  the International Labor Organization classification). But  taking into account those who are not fully employed, the total  potential for unemployment stands at 8.8 million people (11.7  percent of the economically active population). This is another  alarm signal....    In conclusion I will cite a fact which can be viewed in two  ways: The share of the labor remuneration fund in the overall  volume of monetary incomes has fallen from 65 percent (in the  first quarter of last year) to 59 percent in January-March 1994.  That is, the role of wages has diminished somewhat. This is  because, first, the new rich are passing huge money through  commercial banks, making a sizable profit, and, second, many  Russians are increasingly actively seeking somewhere that they  can earn a bit extra, in addition to their main occupation.  This "bit extra" almost compares (in size) with their wages.  On the one hand this is good: The population's enterprise and  activeness attest to a change in the stereotypes of thinking, to  a gradual adaptation to the conditions of market economics. But  there is another side here too: Inadequate wages, not paid on  time moreover, accustom people to doing hack work and working at  half stretch in their main job, in order to make a bit more on  the side....    On the whole, the average monthly real wage, calculated  with due regard for the consumer prices index, fell 4 percent in  the first quarter of 1994 (compared with the same period last  year) and 3 percent in March (compared with last March). By  comparison with the drop in production, we received even more  than we earned. This presages a new surge of inflation in the  second half of April and in May. No, stabilization of the  standard of living and an increase in it are possible only by  way of reviving the economy and an effective structural policy.  No other artificial methods will be able to lead to success....</p>

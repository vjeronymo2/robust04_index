			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1725 GMT on 18 March broadcasts a regular 10-minute  long "Details" program, presented by correspondent Sergey  Dorenko, which is devoted to recent rumors about preparations  for a coup in Russia and Yeltsin's poor health. Dorenko says  that today practically everybody is talking publicly and openly  about a conspiracy but the authorities are silent and behave  almost as if they are participants in this plot. Today there  were numerous meetings and sittings in the Kremlin and around  it. People have discussed what to say, with whom to talk, and  who will talk about the recent rumors. Many of them say they  have nothing to talk about because there has been no coup. Some  of them are afraid that if they talk about this with somebody,  later the president may learn about it and, possibly,  misinterpret their remarks.    Dorenko then says: "The latest information is that today  some  people from the State Duma called the Kremlin and asked one of  the president's assistants whether it is true that the president  was delivered by air this afternoon from Sochi in very bad  condition so he could be treated here. Well, around ten people  in the Kremlin say that this is a lie. But all of them are  saying that they will not talk about this in front of the  camera. We know that in the near future a certain event is to  take place in Sochi where journalists with cameras will be  invited and they will be able to show the healthy president to  the people. The apparatus is working with awful delays which we  would like to explain by the fact that they are simply doing  their work inefficiently. The only person in the Kremlin who is  not afraid to speak for television at all is Georgiy Satarov,  the president's assistant."    The video then shows Georgiy Satarov giving an interview to  Yelena Karayeva, an RTV correspondent. She asks him to comment  on the rumors about Yeltsin's poor health. He says there are  forces that would prefer to have a bad situation in the country.  The correspondent asks him to explain whom he means. Satarov  says: "There are two kinds of politicians. We are talking about  those who are in principle outside legal politics and do not use  legal methods, and those who, let us say, do not have experience  in public politics and they know full well that they do not have  chances, even if they are respectable people, they do not have  chances to come to power as a result of a normal democratic  process. These kind of people do exist. I am talking, above  all, about the type and not about specific persons." He adds  that he cannot speak about any particular person because he has  no real facts.    The correspondent asks Georgiy Satarov whether former KGB  members and former bosses of the Ministry of Internal Affairs  who have money and real power even now could start to use all  kinds of propaganda to influence people. Satarov says: "Yes,  potentially, of course, this could be done. But I do not know  for sure whether such a team exists or not at the present time.  But some facts could be interpreted in this way." But he adds  that he does not have enough facts to confirm this.    The correspondent then says that today they tried to speak  about all these issues with many prominent political figures but  they all refused to speak with journalists and said that they  were too busy. Satarov says that it was difficult for him to  find time for this interview as well and he has only a few  minutes. He adds: "But on the other hand we should speak about  this because, of course, people are interested to know where the  president is, what he is doing, why he decided to have a rest  and what all this means. Of course, they should know this and  we should speak about it."    Presenter Sergey Dorenko then continues to comment on this  issue. He says that despite the fact that the authorities do  not want to speak about this it is clear that the Kremlin is  very anxious about these rumors. For example, Yuriy Baturin has  interrupted his holiday and returned to Moscow and Stepashin  urgently returned to work after his illness.    Dorenko then discusses who was the organizer of these rumors  and who would benefit because of them. There are several  versions. One of them is that the president himself has  organized all this so as to introduce a state of emergency in  the country and thus, to get rid of opposition. This is a very  weak argument. The second version says that some politicians  like Soskovets, Luzhkov, or Skokov want to come to power now  because they are afraid that "foolish and unpredictable" voters  will allow Zhirinovskiy or Rutskoy to come to power. But the  president supports these politicians and even considers Luzhkov  as one of his possible successors. Communists are not  interested in these rumors either because they do not have  control over the Army and they hope to win only at open  democratic elections. So, it seems as if there are no people  who would be interested in all that. But the presenter adds  that according to Yuriy Baturin these rumors are some kind of  smoke-screen. He concludes: "When everybody gets used to talks  about a conspiracy and stops paying any attention to them  everything will start and we will learn the name of the author  of the present artillery preparation."</p>

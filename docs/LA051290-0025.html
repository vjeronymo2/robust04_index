			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MILLS COLLEGE STUDENTS PROTEST DECISION TO ADMIT MEN IN 1991  </P> <P> Perhaps someone can explain why:  </P> <P> 1) When women are introduced to a previously all-male environment, it is  termed, in so many words, a victory for women everywhere and a further  breakdown of the barriers between men and women.  </P> <P> 2) When men are introduced to a previously all-female environment we hear  things such as, "This is a women's institution and we will not accept this,"  and " . . . students fear the arrival of men will destroy what they call the  nurturing atmosphere at Mills."  </P> <P> Is a nurturing atmosphere a one-sided thing? I can imagine the reaction of  women if an all-male student body sported T-shirts saying, "Better Dead Than  Co-Ed."  </P> <P> GORDON MORRIS  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By He Jun: "Freshmen To Pay Tuition in 37 Top </F> Universities"]    [Text] Freshmen students attending China's top 37 colleges  and universities will have to pay their own tuition beginning  this fall, the State Education Commission announced yesterday.    And when they graduate, they will have to find their own  jobs  as part of this year's reform of the higher education system.    Students attending these 37 institutes will be asked to pay  annual tuition of 1,000 to 1,500 yuan ($115 to $175), according  to State Education Commission (SEC) officials.    The new tuition policy is designed to eventually replace the  current so-called "dual track system" for college enrollments  and job assignments.    The policy is meant to maintain higher education standards.  uphold the policy of equal educational opportunities for all  students and encourage collegians to study harder, according to  Zhang Tianbao, SEC Vice-Minister.    The Chinese Government previously paid for everything but  food and clothing for college students.    Then, in the mid-1980s, institutions began enrolling  enterprise funded and self-funded students.    These students, who pay their own way, have been warmly  welcomed by colleges. Schools see them as a source of revenue.    Self-funded students have increased substantially over the  past few years and now account for 40 to 50 percent of some  academies' enrollments.    But the rise in self-funded students has come at a cost,  according to Zhang.    These undergraduates have actually lessened the quality of  student bodies, he charged, especially at schools accepting  pupils who scored low on the national college entrance exam in  exchange for higher tuition fees.    The practice has also kept some needy students with higher  scores from going to better schools, he added.    The new policy sets one cut-off score for each school and  establishes a tuition standard for all new students Zhang said.    Students at other colleges will abide by the old policies,  he  added.    The universities and colleges piloting the new policy are  mostly directly guided by SEC. They include Qinghua, Beijing  and Nankai universities.    While emphasizing that higher education is non-compulsory  education, Zhang said tuition standards must be set according to  the exact costs for each student as well as the resources of  students' families and local economic conditions.    Since some schools used to charge 2,000 to 4,000 yuan ($230  to $460) annual tuition from enterprise- and self-funded  students, the incomes of some colleges will likely decrease with  the advent of the new policy Zhang said.</p>

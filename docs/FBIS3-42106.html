			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Danilkin under the rubric "Private </F> Investigation": "From Russia with a Nuclear Welcome. Do You Want  a Bomb? No Problem"]    [Text] It is a commonplace that it takes 1 kg of uranium to  produce one atom bomb. It is another matter that this is only  raw material. And the bomb ends up with considerably less power  than, for example, the one dropped on Hiroshima. And this  depends largely on the degree of enrichment of the uranium. But  the fact is that it works!    And now the information obtained in the Ministry of Internal  Affairs of Russia: During the past year several dozen thefts of  uranium-235, uranium-238, and other radioactive substances from  secret defense industry enterprises of the country have been  registered. The figures for last year are being amended. In each  case no less than 1 kg has been stolen, and most frequently they  each take a piece weighing 4-6 kg. One more stipulation must be  made here: We are speaking only about cases where the criminals  were apprehended and the dangerous cargo confiscated. One could  quite logically assume that we have not managed to arrest all  the uranium thieves. And now attention: According to figures in  the German press, as of today the FRG is investigating 150  criminal cases involving illegal trade in radioactive  substances. Law enforcement organs there assume that the lion's  share of these substances migrated to Germany over the vast  expanses of the once inviolable Union. But even that is not all.  Let us not be idealists: In spite of German meticulousness and  care, there is no doubt that this is only a certain part of the  whole. The ones who failed. If there were no uranium smugglers  who succeeded, this business would wither on the vine. The  Russian nuclear business is three years old. Previously it was  simply impossible. Now it is attractive to many.  <H5>  May Dreams </H5>   Last year Vladimir K. was still working in a large Moscow  scientific research institute that dealt with problems of  nuclear energy. On his way home from work he usually met his  friend Aleksandr P., who was not employed anywhere and lived on  odd-job earnings. In spite of the difference in their social  positions, both of the young people were equally short of money.    When entertaining his friend, Vladimir frequently told him  various stories from the institute to the effect that they  practically have uranium coming out of their ears and nobody is  worried about it. In his words, an equal if not a greater mess  was being made in the neighboring associate enterprise, which is  also secret and to which Vladimir also has access. One warm May  evening the friends did not have enough money for beer and were  dreaming about wealth. If there is uranium coming out of their  ears, why not take advantage of an opportunity? This could be  done best in the "P.O. box enterprises," at the associated  enterprise.    ... In the middle of May Vladimir K. managed to steal a 4 kg  chunk of uranium which, although it was considered to be only  slightly enriched, still "gave off radiation." In order not to  get a large dose, Vladimir wrapped what he had stolen in special  foil and the placed it in an ordinary cellophane package. He  boarded the commuter train and went home to Dedovsk near Moscow.  He had no Geiger counter, so up to this point he did not know  what kind of doses the other people in the car or he himself had  received.    In Dedovsk the friends buried the package of uranium in a  suburban forest and started to think about to whom and, the main  thing, for how much they could sell the "bomb." The task was not  that simple, and it was necessary to bring four more people from  that same company in on it. Through joint efforts they managed  to make connections with people who knew something about prices  on the black market. It turned out that they should ask no less  than $60,000 for this piece. By this time none of the six were  working anywhere, the transaction promised good money, and they  were already dreaming of a new life.    They began to look for a buyer. But from that moment, in the  words of one of the operatives, "they began to suffer from an  old affliction"--the fear of losing their wealth. They thought  someone might find the package of uranium in the forest, so they  dug it up and moved it to Dedovsk, where they hid it in a  garage. Then they hid it again, in the garret of a residential  building whose residents had no suspicion of the danger that  threatened them.    Their search for a buyer lasted a half-year. In the words of  the "nuclear" six, they would have sold the goods to anyone who  would pay good money; they were not concerned about what  happened to their product after that. It was considered  axiomatic that the "bomb" would interest foreigners and  therefore they looked for contacts with them. The business even  reached drivers of heavy trucks from the Baltic region. But  after hearing the proposals, the majority of the Baltic  residents stepped on the gas, and the few who did agree to buy  paid a miserly price. Ultimately the zealous activity of the six  was noticed by the regional administration for fighting  organized crime. Experienced operatives from the Moscow suburb  Krasnogorsk watched the group for three weeks and then arrested  them. A special group assigned to work with radioactive  substances was called to confiscate the stolen uranium.    When the leader of the operations group spoke with the  official representative of the enterprise the 4 kg of uranium  had come from, he stated that "every mouse is accounted for  around here." To which the Krasnogorsk militiaman responded:  "Maybe a mouse cannot get by you, but 4 kg of uranium were  stolen from you."  <H5>  Our Country Is Large... </H5>   A militia colonel and deputy department head of the Main  Administration for Economic Crimes of the Ministry of Internal  Affairs of Russia, Vitaliy Zus, confirmed to the correspondent  that dozens of thefts of radioactive materials are registered  here in a year. Of rare earth metals--hundreds. Traffic in  radioactive materials is a sign of the times. We know the  explanation for this kind of trafficking: the collapse of the  Union, the conversion that has been started, economic confusion,  and the liberal conditions on the borders that facilitate taking  goods out.    In spite of all its cataclysms, Russia has remained a  country  with immense territories. With a great multitude of defense  enterprises and the most diverse "P.O. Box enterprises" where  radioactive elements and that same uranium are used. A demand  for inexpensive radioactive substances has arisen among  mysterious foreign consumers. But the conditions at the secret  enterprises have remained the same. A worker of that same  department of the Main Administration for Economic Crimes,  militia Colonel Sergey Mayorov, noted that about 90 percent of  the thefts of strategic raw material can be explained by the  possibility of free access, including for people from the  outside. And also there are all kinds of violations of rules for  accounting for and storing raw material.    The stolen uranium and other radioactive substances are  usually offered to foreigners or intermediaries who are able to  travel abroad. Of course it is easiest to meet such people in  large cities, in Moscow. Most frequently it is there, to its  white stones, that the uranium trail extends. Where does it come  from? From everywhere where there are defense "P.O. Box  enterprises." And they are everywhere: Siberia, the Urals,  Central Russia...but the Urals still take first prize in this  matter. They are a real Klondike for "nuclear" thieves.    From existing data it is possible to compile a portrait of  businessmen of this breed. Judging from the practice and thefts  of radioactive substances, they work, as a rule, in groups, and  not alone (people working alone are caught more easily). The  group usually includes (along with "proletarians") middle-level  technical managers and also some representatives of the  leadership of the enterprise--in case they have to provide a  cover at a dangerous moment or simply "not notice." Or put their  signature on a document for writing materials off. Then the  courier takes the commodity in a capsule to the capital, where  the buyer is given the opportunity to take 1 gram of the  substance for analysis. If the commodity meets his  "standard"--the transaction is completed according to the  classical formula of "commodity-dollars." One well-informed  person told a correspondent that if the buyer thinks of  violating the gentleman's agreement, he is punished by death.  This person even confirmed that the ones trapped by the militia,  as a rule, are "people working on their own or terrible  dilettantes."    Reality convinces us that what he said is true. A department  chief of the Economic Crimes Administration of the Moscow City  Internal Affairs Administration, Boris Blontsev, told about one  such case. In a closed compound in Chelyabinsk Oblast 4.5 kg of  a substance containing uranium-235 was stolen from a defense  enterprise. The thief managed to successfully cover his tracks  and soon he was on his way to Moscow with his mysterious parcel.  The lone thief had no idea of whom to offer his parcel to or how  many thousands of dollars to ask for it. Ultimately he ended up  in a meeting with a buyer who turned out to be...a militia  worker. Workers of law enforcement organs think that the single  person from Chelyabinsk had practically no chance of succeeding.  <H5>  Seize the Moment! </H5>   While preparing this article I had occasion several times to  see various consultants. All of them agreed with the opinion  that a dangerous time had come and it is becoming advantageous  and almost safe to engage in trade in semimanufactured nuclear  products.    Quite recently a tonne of titanium could be purchased in  Russia for 350 rubles [R] and then shipped abroad, where one  could obtain $7,500 for it and buy household electronic  equipment there, and then take it home and sell it for a  fantastic profit. More than one Russian has become a billionaire  from such speculations...prices of rare metals in Russia are now  approaching world prices, and buying and selling them can  produce a solid income, especially if they are shipped  contraband, that is, if you do not pay for licenses, quotas, etc.    Not long ago investigators from Moscow confiscated seven  ampules of cesium--a total of 1,550 g. When they brought it to  an academician for consultation he was amazed: Never before in  his life had he seen all at once seven ampules of cesium, 1 kg  of which costs $50,000. Half joking, the academician said that:  "He had an atomic bomb lying on his desk at that time." In  certain circumstances, cesium can be extremely explosive.    Specialists from law enforcement organs think that there is  another, possibly the strongest, precondition for smart "nuclear  dealers," and one might call this precondition this: state  feebleness.    Until recently any accident involving radioactive substances  came mainly under the purview of the KGB. This information was  systematized, analyzed, and immediately sent up to the very top.  KGB people played first fiddle in all kinds of "P.O. Box  enterprises."    A couple of days ago I phoned the corresponding service of  the former Ministry of Security and asked for information on the  countries to which stolen radioactive substances go from Russia.  A day later the official representative reported: The Department  has no information on this subject. That is, it does not know.  One can perhaps believe this answer too: The Department has not  had time for this recently.    I received a similar answer from the Russian customs  service:  "It seems that there are such cases, but they are individual and  are no big deal." Most likely this answer can be accepted as  well. But when you recall the endless Russian borders which are  now called penetrable...the customs service is up to its neck in  work and there is simply no possibility of keeping track of many  regions.    In circles close to the government one most frequently  encounters this position: "The problem of the sale of stolen  semimanufactured products for an atomic bomb abroad is  fabricated, we know nothing about this." And could it be that  the militiamen who encountered criminals of this kind were  really just exaggerating because they were afraid? And who would  let it enter their mind to risk their health in this way even  for dollars?    According to information from the Ministry of Justice of  Russia, articles concerning the theft and attempts to sell  radioactive materials were introduced into the Criminal Code  back in 1988. But during 1988 and 1989 not one person in Russia  was convicted under these articles. In 1990 one was convicted.  Then for two years in a row there was silence, and in the first  half of 1993--there were 12 individuals. We have no figures for  the second half of the year yet.    We managed to obtain this information from unofficial but  reliable sources: When investigating criminal cases involving  the theft of radioactive substances they manage to arrest only  every tenth criminal. And this certainly does not mean that his  case is necessarily taken to court. As a rule, they use a  multitude of intermediaries and also couriers to transport the  material--people who have no idea of the content of their cargo.  But even if a person is caught red-handed, his first words will  usually be: "I found it." Or: "I bought it from somebody I did  not know." Just try to find where it all ends.    Information from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia:  During 11 months of last year 8,793 crimes involving all kinds  of strategic raw material (including radioactive substances)  were committed in the country. In spite of the numerous official  appeals from law enforcement organs to the government for help  and the various committees and other levels of authority, no  reaction followed. Which in translation can mean: "Catch them  yourselves!"  <H5>  A Bomb for... </H5>   And now the main question: Where does the river of uranium  flow from Russia? For now we know for certain that our  compatriots do not intend to make and keep a private atom bomb.  But is the final destination of these exports Europe?    From the majority of my consultants who had at least in some  way been involved with the problem of uranium and similar  substances I most frequently heard this address: the Near East.    According to certain information, emissaries are sent to  Russia, forming the demand and prices on our uranium black  market. They say that unofficial Iraq has long shown an interest  in goods of this kind. Evil tongues even assert that there are  chunks from the Urals in the atom bomb that they are now  assembling. But officials so far do not want to either confirm  or deny these assumptions.    Paradoxical as it may be, a circumstance that significantly  complicates the fight against theft of radioactive raw material  is the coincidence of the interests of the "uranium" criminals  and those who...are responsible for the safety of our  radioactive reserves: Both are interested in remaining silent.  Neither one side nor the other wishes to risk their own necks.  Not until a critical mass has accumulated.</p>

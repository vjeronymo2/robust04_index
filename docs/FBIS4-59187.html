			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Talks by Keeping Nation in Darkness] </F>   [Text] The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and the missile  program are very sensitive issues for India. That is why the  so-called secret talks with the United States in London were  enough to provoke the parliament. The provocation was logical  in the sense that it was borne out of the deep national pride.  Of course, secret talks have significance in diplomacy, but on  these two issues a prudent Indian society demands absolute  openness and full clarification. It is logical to ask as to  when the parliament is in session, why it was not taken into  confidence on such an important issue. When a newspaper one day  suddenly revealed that the government has stopped the  development program of `Agni' missile, the government springs  into action and Prime Minister Narasimha Rao makes a statement  in the parliament that this has not been done under anybody's  pressure and the program is suspended only temporarily, but the  answer, perhaps, satisfied no one. The same is true for the  government's explanation of the secret talks. We do not  consider the United States a villain, but it is neither a  trustworthy friend or well-wisher of India. On the U.S.  direction Russia banned the sale of cryogenic engine technique  to India that has affected our missile development program.  When Pakistan has received Chinese M-11 missiles and the U.S.  F-16 fighter aircraft -- additional consignments are also being  planned, stopping the missile program by any logic would be  national suicide. Even though, this was the fourth round of  secret talks with the United States and the subject of talks was  the world disarmament, what was the reason for masking them in  secrecy? And, why were the talks held in a third country? If  the U.S. delegation had problems coming to New Delhi, the Indian  delegation could have gone to the United States. Many other  questions remain unanswered. The delegation members included  those whose views generally favor India's signing of the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty. What does this fact indicate?  Definitely there is something fishy about all this. Then  again, the London talks took place in the background of the  scheduled Rao-Clinton summit.    There should be no doubt whatsoever that the United States  wants total elimination of strategic weapons in South Asia.  While U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Talbott is luring Pakistan  into capping its nuclear program by promising F-16's, Washington  has trapped India into multilateral or five plus two plus two  [the five members of the UN Security Council, Japan, Germany,  India and Pakistan] talks. Our participation in these talks  will mean that we are approving the U.S. policies in South Asia.  The government says that the talks have been held with the  United States since 1992 for multilateral negotiations on  disarmament. Okay, but why is India so eager for such  multilateral talks? It is the government's duty to tell the  parliament what has been discussed so far with the United  States. It should also reiterate the commitment that no  agreement will be reached on India's security and strategic  interest that is not fully acceptable to the Indian people.</p>

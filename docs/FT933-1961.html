			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Telecoms firm Telecom issues held up, with BT adding 4 1/2 at 425 1/2 p as a UK analyst pointed out the yield attractions, and Vodafone gaining 8 1/2 at 503p on US support. In BT, Hoare Govett's telecoms specialist noted the benefits of the company's yield, arguing that it was attractive to income funds as it would be paid in cash rather than as an increased scrip. Also, against the current low interest rate climate the company offers a yield of 9.4 per cent on the partly paid shares and 5 per cent on the fully paid. BT shares were further helped by reports in the weekend press of a huge relocation from central London which would lead to massive salary savings. Meanwhile, Vodafone was recommended by New York trading house Cowen &amp; Co, which raised its near-term rating on the group to outperform from neutral ahead of an important presentation tomorrow. Analysts said there was a possibility that the group could announce changes to its peak-time urban charge to hit back at Mercury's new One-2-One service. Finally, Shaw &amp; Co, the private client broker, recommended switching funds into Vodafone from Cable and Wireless, which suffered initial weakness before ending a net 5 up at 838p.</p>

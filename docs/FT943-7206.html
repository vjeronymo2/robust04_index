			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Monetary policies key to Brussels revival - The bourse has outperformed this year, especially in dollar terms August may be a sleepy month in Belgium but the Brussels stock exchange, at least, had laurels to rest on after a late July and early August rally which surprised observers, coming immediately after a 1994 market low on July 13. Buoyed up by much better than expected half-year results from some of Belgium's biggest blue-chip companies, the Bel-20 weighted index of the 20 largest stocks rose 6.6 per cent to 1,485.54 in a little under four weeks to August 8, against the high of 1,542.65 it reached early in February. 'In those few weeks we saw a clear rally in industrial company stock after a very bad June,' said Mr Michel Ernst, investment research manager at Dewaay, the Brussels-based brokers. Belgium has outperformed other continental European stock markets since the beginning of the year, especially if the strength of its currency is taken into account. Measured by the FT-Actuaries World Indices, Brussels had risen by 8.1 per cent in terms of the weakening dollar by last Friday, against a 2.6 per cent gain for Europe as a whole. The country's relatively better showing can be explained partly by a succession of small but steady cuts in short term interest rates since January. Having taken longer to act last year than some of its neighbours, the central bank changed its pace at the start of the year, contributing to a climate of good sentiment through some 25 small rate cuts. Also helping to keep the market steady has been the absence of new issues, unlike the situation in France, for example, where the privatisation programme produced a good deal of new paper. 'In Belgium there has been virtually nothing,' said one London-based broker. 'There has been no new paper around for people to buy.' Further, macroeconomic news has been more promising than last year, when the economy remained locked in recession. In its recent budget statement the government was confident that it would not have to raise taxes or cut spending in order to meet next year's budget deficit target of 4.3 per cent of gross domestic product, thanks to higher than expected growth. Although the government's comments helped stem some of the worst fears about Belgium's huge deficit problems, certain analysts are sceptical about the official growth forecasts. 'The government has based its forecast on a pick-up in consumption in 1994, as people reduce their savings. We don't think that will happen. So far there have been no signs of any real improvement in domestic consumption,' said Mr Ernst. The pleasant surprises that prompted the recent rally came from the interim results of Belgium's big petrochemicals and pharmaceuticals companies, Solvay, UCB, and Petrofina. Petrofina, the biggest of Belgium's energy groups, announced that recovery in petrochemical activities and gains from asset sales helped lift interim profits to BFr5.2bn in the first half of the year compared with BFr3.8bn a year ago. This came after similarly encouraging results from Solvay and UCB. Thanks to the results from the blue chips, the outlook is good. Brokers have been urging clients to buy industrial stocks, with expectations high for more good results from the banks and distribution companies next month. 'We must wait until September in order to confirm the good results we have already seen,' said Mr Ernst. 'This could be the signal for the stock exchange to go into an upward trend.' One potentially unsettling event on the horizon is October's communal elections. Analysts are unsure whether, like the European elections, these will be used as an opportunity to pass judgement on the federal government. 'I don't think they will be seen as a national test. The issues involved are different,' said Mr Vanbol. 'There will be some nervousness but no great upheaval.'</p>

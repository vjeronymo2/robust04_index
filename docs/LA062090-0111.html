			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> RANCHO SANTIAGO PICKS NEW ARTS DEAN  </P> <P> A theater arts director has been chosen as Rancho Santiago Community College  District's new dean of fine arts and performing arts.  </P> <P> Thom B. Hill was named by the district's Board of Trustees at their meeting  last Wednesday.  </P> <P> Hill currently is dean of administrative and cultural services at Citrus  College in Glendora.  </P> <P> "Thom brings to this position a wealth of experience as an arts administrator,"  said Carter Doran, Rancho Santiago's vice chancellor of academic affairs. "He  combines the best of both worlds for RSC: strong fiscal management skills and  an equally strong background in the creative processes of artistic instruction  and production."  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago's Fine and Performing Arts division includes the fields of art,  theater, dance, music, photography, speech communications, telecommunications  and journalism. Hill will be responsible for curriculum planning and liaison  with local arts organizations and the arts community, district officials said.  </P> <P> Hill, 43, whose annual salary will be $70,956, said his first priority would be  to decide with the faculty in each field how their program should develop over  the next decade.  </P> <P> Hill has a master's degree in fine arts from Wayne State University in Detroit,  and a bachelor's degree in fine arts from the University of South Dakota. He  was executive director of the Western Alliance of Arts Administrators from 1983  to 1988, and directed performing arts programs at Citrus College from 1974 to  1988. He has served as a guest artist and director with the South Dakota  college's Black Hills Playhouse.  </P></p>

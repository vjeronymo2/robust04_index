			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Uphill struggle before fortunes reversed - The problems at Ford of Britain despite a cut in losses Correction (Published 29th May 1993) appended to this article. FORD OF Britain buckled again last year under the heavy pressure of the recession and the attack of its main rivals on its traditional UK market leadership. The pre-tax loss of Pounds 353m for the 1992 year followed losses of Pounds 935m in 1991 and Pounds 274m in 1990, both of which were exaggerated by the inclusion of Jaguar, the heavily loss-making luxury car operations. Even without Jaguar, which was acquired in late 1989 and transferred to the Ford US parent company in November 1991, the decline in Ford of Britain's core operations has been precipitous. Excluding Jaguar left 1991's loss at Pounds 487m and profits of Pounds 61m in 1990. In 1989 profits had been Pounds 483m after a record profit of Pounds 603m in 1988. The operating loss last year, including financial services, totalled Pounds 201m, after restructuring costs of Pounds 68m relating to the automotive side, against Pounds 313m, excluding Jaguar. Financial services operating profit was Pounds 36m, compared with Pounds 24m. The harsh grinding of gears at Ford has contrasted sharply with the resurgent fortunes in Britain of its arch US rival, General Motors. Vauxhall, GM's UK subsidiary, more than doubled operating profits last year from Pounds 128m to a record Pounds 269m, while pre-tax profits rose by 69 per cent to Pounds 224m (Pounds 133m). It achieved record production at its two assembly plants with rising exports and a record share of the UK new car market. The Vauxhall workforce has remained almost unchanged at about 11,000 in the last five years, while vehicle output has jumped from 206,000 in 1988 to 302,000 last year. By contrast Ford, the UK operations of which are far more extensive than GM's, has been caught up in a turmoil of recession and restructuring. It has been apparently unable, until recent months, to cope with the magnitude of the whirlwind which has engulfed it. UK demand for new cars has fallen sharply during the recession. Ford's performance has been further undermined by a continuing erosion of its share of this contracting market. While the overall UK new car market has fallen by 31 per cent since 1989, Ford's share has fallen from 26.5 per cent to 22.2 per cent. Its share peaked at 30.9 per cent in 1981. Ford new car registrations have fallen by 42 per cent since 1989, from 608,617 to 353,339 last year, with an 8.4 per cent decline last year in a market that was almost unchanged at 1.59m. More importantly, it has suffered a collapse in its net margins during the recession under the impact of very heavy marketing costs in the form of discounts and other financial incentives to try to support its sagging sales. Marketing costs, which jumped to a horrendous 24 per cent of revenues in 1991 from 14 per cent in 1990, were still above 20 per cent in 1992. 'If we had been able to sell vehicles at regular prices as we have done historically we would have been in much better shape. These are the lowest net margins we have experienced in history,' said Mr Bill Brooks, finance director. Exchange rate losses of Pounds 100m added severely to the company's problems last year, said Mr Brooks, with the growing weakness of sterling in 1992 adding to the already high costs of imported vehicles and components from continental Europe. Ford of Britain's trade balance has been in deficit since 1981. Last year's losses were compounded by assembly plants being forced to work at only 62 per cent of capacity. In response to lower-than-expected sales and in order to reduce excessive stocks the company was forced repeatedly last year to resort to short-time working. It cut a total of 214 shifts at its three assembly plants at Dagenham (Fiesta), Halewood (Escort/Orion) and Southampton (Transit vans). The Southampton plant stood idle for about nine weeks, with the loss of 89 shifts, while the Dagenham plant in Essex was forced to halt assembly for 5 1/2 weeks (56 shifts) and the Halewood plant on Merseyside being idle for seven weeks (69 shifts). Car production fell by 11 per cent to 302,784 (339,182), while commercial vehicle output rose by 28 per cent to 144,291, leaving total vehicle production static at 447,075 (451,996). Ford finally took drastic action to reduce its manned capacity in November last year as part of a dramatic restructuring of the whole of the loss-making Ford of Europe operations. The workforce of the core Ford of Britain activities, excluding Jaguar and the former Ford New Holland tractor operations which were both disposed of in 1991, was cut last year by 5,000 to 35,300 at the end of 1992. It has fallen further in the early months of this year. Expenditure on research and development in the UK was virtually unchanged last year at Pounds 239m (Pounds 236m). But its capital expenditure has fallen sharply from a peak of Pounds 669m in 1990, when it was investing for the new generation Escort/Orion at Halewood, to Pounds 386m in 1991 and Pounds 241m in 1992. However, there were still some bright spots in the gloom last year. Since last September's devaluation of sterling total unit production costs have been lower at Ford's UK plants than in Germany, said Mr Brooks, although production of the Fiesta small car was still cheaper in Spain. According to Mr Ian McAllister, Ford of Britain chairman, significant improvements in productivity were achieved in 1992 led by a 23 per cent productivity gain at Dagenham. The improvement has narrowed the previously yawning performance gap between Dagenham and Cologne, Germany in the assembly of the Fiesta. In 1988 Ford required almost twice the number of hours to build a Fiesta in Dagenham compared with Cologne. The gap was closed to only 27 per cent more in 1992, said Mr Brooks, and had narrowed further this year. The improvements at the UK plants had stemmed from 'changed working practices, a focus on core activities, the extension of integrated manufacturing teams, and the implementation of progressive agreements with trade unions,' said Mr McAllister. Ford has finally taken drastic actions to staunch its losses in the UK, but with its rivals, including the newly-arrived Japanese producers, still eating into its market share, it faces an uphill struggle to regain the record profits of the 1980s. CORRECTION Ford of Britain's UK vehicle assembly plants worked at 77 per cent of capacity in 1992, not at 62 per cent as the company incorrectly stated on Thursday.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian  at 1800 GMT on 17 May carries a three-minute report on a news  conference given by Russian Economy Minister Aleksandr Shokhin.    The correspondent says that Russia has declined an  invitation  to take part in a meeting of the Paris Club of the country's  creditors on 2-3 June. The correspondent reports that at a news  conference on 17 May, Shokhin said that he considered the recent  granting of credit by the IMF as sufficient reason for  concluding a new agreement with the Paris Club. In a recording,  Shokhin says that two weeks would not be sufficient time to work  out repayment proposals based on Russia's budget.    Shokhin says: "It is necessary to hold preliminary  consultations with the members of the Paris Club so that the  meeting, itself, should produce results. We do not yet have the  basic concept for restructuring the 1994 payments and we are  simply physically unable to draw up this concept by 2-3 June.  And for this reason we have asked for the meeting to be held in  mid-June."    Shokhin concludes by saying that the important thing is for  a  realistic repayment figure to be reached.</p>

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Frogmore jumps 74% to Pounds 7.3m in first half Frogmore Estates, the property investment company, announced a 74 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.17m to Pounds 7.26m for the six months to December, aided by increased rental income from acquisitions. The company has built up its portfolio and has invested more than Pounds 70m on properties since June 1993, when it announced a Pounds 42m rights issue. Some Pounds 45m of this has been invested in trading properties, the directors stated. Activity has also picked up in Frogmore's joint venture housebuilding business, which is expected to sell 700 units in the current year, compared with 443 last time. Turnover increased by 34 per cent from Pounds 22.2m to Pounds 29.7m while operating profits rose 51 per cent to Pounds 9.62m (Pounds 6.35m). The 1992 figure was held back by a Pounds 1.53m charge, related to litigation. Without this distortion, operating profits would have risen 22 per cent, directors pointed out. The interim dividend is 3.8p, compared with 3.6p. Earnings per share were 13.4p (6.7p), helped by a reduced tax charge from the release of earlier provisions. Borrowings were Pounds 74.3m at December 31, representing gearing of 37 per cent. Debt servicing cost Pounds 2.74m for the half year, compared with an annual rent role that has grown to Pounds 24.4m.</p>

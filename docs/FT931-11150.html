			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Salinas signals tougher stance PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas of Mexico has removed one of his new appointees in a move seen as consolidating a harder government line towards negotiations with opposition parties. Ms Beatriz Paredes, former number two in the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI), has been ousted as Interior Ministry under-secretary and made ambassador to Cuba. The government described the change, just 17 days after installing a new team at Interior, as a progressive step. An official said the president was responding to criticism that there 'was excessive PRI presence in the Interior Ministry'. However, analysts saw the abrupt shift as further evidence of a hardening of the ministry's line against negotiation with opposition parties. 'Beatriz Paredes was viewed as a progressive force in the ministry. Her removal shows there is unlikely to be conciliation this year or next,' said one commentator.</p>

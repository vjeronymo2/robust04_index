			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITICISM OF ARMAND HAMMER'S MUSEUM  </P> <P> While Armand Hammer's "museum grows in Westwood," hordes of mentally ill,  hungry and homeless humans are growing as well. You will pardon me if I do not  cry "Hallelujah!" at Mr. Hammer's gift to humanity and himself.  </P> <P> If he wants to "build a permanent reminder of his accomplishments" let him  build schools, hospitals and housing for the destitute instead of spending  millions on a memorial for himself.  </P> <P> SHIRLEY WOLF  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

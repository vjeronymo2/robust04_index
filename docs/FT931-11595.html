			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Business and the Law: Out-of-court settlement - Industry is still paying a heavy price for ignoring a fast, cheap alternative to litigation The American writer Ambrose Bierce defined litigation in his Devil's Dictionary as 'a machine which you go into as a pig and come out of as a sausage'. He could have added that you must also pay for the privilege. Court-based justice is slow and expensive and for every winner produces a loser. The cost of a two-year commercial dispute culminating in a one- or two-month trial can run into millions of pounds. Yet during the UK's deepest recession in 60 years, when businesses ought to be doing all they can to cut variable costs, they are spending more and more on fighting costly battles in the courts. The Centre for Interfirm Comparison, an independent research group, says that on average London law firms reported a 25 per cent growth in litigation in 1992. That came on top of an average 43 per cent rise in litigation in 1991. There has been some progress in the search for cheaper and fairer methods of handling commercial disputes in the UK over the past two years. But industry has been slow to embrace the concept of alternative dispute resolution (ADR)  -which in the UK mainly takes the form of mediation - despite Confederation of British Industry (CBI) backing. In November 1990 the CBI supported the launch of the Centre for Dispute Resolution. CEDR is a non-profit making organisation, backed by industry and professional advisers, dedicated to reaching better commercial solutions to domestic and international business disputes. Founder members included BAT, Ford (Europe), Grand Metropolitan, ICI, Smiths Industries and Trafalgar House Construction, plus a dozen of the UK's leading law firms and four of the big accountancy firms. Six months later membership of CEDR had passed 100. New recruits included RTZ, Legal &amp; General, Midland Bank, BOC Group, Prudential, John Laing, John Mowlem Construction, British Telecom and Black &amp; Decker. Today membership totals more than 250 with almost 50 per cent drawn from commerce and industry. Many companies have actively promoted ADR. CEDR has established links with a growing number of UK and international ADR organisations and is to supplement the work of the London Court of International Arbitration. The Law Society, the Bar and the Lord Chancellor's Department have all expressed support for ADR as a concept. In its first two years 230 cases, involving more than Pounds 800m, were referred to CEDR, of which about 25 per cent went on to complete formal ADR processes. CEDR estimates that more than Pounds 30m in potential legal costs have been saved and substantially more if management time is included. So, with CBI-backed industry support, goodwill from the professions and at least the beginnings of a sound record, why has ADR failed to take off in the UK? Dr Karl Mackie, CEDR's director, says: 'The low level of experience of lawyers and clients with the process is still an obstacle and the traditional adversarial mindset and culture of lawyers and clients in litigation a positive barrier.' But old habits dying hard is not a complete answer. While lawyers' interests are unlikely to make them the first to suggest it, Dr Mackie concedes that CEDR has made 'considerable headway' in recent months in persuading lawyers to take ADR more seriously. The real problem is in industry, where there is lack of awareness of ADR and what it has to offer, edged with a large dose of scepticism. In America the success of ADR techniques came from publicity surrounding the successful resolution of business disputes involving well-known companies. Examples include the four-year IBM/Fujitsu computer software copyright dispute, Borden's Dollars 200m trust action against Texaco and American Can's Dollars 41m action for breach of contract against Wisconsin Electrical Power. In the UK no company which has been through ADR has yet been prepared to talk about the experience in any detail. Industry has had to judge the process from brief second-hand accounts of anonymous disputes provided by CEDR. All that may be about to change, however. Although not a household name, one of the two companies involved in the largest dispute handled by CEDR so far has allowed its lawyers, Warner Cranston, to talk about the resolution by mediation of its Pounds 27m claim against a product design consultancy. The company, Autocar Equipment, an automotive equipment manufacturer and distributor, agreed with an American to manufacture and market in the UK a steriliser he had invented and patented for the dental industry. Successful UK marketing required several design changes. Autocar approached a London product design consultancy and subsequently accepted its quote for cost and time. The design changes took a lot longer and cost a lot more than anticipated. Autocar felt it had lost market opportunities. Eventually the American exercised his right to terminate the agreement with Autocar under US law and Autocar decided to sue the design consultancy for negligence and breach of contract and lost profits. Mr John Wright, the Warner Cranston partner handling the case for Autocar, said initially they went down the traditional route. A writ claiming Pounds 27m was issued in April 1989 and a split-trial was agreed - the first trial, expected to last eight weeks, to determine liability, the second to determine damages. Traditional negotiations failed to produce a settlement but did narrow the issues. Eventually, four months before the date for the first trial, the design consultancy suggested one final attempt should be made to settle the dispute by mediation. Autocar agreed and together they approached CEDR. Two mediators, Mr Michael Burton QC and Dr Karl Mackie, were nominated and a date fixed for the hearing. The mediation took a day. It began with a short opening summary of each side's case in open session followed by a series of private caucuses, or open and frank discussions, between the mediators and each side in turn about their respective cases. The case was eventually settled late in the afternoon for less than Pounds 1m, but only after the defendants had increased their original offer by more than 70 per cent. Both sides appeared satisfied with the outcome. 'In a way,' says Mr Wright, 'they had had their day in court.' The total cost of the mediation was less than Pounds 20,000 for both parties. Avoiding two trials lasting as much as four months overall saved somewhere between Pounds 1m and Pounds 1.5m for each side, he says. Even if mediation fails all that has been lost is the cost of a day's mediation, he adds. For it to work, however, both sides must be willing participants and they must have top managers there who are capable of taking decisions on the spot because the function of mediation is to persuade each side to move away from their entrenched positions. ADR provides a cost-effective, simple and quick alternative to litigation. It will not always work and it will not be suitable in all cases. But as the Autocar case illustrates the potential savings are enormous. Business continues to ignore ADR at its cost.</p>

			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'BENNETT THE DRUG CZAR'  </P> <P> In the midst of the debate over a picking a secretary of defense, a dangerous  Bush nominee may be confirmed unchallenged. Drug czar-designate Bennett has  admitted a willingness, almost a longing, to sacrifice the Bill of Rights in  his war on drugs.  </P> <P> While I halfway expected such a fascist reaction from ex-Education Secretary  Bennett, I was shocked and saddened by the lack of protest against him. Surely  a madcap disregard for civil liberties is as frightening as a drunk defense  secretary would have been.  </P> <P> If Bennett's views become Administration policy, police would no longer have to  exhibit probable cause. They would not need warrants to search and seize  anything which could contain drugs, including urine.  </P> <P> If Bennett truly wants a drug-free America, why doesn't he turn his attentions  toward the causes of abuse and addiction -- an almost palpable despair in our  cities and among our poor. Drugs provide both an emotional and financial  escape. In any other field Republicans would probably congratulate them on  their capitalistic gumption.  </P> <P> The need for escape would become even greater with Bennett as drug czar. It's  enough to make one a Bolshevik.  </P> <P> PARK BUCKER  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

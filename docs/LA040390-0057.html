			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL;  </P> <P> PAI'S TEAMMATES COME BACK TO WIN  </P> <P> In its first game since the sudden death of teammate Ben Pai Thursday night,  Oceanside overwhelmed visiting El Camino, 9-2, in a make up Avocado League  baseball game Monday at Oceanside. The scheduled game against El Camino was  rained out Wednesday.  </P> <P> Oceanside players wore patches on their uniforms in honor of Pai, 17, who died  of acute bronchial asthma after having an asthma attack after playing a  recreational basketball game at the Oceanside Boys &amp; Girls Club Thursday.  He was having difficulty breathing as he was rushed to the Tri-City Medical  Center, where he arrived at 9:40 p.m. He was pronounced dead at 10:19 p.m.  </P> <P> It was the Pirates first game in 10 days.  </P> <P> "It's great to be back playing ball," Coach Dave Barrett said. "They were  pressing a little too much at first, but then they settled down."  </P> <P> The Pirates' eight-run fourth inning opened up the game, with Oceanside's Terry  Vaughn getting two hits and El Camino committing four of its five errors.  </P> <P> Andrew Acevedo (2-1-1) went the distance and struck out 11 for Oceanside  (7-2-1, 1-0). Teammate Saul Gutierrez was two for three. Ricky Spears hit a  solo home run in the fifth for El Camino (7-4, 1-1).  </P> <P> Pai, a senior, was a starting pitcher with a 2-0 record and a 0.27 ERA.  </P> <P> "He was a part of us, and he still is part of us, just in a different way,"  said Barrett. "We don't want to put pressure on ourselves, we just want to put  forth our best effort. The kids are really plugged into that."  </P> <P> Barrett said team members decided to play Monday after meeting with Pai's  parents, Benjamin Sr. and Edith Gail Pai, over the weekend. Both parents  attended Monday's game.  </P> <P> "They wanted us to play," Barrett said.  </P> <P> In other Avocado League games:  </P> <P> San Marcos 18, Ramona 7 -- San Marcos collected eight of its 15 hits and 12 of  its 18 runs in the second inning, the same inning Ramona made two errors and  walked three batters.

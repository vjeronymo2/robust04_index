			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Switzerland (13): The prospect of a Swatch car - After the rescue of the watchmaking industry, there are more ambitious plans ON APRIL 1, the French language daily, Le Nouveau Quotidien, published an interview with Mr Nicolas Hayek, boss of SMH, the watchmaking company best known for the Swatch plastic watch. Referring to the current political row over the Swiss government's intended purchase of 34 US fighter planes, Mr Hayek said Switzerland should develop its own aeroplanes. Aircraft design needed rethinking to produce a high-performance, low cost, environmentally friendly machine. Of course, the 'Swatch fighter' was a spoof. But Mr Hayek's real-life project to build a Swatch car has met much the same kind of amused disbelief. In proving the scoffers wrong, he hopes to demonstrate a personal conviction that Europe, even high-cost Switzerland, need not surrender its manufacturing base to the Far East. This conviction underpinned Mr Hayek's rescue plan for the Swiss watchmaking industry in the early 1980s when it was in danger of obliteration by Japanese competition. An engineering consultant who had already built up a successful business, Hayek Engineering, Mr Hayek was brought in by the banks to guide the troubled merger of SSIH and Asuag, the two biggest watchmakers, to form SMH (Societe Suisse de Microelectronique et d'Horlogerie) in 1984. Rejecting the conventional wisdom that Switzerland should retreat to the luxury end of the watch market, he argued that a thriving industry needed the mass market to provide the impulsion for cost control, technological development and marketing. The Swatch, which first appeared in 1982, was to spearhead recapture of this market from the Japanese. Greeted sceptically at the time, the Swatch has become a classic success story. Last month, the 100 millionth Swatch came off the production line - making it the biggest selling watch in history. Early Swatches are collectors' items, fetching thousands of dollars at auction and contemporary Swatch variants like the chronograph are the object of a flourishing black market trade. Stylish, constantly changing designs, a careful distribution policy and clever marketing have kept the Swatch boom going. But at its heart rests the original Swatch innovation - a big cut in the number of watch parts and a way of assembling them in one operation, allowing fully automated production for the first time. Today, the basic Swatch still sells for its original price of SFr50. Sales of Swatches, which are all produced in Switzerland, topped 17m in 1991. SMH plans output of 25-30m this year, doubling to 50m within five years, including variants such as the Pop Swatch, chronograph and the Scuba diving watch. A Swatch automatic, with a self-winding mechanism, will be launched later in 1992. Swatch accounts for something over half SMH's finished watch output of 30m last year and about a quarter of its SFr2.37bn sales. But production and marketing skills honed on the Swatch have helped to revitalise SMH's higher-priced watch brands, such as Omega, Longines, Rado and Tissot. SMH is now a world leader in luxury watches, which are estimated to contribute over half its profits, though analysts think it may be losing money in the highly competitive medium-priced market. The company has also pursued an ambitious strategy of vertical integration, manufacturing its own components including state-of-the-art microchips and batteries. These, and some 50m watch movements produced by SMH last year, are sold for assembly by other manufacturers in Switzerland and elsewhere. Within a decade, SMH has become the world's most profitable watch company, according to James Capel, the London stockbrokers, and sales by value are poised to overtake Seiko of Japan within five years. Profits have risen steadily, jumping by a third last year to SFr252m, and in 1992 the company is expected to have cash in hand after repayment of debt. Taking watches and movements together, SMH accounts for some three-quarters of total Swiss production (about 13 per cent of the world total) and about a third of Swiss sales. The rest is accounted for by mainly top-of-the-range watchmakers such as Rolex and Patek Philippe, whose dominance in the luxury market gives Switzerland over half the total world watch sales by value. Mr Hayek, who with a group of investors, bought out the banks' controlling shareholding in 1985, says SMH is and will remain primarily a watch company. But he believes other, more dynamic markets are ripe for the Swatch formula of technological innovation combined with skilful design at a competitive price, that can capitalise on the company's experience with micro-electronic and micro-mechanical devices. About 5 per cent of SMH's sales are currently outside the watch sector, mostly accounted for by the Swatch twinphone (a dual handset model) in the US and Europe. However, initial problems with telephone type approval, marketing and distribution have now persuaded SMH to opt for tie-ups with established telecommunications companies. Mr Hayek plans to announce in June a deal with a major telecommunications manufacturer to produce the twinphone and the cordless, cellular and fax telephones SMH already has on the stocks. SMH hopes to produce 1m twinphones this year - assembled in south-east Asia - and in March launched the Swatchpager, a paging watch, in the US in partnership with BellSouth. More ambitiously still, SMH and Volkswagen, the German car maker, last year set up a joint venture to develop, manufacture and distribute the Swatchmobile, an ecological car intended to exploit the huge potential market for non-polluting vehicles, especially in the US. The rewards could be enormous for a car with the right price-performance combination, which has so far eluded the big car makers. A Swatchmobile prototype is already under test, and the two companies are hoping to start production in 1994 for launch in 1995. The details are a closely guarded secret but the car will have an electric or hybrid petrol-electric motor and, Mr Hayek claims, the performance and safety features of a normal petrol-driven model. Though the project seems fanciful, SMH is not taking too big a risk. VW is thought likely to put up most of the funds needed for the manufacturing operation, with SMH taking a royalty fee on sales and perhaps an equity stake. The companies, which are sharing development costs of around Dollars 20m, are planning production of 100,000 cars a year if the launch goes well. Analysts concede that Mr Hayek's track record makes it difficult to dismiss the idea out of hand. 'If VW and SMH can bring a car to market that is cheap, clean, handy and comfortable, it could be a nice surprise,' says Mr Roland Leutenegger of Bank Julius Baer in Zurich.</p>

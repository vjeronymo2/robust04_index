			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Injuries scheme attacked The government yesterday rejected calls for changes to the criminal injuries compensation scheme, in spite of Labour's warnings that thousands of victims would be worse off because of it. Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said about a quarter of victims would 'lose substantially', and those who were losing out would often be the worst injured. During the report stage debate of the criminal justice and public order bill, Mr Blair said: 'There is nothing that (more) completely exposes the hollowness of government claims on law and order than the scrapping of the existing system of criminal injuries compensation.' The government is refusing to rethink the proposed changes, which would replace individual assessments with a fixed tariff. The reforms have been criticised in the Lords, where peers said they could be unconstitutional and open to judicial review. However, Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, is understood to have taken legal advice which supports the government view that the changes can be implemented. Mr Blair said the present scheme would be replaced by one 'based on a crude tariff, which will ignore the individual circumstances of the victim'. The existing system, introduced in 1964, compensated victims of violence on roughly the same basis as civil law and took into account future loss of earnings. Mr Blair urged withdrawal of the new system until the government established a better scheme, 'properly consulted upon, properly worked out, that protects the interests of the victim in the way the British public wishes to see'. Mr Robert Maclennan, for the Liberal Democrats, accused Mr Howard of acting 'high-handedly and possibly illegally'.</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Industry must play part in technology programme Sir, I welcome Paul Ruskin's letter about the 'technology foresight programme' (September 20). We all agree that the UK - including both private and public sector funders of research and development - should benefit from a clear vision of priorities. I agree with much of Mr Ruskin's general argument. Decisions need to be taken by industry on where the UK ought to try to be a world leader, where it might do better to collaborate, and where it would do better to buy in technology. The government's white paper on science, engineering and technology, Realising our Potential, sets out how a new working partnership should be developed between scientists and industrialists to assess the significance of emerging technological trends and market opportunities. Key factors in considering priorities will no doubt need to be whether there are strong market signals that a technology can improve our competitiveness; whether UK companies can, realistically, hope to capture markets which depend on the particular technology; and whether our science, engineering and technology base is judged capable of achieving world leadership, or parity, in the technology. I have initiated a series of consultative seminars on the best way to organise a 'technology foresight programme'. It is essential that industry and other users of research are fully involved and in the driving seat in this exciting new exercise, particularly to ensure that it is sufficiently responsive to market pull and not just technology push. We will then need to weigh up the objective evidence in the light of the consultation process, assess expert views as widely as possible, and come to robust conclusions. I look forward to those conclusions and expect that they will provide the UK with a clearer grasp of strategic priorities than we currently have.

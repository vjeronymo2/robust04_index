			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (22): 'Too busy for fun' - Problems of the new rich ROWS OF smart Mercedes cars gleam through the display window in a shop on Warsaw's main Krakowskie Przedmiescie street, which once sold olive green uniforms to the military. When the showroom opened recently, it sold some 50 vehicles in the first few days to rich Poles who no longer have to be shy about having money. In contrast to the communists who hoped to work wonders with the working class the present government has the creation of 'a middle class' written into its political programme. At times, though, displays of wealth attract open signs of anger. 'A woman spat on my windscreen as I stood at the traffic lights in my expensive car,' said one businessman. 'I don't really blame her, it cost more than she'll earn in her life. 'But she doesn't realise I'm so busy I don't have any time to enjoy the things I can now afford,' he adds bitterly. Ms Malgosia Piwkowska from Sopot, a popular resort on the Baltic, who is opening a menswear shop there in the summer, reckons she will be selling 100 Giorgio Armani suits a month.' But I won't just be selling clothes, I'll be advising men what to wear and when to wear it,' she says of her project which promises a monthly turnover of Dollars 30,000. It's a service which could well be gratefully received as Poland's new money looks for pointers on how to behave when dealing with their rich and powerful foreign partners. These are the ones on the way up working hard to make their first million dollars. Several hundred, though, according to Mr Wiktor Kubiak, the owner of Batax Ltd, a trading company, are already worth between Dollars 5m to Dollars 10m. The capital was mostly accumulated, he says, over the past two years. Mr Kubiak is rich, too, and he is one of the first of his kind to have invested in the performing arts and is planning to buy a Warsaw theatre. He says he has put more than Dollars 1m into Metro, a musical which he hopes to promote on Broadway. In the meantime, it is playing to packed houses in Warsaw to disapproving stares from theatre people used to a more staid cultural diet. But state subsidies to the arts are being cut and private money will be essential if many artists are to survive. The arts are not the only sphere where the rich are beginning to dabble. Politics is another. When Mr Algirdas Saudargis, the Lithuanian foreign minister, arrived in Poland last January charged with setting up a government in exile soon after the tragic shootings in Vilnius, Mr Jan Walczyk, the owner of the Zajazd Napoleonski hotel, and his rich friends helped him set up an office. It may have been one of the first foreign policy initiatives taken independently of the government by the newly rich. Mr Slawomir Jaruga, a successful businessman from Lodz, provided an example of domestic political ambitions when he split the UPR, a small free-market party in an attempt to become its leader. The rich are also beginning to take an interest in restoring crumbling country houses once owned by the gentry. Some money is being spent abroad. Indeed, children are beginning to be educated at foreign schools and a few are already enjoying their own yachts on the Mediterranean. Art auctions are fashionable, and Mr Wojciech Fibak, the tennis player, recently paid Dollars 47,000 for a symbolist painting by Jacek Malcewski at a sale organised by the Unicum auction house at the Victoria Intercontinental hotel. The Warsaw rich tend to live in leafy suburbs in large comfortable houses surrounded by high walls protected by large dogs and hired private bodyguards. Horse riding, tennis, eating out and charity dances at the Warsaw Marriott are all part of their lifestyle. A ball next Saturday in the Gdynia Hotel should provide a review of a class in statu ascendi. It is being organised by a local group of the Lion's Club to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the first constitution. Mrs Danuta Walesa, the president's wife, is an honorary patron as is Mr Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, the prime minister. Dinner jackets will be worn.</p>

It relayed the guidelines of the  national economic work conference and made initial arrangements  for Beijing's 1994 reform and development based on the  requirements of the "decision" of the Third Plenary Session of  the 14th Party Central Committee and the national economic work  conference. Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal party  committee, attended the meeting, and Mayor Li Qiyan gave a  report.    Li Qiyan relayed the major guidelines of the national  economic work conference and spoke on Beijing's 1993 economic  work. He said: This year is the first year for the new  municipal government to carry out its work. Thanks to the  correct leadership of the party Central Committee, the State  Council, and the municipal party committee and the support of  the various democratic parties and friends outside the party,  the people throughout the municipality have conscientiously  studied Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics, adhered to the party's basic line,  and, based on Beijing's specific conditions, further emancipated  the mind and comprehensively accelerated reform and opening up  with new ideas and large-scale measures. Thanks to the good  foundation laid by the previous government, the economy has  developed in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner, and it is  certain that the goal of "making this year's achievements  surpass last year's" will be attained.    Li Qiyan said: Beijing's gross domestic product is expected  to reach 84.5 billion yuan this year, up 11.8 percent in terms  of comparable prices. We conquered the catastrophic drought  unheard of in 50 years to make this year the 16th bumper harvest  year in a row. Grain per-unit yield and total output set new  records, the production of a wide range of farm and sideline  products increased, and market supplies were ample. The output  value of township enterprises is expected at 56.8 billion yuan,  up 53.3 percent from the preceding year. In industry, we  overcame numerous unfavorable factors to maintain a fairly high  growth rate. Industrial output value is expected at 124 billion  yuan. Economic benefits grew basically at the same pace with  production, industrial technology advanced more rapidly,  adjustment of industrial composition was accelerated, readily  marketable new products increased, and product quality improved.  The tertiary industry developed continuously, and construction  of large commercial and service facilities and development of  new trades were expedited. The proportion of the tertiary  industry is expected to reach 46.3 percent, nearly 2 percentage  points higher than in the preceding year. Local revenue is  expected at 8.41 billion yuan, up 4.8 percent. Markets were  brisk, and retail sales are expected at more than 54 billion  yuan, up 27 percent.    Li Qiyan said: Urban construction was expedited in the past  year, and, with a large number of key water, electricity, gas,  and heat supply projects, roads, and telecommunication projects  completed, eye-catching changes took place in urban and rural  areas. The expressway to the Shoudu Airport, the renovation of  the east third ring road, Guangning Road, the Beijing section of  Beijing- Shijiazhuang Expressway, and Migu road were completed  and opened to traffic. The Beijing key post and  telecommunication project passed state inspection. Construction  of the large Jingtang Harbor, Beijing west railway station, and  Gaobeidian sewage treatment plant, and other key projects  proceeded smoothly. Houses totaling 10 million square meters in  floor space are expected to complete in urban and rural areas,  of which 6 million square meters will be residential houses.  New achievements were also won in tree planting to green and  beautify the city.    Li Qiyan said: The municipality achieved new progress in  science and education. Urban and rural people's living standard  was raised to a new level. The increase in urban people's per  capita cost of living income is expected to be 8 percentage  points higher than price increase, and peasants' per capita  income is expected at 2,123 yuan. New breakthroughs were made  in the reform focusing on establishing the socialist market  economy system and transforming enterprises' operating  mechanism. The endeavor of opening to the outside world  developed in unprecedented range and quality.    Speaking on the initial arrangements for next year's  economic  work, Li Qiyan said: Next year is an extremely important year  for comprehensively implementing the "decision" of the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th party Central Committee and  establishing the socialist market economy system more rapidly.  It is also a crucial year for accelerating the socialist  modernization of the capital and striving for a fairly  comfortable standard of living three years ahead of schedule.  Based on the guidelines and arrangements of the national  economic work conference, the municipal government has conducted  repeated study of next year's economic work. The basic idea for  next year's economic work is to emancipate the mind, seize the  opportunity to accelerate reform, opening up, and economic  development, and strive for the fairly comfortable standard of  living three years ahead of schedule. Emphasis should be placed  on the following work next year. First, focusing on  establishing the modern enterprise system and macroeconomic  regulating and control system, we should establish the socialist  market economy system more rapidly. Second, We should open  wider to the outside world to achieve a new breakthrough in  using foreign capital. Third, we should optimize the industrial  composition, improve economic efficiency, and maintain the good  trend of rapid development in urban and rural economy. Fourth,  we should have the greatest determination and devote utmost  efforts to speed up construction of urban infrastructural  facilities and raise the modernization level of urban and rural  areas. Fifth, we should develop the advantage in our status as  the national capital and accelerate scientific and technological  progress and personnel training.    Li Qiyan emphasized: To complete next year's work smoothly,  leading cadres at all levels should keep their understanding in  pace with the developing situation. They should, first of all,  further emancipate their minds. In accelerating the  establishment of the new system of the socialist market economy  and the capital's modernization drive, we will face many  unprecedented new tasks, and bold explorations are urgently  needed. Whether the urban and rural economy, reform, and  opening up of the capital can be developed greatly is determined  by whether leading cadres at all levels can greatly emancipate  their minds. Some leading cadres still fail to fully emancipate  their minds. This problem remains conspicuous in some aspects.  How should they further emancipate their minds? Based on  Beijing's reality, leading cadres at all levels should further  emancipate their minds concerning the endeavors of extending the  degree of reform and opening wider to the outside world, with  the focus on establishing the new system of the socialist market  economy more rapidly. They should emancipate their minds to  resolve the difficulties and problems in economic development  and to meet the requirements for achieving sustained, rapid, and  healthy economic development and the fairly comfortable standard  of living ahead of schedule. When their minds are emancipated  and when they truly proceed from Beijing's reality, they will  have new ideas and adopt large-scale measures to promote  Beijing's work continuously.

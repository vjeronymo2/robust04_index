			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Financial services reassured on industry regulation Mr Joe Palmer used his first speech yesterday as chairman of the planned Personal Investment Authority to tackle hostility in the financial services industry towards the overhaul of its regulation. There had been too many financial services 'scandals' for anyone to claim self-regulation had been an unqualified success and that the current system could continue without change, Mr Palmer said. But he launched a vigorous attack on those within the industry who have pressed for the alternative route of statutory regulation. He underlined his belief that strong public interest representation on the PIA board was essential to give people more confidence in the regulatory system. Given the time-lag before any radically different regulatory system would begin to work, he said, 'I find it incredible that anybody should seriously suggest the best remedy for the problems which we know we have is to tear up the system we have got and start all over again.' The new authority is to become the single retail financial services watchdog later this year. The plans for its 19-strong board to contain just nine people currently working in the industry last week prompted the resignation of one of its members and reignited controversy within the industry over the proposals. 'As a former life assurance person myself (a former chief executive of Legal &amp; General), I am appalled by the low esteem in which the financial services industry is held,' Mr Palmer told a Life Assurance Association conference. He added that the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, was reflecting the public mood in requiring a stronger public interest element on the PIA board. 'What we are proposing will bring solid practitioner influence to our board without the risk of domination.' The PIA prospectus, which will be critical in determining the industry's response, will be published in mid February.</p>

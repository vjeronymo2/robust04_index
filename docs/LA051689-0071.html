			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GALE ON ENERGY ALTERNATIVES  </P> <P> Gale frames the energy question in relatively narrow terms. He rightly  emphasizes our lack of serious commitment to effective energy policies but  implies there are few options to expanded energy supplies as future demand  increases. We are told all sources are tainted by environmental hazards but  nuclear power appears the least troublesome -- if not for emotional  reactionaries and murky politics which cloud rational thought.  </P> <P> If we really want to be sensible about our options, why not take a cue from  utilities who found conservation more profitable than new sources? Consider the  words of physicist Amory Lovins ("To Save Energy, Oceans, Billions -- and the  Air We Breathe" Opinion, Oct. 30, 1988): "Since 1979, Americans have gotten  more than seven times as much new energy from savings as from all net increases  in supply, and more new supply from renewable sources than from fossil and  nuclear fuels. Savings achieved since 1973 are saving $150 billion in annual  energy costs today. . . . Even so, we've barely scratched the surface of how  much efficiency is available and worth buying."  </P> <P> Who would have thought there was so much potential for creating wealth merely  by not throwing it away? Even a headstrong consumer society might get used to  that idea if it were painless enough (read: incentives, glamour). Maybe not,  though. A mandate for efficient energy use might inadvertently lead to a more  competitive business climate, forcing us to gaze on fewer foreign cars and  high-rises against a cleaner skyline. This would be an obvious deline in our  standard of living.  </P> <P> KENT STROTHER  </P> <P> Whittier  </P></p>

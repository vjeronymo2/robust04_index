			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 8 (KCNA) -- Yi Yong-tok, the new  minister of the South Korean puppet Unification Board, at a  press conference on January 5 reportedly uttered very  provocative words that he "will not respond unconditionally even  if the North proposes a North-South dialogue."    He meant that the South Korean puppet clique would refuse  dialogue with the North by setting every conceivable condition.  This clearly proved once again that they actually do not want  any contact and dialogue between the North and the South but  continue seeking confrontation and division, although they are  loud-mouthed about dialogue and the exchange of special envoys.    The mishmash of Yi Yong-tok is grave because it came at a  time when a breakthrough has been made in the solution of the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through DPRK-U.S.  contacts and work is being done for a progress of the DPRK-  U.S. talks. Yi's words are a base blast to foil the DPRK-U.S.  talks at any cost and isolate and stifle the North by setting an  "international cooperation system" in-motion.    Judging from this, "preconditions" for DPRK-U.S. talks cried  for by the South Korean puppets are, in the final analysis, a  brake on the DPRK-U.S. talks.    Still more intolerable is that he, ridiculously enough, spun  out the venomous trash that "the North's human rights problem  will be dealt with" and "things touching the North on the raw  will be mentioned in the future".    It is preposterous for Yi Yong-tok to have cried over the  North's "human rights problem", while keeping mum about the  reality of South Korea riddled with human rights abuses.</p>

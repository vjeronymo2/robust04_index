			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, </F> Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others from the  "Diplomatic Panorama" feature]    [Text] An additional 100-strong Russian peacekeeping  contingent will go to Sarajevo from Ryazan on 26 March, the  Russian president's special envoy, Deputy Foreign Minister  Vitaliy Churkin told a press conference Thursday.    He said there would be Russian Orthodox and Muslim members  in  it, which reflected Russia's objective position. Russia rejects  accusations of having a pro-Serb or any other position, he added.    He said that relations between the leaders of Croatia and  the  self-proclaimed Republic of Serb Krajina must be normalized.  "There are ebbs and flows in relations between Zagreb and Knin,  fraught with the danger of violence that may bury peaceful  settlement in former Yugoslavia," he said.    He said that talks on a cease-fire were held in the Russian  embassy in Zagreb on Tuesday. "The world community unanimously  believes that cease-fire is the first thing to be achieved.  Then economic relations must be normalized and then the  political status of Croatia's Serb regions must be defined,"  said Churkin.    He pointed out that the talks in Zagreb were held in an  absolutely new context. They involved representatives of the  U.S., the international peace conference on former Yugoslavia,  the EU, the UN and Russia. "Unfortunately, no agreement on a  cease-fire was signed, and individual details are still to be  specified. We hope, however, that during the next few days  representatives of the UN and of the UN protection force in  former Yugoslavia will take charge of this. We also hope that  the talks will be continued in the Russian embassy in Zagreb on  29 March," said Churkin.    He emphasized that the agreement between Zagreb and Knin was  not simply a cease-fire agreement, but a complicated  military-technical document envisaging the disengagement of the  conflicting parties and a number of security measures.    Croat tourist companies have been actively inviting Russian  tourists to visit Croatia lately, Churkin went on to say.  "Before the Croats and Krajina Serbs reach a cease-fire  agreement I would not recommend that Russian citizens spend  their holidays in Croatia," he said.</p>

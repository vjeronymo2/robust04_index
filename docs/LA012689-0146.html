			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> The SEC has filed suit in Manhattan against two stockbrokers alleging they  cornered the market and manipulated the stock of Chase Medical Group Inc. in a  classic short squeeze designed to defraud outside investors. The defendants in  the suit are Vincent Militano, 36, of Plainview, N.Y., and Milton Sonneberg,  42, of Woodmere, N.Y. The two work for Moore &amp; Schley, Cameron &amp; Co., a  New York-based broker-dealer firm that was not charged in the suit. The two  could not be reached for comment. Miami-based Chase Medical operates medical  centers in southern Florida. Its shares are traded on the American Stock  Exchange.  </P></p>

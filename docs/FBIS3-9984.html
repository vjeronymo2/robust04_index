			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 23 February, the Teotonio Vilela Human Rights  Committee informed the Attorney General's Office about the  creation of a new neo-Nazi group -- "White Power" [preceding two  words in English] -- in Florianopolis (Santa Catarina State).  The group says it has created "shooting blacks week."    The group threatens to attack with bombs sites regularly  visited by blacks. In publications known as "skinzines," the  group reports it is settling in Florianopolis to "defend racial  purity and preserve social order." It proposes "expelling  blacks from Brazil."    Councilman Marcio de Souza (Workers Party) sent the  committee  a publication in which the neo-Nazis promise to blow up the  building where his office is located.    The messages are signed by pen names such as "Black Killer"  [preceding two words in English]. It is stated in them that  people involved in the bomb explosion at the World Trade Center  building in New York have been contacted by the group and asked  to come to Santa Catarina to conduct similar attacks. The  Attorney General's Office will ask Federal Police to begin  investigating the charges.</p>

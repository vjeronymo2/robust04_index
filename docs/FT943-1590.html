			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Computer aid in drug screening Researchers working in the fast-growing field of combinatorial chemistry aim to make a wide variety of compounds simultaneously, which are then screened to find useful characteristics. The first set of computer tools to assist in this process have been devised by Tripos, a US scientific software company. Tripos's Mass Screen software will assist researchers to generate vast 'libraries' of compounds and manipulate the data as they search for new leads in drug development.

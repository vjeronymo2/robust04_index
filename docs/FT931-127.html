			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Restructured David Brown ready for market with Pounds 90m price tag DAVID BROWN Group, the Huddersfield gear manufacturer with one of the most famous names in British engineering, is to be floated with a market value of Pounds 90.3m. About 7.7m ordinary shares priced at 170p will be made available to the public through an offer for sale, with a further 23.1m shares being placed with institutions. All the shares have been underwritten by BZW, the company's broker. The group, which was losing money at the time of a Pounds 46m management buy-in in 1990, has been restructured and last year made pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.3m on sales of Pounds 81m. The offer price represents a multiple of 12.1 times pro forma historic earnings and a notional gross dividend yield of 4.7 per cent for the year to January 29 1993. The company's biggest business is vehicle transmissions, supplying both the military and civil markets. It said work for the Challenger 2 battle tank would provide stable work until 1997. The Radicon division makes geared drives for the industrial market. The group said it should be an early beneficiary of economic upturn. The offer and placing will raise Pounds 52.4m, of which the company will receive Pounds 20.1m, net of expenses. After paying off borrowings and redeeming preference shares, the group wil have cash balances of Pounds 9m. Mr Chris Cook and Mr Chris Brown, the joint chief executives who led the buy-in, said the company would have up to Pounds 15m available for acquisitions. They want to fill in product gaps and also extend the group's sales and distribution network - particularly in continental Europe. The closing date for share applications is next Tuesday. Dealings are expected to begin on April 15. COMMENT In spite of some feeling that this management buy-in comes to the market with unseemly haste, analysts considered the offer had been realistically priced by BZW. The new management has taken a company and shaken it up after after five generations of family ownership. The group's name and technical reputation are well known, so it should benefit from economic upturn. However, orders on the military side come unevenly, and Radicon's new products are yet to prove themselves. A prospective multiple of about 11 puts it at a discount to other engineering stocks which are priced for recovery. Not one for the stags perhaps, but the shares should attract long-term investors with faith in British manufacturing.</p>

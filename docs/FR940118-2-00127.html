Description of Guidelines for Deriving Site-Specific Sediment Quality Criteria for the Protection of Benthic Organisms <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Guidelines for Deriving Site-Specific Sediment Quality Criteria for the Protection of Benthic Organisms provides guidance on the methodology which is appropriate for modifying nationally applicable sediment quality criteria on a site-specific basis. The document details the procedures and data necessary to perform the modification that may be required because of unique sensitivities of site species or partitioning processes at the site.

The sediment quality criteria, like the surface water quality criteria, are ambient criteria describing aquatic conditions which support designated uses. The merit and validity of these criteria must stand alone without regard to permit limit derivation, sediment remediation costs, etc. Specifically the Agency requests comment on the five sediment quality criteria documents described above, the document entitled ``Technical Basis for Deriving Sediment Quality Criteria for Nonionic Organic Contaminants for the Protection of Benthic Organisms by Using Equilibrium Partitioning'' and the ``Guidelines for Deriving Site-Specific Sediment Quality Criteria for the Protection of Benthic Organisms''. EPA is also interested in receiving comments on the following issues:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Site Specific Criteria Modifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 304(a) a state may develop its own water quality criteria on either a state-wide basis or on a site-specific basis to be protective of unique waters. EPA is considering the same approach for the developement of sediment quality criteria. Section 131.11(b)(1) of EPA's regulations allows states to modify 304(a) criteria to reflect site-specific conditions, when adopting water quality standards based on such criteria guidance and EPA is considering allowing similar site-specific modification for water quality standards based on EPA's sediment quality criteria guidance. Technical persons have identified a number of reasons both supporting and challenging the appropriateness of allowing site specific modifications to sediment criteria. EPA is particularly interested in receiving comments and ideas on site specific criteria modifications. A more detailed discussion of these issues can be found on this topic on page 99 of the Technical Basis document identified above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Arts: La Damnation de Faust - Concert There are problems in trying to attract the top international conductors to London. Many of them are exceedingly expensive and, even if they can be lured to come, only want to conduct works that they have either just recorded or are taking with them around the world's capitals. Nevertheless, if a London orchestra wants to look competitive against its rivals, it has to enter the fray. The Philharmonia has been striving to put together a distinctive line-up of conductors, among whom the successor to its Music Director Sinopoli (still not announced) will clearly be the most important. The prestigious new arrival on its list is James Levine, a high-profile figure in New York, Bayreuth and Salzburg, but not seen in front of a London orchestra for several decades. His return was well handled. By scheduling a series of three programmes the Philharmonia made sure that the concerts could be marketed to best advantage (there were queues for returns) while also giving an overview of Levine's musical sympathies. The Beethoven and Mahler concerts met with mixed opinions; by all accounts the best - a performance of Berlioz's La Damnation de Faust - was left until last. It seems no coincidence that Levine has had his biggest successes in the opera-house. The Berlioz may not be an opera (even though it was recently staged at Covent Garden) but it calls for an opera-conductor's sense of atmosphere and pacing. Levine succeeded in providing most of that and took care over every bar, not just the showpiece orchestral numbers. In his hands the work aspired to grand opera status, which was clearly intentional, as Levine had brought with him a heroic Faust in Gary Lakes. Perhaps Faust's Invocation to Nature does call for a grandeur of utterance, but it would take the devil himself to get a voice of this size to sing with the flexibility that most of Berlioz's music presupposes. Maria Ewing brought inner intensity to Marguerite's solos; Roderick Earle made a lively impact as Brander. Jose van Dam sang a wickedly subtle Mephistopheles, suave, ingratiating, diabolic, making every word of the French text count. Only a couple of years ago the Philharmonia put on La Damnation de Faust with Charles Dutoit - not such a high-class performance as this, but it did exhibit a sense of French style that is not in Levine's bones. Where he gained the upper hand was in the standard of singing which he obtained from the Philharmonia Chorus and, above all, the quality of ensemble from the orchestra. This was an evening when the Philharmonia sounded confident of its place in the international league. Sponsored by AT&amp;T and NCR</p>

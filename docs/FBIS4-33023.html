			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Otero] </F>   [Text] President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares has  announced his government will seek Panama's entrance into the  Group of Three (G-3), which includes Colombia, Mexico, and  Venezuela, and rejoining the Rio Group. Meanwhile, he proposed  as a solution to the Darien Gap problem the construction of an  alternate road through the San Blas region.    Perez Balladares made these statements on Monday during a  courtesy visit to Colombia, where he met with his colleague  Cesar Gaviria, according to a news release from the  president-elect's press office.    It also was learned that Perez Balladares proposed Panama's  entry into the G-3 free trade agreement, which is to be signed  by the governments of Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela on 14 June  during the Ibero-American Summit of heads of state.    The president-elect also said that his government  administration will seek readmission into the permanent market  and political consensus know as the Rio Group, from which Panama  was ousted during Manuel Antonio Noriega's military regime.    The press release also reports that Perez Balladares and  Gaviria agreed on bilateral procedures to combat drug  trafficking, particularly along the common border where an  inter-American road is to be constructed.    Perez Balladares appeared in favor of modifying the road's  route in an effort to reopen the inter-American road --  construction on the road was halted 20 years ago in the Darien  Gap -- indicating that the San Blas area is the most feasible  alternative for this project, according to the press release.    The future president was accompanied on this visit by his  Foreign Minister-designate Gabriel Lewis Galindo, and Jose Luis  Sosa, member of the governmental transition commission.    It also was officially announced that Perez Balladares will  travel tomorrow to Puerto Rico, where he will hold a private  meeting with Jose Rosello, governor of that Caribbean island.  The president-elect's June visits to Japan and Taiwan, which  are aimed at reestablishing commercial ties, were also confirmed.</p>

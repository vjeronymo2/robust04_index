			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Harrington Kilbride lifted by acquisitions HARRINGTON Kilbride, the specialist publisher, reported profit and turnover sharply ahead in the year to end-December. Pre-tax profits advanced 46 per cent to Pounds 1.87m (Pounds 1.27m), on turnover up 68 per cent to Pounds 15.4m (Pounds 9.19m). The company, floated in December 1991, has been expanding rapidly. It now has 40 titles, including the Employment Gazette, a government contract won from HMSO last year. More than half of turnover was generated overseas, almost all from controlled circulation publications. Expansion has been largely funded by borrowing. Net debt at the year-end rose from Pounds 1m to Pounds 2.4m, taking gearing to 65 per cent. However, falling interest rates cut net interest charges to Pounds 211,000 (Pounds 276,000). Earnings per share were 11.8p (10.2p). The recommended final dividend is 3p, making 4.5p for the year.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Aitken denial on hotel bill fails to stem sleaze storm: Labour calls for public investigation - Police asked to examine blackmail claims The government's bitter confrontation with Harrods' owner Mr Mohammed Fayed erupted into a new political storm at Westminster yesterday as Mr Jonathan Aitken, the Treasury chief secretary, denied he had lied to the cabinet secretary. With Mr John Major's administration engulfed by new 'sleaze' charges, the prime minister disclosed that police were investigating whether an intermediary for Mr Fayed had sought to 'blackmail' the government. The row prompted an angry clash in the House of Commons between Mr Major and Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader. Mr Blair called for public investigation of the allegations and demanded to know why Mr Major had earlier this week sacked Mr Neil Hamilton as industry minister. But in an exchange which marked an abrupt end to the 'new style of politics' promised by both leaders, Mr Blair was accused by the prime minister of descending into the 'gutter' of public life by giving credence to unsubstantiated rumours. Opposition MPs in turn demanded that Mr Major order Conservative Central Office to return the Pounds 250,000 Mr Fayed says he paid to the party during the 1980s. Mr Aitken's denial that he had allowed a business associate to pay some or all of a bill for a two-day stay last year at the Ritz - the Paris hotel owned by Mr Fayed - was reinforced by a letter to The Guardian newspaper from Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary. Commenting on suggestions that Mr Aitken had lied to him during an earlier investigation, Sir Robin said: 'For the record, I do not regard Jonathan Aitken as having lied to me or misled me.' In a reference to Mr Aitken's Ritz account, Sir Robin told Mr Peter Preston, the newspaper's editor: 'I am satisfied that, despite the discrepancies in the billing to which you have devoted so much attention, Mr Aitken and his wife paid their bill at the Ritz in full.' In the Commons, Mr Aitken accused the newspaper of 'hysterical, sleaze journalism'. But Labour continued to demand an explanation of why Mr Aitken's account for the Ritz stay shows only a FFr4,257 (Pounds 510) cash payment towards a total bill of FFr8,010, transferred to the account of Mr Said Ayas, a former business associate. Downing Street declined to offer an explanation of the discrepancy between the FFr4,257 cash payment made by Mr Aitken's wife and the FFr8010.90 cost of Mr Aitken's two-night stay. Amid growing concern among Tory MPs that the government's standing is being seriously damaged by wave of claims of impropriety against a succession ministers, Mr Fayed attacked Mr Aitken's explanation. In a statement, Mr Fayed said he was 'surprised that the Cabinet secretary had reached his decision without reference to me'. There is now no pretence that there is open war between Mr Major and Mr Fayed, whose colleague, Mr Michael Cole, said it was 'brave of him to take on the government'. Chief Superintendent Roy Clark of London's Metropolitan Police has meanwhile been asked to examine whether there should be a full-scale inquiry into the manner in which the government learned that Mr Fayed was making allegations about ministerial improprieties. The intermediary who took the allegations to Mr Major is widely believed at Westminster to be Mr Brian Hitchen, editor of the Sunday Express. He has declined to comment. In a further twist last night to the wider controversy, Dame Angela Rumbold, a Tory party vice-chairman, announced she was stepping down as an executive director of political lobbyists Decision Makers. Dame Angela, MP for Mitcham and Morden, quit after the Commons committee on members' interests was asked to investigate her alleged role in Decision Makers' lobbying for a Channel Tunnel rail link station at Ebbsfleet, in Kent.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Technical Sciences Gennadiy Ivanov, </F> chief of a separate laboratory at the All-Union Scientific  Research Institute of Experimental Physics, under the  ``Reaction'' rubric: ``Listen to a `Three-Star'  Hero-Academician'']    [Text] The choice of ways to build defenses has always  numbered among the particularly crucial tasks of state  management. Therefore the interest of political scientists and  experts in the recently adopted decision on structural changes  to the composition of the national nuclear triad is  understandable. For, under the treaty signed a year ago on  reducing and limiting strategic nuclear arms (START II), our  primarily ``land-based'' triad could turn into a ``sea-based''  one.    Since the polemic over this part of the treaty is  continuing,  it would be interesting to know the opinion on this score of  Academician Yu. Khariton, one of the creators of the Russian  ``nuclear shield.'' Although the well known scientist has left  the immediate leadership of the All-Union Scientific Research  Institute of Experimental Physics (city of Arzamas-16), he  continues to work in this ``field.'' After asking him to  familiarize himself with the rubric ``Disarm, But Sensibly'' in  PRAVDA 16 February this year, we learned his opinion of the  questions touched upon there. Two points stood out particularly  clearly.    First point. Yuliy Borisovich showed concern at the  reorientation of our nuclear triad from ``land'' to ``sea'' --  as prescribed by START II. He is unable to find a proper  explanation for such a decision and is not in possession of  proper arguments in favor of that decision.    Second point. In his opinion, under the changed conditions  of trust between the nuclear partners questions of the security  of nuclear weapons must evidently take priority. Precisely this  must be taken into consideration when choosing the carriers of  such weapons and their basing modes.    Broadly speaking, security means, above all, protecting the  environment and man from excessively dangerous technologies. In  this connection the academician touched on the danger of an  accident involving a nuclear-powered submarine stuffed with  dozens of dangerously explosive solid-fuel missiles carrying  hundreds of nuclear warheads. He emphasized the catastrophic  nature of the consequences for nature of such an incident. The  use of solid-propellant rockets with the U.S. space shuttles is  also, in his opinion, a risky technical decision. The deaths of  several U.S. astronauts have already confirmed this.    Festivities marking the academician's 90th birthday took  place recently at the All-Union Scientific Research Institute of  Experimental Physics. He is now honorary director of this  institute. His opinion on the future of the national nuclear  forces should be heeded, for it has already repeatedly been of  tremendous benefit. But, so we understand, this time he is not,  for some reason, being involved in resolving the problem of  nuclear disarmament. And yet, of our scientists who developed  nuclear weapons, Yuliy Borisovich is now the only ``three-star''  hero-academician.</p>

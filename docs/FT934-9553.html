			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Observer: Euro-burble Life at the great Euro-show in Strasbourg will be markedly duller when MEP Madron Seligman checks in his dispatch box next June. Seligman, who hails from the engagingly-named Sussex village of Nuthurst, regularly added a little colour to proceedings at the European Parliament by sporting a pink carnation furnished gratis by the Alsacian city fathers. Never a shrinking violet, Seligman, who entered the Guinness Book of Records for the size of his majority in the 1979 Euro-elections, was on Monday evening reminded of an early piece of self-publicity. Speaking at Seligman's 75th birthday party, fellow Balliol College alumnus Sir Edward Heath recalls playing the organ at his friend's wedding. Confronted at the last minute with a sheet of music, Seligman in D, Heath duly sight-read the unfamiliar opus. Nearing the end, the bride was nowhere in view, so he returned to the top. The congregation finally heard Seligman in D 11 times. Well, those Euro-MPs do go on.</p>

However, developing countries could suffer from two costs of transition: the decline of benefits from preference schemes, under which industrialised countries allow specified imports with little or no duties, and also higher food costs. The IMF says preliminary analyses suggest that erosion of preference margins is small. The main beneficiaries have been the more advanced developing countries, which have more to gain from tariff cuts and liberalisation of agricultural, textile and apparel trade. However, some countries (notably in North Africa and the Caribbean), which rely overwhelming on preferences on industrial products, could be adversely affected. Although developing countries which import much of their food might be hurt by higher prices, farm sectors in other countries could thrive as world market distortions are reduced. Countries protecting their farmers may simply replace their quotas with prohibitive tariffs, the report notes, and anti-dumping measures could still be used for protection. Still the achievements in market liberalisation, strengthening of rules and institutions and extension of discipline to new areas will be far reaching, the report said.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] St. John's (Antigua), 9 Mar (DPA) -- The Antigua  Labor Party (ALP) has garnered its fifth straight electoral  victory by beating a unified opposition in yesterday's elections  in this Caribbean nation, which comprises the islands of Antigua  and Barbuda. The ALP, with 16 of the 17 electoral districts  reporting final tallies, has secured 11 seats in the parliament,  while the opposition United Progress Party (UPP) has won four.    UPP leader Baldwin Spencer is leading in his district and it  is almost certain he will win. Therefore, the opposition party  will have five representatives within the legislature. The last  seat will be taken by a representative of the Island of Barbuda.    Although the ALP maintains control over the government, the  election results show significant progress for the opposition.  The UPP will increase its presence in the legislature from one  seat in the current administration to five seats in the next.    In addition, the election results show Lester Bird, an ALP  leader, will be the country's new prime minister. Bird succeeds  his father, Vere Bird, who decided to retire from politics at  the age of 84 after governing the nation since it gained  independence 13 years ago.</p>

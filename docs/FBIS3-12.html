			<p>A     26 February VNA report on a conference on the anti-malarial  effort in Vietnam's northern provinces suggests that Hanoi has  made considerable progress in overcoming what the media two years  ago had indicated was a serious malaria problem.  According to  VNA, all three targets of Vietnam's anti-malaria program for 1993  were met as the death rate dropped by 30 percent, the number of  malaria sufferers fell by nearly 20 percent, and the number of  malaria epidemics decreased by 84 percent compared to 1992.  VNA  reported particular progress in combatting malaria in Vietnam's  central highlands--which the report said was "one of the worst  affected areas " --noting that the death rate in that region had  fallen by "50 percent."      Despite the progress, VNA noted that Hanoi is planning to  intensify its efforts in combatting malaria in 1994.  According  to VNA, the government will allot 60 billion dong for the 1994  anti-malaria campaign--an increase of 10 billion dong over 1993-  -in hopes of reducing the mortality rate by 30 percent and the  number of malaria outbreaks by 20 percent in comparison to 1993.

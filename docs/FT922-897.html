			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: German steel shares transcend cyclical slump - The industry's rationalisation plans are looking good to investors Stuck at the bottom of the world-wide cyclical slump, German steelmakers have done well in the equity market this year. Relative strength and momentum statistics from Merck Finck in Dusseldorf put the sector consistently high in the performance charts since mid-March. Even after some profit-taking over the past week, Hoesch, Klockner-Werke and Thyssen are standing nearly 20 per cent above their lows for the year. The steelmakers seem finally to have abandoned their 'every man for himself' policy and implemented classical techniques for improving buoyancy. They are off-loading excess costs, notably by cutting highly paid workforces. Some 70,000 are expected to lose their jobs by the end of the decade. At the same time they are merging, co-operating and, in the process, rationalising the overall structure of the industry. However, while British Steel and Usinor Sacilor represent virtually the entire steel output of the UK and France respectively, Germany still has five steel specialists. That will come down to four in short order, when Krupp formally completes its takeover of Hoesch. After that, according to Mr Gerhard Cromme, the tough Krupp chief, the number is likely to fall eventually to three, but 'never' less than two. He and Mr Heinz Kriwet, boss of Thyssen, Germany's leading light in steel, are determined that their businesses will remain independent. Survival prospects are not so bright at the bottom of the heap, where Klockner-Werke, a 3.4m tonne per year producer, is feeling the squeeze. Announcing the second passed dividend in succession earlier this year after net profits had slumped from DM78.3m to DM1.5m, Mr Hans Christoph von Rohr, its chairman, bravely remarked that he saw no reason to get out of steel. 'Everyone is now talking to everyone else in the steel industry,' he added. In the interim, however, the shares are trading on a current price/earnings ratio of around 40, according to forecasts by Mr Chris Heminway of Robert Fleming, falling to just above 7 in three years' time. The impulse for the exchanges between steelmakers was the Krupp move against Hoesch last October, which showed that, in spite of obstacles built into the German corporate and financial system, an aggressive takeover of a leading German company can be mounted, and implemented. Whether that is now true for foreign bidders remains to be seen. Thyssen, currently busy knitting together its conventional and special steels subsidiaries (and cutting 5,000 jobs in the process), has said it is not in the market to buy. Mr Cromme, of Krupp, in charge of a 9.5m tonne outfit, says he has enough to do. At present, while tying up the Hoesch deal, he is also trying to persuade the authorities of his right to subsidies for his purchase and rebuilding of the run-down east German EKO Stahl business. The most likely next stage in the restructuring round is expected to include more co-operation deals, such as that struck recently between the steel tube divisions of Hoesch and Mannesmann, which will tie existing steel groups closer together. The German industry looks in far better shape now, ahead of the expected upswing in the cycle. In spite of a pay award of 6.4 per cent, compared with a 5.5 per cent average in Germany this year, rationalisation looks likely to improve competitiveness at least in terms of labour costs per tonne. And although manufacturers complain about selling prices down at 1982 levels, analysts are unanimous that the worst of the cyclical slump is over. They also speak with one voice of the industry leader, Thyssen - 11m tonnes of steel a year and a wide range of diversified interests to ease it over the cyclical bumps - as the long term quality German steel stock. Although Thyssen's pre-tax earnings this year are expected to take a pummelling, and Mr Kriwet has suggested that he might not be able to match last year's DM10 dividend, analysts put it on a prospective p/e of about 13 and their forecasts signal accelerating upwards movement from 1993 onwards. If Hoesch had remained independent, it, too, would have ranked among the favoured. But absorption by Krupp - 'for an absolute song', according to Mr Heminway - has taken it off the market, and investors have been left to speculate, short term, on the value of the Krupp shares in the takeover package. When Krupp comes to market, later this summer, Mr Michael Geiger and Mr Robert Sassoon at County NatWest advise caution. Mr Cromme's transformation has yet to free Krupp of its heavy gearing and a commitment to pay back state subsidies. If the EKO deal goes through, Krupp will have to find substantial funds to bring it up to scratch. And while Mr Cromme speaks confidently of the synergistic savings from his Hoesch link, he has work to do to extract them. It is a little early to 'get positive'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 6 (XINHUA) -- China is becoming a  rising force economically in the Asia-Pacific region and it will  promote the prosperity of the whole region in the next century.    The remarks were made by Peter Tapsell, speaker of the New  Zealand [NZ] Parliament, in an exclusive interview with XINHUA  before leaving here for Xian today.    During his three-day stay in Beijing, the speaker met with  Qiao Shi, chairman of the National People's Congress Standing  Committee, and Vice-President Rong Yiren. His delegation also  held talks with Chinese officials.    "Any appreciation of the future development in the Pacific,  either politically, economically and in terms of security, China  would be an important force," Tapsell said.    New Zealand hopes that China maintains its responsible role  in the region, which would benefit New Zealand, he added.    There would be "excellent opportunities" for trade and  economic cooperation between New Zealand and China, he said.  China has been and will continue to be a huge market for NZ's  exports, mainly wool and timber. China is NZ's biggest wool  buyer, importing more than one quarter of its wool exports. For  New Zealand, Tapsell said it would import more Chinese  machinery, tools, clothing and other light industrial products.    New Zealand is shifting its trade focus from the traditional  European market toward Asia, China in particular, Tapsell said.  China has been one of NZ's top ten trading partners. Although  New Zealanders are mainly decendants of European immigrants, the  younger generations no long have strong ties with Europe,  rather, they are closer to Asia. Objectively speaking, the  establishment of the European Common Market has shut New Zealand  out, he noted. To enable China to trade with the rest of the  world on an equal base, New Zealand supports China to resume its  status in the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs. Moreover,  NZ and China share views on many international issues.    China has also well preserved its culture including the  ancient historical sites and sites featuring many minority  ethnics. Tapsell is a Maori, NZ's indigenous people. He is  also NZ's first speaker from the Maori and the first speaker  from the opposition party.    The visit so far has been quite a success, he said, adding  that he hopes to know more about China in his visit to Xian and  Shanghai.</p>

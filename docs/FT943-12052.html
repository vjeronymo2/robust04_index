			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Gencor buys Shell minerals arm Gencor, the South African mining house, is to pay Dollars 1.14bn (Pounds 920m) for most of the metals and minerals operations of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, which trade under the Billiton banner. The purchase will satisfy Gencor's ambition of becoming one of the world's biggest and most diversified resources groups. The deal includes assets in 15 countries, including bauxite, aluminium, nickel, zinc and lead interests, as well as a portfolio of exploration rights and a global metals marketing and trading network. It also includes Billiton International, which takes in Gencor's Sao Bento gold mine in Brazil and its 50 per cent share of Richards Bay Minerals, the South African mineral sands producer. Billiton draws most of its revenue from bauxite and alumina, raw materials for aluminium. Combined with Gencor's existing South African aluminium interests at the Alusaf refinery, undergoing a Dollars 2bn expansion, it will turn Gencor into the world's fifth biggest aluminium producer. Gencor's international portfolio will also include coal, gold, platinum, and manganese. Mr Brian Gilbertson, Gencor's chairman, rejected concerns that Gencor was now overexposed to aluminium, saying that after recent improvements in the aluminium price the combined group was poised to benefit from the economic upturn. The price agreed for the assets was Dollars 1.22bn, but an expected adjustment downwards of Dollars 90m to reflect changes in net capital employed since December 1992 and a Dollars 15m cash injection to Billiton's Suriname operations by Gencor brings the value of the deal to Dollars 1.14bn. Because of exchange control restrictions, Gencor has been unable to finance the deal from South Africa. Instead it will contribute Dollars 335m in cash, raised from the disposal of its interests in TransAtlantic Holdings and some North Sea oil assets, and is borrowing Dollars 430m of seven-year debt. Shell will retain a stake in the business by subscribing for Dollars 300m of exchangeable bonds. Billiton will take out an additional facility of Dollars 170m to meet working capital needs. Shell said the deal would result in an after-tax charge of Dollars 170m but this would at least be offset by the divestiture of its remaining metals assets. Lex, Page 18; Bold steps, Page 24</p>

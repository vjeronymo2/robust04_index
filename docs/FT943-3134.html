			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Arlen turns in Pounds 1.2m Arlen, the electrical manufacturer and distributor, has achieved a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.21m for the first half of 1994 on sales from continuing operations of Pounds 15.1m. Earnings per share were 1.1p. The company, which came under the control of a new management team a year ago, said comparisons were difficult since the business has been reorganised and the year end changed. But it stated that for the nine months to December 31 1993 there was a loss of Pounds 6.81m.</p>

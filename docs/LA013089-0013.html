			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES : BACK-YARD PARTY ROCK FROM AMBEL AND GANG  </P> <P> Toward the end of his show at the Palomino on Friday, Eric Ambel asked if  anyone knew of a barbecue he could play at Sunday. In some ways, the casual,  spirited rock 'n' roll provided by Ambel and his band, Roscoe's Gang, might  have been more suited to a back-yard party than the sparsely populated North  Hollywood club. But Ambel's genuine enthusiasm proved enough for any setting.  </P> <P> Even if all Ambel (taking a break from his duties as the lead guitarist for New  York's Del-Lords) had done was play Swamp Dogg's buried treasure "Total  Destruction of Your Mind" -- the highlight of his recent "Roscoe's Gang" album  -- he would deserve to be carried to the barbecue of his choice in a sedan  chair. With drummer Ron (Wrongo) Gremp's trash-can whomp serving as the  heartbeat, the rarely heard song sounded like an outtake from "Beggar's  Banquet."  </P> <P> That heartbeat carried the gang -- which included singer Syd Straw and  harmonicat Jimmy Powers -- through a rambunctious mix of obscure outside  material, several Del-Lords selections and a handful of spunky originals. A  reminder that rock played just for fun is every bit as meaningful as rock  played for more "high-minded" purposes. STEVE HOCHMAN  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TOROS TAKE AIM AT RIVERSIDE IN EARLY SHOWDOWN  </P> <P> Coach Dave Yanai at Cal State Dominguez Hills prefers to play down the  importance of one game.  </P> <P> But there's no way his UC Riverside counterpart, Dave Masi, would beat around  the bush about tonight's 8:05 California Collegiate Athletic Assn. tip-off  between the two schools in the Toro gymnasium.  </P> <P> "No doubt about it, this is an early-season showdown," Masi said.  </P> <P> Hard to believe, you say, particularly since little old Division II Riverside  (12-2) drew national attention a few weeks back with a shocking 110-92 victory  over second-ranked Division I powerhouse Iowa while the Toros were losing to  Cal State Hayward and Cal Lutheran.  </P> <P> Even more difficult to consider because Dominguez Hills (9-5) spent most of its  preseason schedule spinning its wheels while Riverside was marching to second  place in national rankings.  </P> <P> Besides, says Yanai, this is only the second CCAA contest for both 1-0 clubs.  "I don't put much importance on this game over any other. This is just one of  13 more," he said.  </P> <P> Still, if Dominguez Hills wants to make good on the contender status Yanai  predicted before the season, this is the night to make a statement to the other  seven teams in the conference.  </P> <P> A Toro victory, says Masi, would prove what he has thought for some time.  </P> <P> "There are five or six teams that can win this conference," he said. "Dominguez  Hills is one."  </P> <P> Masi's team is one of his own picks too. Riverside brings an eight-game winning  streak into the contest and on paper has a leg up on its preseason co-favorite,  defending champion Cal State Bakersfield, which was upset in its opener last  week by Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.  </P> <P> Masi says he is uneasy about tonight's game, but Yanai could see only one  reason for Masi's concern: "This game may be more important for them since it  is a road game."  </P> <P> Masi pointed to other areas of concern: "Dominguez Hills is peaking at the  right time. I saw them play last Saturday and they looked excellent."  </P> <P> "We are a long way from (peaking)," Yanai responded.  </P> <P> Injuries may play a part in the game. Riverside is expected to be without  starting forward Jimmy Shorters (broken rib) and sixth man Chris Ceballos (bone  chip in knuckle). Each has missed four games. Shorters played his freshman year  at Dominguez Hills in the 1983-84 season. Also missing for the last four  contests has been Toro starting forward Kenyatta Kalisana (knee injury). Yanai  said Kalisana is expected to play.  </P> <P> Masi says his game plan may change if either of his players can't play.  </P> <P> "I'm very concerned," he said.  </P> <P> This could be the biggest game in the last two seasons for Dominguez Hills. The  Toros, who lost both times to Riverside last year, nevertheless finished the  season winning seven of their last 10 CCAA games and narrowly missed a  postseason conference tournament berth.  </P> <P> With three of five starters back, the Toros figure to make a run for one of  those four tournament spots. Despite stumbling early in the season, Dominguez  Hills brings a four-game winning streak into tonight's game. The Toros have won  nine of their last 12 games.  </P> <P> "We have had a little more level play early in the year," Yanai said. "I'm  pleased with the play right now. This certainly is the right time (to gel)."  </P> <P> Riverside leads the CCAA in scoring, averaging 96 points a game. Dominguez  Hills is the top defensive team, allowing 63 a contest.  </P> <P> "We handle the transition game well," Yanai said, "but we function at a slower  pace -- not a slow pace, but maybe a score like in the 70s."  </P> <P> Dominguez Hills will need a big night from its All-American candidate, senior  center Anthony Blackmon. Blackmon, who was voted the CCAA's Player of the Week  after an 82-71 victory last Friday over Chapman College, has averaged 21 points  and nine rebounds a game in his last seven outings. The 6-7 post has averaged  three assists during the four-game winning streak.  </P> <P> Dominguez Hills will be at Cal Poly Pomona on Saturday night at 8:05. Women's  games precede both contests at 5:45 tonight and Saturday.  </P></p>

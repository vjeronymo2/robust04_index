			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Israeli Broadcast Ban: Israel's broadcast authority angered pop music fans and  leftist politicians Wednesday by banning from radio and television two protest  songs about the country's handling of the Palestinian uprising on grounds that  the songs serve the enemies of the Jewish state. "This is a political protest  and cannot be heard as entertainment. . . . These songs depress the state and  are propaganda for the Palestine Liberation Organization," authority deputy  chairman Shlomo Kor said of the tunes by Nurit Galron and Hava Alberstein, two  of Israel's most popular women singers. Education Minister Yitzhak Navon said  he will delay implementation of the decision until he can hear arguments from  both sides. DANIEL CERONE  </P></p>

Exports amounted to 5.5 billion dollars for the period, off  10.9 percent from the same period in 1992, while imports were  set at 5.8 billion dollars, up 3.9 percent.    Economic Relations Minister Davorin Kracun said that despite  the trade deficit, Slovenia's foreign exchange reserves had  increased by around 300 million dollars over the period, to  almost 1.5 billion dollars at present.</p>

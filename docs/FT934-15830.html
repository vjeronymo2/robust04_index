			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Priceless Sir, I cannot help wondering whether there is a conspiracy of silence among those building societies which have issued permanent interest bearing shares (PIBS). Twelve societies have now issued PIBS and the current, aggregate market value of such issues is in excess of Pounds 1bn. To my amazement, not one of the societies has seen fit to have its PIBS prices quoted daily in your columns. I enquired of two societies why they were not advertising their prices in your paper. One appeared to regard the idea as a somewhat quaint notion; the other said I was only the second person to ask the question. Cannot these building societies be persuaded to abandon their excessive modesty? S W Duggan, J D Ward (Financial Services), Number 9 Kingsway, London WC2B 6XF</p>

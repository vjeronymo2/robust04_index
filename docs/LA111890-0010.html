			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> O, YOSEMITE!  </P> <P> I work in Yosemite Valley in the summer months. It is truly a glorious place.  But these Joe Bolands really chaff my hide.  </P> <P> These so-called preservationists want to preserve only their own narrow  interests. What sort of changes do these types want? You can bet they don't  include you enjoying this magnificent valley.  </P> <P> How is it Dolan so easily found critics but was unable to find those who like  the way things are. The history of Yosemite is written in sweat and toil by  those who love this valley. The Yosemite Park and Curry Co. is full of people  like this. Look a little more, and Dolan will probably find the rest of the  crowd supports the way things are.  </P> <P> RANDY YATES  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

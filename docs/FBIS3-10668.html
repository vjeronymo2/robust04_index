In an interview with PRENSA LATINA, Dufour has said the  strengthening of bilateral relations constitutes a reply to  Cuban efforts to broaden, more each day, the ties uniting this  Caribbean nation with the rest of the world, particularly with  the European Union.    Dufour recalled the French delegations that recently visited  Cuba were very impressed with the Cuban people's efforts to  overcome their current difficulties.    Our representatives saw how Cubans are working to find  solutions by using imagination with knowledge. When they  returned to Paris, they reported they found a very active people  ready to work with us, the ambassador has added.    After saying the 35 businessmen who accompanied the first  mission had a similar reaction, Dufour said all of this  contributes to a positive evolution of the negotiations.    He said the French Government has guaranteed a $120-million  credit by which Cuba can acquire basic products for industries  and food. He added both countries must work at materializing a  profound development of commercial relations and overcoming  financial difficulties.    Dufour has said he favors finding solutions for investing in  Cuba so that Cuba can obtain resources and credits to be  invested in tourism and to improve the economy.    It will be necessary to find solutions via the Bank of Paris  to grant Cuba the credit it needs. Naturally, via efforts from  both sides, we will be able to sort this obstacle, Dufour said  during the interview.    Dufour stressed the importance of Cuba's current relations  with Europe and the place the European Continent occupies in the  country's investments and trade, with France in an outstanding  position, along with Spain, Germany, Italy, the U.K., and the  Netherlands.    We must help Cuba overcome its economic difficulties and  facilitate its full development.</p>

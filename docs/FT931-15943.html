			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Disclosure ruling is needed - Eric Short thinks spouses should have pension information rights / Planning your Pension INVESTMENT in a pension, whether through a personal pension or a company scheme, usually represents the largest and most important savings by individuals. For most people, a pension will provide the bulk of income in retirement. So individuals need to understand the progress of their pension arrangements. They need to know the likely pension provided and the current value of accrued benefits should the arrangement be discontinued or transferred. At one time, employees in company schemes were given little or no information. Now, employers and scheme trustees are legally obliged to provide employees with certain information. The format depends on the type of scheme. There are different requirements for final salary schemes and for money purchase schemes. Disclosure regulations concerning final salary schemes require employers and trustees to provide certain information at an employee's request or to make that information available for inspection. An employee can only seek such information once every 12 months. However, the most convenient means of fulfilling this legal obligation on disclosure is for employers and trustees to provide employees with an annual benefit statement automatically and to provide employees and scheme pensioners with an annual report and accounts. The annual report will include details of scheme income, spending and investments, changes in assets over the year, changes in membership numbers and changes in benefit structure, including details of pension increases. There will also be the annual report of the trustees, and details of the last actuarial valuation of the scheme. However, interesting though the annual report and accounts may be, employees will find their annual benefit statement of far greater value in planning their retirement income. This statement usually shows the employee's salary or earnings, the pensionable salary or earnings if different, the amount of contributions paid over the 12 months, the cash sum and spouse's pension entitlement should the employee die at the time of the statement, the employee's pension from normal retirement age and the spouse's pension - all based on the employee's current pensionable salary. The retirement pension expressed as a percentage of the employee's salary shows whether the company pension, together with the basic state pension, would be sufficient to provide a reasonable income in retirement. If not, then the employee can boost his pension benefits through an AVC (Additional Voluntary Contribution) arrangement. However, there are gaps in the information provided in the benefit statement. The disclosure regulations give trustees the choice of showing either the benefits at normal retirement or the current benefits if the employee ceased being a member of the scheme at the time of the statement, but not both benefits. In the current employment market, with employees moving jobs frequently, employees need to know their current transfer benefits and early retirement benefits as much as they need to know the benefits at normal retirement. They have the right to ask for these benefits from scheme administrators. But many employees are reluctant to ask in case the employer becomes aware of the request and the wrong impression is conveyed to the employer, even though such requests are supposed to be confidential. Some schemes do provide transfer benefits on the benefit statement automatically. But it would be better for both employees and employer if it were obligatory to provide both benefits on transfer and at normal pension age and possibly the minimum benefits at certain early retirement ages. The disclosure requirements for money purchase schemes are different. All that is certain on a money purchase scheme is the value of accumulated benefits to date relating to the employee and essentially that information has to be provided to employees. If the scheme is on a unitised with-profits basis, then the benefit statement would show the contributions paid, the bonus added for the year and the accumulated value, often split into the guaranteed additions and the bonus additions. If the scheme is on a unit-linked basis, then the statement would show the year's contributions, units purchased with those contributions and the total number of units on the employee's account. The unit value(s) at the date of the statement should be shown. The statement should also show the current transfer value of the accumulated fund, whether with-profits or unit-linked, thus showing the penalty that would be applied should the employee wish to transfer the accumulated value to another arrangement. However, OPAS (Occupational Pensions Advisory Service) reports that it has received a number of complaints on transfer values from money purchase schemes where the benefit statement did not show the transfer benefits, in spite of the legal requirement to do so. But, while the benefit statement shows the size of the employee's accumulated fund at present, it gives little idea of what the ultimate benefits are likely to be and whether the pension at retirement will be sufficient. Some schemes do provide employees with an illustration of likely benefits at retirement. But since most money purchase schemes are through life companies, the illustration has to conform with Lautro requirements. The Lautro basis is highly misleading, showing just the accumulated fund at retirement on two rates of interest - the new rates will be 6 per cent and 12 per cent - with no account taken of inflation except to provide an incomprehensible general inflation statement. The employee needs to know the pension secured by the accumulated sum. The annuity invariably used is the highest possible rate - a level annuity on the life of the employee with no spouse's benefit. The Department of Social Security needs to grapple with this defect in providing employees with information on money purchase schemes. But it should also consider disclosure to spouses. Spouses of employees are potential beneficiaries of company pension schemes. Yet the only information to which they are entitled is general details of the scheme, such as that it provides a spouse's pension of a given percentage of the employee's pension. Only when they become beneficiaries on the death of their partner do they become entitled to information. Until then, they rely on their partner keeping them informed. The dangers of such reliance were highlighted by OPAS when it received a complaint from an elderly woman who found her pension stopped on the death of her husband, in spite of assurances from the husband that she would be looked after. OPAS found that the husband had done nothing to provide a spouse's pension despite assurances to his wife. Spouses should be told what their partner's benefits will be. This is the last piece in this series.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "A.K": "Hesse Interior Minister Announces His </F> Resignation"]    [Excerpt] Hesse Interior Minister Guenther has  unexpectedly announced his resignation. The 65 year-old Social  Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] politician gave cardiac  disease as the reason for his decision. His doctors advised him  to urgently abandon his original intention of remaining in  office until the end of the present election period in Spring  1995. Guenther, who comes from northern Hesse, was Hesse's  justice minister between 1974 and 1987, and also interior  minister of Hesse from 1982 to 1984. He was reappointed to this  office in April 1991 after the SPD and Greens defeated the  Christian Democratic Union/Free Democratic Party coalition in  the Landtag elections. [passage omitted]</p>

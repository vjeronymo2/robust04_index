			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jan. 24 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia's  proposal to convene a new international conference to solve the  conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina has received the support of  Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic.    Izetbegovic said: We believe that convening a new  international conference on Bosnia-Herzegovina on a larger basis  and including a larger number of participants would be useful,  especially if it will reaffirm the principles passed at the  London (peace) conference last year.    It was obvious that the last round of talks convened in  Geneva a few days ago had exhausted all possibilities, he told a  press conference here Monday to mark the end of his four-day  working visit to Malaysia.    Earlier, Izetbegovic held a four-eyed meeting with Deputy  Prime Minister Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim. The meeting lasted for  an hour.    The idea to convene the new peace conference was mooted by  Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed in his address when opening  the two-day international conference of parliamentarians on  Bosnia-Herzegovina on Saturday.    The 10 parliamentarians from more than 30 countries, who  attended the international conference of parliamentarians on  Bosnia-Herzegovina, also called for fresh peace initiatives,  including the convening of a new international conference,  citing the non-accountability of the present mediators in the  on-going peace negotiations to the United Nations.    Asked if the other two warring factions -- Serbs and Croats  -- would agree to such a conference, Izetbegovic said: I cannot  be sure about the attitude of the other sides.    He reiterated, however, that the conflict and violence in  the  former Yugoslav republic could not be solved through resolutions  and appeals.    There is no case in history in which any violence and force  was stopped by resolutions or an appeal no matter how good the  resolution was, he said through his daughter, Sabina, who acted  as interpreter.    Izetbegovic said he would attend the next round of peace  talks in Geneva scheduled for Feb. 10.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following review of the 5 April  issue of Cairo 'AQIDATI summarizes articles that are Islamic in  nature.  <H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>   1. Awqaf Minister Praised for Confronting Extremism    2. Secularists' Criticism of Religious Practices Refuted    3. Religious Seminar Stresses Adherence to Religion    4. Al-Azhar Mufti Explains Position on Progeny Cloning    5. Turkish Islamic Party's Strong Showing in Election  Viewed  <H5>  AWQAF MINISTER PRAISED FOR CONFRONTING EXTREMISM </H5>   In a 400-word article on page one, Samir Rajab, the  newspaper's board chairman, praises the religious seminars  organized by the Awqaf Ministry throughout Egypt to explain true  Islam and protect the youth from extremist ideas. He says the  Awqaf minister, through those seminars, took action "when minds  were ready to receive that bad extremist thought." When the  minister found that there was no point in dealing with the  extremists themselves, he instructed that the broad bases in  schools, universities, and factories be addressed. "The results  were very promising. Honestly, without that effort many would  have fallen in the quagmire, far more than those who are  pointing their guns at the chests of our sons and daughters,  desecrating our women, and indiscriminately destroying private  and public property."  <H5>  SECULARISTS' CRITICISM OF RELIGIOUS PRACTICES REFUTED </H5>   An approximately 2,000-word article by al-Azhar professor  Dr.  'Abd-al-Jawad Sabir Isma'il on page six essentially reacts to an  article entitled, "Who Is the Apostate?" which Isma'il says he  read in some newspaper. Isma'il, who does not identify the  newspaper or the writer, begins by stating that one of the  "bizarre phenomena" these days is that some writers who know  nothing about Islam are writing in newspapers about religious  issues, making mistakes and telling lies, and trying to harm  Islamic clerics and level false accusations against them.    Commenting on a claim in the article that religious sermons  and preaching recorded by some ulema on audio cassettes contain  material that is almost destructive to the country, Isma'il  says: "Those ulema, in fact, were the reason for a religious  and national awakening that is no secret to anyone. The  destruction feared by the writer of that article will only be  the destruction of corruption, treason, agentry, and apostasy."  Isma'il adds: "Had the writer of that article been fair, he  would have drawn the reader's attention to another area where  cassettes are used: to promote vice and eliminate ethics and  virtue. But this is not in the interest of the secular  approach, which defends everything Western, even vice."    The author also refutes claims that there is an attempt "to  establish Islamic priesthood" in Egypt. He says this is a big  lie because Islam eliminated priesthood as it did idols.  "Muslim ulema receive the credit for their knowledge, and we  have never known in history, or in this contemporary age, a  scholar who so sanctified himself or who people held as holy."  He says this fact was understood by the orientals, who called  those specializing in religion and its sciences ulema.    Isma'il also defends Shaykh al-Ghazali, whom the writer of  the article allegedly tried to discredit, saying that he rejects  the implementation of shari'ah. Preparing individuals and  groups for shari'ah rule, says Isma'il, does not mean rejecting  the implementation of shari'ah.    --A 200-word article by Ibrahim Nasr on page 23 says linking  Islam and extremism is no longer justified after the confessions  of repentant terrorist 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi on television. The  writer says: "It is very regrettable that some tendentious  people who hate Islam are trying to fish in troubled waters and  use the confessions as a pretext to foolishly confuse right and  wrong, good and bad, and to harm any religious trend." The  writer notes that one of the things that made the terrorist  repent was a book he read for imam al-Ghazali. He says Egypt is  full of sincere and renowned ulema, but they are all viewed by  the "tendentious" ones as terrorists. The writer addresses those  tendentious ones: "Die in your fury, Egypt will remain Islamic.  Islam is its official religion, Islamic shari'ah is its main  source of legislation, and holy al-Azhar will continue to stand  as fast as towering mountains against both the extremists and  the deviants alike."   <H5>    RELIGIOUS SEMINAR STRESSES ADHERENCE TO RELIGION </H5>   An approximately 1,500-word report on page four gives an  account of a religious seminar organized by the newspaper in a  Cairo mosque. Men of religion answer questions posed by the  audience on religious and civil matters, such as marriage,  mosques, prayers, and family affairs. Speakers reportedly  stress the role of the mosque in Islamic education and maintain  that "religion is the spirit of this people, the source of their  power, and the basis of their unity. Without adhering to our  religion and acting accordingly, we cannot solve our problems."  <H5>  AL-AZHAR MUFTI EXPLAINS POSITION ON PROGENY CLONING </H5>   A 1,500-word report by Amal Hasan on page 14 cites Shaykh  'Atiyah Saqr, head of al-Azhar's Fatwa [religious ruling]  Committee, as saying that Islam is a religion of science. He  encourages scientific research as long as it observes three  conditions: legitimate purpose, legitimate means, and belief  that things can only happen under God's order and will. He  tells a medical seminar that "cloning, if meant to improve the  selection of the species and treat some kinds of infertility,  and the use of genetic engineering to treat cancer and some  hereditary diseases, are no problem." He adds: "If cloning is  aimed at producing males instead of females, or females instead  of males, or at forming human progenies as needed, then it is a  major mistake."  <H5>  TURKISH ISLAMIC PARTY'S STRONG SHOWING IN ELECTION VIEWED </H5>   Page 21 contains an 800-word comment by Ashraf Abu-al-Hawl  on  the results of the Turkish municipal election in which the  Islamic Welfare Party made a strong showing. The writer notes  Western anxiety over the results of the election. Although the  Welfare Party is not a fundamentalist Islamic party in the sense  we know it in Egypt, he writes, "The enemies of Islam, both in  Turkey and abroad, rushed to attack it fiercely and to belittle  its achievement. Indeed, they implicitly called for outlawing  the party under the pretext of fear for freedoms and the  democratic achievements of the secular state." The writer  maintains that Turks "began to feel that the current Turkish  crisis is caused by the enemies of Islam, who divided the Turks  on nationalist grounds, tried to isolate Turkey from its  historical Islamic roots, and promoted the idea of European  Turkey."</p>

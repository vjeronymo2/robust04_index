			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY'S 'ESSENCE' CAPTURED ON PAPER  </P> <P> Long Beach is abandoning its old logo, a drawing of City Hall, for a slicker  image of rolling waves and skyscrapers. The design was chosen from 137 entries  in a logo contest, and the winner, Paul Showalter Design of San Gabriel, will  receive $5,000.  </P> <P> Mayor Ernie Kell said the logo captures the "essence of Long Beach. It depicts  the meeting of an important urban center with the ocean."  </P> <P> The new logo will be used on city publications, stationery and signs.  </P></p>

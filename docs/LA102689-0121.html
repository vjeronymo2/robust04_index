			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAY AREA QUAKE;  </P> <P> CALTRANS TO INSPECT BRIDGES AND OVERPASSES IN L.A. AREA  </P> <P> California Department of Transportation officials announced Wednesday that they  are organizing two teams of engineers to assess the seismic safety of  overpasses and bridges in the Los Angeles area, including the Harbor Freeway  transitway now in the early stages of construction.  </P> <P> James E. Roberts, chief of Caltrans' structure division, said one team will  concentrate on new construction in the Los Angeles area. He said the second  team will review the design plans on older structures bearing a similarity to  the mile-long section of the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland that collapsed in last  week's earthquake.  </P> <P> Of prime concern to the engineers, Roberts said, will be the double-decked  portions of the Interstate 10 approaches to the Los Angeles River bridge near  downtown and a two-mile section of the Harbor Freeway transitway that will be  elevated.  </P> <P> Although state engineers say they are still looking at possible causes of the  Nimitz collapse, its failure has forced them to focus new attention on  double-decked, multicolumned freeways. Several University of California  engineers have said that joints in the Nimitz columns gave way, causing support  columns to fail and the upper deck of the freeway to collapse on the lower  deck, killing at least 39 people.  </P> <P> Roberts insisted repeatedly that officials believe that Los Angeles bridges and  overpasses would not collapse in an earthquake but added that they wanted to  conduct the additional inspections to allay any fears local residents may have.  </P> <P> "There's a concern obviously in Los Angeles, and so they've asked us to come  down and reassure them and that's what we intend to do," he said. "We know we  have to build peoples' confidence again."  </P> <P> Caltrans Regional Director Jerry Baxter told the Los Angeles City Council  Tuesday that he had asked that experts be appointed to inspect the Harbor  Freeway construction for seismic safety in light of the collapse of the Nimitz  Freeway.  </P> <P> Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago said a team of eight engineers will travel to Los  Angeles for on-site inspections of new construction and their design plans. He  said the team will include four Caltrans bridge engineers, with a combined  experience in designing bridges of nearly 100 years, and four private  consulting engineers, with expertise in the fields of seismic research and  structural design.  </P> <P> "They're going to look at the plans for any new structures in the Los Angles  area that involve any sort of an elevated highway," Drago said.  </P> <P> He said the second team will work out of Sacramento reviewing the design plans  of older, existing elevated structures in the Los Angeles area, with particular  emphasis on those that are double-decked and multicolumned.  </P> <P> He said the team will look at structures built before 1971 for any design  features similar to the section of the Nimitz Freeway that failed.  </P> <P> "We're not doing this because we think there's a problem. We're doing this to  be cautious and make sure there isn't a problem," he said.  </P> <P> Roberts said the portions of Interstate 10 at the Los Angeles River will get  attention first because those structures are more like the Nimitz Freeway than  any other in the area.  </P> <P> Even so, he said he believes that there is enough difference in the design of  the two structures to make the Interstate 10 bridges safe in an earthquake. The  Interstate 10 approaches, for example, were built much later than the Nimitz  Freeway and include much more steel and less concrete in their construction.  </P> <P> By the same token, he said, the new Harbor Freeway construction will be built  according to a design that is considered state-of-the-art for seismic safety.  </P> <P> The following Times staff members contributed to earthquake coverage. In  Oakland: Stephanie Chavez, Ashley Dunn, George Ramos and Ronald L. Soble. In  San Francisco: Larry Green, Charisse Jones, Norma Kaufman, Suzette Parmley,  Tracy Wilkinson and Victor F. Zonana. In Santa Cruz: Charles Hillinger. In Los  Angeles: Kristen Christopher, Cathleen Decker, Myrna Oliver and Bob Secter.  </P></p>

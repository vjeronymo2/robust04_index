			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc and Akzo Nobel call off talks Akzo Nobel, the Dutch chemicals group, and France's Rhone-Poulenc said yesterday they were suspending talks on creating a joint venture for the production of soda ash because they could not agree on the ownership of the new company, As part of plans unveiled in late May, Rhone-Poulenc, the world's third-largest soda ash producer, was to have held 67 per cent of the joint venture, with Akzo Nobel owning the rest. In later negotiations, both sides wanted a larger stake, and the gap between the two could not be bridged. However, Akzo Nobel and Rhone-Poulenc held out the possibility that talks might be resumed later because the industrial logic between the partnership in soda ash remained intact. The planned joint venture, originally scheduled to get under way in January, was to have had annual turnover equivalent to Fl 300m (Dollars 175m) and a workforce of more than 600. Rhone-Poulenc was planning to contribute its plant in Nancy, France, while Akzo Nobel was prepared to transfer ownership of its production site in Delfzijl, in the Netherlands.</p>

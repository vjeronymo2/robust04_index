			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["hal"-signed report: "Brighter Prospects for the Economy; </F> Growth of 1.5 Percent Predicted"]    [Text] Bonn, 26 Apr -- The German GDP is expected to grow  by a total of 1.5 percent this year. This has been announced  by the leading economic research institutes in their spring  reports. The researchers expressed limited optimism in their  study. However, changes in the financial and wage policies are  required for a sustained upswing. Thus, the solidarity  surcharge that is to be reintroduced next year should be  gradually abolished again as of 1996. The scientists also  criticized the predominance of certain lines of business in the  market, mentioning the banks explicitly.    Despite the criticism by the institutes, Finance Minister  Theo Waigel (Christian Social Union) believes that his financial  course has clearly been confirmed. His policy has made a major  contribution to the emerging reversal in the economic  development. It is now important to continue the course of  consolidation that has been initiated. The economic spokesman  of the Bundestag group of the Free Democratic Party of Germany,  Graf Lambsdorff, stated that it is particularly striking that  the report is calling for tax reductions as a condition for a  dynamic economic development. The economic and financial  spokesman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, Lafontaine,  interpreted the report by the economic experts as a confirmation  for his party's call for a surcharge on income tax. The German  Trade Union Federation called on the government to introduce an  investment grant and to carry out planned public investments  earlier. In this way, the government could make an independent  contribution to an economic upswing. It should not solely rely  on a recovery of the world economy. The German Employees' Union  accused the institutes of ignoring the dramatic situation in the  labor market. The employers, however, support the institutes'  view that the machine times must be extended. In fact the  bargaining autonomy has proven itself in a difficult economic  situation, but a wage policy continues to be required that takes  into consideration the considerable lack of jobs, the National  Union of German Employer Associations stressed. The Federation  of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHT) endorsed the  view of the experts that only a moderate economic recovery can  be expected for the time being. The politicians responsible for  economic policy must realize that support from the finance and  tax policies is urgently required. In this spirit, the DIHT  backs the demand for the gradual abolition of the solidarity  surcharge. The National Association of German Banks expressed  surprise over the institutes' assertion that the high profits in  the banking industry are a sign of a lack of competition. This  creates once more the impression that the profits of the credit  institutions are made at the expense of other lines of business.  This prevailing prejudice does not become justified through  constant repetition, it stressed.</p>

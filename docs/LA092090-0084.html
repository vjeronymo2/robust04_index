			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIREHOUSE SOLD FOR $502,000  </P> <P> A Corona del Mar man bid $502,000 last week to buy the 66-year-old Fire Station  56 in Silver Lake from the city of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Buddy King, who owns a recording studio near the vacated station at 2838 Rowena  Ave., said he plans to add to the building and use it for office space.  </P> <P> In an auction last Friday at City Hall, King outlasted two other bidders who  pushed the price well above the required minimum of $274,500.  </P> <P> Before he can move in, King will be required to make the 1924 structure satisfy  earthquake safety standards, and may have to remove asbestos and a 1,000-gallon  underground gas tank.  </P> <P> Any substantial changes in the appearance of the bungalow-style fire station  would have to be approved by the city's Cultural Heritage Commission, which  declared it a historic landmark in 1988.  </P> <P> The station was abandoned in February, 1989, when the Fire Department opened  its new Station 56 a few blocks away -- at Rowena Avenue and Glendale  Boulevard.  </P> <P> The real estate division of the city's Bureau of Engineering put the station up  for sale after determining that no other city department wanted the property.  </P> <P> Proceeds from the sale will be added to a fund that is to pay for the  replacement of 16 fire stations deemed to be seismically unsafe.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> 'WANNA-BE BIRDS' ARE BACK  </P> <P> Stand back, voters! Here come the "wanna-be birds" again. Like swallows  returning to Capistrano, these birds appear regularly, but only at election  time.  </P> <P> With loud crowing and squawking, they promise to cure all of our many problems,  be they fiscal, social, foreign, domestic or imaginary. Wanna-be birds are  especially adept at curing imaginary problems.  </P> <P> Forget that these birds have done nothing of much importance to date. Just give  them a chance and they will solve the world.  </P> <P> Are you willing to risk your vote on any of these ambitious pretenders?  </P> <P> I'll wait patiently until these birds have finished their puffing and  posturing. Then I'll vote for the competent, dedicated and proven legislators  we have in this area.  </P> <P> Congressman Elton Gallegly in the 21st Congressional District is such a  legislator. Or if you are in the 19th Congressional District, Congressman Bob  Lagomarsino is also an outstanding representative. Assemblyman Tom McClintock  in the 36th Assembly District is another fine legislator.  </P> <P> They don't puff and strut and crow. They are much too busy just doing  outstanding jobs, representing the people of Ventura County.  </P> <P> MARY E. BAALAS  </P> <P> Camarillo  </P></p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei recovers to clear 21,000 again Tokyo CONTINUED HOPES of an early cut in the discount rate to stimulate the economy, and an overnight rally on Wall Street encouraged dealers to buy equities, and the Nikkei average recovered to the 21,000 level for the first time in four trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The average rose 519.89 to the day's high of 21,291.81, a gain of 2 per cent on the week. It opened at the day's low of 20,849.98, but later rose on arbitrage-related buying and bargain-hunting. Volume remained unchanged at 200m shares. Gainers led losers by 807 to 188 with 133 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks advanced 28.25 to 1,551.66 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.82 to 1,188.88. Traders noted a lack of sellers, such as investment trusts which have been selling heavily recently to meet redemptions. Market participants, heartened by the record low money supply growth announced on Thursday, found additional support in the central bank's confirmation of its commitment towards a stronger yen. Short-term interest rates fell on expectations of an easing in credit policy. Hopes that the government will announce fiscal measures to activate the slowing economy lifted stocks likely to benefit from higher public spending. Budget deliberations resumed this week after a two-week suspension due to a dispute between the ruling party and opposition over a bribery scandal. Housing stocks firmed, with Sumitomo Forestry adding Y40 to Y1,730, and Daiwa House Industry advancing Y20 to Y1,840. Interest rate-sensitive large capital issues were also higher. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, rose Y5 to Y352 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries advanced Y6 to Y634. Bargain-hunting lifted high-technology issues which have been sold heavily following downward revisions in earnings forecasts. Toshiba rose Y14 to Y610 and TDK added Y100 to Y4,140. The Tokyo Stock Exchange said yesterday that individual investors turned net buyers of stocks last week for the first time in 44 weeks. Individuals bought a net Y20.4bn in Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya. Foreign investors remained net buyers, while institutions, including insurers, banks and investment trusts stayed net sellers. Corporate selling shrank from Y24.6bn to Y2.6bn. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 218.19 to 22,679.16 in volume of 65.4m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, added Y200 to Y10,900 on bargain-hunting. Roundup WALL STREET's overnight gains had a relative muted effect on the region. HONG KONG reversed a mid-week decline with the Hang Seng index 20.47 higher at 4,736.47, still 0.8 per cent lower on the week, as turnover rose from HKDollars 1.87bn to HKDollars 2.13bn. The index opened strongly on the back of Wall Street with a rise of more than 40 points, but profit-taking soon took over the initiative. NEW ZEALAND moved in similar fashion, the NZSE 40 index closing 9.97 higher at 1,499.69 after a 19-point rise in the early morning. JAKARTA halted a week-long fall in the official index, up 3.50 to 279.89 in half-day trading. MANILA reflected the gains of Philippine Long Distance Telephone (PLDT) in New York, the composite index ending 16.72 higher at 1,156.08, down 3.8 per cent on the week. PLDT rose 35 pesos to 870. AUSTRALIA, however, got no Wall Street kick from News Corp, which dropped 58 cents to ADollars 17.60 after a large gain last week. The market ended lower on mixed economic data, the All Ordinaries index easing 1.5 to 1,621.5, 0.2 per cent higher on the week. TAIWAN's weighted index fell 44.95 to 4950.37 following a rise of 155.90 on Thursday. It fell 0.5 per cent on the week. SINGAPORE bounced back from profit-taking, the Straits Times Industrial index closing 5.78 better at 1,519.05. SEOUL's composite index was up 0.25 to 632.91, 3.9 per cent lower on the week.</p>

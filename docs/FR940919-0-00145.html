			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service has reviewed carefully the assertion that the crustaceans are found in non-vernal pool habitat. A number of the sites that served as the basis for this belief have been examined by Service biologists and were found to represent degraded vernal pool habitat or, in one case, an ephemeral wetland located in a gravel pit that likely was colonized by fairy shrimp washed in from adjacent vernal pools during periods of high rainfall. Based on the best information available, the Service believes that a significant portion of these records most likely represent ``unusual'' vernal pools (e.g., rock depression pools) or vernal pool habitat that was incorrectly identified. Some of these records, such as roadside ditches, scraped areas, and airport runoff ditches almost certainly represent remnant vernal pool habitat or are part of the swale systems connected to vernal pools. Lack of experience or familiarity with vernal pool ecosystems likely has led some respondents to misinterpret these observations. Most of these disturbed habitats also are imperiled by urban development, gravel mining, and, in the cases of roadside ditches, grading and spraying of herbicides for highway maintenance. In addition, the accurate identification of fairy shrimp is extremely difficult because the morphological characters required to differentiate the various species are often extremely subtle and can be misinterpreted by biologists not specifically trained in fairy shrimp identification. Widespread, common species, such as Lindahl's fairy shrimp, can be mistaken for other fairy shrimp species. Some of the records of the California linderiella and vernal pool fairy shrimp in non-vernal pool habitats may result from such misidentifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The potential for a fairy shrimp population to persist after habitat disturbance varies from case to case, depending upon specific circumstances, such as the nature and intensity of disturbance, how much of the original egg bank was destroyed, and other factors. With the exception of a few extremely rare cases, plowed fields that historically held vernal pool habitat do not support populations of these species. The example provided by the commenter is not typical of agricultural operations, as is pointed out in the commenter's statement that this site was ``unlike other properties in the <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> area .&blank;.&blank;.'' (B. Sugnet,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> in litt. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> , 1992), with respect to the degree of disturbance (i.e., leveling) and adverse modification of the vernal pool habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 28:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many respondents contended that the proposed rule did not reflect accurately the success of vernal pool ``creation'' efforts. For example, a number of commenters claimed that artificial vernal pools, primarily in Sacramento and Placer Counties, cited in Sugnet and Associates (1992), were successful and were adequate mitigation for adverse impacts to vernal pools resulting from urban development. Other commenters asserted that ongoing creation ratios of 2:1 or greater and the ability to transplant these animals makes it likely that the habitat for these species will increase over time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter stated that the ability to successfully transplant the eggs of fairy shrimp and tadpole shrimp is well known. One submitted report (Sugnet and Associates 1992) asserted that the four fairy shrimp and vernal pool tadpole shrimp have been shown in the ``literature and in field sampling to be extremely hardy and capable of surviving long-term in greatly disturbed conditions and artificial habitats''. The report also stated that there are technical papers that demonstrate the ability to rear shrimp in the laboratory. The party submitting this report stated that they have been creating vernal pools as mitigation for development projects and monitoring the fairy shrimp and tadpole shrimp for the past three years from 1989 to 1992. They stated that although the presence of adult fairy shrimp may be due to a certain number of eggs continuing to hatch from the initial inoculum in successive years due to differences in physiochemical parameters, the presence of mating individuals and gravid female fairy shrimp in artificial pools, as well as historically degraded habitat, leads them to conclude that natural reproductive mechanisms are still at work. The report stated that the California linderiella and the vernal pool fairy shrimp can be transplanted successfully from one vernal pool location to another. The supporting data and criteria by which success was determined were not specified in the report. Based partly on the above information, numerous commenters stated that the fairy shrimp and vernal pool tadpole shrimp were not imperiled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

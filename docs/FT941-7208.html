			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: AGF to take control of Spanish insurer Assurances Generales de France, the French state-owned insurance group, has reached agreement to take majority control of loss-making Spanish insurer La Union y El Fenix. The deal announced yesterday with Banesto, the beleaguered bank for which a rescue plan is being drawn up under the auspices of the Bank of Spain, came after about 10 months of negotiations. The French group will take over Banesto's majority share of a joint holding company which in turn owns 52 per cent of the insurer. The agreement is regarded as an important strategic move for AGF, which has been seeking to expand its presence in the Spanish market. It also removes an element of uncertainty ahead of the group's planned privatisation later this year. Under the provisional agreement, shareholders in El Fenix and AGF Seguros, the French group's Spanish offshoot, will be asked to approve a merger through the exchange of one AGF Seguros share for seven El Fenix shares. The nominal value of AGF shares will be reduced before the operation from Pta5,000 to Pta500, the same as El Fenix's. These terms differ markedly from an original plan drawn up last year which envisaged a three-for-one share swap.</p>

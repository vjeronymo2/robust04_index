			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> FRED STRICKLAND, A MAN OF MANY POSITIONS  </P> <P> From the football laboratories of Anaheim, where the Rams once cooked up the  Eagle defense, now emerges the prototype football player of the 1990s.  </P> <P> The Rams are calling him Fred Strickland. Other teams around the league will  use different names.  </P> <P> This modern-day gladiator can rush the passer as a defensive tackle on one play  and drop into pass coverage the next.  </P> <P> Has the game evolved? Imagine Merlin Olsen covering Gale Sayers out of the  backfield.  </P> <P> The Rams drew up their unique five-linebacker Eagle scheme before the 1988  season, in part as reaction to National Football League offenses that seemed  intent on turning football into a game of finesse and foot races.  </P> <P> "All these offenses with all these open formations are causing you to have to  defend the whole field," Ram defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur explained.  "The more guys you can put on the field who can run, the better off you are."  </P> <P> Bigger and faster players on offense demanded bigger and faster players on  defense.  </P> <P> In the context of the new defense, he threw the compiled data into a computer  and it spat out Fred Strickland's name. What exactly is a Strickland? Certainly  not an Edsel. He was the Rams' second-round choice from Purdue in 1988. He  played middle linebacker in college and is cat-quick and strong at 6-feet-2 and  250 pounds.  </P> <P> With the Eagle, the Rams had already invented a new position called the  nose-backer, a player who roams the defensive line as a linebacker or lines up  directly over the opponent's center.  </P> <P> Mark Jerue was the original nose-backer, but after his knees gave out late last  season, the Rams moved rookie Strickland into the position. And he has taken  the job to another level.  </P> <P> Before undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery Aug. 8, Strickland was playing a  different position in every defensive formation. He'll resume that role once  his knee gets a bit stronger. Strickland returned to the lineup last week  against Indianapolis in a limited role.  </P> <P> What exactly does he do?  </P> <P> In the Rams' regular 3-4 defense, he's a starting inside linebacker. In the  Eagle, he moves to nose-backer. In the team's "nickel" or pass defense,  Strickland plays down in the trenches as a defensive tackle.  </P> <P> "You hear every day how the players are getting bigger and stronger and  faster," Strickland said. "And I think with this defense, you can actually see  that. It's no longer just because a person weighs this much and is this high or  this fast he's just going to play that position. Chicago came up with it first,  when they had Refrigerator (William Perry) playing at fullback. He ran pass  patterns, and caught a touchdown pass. That started a new era, with them  saying, not just big guys are made for the line, and not just small guys are  made to just play linebacker."  </P> <P> The game, of course, has been evolving all along. For years, Lawrence Taylor of  the New York Giants has been darting and blitzing like a defensive end from his  outside linebacker position, prompting other teams to follow suit. The Rams  used the mold to form Kevin Greene.  </P> <P> But playing an active linebacker such as Strickland at defensive tackle was a  new wrinkle that raised a few eyebrows around the league.  </P> <P> "I think it was a surprise to people that you could play Strickland in the line  and have him do well," Coach John Robinson said. "When we were talking about it  in the spring, people were laughing at us. They said, 'You can't do that.' "  </P> <P> Well, yes they could. And Strickland hopes to become a roving menace that  opponents can't ignore.  </P> <P> "You're looked at a lot more," Strickland said. " 'Is he going to stay here? Is  he going to drop? Is he going to blitz?' Staying in one spot, that gets boring  after a while. You're standing there, and it's 'OK, I line up right here, I  read this guy, and that's it.' With this, I can stand up over the center, I  don't have to get in a three-point stance. I like it. It makes them aware."  </P> <P> Strickland said he actually lobbied to play defensive tackle.  </P> <P> "I said I wanted to rush, I didn't care where," Strickland said.  </P> <P> There were adjustments, of course. "At first I thought it would be easy,"  Strickland said. "I thought my speed was going to help me, that I was just  going to get by them. But when I started playing over a guard, it was a lot  harder, because speed didn't help there. I had nowhere to run. I was getting  bounced back and forth."  </P> <P> The answer for Strickland was putting on weight. He has added about 15 pounds  and now weighs about 255. "And I'm still running well, and dropping into  coverages fine," he said. "And my pass rush has not slowed down at all."  </P> <P> So the next time you see Strickland following Roger Craig out of the backfield  on a pass pattern, think of Olsen chasing Sayers. And take another good, long  look at the Fred Strickland model. Soon, everybody in the league is going to  have one.  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> The team considered putting linebacker Larry Kelm on injured reserve Thursday  but decided against it. Kelm, expected to start the season at inside  linebacker, will miss his fifth consecutive game this week because of the foot  injury suffered in the Phoenix exhibition game on Aug. 21.Tight end Vernon  Kirk, who was on the non-football injury list, was released. Kirk tested  positive for steroid use on Aug. 29, but was never expected to make the final  roster. . . . Cornerback LeRoy Irvin, suspended Aug. 29 for violating the  league's substance-abuse policy, will return to practice Monday. . . . The Rams  fell 14,835 tickets shy of selling out Sunday's game and lifting the local  blackout.  </P></p>

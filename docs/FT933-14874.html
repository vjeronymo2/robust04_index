			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Institutions bullish on outlook for UK equities A LARGE majority of institutional investors are more positive on UK equities over the next 12 months than on any other market, according to a survey published today. The monthly Smith New Court/Gallup poll of fund managers found 84 per cent were bullish over the outlook for UK equities compared with 67 per cent for Japan, 55 per cent for continental Europe and only 9 per cent for the US. The finding reinforces other recent reports and comes on top of a gathering momentum for a reduction in domestic interest rates. The London stock market firmed on Friday as rumours of an imminent cut were boosted by four of the City's leading broking firms' reducing their year-end forecasts. BZW, James Capel and SG Warburg moved from 6 to 5 per cent, with SG Strauss Turnbull also trimming its figures. However, market strategists did strike one note of caution last week as suspicions grew that some of the big institutions were beginning to move funds out of London and into Germany in anticipation of a cut in German rates as part of a support package for the Franc. However, many fund managers remain nervous about the pace of recovery in the UK economy, with only 17 per cent of respondents believing the general economic situation would improve over the next 12 months, down from 24 per cent in June and 35 per cent in May.</p>

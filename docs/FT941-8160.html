			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / OFT to investigate safeguards in pre-payment of funerals schemes The Office of Fair Trading launched an investigation yesterday into Britain's growing pre-paid funeral business. The inquiry follows the collapse last month of a Yorkshire-based company running a pre-payment scheme and comes amid concern about the lack of regulation of a business that could attract billions of pounds. In the US, one funeral in seven is pre-paid, and pre-payment schemes have won up to 40 per cent of the market in some states. Pre-paid schemes currently account for 3 per cent of the Pounds 70m-a-year funeral business in the UK. The OFT estimates 100,000 plans have been sold and expects the market to expand to 150,000 a year. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said the financial implications of the growth of pre-paid funerals were considerable. If 25 per cent of the UK's 20 million people over the age of 50 eventually bought plans worth about Pounds 1,000 each, the funeral companies' funds would be holding Pounds 5bn. These funds would not be regulated or safeguarded, he said. Proper arrangements were needed to cover the appointment and powers of trustees and the deployment of returns from investing pre-payments. The funds should be kept separately from shareholders' funds. It was also important to ensure that elderly and vulnerable people were not sold over-elaborate schemes they could not afford, and that plans purchased decades before a person's death were honoured or a refund paid to the person's estate, Sir Bryan said. The four main companies providing pre-paid funeral schemes - market leader Chosen Heritage, Dignity, Golden Charter and CWS, the Co-operative Wholesale Society - offer a variety of plans ranging in cost from about Pounds 750 to more than Pounds 5,000. The average cost is Pounds 850 to Pounds 1,200. The companies believe they already provide many of the safeguards the OFT is looking for through two voluntary regulatory bodies. Dignity and Chosen Heritage are members of the National Association of Pre-Paid Funeral Plans, and Golden Charter and CWS co-founded the Funeral Planning Council. Both bodies are working on codes of practice covering pre-paid schemes and demand that member companies hold pre-paid funeral fees in independent trust funds with separate custodian trustees.

			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Hurd says European tide has turned CONSERVATIVES edged towards unity on Europe yesterday, as Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, spelt out the common ground within the party, and Lord Tebbit, a former Tory chairman, welcomed the government's recent shift towards a more Euro-sceptic position. Mr Hurd told the conference that the tide of European opinion had turned, and that the EC's future work would be directed towards the agenda put forward by the UK government: a wider, more competitive Community, based on free trade and co-operation. Speaking after a debate that was curiously tame, given the passions Europe has aroused over the past year, Mr Hurd underlined the importance of winning more Conservative seats in the European elections next June. Most people, he said, looked to the Conservatives to fight for Britain's interest in Europe. 'No other party is going to do that job. We have to do it. In all senses of the word we are right in Europe,' he said. Paying tribute to the European vision of the 1950s, and expressing understanding that in the aftermath of the two world wars a strong role for the nation states was not seen as inevitable, Mr Hurd said the aim of preventing another western European war did not mean centralised decision making in Brussels. 'It does not follow that the nation states should wither away, that would be unnatural . . .History is against it and the peoples of Europe do not want it'. Despite the outbreak of unity, Lord Tebbit's remarks to a fringe meeting organised by the Thatcherite Conservative Way Forward remained barbed, as he said it would have been better if Mr John Major's conversion had occurred earlier. 'How much easier it would have been if Mr Major had worn those sceptics' clothes at Maastricht,' he said. Lord Tebbit rejected suggestions the party leadership had secured a truce with the rebels, insisting that the right of the party had not altered its stance. 'I think the Euro-sceptics have been proved right,' he said. 'I think there will continue to be arguments but I welcome the switch (the leadership) has made.' Adopting a conciliatory tone, he said Mr Major's recent Economist article setting out his vision of Europe was 'good', although he would have liked it to take a stronger line on some issues. But he also served notice that Conservative candidates in next year's European parliamentary elections could not necessarily count on his support.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Our country's Foreign Ministry has issued a  statement in the wake of the bestial attacks launched by the  Serbs against the Muslim-inhabited town of Gorazde and the  accompanying silence of the international forums. The statement  criticizes the United Nations for holding back from forcing the  Serbs to abide by the international regulations and accuses the  United Nations of playing a part in the crimes committed by the  Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The statement says: Iran considers the United Nation's  inability to carry out its duties as unjustifiable and once  again calls on that organization's secretary general to accept  the Islamic countries' proposal to dispatch troops to Bosnia and  attempt to lift the arms embargo against that country's  defenseless people, thus preventing the continuation of Serbian  crimes in Bosnia.</p>

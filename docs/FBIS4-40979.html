			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Vladimir Solntsev] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 21 Jun -- The Foreign Intelligence Service  of the Russian Federation is closely monitoring the situation  regarding the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula and this  monitoring is being done, among other things, in collaboration  with representatives of Western special services, experts of the  Foreign Intelligence Service told the ITAR-TASS correspondent  today.    Replying to a question about the possible emergence of a new  armed conflict on the Korean peninsula just over four decades  since the end of the Korean war, the Russian special service  experts said: For the time being, according to our estimates,  neither side wants a conflict. The specialists said that so far  they cannot see that either side has a clear and firm policy  toward casting the world into global conflict.    The experts of the Foreign Intelligence Service  categorically  denied speculation that the former Soviet Union virtually  assisted North Korea [DPRK] to create a nuclear bomb, stressing  that cooperation between the USSR and DPRK in the nuclear field  had been carried out for exclusively peaceful ends and under  international control. In particular some work to train  specialists was carried out. Apart from this, the USSR supplied  fuel assemblies for a civilian research reactor under the  control of the International Atomic Energy Agency.    Commenting on the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula,  informed Russian circles note that in addition to the problem on  the surface, each side has its own political objectives and this  is reflected in the political campaign now under way in the  world.</p>

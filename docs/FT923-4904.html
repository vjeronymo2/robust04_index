			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / World News in Brief: Pan Am lights out: The Pan Am Building, the 59-storey skyscraper which forms an integral part of the Manhattan skyline, is to change identity. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, which owns the building, is to remove the now-defunct airline's name, displayed in 15ft lights, and replace it with 'MetLife', the nation's second biggest insurance company. The insurer said the logo would be replaced over the next few months. People, Page 15</p>

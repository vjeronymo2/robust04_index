			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OIL TANKERS WOULD HAVE TWO ESCORTS UNDER NEW SAFETY PLAN  </P> <P> Loaded oil tankers leaving Alaska will be accompanied by oil spill response  vessels under a plan submitted by the industry Tuesday to meet state demands  for a spill response following the Exxon Valdez disaster.  </P> <P> The new Tanker Spill Prevention and Response Plan for Prince William Sound will  guarantee that spill response vessels and equipment will be ready to respond  immediately to a spill the size of the Exxon Valdez, said Nick Mitchell, a BP  Shipping Co. official who coordinated development of the plan.  </P> <P> The plan, which is expected to cost the oil industry $45 million annually, was  developed for the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., which operates the trans-Alaska  oil pipeline and Valdez terminal for its seven oil company owners.  </P> <P> Alyeska is obligated to mount the initial response to any tanker spill and has  come under attack for its response to the Exxon spill before the company  initiated its own effort.  </P> <P> But while promising to be ready to fight the next spill, Alyeska stopped short  of promising any better results.  </P> <P> "If the question is, can we guarantee that we can pick up an 11-million-gallon  spill, the answer is no, we can't guarantee it," Alyeska spokesman Tom Brennan  said.  </P></p>

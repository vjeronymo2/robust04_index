			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Assisted area map ready for approval THE NEW assisted areas map will be presented for approval to the weekly meeting of the 17 European commissioners in Brussels on Wednesday, the Department of Trade and Industry confirmed yesterday, Chris Tighe writes. The map has been slightly amended since last week's negotiations between Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, and Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner. The government hopes to give details of the map, which is expected to give assisted area status to some parts of southern England, in the Commons on Wednesday. The map has been slightly amended since last week's negotiations between Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, and Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner. It is not yet certain whether discussion of the map will be given priority at the commissioners' meeting on Wednesday, the DTI said, and an announcement might have to be postponed until Thursday, or even the start of the following week just before parliament rises on July 27. The DTI yesterday confirmed that the proportion of the working population covered by the map would be about 35 per cent, less than 1 percentage point below present coverage.</p>

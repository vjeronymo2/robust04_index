			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Leading Article: Finalising Nafta THE CLINTON administration may be right in believing that the new US Congress would throw out a North American Free Trade Agreement without the understandings it is now negotiating on the environment and labour standards. But if it wants a workable agreement, the US should be cautious about how far it pushes these additional conditions. One reason for caution is that such side accords could have significant implications for sovereignty, not only for Mexico but for the US as well. The envisaged procedures would, after all, be usable not only against Mexico, as US lobbies desire, but by Mexicans against the US. Furthermore, the whole point of Nafta is that all the three parties - the US, Canada and Mexico - should gain from the increased economic efficiency created by specialisation. Tough side agreements could so load the dice against Mexican companies that Nafta would become more trouble than it is worth. It would be wrong and self-defeating for the US to burden a developing country with the standards of a highly developed one, themselves rather recently acquired. In addition, dispute resolution procedures must be transparent and speedy. Otherwise, they could simply become a way for aggrieved US businesses to obtain protection. US companies are already all too well practiced at exploiting such mechanisms, anti-dumping procedures being the chief example. If it is to avoid these dangers, the Clinton administration needs to keep reminding itself of Nafta's purpose. True, the main direct beneficiary of Nafta would probably be the Mexican economy, which should enjoy higher investment, more jobs and faster growth. But these gains for Mexico would also bring important benefits to the US. Pollution should be easier to control, for example, as the Mexican economy grows, while Mexican industry would also have less reason to cluster in the contaminated border areas. The differential between US and Mexican wages should fall, thereby slowing the flow of migrants across the border. A more dynamic and outward-looking Mexico would become an increasingly important market for US goods. Not least, the Mexican government would be rewarded for overturning years of animosity towards the US, while the political liberalisation of Mexico would be reinforced. The most powerful economy in the world has little to fear from a free trade agreement with an economy one-twentieth its size. But it has much to gain from a stable and increasingly affluent neighbour to the south. The US may have to negotiate understandings on labour and environment in order to secure support for Nafta. But it must not deprive Mexico - and so itself - of the economic and political fruits of this agreement. The US should forget fair trade theology and remember its interests instead.</p>

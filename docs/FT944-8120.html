			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Beirut property prices soar to sky-high limits: Laws of supply and demand seem to have little effect on rents or prices The price of property in Beirut is one of the most hotly debated subjects in Lebanon today. Since the end of the country's 17-year civil war, the cost of residential and office space in and around the centre of the city has soared to unprecedented levels. Ar the top end of the market, a 500 sq m apartment with a sea-view can be bought for Dollars 1.5m (Pounds 955,000) to Dollars 2m. Unlike similarly priced properties in the prime areas of London, Tokoyo and New York, this includes little in the way of extra facilities. There may be limited car parking space and a porter, but there is no guarantee that street lighting or telephones will work. The surrounding roads and pavements are rarely cleaned, and within short walking distance there are likely to be huge piles of rubble from construction work which is not due to be finished before the year 2000. Even among the wealthy Lebanese returning from abroad, few are willing to pay such prices; the odd buyer tends to be from the Saudi and Kuwaiti super-rich keen to have a second home in an Arab country. As a result, most affluent Lebanese are renting houses in the eastern suburbs or in the surrounding mountains while they wait for the costs of moving into central Beirut to come down. Estate agents estimate that about 30,000 premium apartments, priced from Dollars 300,000 upwards, are empty in Beirut. They are becoming concerned at the prospect of a huge property over-supply at the top end of the market which shows no signs of driving prices down, while housing needs for middle to low-income earners are not being sufficiently catered for. 'There's a real estate crisis here in Lebanon,' explains Mr Antoine Maroun, who heads the real estate division of the largest financial and services group in Beirut, Lebanon Invest. 'There's a clear over-supply in residential housing; prices have reached astronomical figures.' The main factor driving the supply side is the high expectation that Lebanon is on the road to recovery under the guidance of its billionaire prime minister, Mr Rafik Hariri. These have been fuelled by the successful launch of Solidere, the Dollars 1.8bn real estate and property development company which is rebuilding the centre of Beirut, and more recently, by Lebanon's over-subscribed Eurobond issue (its first ever), which last month raised Dollars 400m for the country's reconstruction programme. 'Private property developers are hoping to tap into this new-found confidence. They are rapidly putting up new units to meet a genuinely high demand for quality housing,' Mr Maroun says. The high prices are caused by the method of financing the construction work. Although there are more than 70 commercial banks in the country, long-term credit facilities, especially mortgages, are almost impossible to come by. The banks deal mostly with dollar-denominated, short-term financing for trade and commerce. Most construction projects are self-financed, with little in the way of leverage. 'Because owners are financing their buildings from their own savings, prices are not coming down. They can afford to wait for a buyer. If they were borrowing from banks, the situation would be much different, there would be a crash,' says Mr Henry Tyan, general manager of Banque Nationale de Paris Intercontinentale, one of the top four banks in the country, On the demand side, the absence of a mortgage culture severely restricts the financing abilities of potential buyers. 'Because of the lack of long-term credit facilities, people can either afford to buy property outright or are forced to pay short-term interest rates on a long-term loan, which is not very efficient,' Mr Riad Salameh, central bank governor, explains. In an attempt to tackle this problem, the government has restructured the Housing Bank by reducing its stake to 20 per cent and selling the rest to a group of commercial banks. At the end of this month, Mr Salameh says that funds of Dollars 100m from Arab and international donors will be available from the bank in the form of competitively priced, long-term mortgages to small-property seekers. Estates agents in Beirut have welcomed this move but say it will still exclude those who wish to have a mortgage of over Dollars 100,000 and, more critically, low-income and poor people. In the teeming suburbs of southern Beirut, for instance, where hundreds of thousands of people live in squalid, over-crowded conditions, there is a huge shortage of proper housing. With high unemployment and an average income of less than Dollars 150 per month, they have little hope in paying rents, let alone becoming property owners. Many families continue to squat in disused and damaged buildings while they wait for the government's reconstruction programme to reach them. A six-year, Dollars 280m plan has been drawn up to rehabilitate the area, including Dollars 100m-worth of funds from the Eurobond issue. Meanwhile, the fundamentalist group Hizbollah has capitalised on the situation by providing a basic welfare system in the form of schools, hospitals, essential supplies and some low-cost housing. Some Lebanese explain the cruel distortions in the property market as inevitable in a country recovering from a long and devastating civil war. Mr Maroun partly blames the problem on a lack of information on the market. 'We need to develop a data base to put some discipline into the market. The lack of good information is inhibiting its development,' he says. Until then, the Lebanese will have to live with the fact that too many luxurious apartments are sitting idle while hundreds of thousands of victims of the war are still desperate for a secure roof over their heads.</p>

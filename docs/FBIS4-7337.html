			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 25 (KNS-KCNA) -- The overseas  headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's  Reunification (Pomminnyon), an organisation of civil  reunification movement, published a statement Monday denouncing  the South Korean rulers for blocking Koreans overseas from  participating in the memorial service on the one hundredth day  after the death of Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, a patriotic fighter for  reunification.    The statement says:    "The South side's authorities, still antagonizing  Pomminnyon,  barred its delegation from participating in the function. This  was an insult to the pure heart of condolence of overseas  Koreans and an unjust act going against the desire of the 70  million fellow countrymen for reunification.    "Today when the United States and other foreign forces are  deliberately increasing the military tension on the Korean  peninsula, it is of great significance in hastening national  reunification for delegates in the North, South and overseas to  gather in one place to honor the memory of Rev. Mun Ik-hwan who  passed away while devotedly working for the independence of the  nation and great unity.    "The overseas headquarters of Pomminnyon urges the South  side's authorities to renounce their hostile policy toward  Pomminnyon and make efforts to accomplish the cause of  reunification together with us."</p>

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / This Week: Film/Video What should we do to film distributors for Christmas? Is there anything punitive enough? Possessed of the spirit of Scrooge, they are introducing just one film in the week before Christmas - a US offering about little-league ice hockey that is a second visit to a story which was silly enough the first time. D2: The Mighty Ducks (the sequel) will lure no one from their turkey, even though it is one. If you want a treat this week, you must choose among films already on release. The Nightmare Before Christmas remains the top ticket. Nanni Moretti's Dear Diary is still the sweetest auteur comedy since early Woody Allen. And The Adventures Of Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert is a high-camp charmer from Down Under. As for last week's Princess Caraboo, (above) it is almost funny enough to be considered. Kevin Kline steals the show as a Greek butler, though the show is erratic. Plot: is the vagrant girl played by Phoebe Cates (Mrs Kline) really an Indonesian princess? If not, how silly will the 19th century Brits and aristos who adopt her feel, having feted her, festooned her in fashionable dresses and all but fed her to the Prince Regent (John Sessions). Witty; could be wittier; worth seeing on a rainy day. Meanwhile, Macaulay Culkin maniacs have the boy times two. He is dull in The Pagemaster but he is a treat - childhood idiocy made radiant - in The Nutcracker, where he capers about in the filmed ballet wearing his Home Alone grin, mischief-making moue and flapping eyelids. Your VCR will probably go through industrial stress over the next seven days, what with Brief Encounter, the complete works of James Bond - and children playing video games of Einsteinian complexity. For thoughtful relaxation you could try two new issues. Fellini's Roma is the maestro's slyly beautiful mockumentary about the Eternal City. And Innocent Moves, the tale of a boy chess prodigy, makes this sit-down game more exciting than any sport, including ice hockey.</p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Chaebol rules reviewed South Korea's Fair Trade Commission (FTC) plans to investigate anti-competitive trade practices within the country's large business groups, writes John Burton from Seoul. The announcement is the latest step by the government to reduce the economic power of Korea's biggest conglomerates, or chaebol. The FTC is expected to apply new regulations in September after it completes an initial investigation of the 78 biggest chaebol.</p>

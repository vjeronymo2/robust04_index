			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (9): Award-winning system - KLM is saving more than Pounds 500,000 a year after linking 12 PC personnel packages / Case study; Personnel management LAST YEAR, KLM's UK personnel department won an award from the Institute of Personnel Management for linking 12 personal computer software packages. However, the Information Technology in Personnel Award was not for technical achievement but a recognition of the way the department has used computers to improve the whole UK company's performance. For a one-off purchase cost of around Pounds 100,000, it has enabled the company to cut costs by at least Pounds 500,000 a year. KLM now has packages for everything from personnel and pensions to time-recording, staff-rostering, training administration, job applicant interviewing and psychometric testing. As UK personnel manager Mr David McCammon puts it: 'We believe there's hardly anything that human resources people do that can't be assisted by computer and there are so many specialist software companies around offering very high-class products.' KLM has 670 UK staff at 10 locations across the UK, although most are at the administrative headquarters on the edge of London's Heathrow Airport or working at the airport itself in passenger handling, baggage loading and so on. In the 1980s all personnel tasks were handled manually but a growing work load brought the department to the point where it had to choose between increasing its staff of six and moving into computing. KLM started towards automation in 1986 by contracting the payroll processing out to a computer bureau and buying a personnel management system from Percom. The first bureau wanted to sell its personnel processing service too and became unwilling to provide links with KLM's in-house Percom package, so the airline has now switched to the Carapay bureau. However, the biggest headache and a long-standing problem for all airlines was staff rostering: how to make the most productive use of staff who only had work to do when an aircraft was arriving or being prepared for a flight. The last flight might be completed two hours before the end of a shift, giving staff a short day, yet on other days a late flight might demand overtime. As Mr McCammon says: 'Shortened shifts are very nice for staff, but a disaster for productivity and ultimately threaten jobs.' Rostering is complex: different types of aircraft, the number of passengers, whether there are mailbags on board and so on mean the mix of staff needed can change from one shift to the next. KLM already had a manual clocking-in system, so it automated this using a software package from Smart Systems and added the company's rostering package. Links were set up from the personnel system and into the payroll service. 'We can now organise work and people to make sure there is work to do,' Mr McCammon says. 'It was impossible to do this with the manual system because there are so many variables and combinations of those variables.' The improved rostering, bringing better use of staff and a cut in overtime, is saving KLM around Pounds 400,000 a year. In addition, there is immediate information on a day's operating costs. 'Our financial controller can see from day to day how much overtime is being worked, for example, and seek an immediate explanation from line managers,' David McCammon says. 'With the manual system it could be six weeks before such information came through. Managers can now ask and answer immediate and relevant questions, because the information is immediately available.' A side benefit here is that the possibility of colleagues clocking in and out for each other has been eliminated: the system uses a personal barcode which is printed on the pass that each person needs to get through airport security to their workplace. They cannot get someone else to clock in for them, because the clock-in card is now part of the security pass they need to get to work in the first place. The automated capturing of attendance data has brought other benefits. The information is transmitted over a telecommunications link to Carapay to keep the payroll records up to date. This has eliminated the errors associated with manual systems, when figures are written on forms. Under the old system there was a six per cent error rate. The automated data capture and transmission has saved an estimated one man-year of work per year. In addition the computer system's analysis facilities have helped cut sick leave by more than a third. KLM keeps detailed records here, grouping reasons for absence into categories such as head, back and chest, with seven or eight sub-groups, such as migraine and headache, in each category. This information can pinpoint people who take an above average number of sick days but is also used to discover potential problems created by the work: for example, whether there is more back trouble among baggage loaders, which might indicate that they need new training in lifting techniques. The information has also been used to measure the effect of KLM's flu vaccination campaign: absences caused by flu are down 30 per cent. KLM decided three years ago to concentrate on cutting sick leave by using the system in this way. As part of the campaign it took on an occupational nurse and introduced schemes such as a cash prize draw for people who had no sick leave for three months. The results are striking: the average number of sick days has fallen from 10.4 in 1990 to seven this year. 'Without a computer system we couldn't even begin to measure absence in this level of detail,' says David McCammon. On the pensions side, KLM uses a package from SPA Plan - 'we used to use actuaries, who are very expensive,' Mr McCammon says. 'We are now saving Pounds 8,000 a year here and we can respond more quickly to staff enquiries.' Other packages have been added over the years. Percom's recruitment package enables one person to handle all recruitment administration, including dealing with the 5,000 unsolicited job applications that KLM receives each year. It has stored 70 standard letters in the system and can tailor these to individual applicants. It also stores details on every applicant so that if a vacancy arises it can enter the required qualifications to retrieve people who might fit the bill. This has cut advertising costs and enabled the company to fill vacancies very quickly: within a few hours of receiving a recent request for 15 warehouse staff the personnel department had selected 150 people and written to invite them for interviews. A psychometric testing package and an interviewing package, both from one of Europe's leading occupational psychology firms, Saville and Holdsworth, have also helped with recruitment. With the interviewing package, users enter up to 25 personal characteristics they are seeking from a list of 64 and the system throws up suggested questions for the interview. 'This is an example of a specialist little package costing around Pounds 300 which brings huge benefits,' says David McCammon. 'It in effect uses the experience of leading occupational psychologists. And the questions are good, open-ended ones which bring people out. You get better interviews and probably better recruits. 'Using the system also increases the personnel department's professional image in the eyes of line managers.' Percom's organisation chart system shows individuals and their jobs and who reports to them and also details such as their age and length of service, which KLM uses for succession planning. The training administration package, also from Percom, holds details of courses and enables managers to allocate people to them, send the details to the staff, compare costs with training budgets and so on. The Lotus Freelance product is used for desk-top publishing, producing charts for management, training manuals and newsletters. The Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet package is also used, notably for modelling the impact of changes in staff, salaries and so on: indeed, a personal computer is taken into negotiations with unions so that proposals and counter-proposals can be modelled immediately to see the likely impact. Users can load data automatically into 1-2-3 from the Percom. Most of these products are linked together through the personnel department's Novell network of IBM personal computers; others exchange information on disc. But despite the level of integration, there are still some significant links missing. At present data on new recruits, pay rises and other factors affecting the payroll is entered to the personnel system and sent to the time recording system, which sends it to the payroll bureau. However, the personnel package cannot accept information from the time recording or payroll systems. This means, for example, that although the personnel system holds a person's basic salary it does not get information on overtime. 'If we get an enquiry about total earnings, when a person applies for a mortgage, we have to ask separately for the payroll details to get the overtime,' says David McCammon. Similarly, information on sick leaves has to be keyed in to the personnel system - 'full integration would save time, and we are looking at getting this link in the next 12 months,' Mr McCammon says. However, nothing dulls his enthusiasm for all the systems. 'There are so many wonderful little packages you can pull off the shelf and get working in half an hour, with great returns,' he says. 'Even a big company could go this way. If it can split its operation into units of, say, 2,000 people, it can use these cheap PC packages.' Mr McCammon is so keen that he spends an hour a day at his keyboard doing mundane data entry of basic data on new recruits, salary changes and so on: keyboard work that anyone could do. 'Hands-on experience is very important,' he says. 'I spend an hour a day on data entry and three hours a day getting information out. Entering data gives me a very good knowledge of the Percom system, so I can get the most out of it when it comes to seeking information. Senior managers should get more hands-on experience: I'm sure many personnel managers are wasting opportunity by not knowing the full potential of their systems. 'At the same time, doing data entry keeps me up to date with what's happening in KLM.' The systems have enabled the personnel department to change its own organisation and to become a more pro-active service to managers. For example, the time-saving aspects have enabled David McCammon's secretary not only to become a personnel assistant but also to do all the company's training on word processing and spreadsheets. This is saving KLM the Pounds 20,000 a year it used to spend on outside training organisations. The pensions administrator now has the time and the information to go round the company giving talks on pensions and advising staff. And the recruitment person is available for careers counselling. The personnel department is working on showing managers the type of information that is available. 'Some managers make really good use of the information but others perhaps need training in the sort of questions they can ask us,' says David McCammon. 'They don't fully understand yet just how much information we can give them to help them manage their departments.' The unions, too, are catching on to the potential of this information-handling tool - 'the unions have been very supportive and actually use the system: as a simple example they ask us for addressed labels when they want to ballot their members.' The success of the UK personnel department has led KLM operations in Belgium, France and Germany to take on the Percom system. Greece is taking the time recording package and the US operation is looking at what the UK is doing. David McCammon is the ideal person for them to talk to. He turns back to the keyboard and taps keys at lightning speed to put together yet another complex report, listing people of specified grades in a specific department belonging to a specified union, with their individual salaries plus an average for the group. 'I know nothing about computers, but I do know this system and that we have at our fingertips every bit of information we need to help run this company efficiently,' he says.</p>

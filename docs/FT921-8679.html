			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Blue Arrow Verdicts: Record saga ends with shrugs and resigned smiles THE BLUE ARROW court-room, in a specially adapted modern office building in London's Chancery Lane, was tense when the jury of 11 men and one woman returned at 1pm yesterday on their fourth day of deliberation. The convictions - all by unanimous verdicts - of four of the defendants were received with surprise by many in the courtroom. Lawyers had generally agreed that the tone of summing-up by the judge, Mr Justice McKinnon, had been favourable to all five defendants remaining on trial. The four convicted men made no comment as they left the court, released on bail for the weekend. Shrugs and resigned smiles were the order of the day. The convictions of the four men - from an original total of 10 defendants - can mark only a partial success for the Serious Fraud Office which brought the prosecution. Because of the length and cost of the trial, and the acquittal of three of the seven individual defendants and all three of the corporate defendants, the trial raises questions over the competence of the SFO and the legal system to handle such complex cases. Blue Arrow was, after the first Guinness trial, the second high-profile 'mega-trial' brought by the SFO. It lacked its predecessor's ability to grab headlines, but was much longer and more expensive, estimated at Pounds 35m. Originally expected to last a maximum of eight months, it expanded to a year, putting the system of trial by jury under exceptional stress. Few deny that the trial was anything but a troubled prosecution, as the acquittal rate and long periods spent by lawyers arguing in camera indicate. Observers point to two causes: the ambitious scale of the prosecution and the non-interventionist style of the judge, Mr Justice McKinnon. Trials of this scale require judges of exceptional ability and reputation. Mr Justice McKinnon came to Blue Arrow with a relatively short record as a judge. He was appointed a High Court judge in 1988 and his experience was largely in civil, rather than criminal, cases. As the trial progressed, he made a series of decisions which, because of their 11th-hour timing, surprised many at the Criminal Bar. But, among the Bar, there is general agreement that the prosecution, because of its insistence on maintaining such a cumbersome case, should take most of the blame for the difficulties. The SFO took over the case in July 1989, soon after the publication of the Department of Trade and Industry report into the affair. The SFO was under pressure to bring the case to court quickly and the arrests of individual defendants were made in November 1989. Relying largely on evidence from the DTI report, it was decided that the appropriate charges were conspiracy to defraud along with more specific charges under the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) (PFI) Act. Mr Nicholas Purnell QC, then chairman of the Criminal Bar Association, was put in charge of the prosecution. Previous high-profile prosecutions he had led included the Brinks-Matt bullion robbery. Under the direction of Mr Purnell the prosecution was ambitious, reflecting the SFO's determination that it should not shy away from tackling the biggest of fish. The prosecution saw the case as one of corporate fraud, allegedly carried out using the financial muscle and reputations of County NatWest and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities. In bringing charges against three companies, the SFO was sailing into largely uncharted waters. Proving corporate criminal liability is notoriously difficult. From the outset, prosecution and judge disagreed over the scale of the trial. After the preparatory hearings, the indictment was reduced and the PFI charges dropped. Mr Justice McKinnon also ruled that the proceedings should be split into two trials. The case still proved a legal juggernaut. Ten legal teams - totalling some 50 barristers and solicitors - filled the courtroom. The prosecution called 80 witnesses and lasted from February to the end of July last year. At its heart was a simple issue, the prosecution believed. The integrity of the London markets demanded that share dealings be transparent, with investors entitled to know price sensitive information that could affect their judgment. By intervening in the market to buy large and secret holdings of shares in the Blue Arrow rights issue, the defendants, the prosecution claimed, rigged its outcome and maintained the company's share price at a false level. In essence, the defendants' case was that they were only doing their jobs. They were acting as merchant bankers and stockbrokers should do - supporting their clients. What had surprised the markets was the extent of their intervention, but this had been a consequence of the greater financial strength open to them following Big Bang. The arguments quickly became complex. Under what circumstances could rights-issue deadlines be ignored? What precedents existed for financial advisers taking stakes in client companies? What should investors be entitled to know? It was not the stuff of classic courtroom dramas. The core issues only once sparked angry exchanges - when Mr Purnell and Mr Jonathan Cohen clashed over the circumstances in which marketmakers could hold shares without disclosing them. The ennui was not helped by the air conditioning, which pumped fumes from a nearby wine bar into the courtroom. The judge complained of the 'oxygen-free' atmosphere. One defence team assembled its own weather station, monitoring temperature and humidity levels, which soared over the summer. The drama in the trial came not from the issues of market practice, but from how the affair had been received within the National Westminster Bank and the Bank of England. Defending Mr Stephen Clark, a former County NatWest finance director, Mr Alun Jones QC alleged that NatWest's top management had conspired with Bank officials to stop the scandal becoming public. The accusations were denied by all witnesses from NatWest and the Bank. The first open signs of the prosecution running into trouble came in September, when Mr Justice McKinnon ruled that Mr Clark and Mr Alan Keat, the City solicitor who advised the merchant bank, should be acquitted because of insufficient evidence. In December, the judge interrupted a closing speech by one defence counsel to make two rulings that set back the prosecution case. The allegation that senior executives within National Westminster Bank had been misled was thrown out and evidence given by a key prosecution witness dis-regarded. At this point, the prosecution felt its case was still largely intact. It was in legal arguments at the end of the evidence, however, that the prosecution suffered its gravest setback. The judge directed that all three corporate defendants - County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities - should be acquitted. In what had been billed as a case of corporate fraud, the companies were free. At the start of the judge's summing up, the jury was then told to strike out three quarters of the indictment. Such evidence, the judge ruled, was relevant, but nothing adverse to the defendants could be drawn from it. Mr Justice McKinnon admitted there had been severe stress on the system. If the jury had felt overstretched, they were not alone, he told them. He, too, had found himself overwhelmed at times.</p>

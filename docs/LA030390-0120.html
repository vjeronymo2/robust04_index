			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POTPOURRI PLANT SHUT AFTER ITS NEIGHBORS RAISE A STINK  </P> <P> The smell of potpourri isn't everyone's idea of heaven, especially when it's  being stirred up in one's neighborhood.  </P> <P> Aromax, a potpourri manufacturing company in Visalia, Calif., was shut down  Thursday by the Tulare County Air Pollution Control District.  </P> <P> The district found that the firm -- which has produced cloyingly-sweet  potpourri since 1981, and later incense and dyed, scented salt crystals -- was  also emitting more than 300 pounds of volatile hydrocarbons a day. The  emissions came from the solvent used to dye and perfume wood chips and flowers  used in the mix.  </P> <P> The neighbors complained when the factory greatly expanded.  </P> <P> "When we first went out there a year ago," said David Fishel, Tulare County  environmental health director, the solvent mix was being poured from sprinkler  cans over chips spread out on the factory floor and in the parking lot.  </P> <P> "It was running down the driveway, into the gutter and into the storm drains,"  he said. "I'll tell you, in that neighborhood, (the odor) is downright  unbearable. . . . I wonder why the place didn't burn up."  </P> <P> Owners of Aromax were unavailable for comment Friday, a receptionist said.  </P> <P> "And do me a favor, will you?" she added. "Don't get all upset about it. Have a  nice weekend, OK?"  </P></p>

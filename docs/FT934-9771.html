			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Govett Emerging to double via Pounds 30m issue Govett Emerging Markets, an investment trust specialising in shares quoted on the stock markets of developing countries, is planning to more than double its size via a Pounds 30m issue of 'C' shares. The trust was only launched in July, when the issue raised Pounds 25m. Net assets per share have risen by 23.5 per cent since launch, according to Govett. A number of emerging markets funds have either been launched, or have expanded their capital, over the last two years. The directors pointed out that the use of 'C' shares is now common for investment trusts which want to expand their capital. The 'C' shares will be converted into ordinary shares only after the bulk of the new money has been invested.</p>

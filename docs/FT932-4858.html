			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Survey of Uruguay (6): A market in the making / Interview with President Luis Alberto Lacalle QUESTION: The Mercosur common market (bringing together Uruguay with Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay) seems to be hitting some problems,does it not? Answer: It's the old-as-history difference between what you want and what you can do, which is the great mystery and attraction of politics. You can say that we set a very short calendar of five years but that's one of the virtues of the treaty of Asuncion (which established Mercosur). The deadline has provoked inside our countries a movement towards change. That's especially necessary in our country. Perhaps, we won't have a complete perfect 100 per cent common market at the deadline at the end of December 1994. But we have agreed that we will have an external tariff, which is an important goal. It will be around 20 per cent - of course with exceptions. We are very keen in Uruguay that it must be lowish to prevent a closed market that can't be touched. Q: What about the accession of other members? A: The treaty is a shortish treaty with 35 or something articles. One very specific article says all countries are invited, but they cannot be part of other pacts or treaties to become members of Mercosur. So at the moment no country can enter if it's a member of Andean Pact, for instance, or the North American Free Trade Agreement. We are trying to provide the possibility of Bolivia becoming a member because it is very keen. Bolivia has her own way to the ocean through the rivers and the river Plate and our port in Palmira and the ports in Argentina: so Bolivia, like the rest of us, is leaning towards the Atlantic. Q: What about the possibility, raised by the US administration, that Argentina, along with Chile and Venezuela, might have accession to Nafta? A: Well, I do think that we should approach this step by step. Nafta is not a reality yet, so that's a big if. The integration movement in Latin America must be modular and step by step. When you think of Mercosur, it is made real by geography. You look at the rivers, at the Parana, Paraguay and Uruguay: it's a tree of rivers whose trunk is the River Plate and whose roots are in the Atlantic: that's why Mercosur makes sense and that's why the accession of Bolivia is reasonable. It's the same for Mexico, Canada and the United States. So I think the integration movement mustn't go to the top from the beginning - let's say all America, from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. No, nonsense. It's very difficult to do what we're trying to do. So the idea for this generation and perhaps another one is to try and make these things work. Q: Enthusiasm in Uruguay for Mercosur appears to be waning. A: It's like marriage: it seems ideal before, but it's not that ideal. There are certain words that have a good press: integration is one of them. But then when you say to people in business that you must restructure, when you tell workers that some jobs may be lost, when you tell young people that they must prepare themselves better in education, then people realise integration provides opportunities not certainties. It means you must change, and change is difficult in a country like mine, as was shown when the private enterprise law - the very timid privatisation we proposed - was beaten in referendum so the signals are mixed. Q: The modernisation of the state that we have seen in other Latin American countries appears to be progressing slowly here. A: Some things have gone ahead. Congress has approved the port reform law. Now, we are lowering our tariffs at the port and cutting by half the waiting time for ships. One other thing was the possibility of the utility company to buy energy from private companies. The general law on enterprises, which included a special chapter on the telephone company, had 32 articles, of which only five were contested by the referendum (in 1992). Of course, those contested were the most important but the rest are on the books. I think are mixed feelings in the country about privatisation but the vote in the referendum was in one sense a vote against the government. All the propaganda was around 'vote against the government, vote against the government vote against the government'. Of course, the state enterprise sector was never as extended here as it was in Argentina. We have in broad figures about 260,000 public employees, of which about 60,000 work for the public companies. Q: One problem you have is the dependence of a large number of people on the state. A: An enormous number people depend on the state. We have about 450,000 pensioners more or less. They draw 600,000 pensions because some people get two. With public employees that makes a total of 700,000, and we have a workforce of 1.1m. The system allows people to retire very early: women at 55 after 30 years of work and men at 60. We had intended to go deep into reform. In the end, a smallish reform was made. Q: Why do you think that in contrast to the rest of Latin America, the left continues to make gains.? A: I think it's very difficult to explain. Here we had one of the the oldest two-party systems, going back to 1836. The country was built on the assumption that there would be two parties: the whites and the reds. The left begun to unite itself in 1971, and now they account for 30-something per cent. The two traditional parties are what the Americans would call catch-all parties; they are vertical cross sections of the entire society. This is something which the coalition of the left has a shield against: they are more class-minded. Q: Does this mean political reform is necessary? A: Well it's a very peculiar system. In each election, there is a built-in primary. It's built on the assumption that before anything voters want their party to win; then inside the party they prefer candidate A against candidate B. The problem starts after the election, the morning after, because you need to build a coalition inside the party and when you are a minority in government to go to other parties. That is why it is so complex and difficult to organise. Q: So is constitutional reform likely? A: It's a legal possibility but not a real possibility. The constitution is very rigid when it comes to changing itself. You need very big majorities. Q: Your party is in a minority in Congress and you can't even rely on all your party to support you. Would it be fair to describe you as a lame duck? A: We still have executive power and we do what we can. For example we were able to renegotiate the external debt. As soon as it requires a change in the law, then it is more difficult. And of course we secured passage of the enterprise law, then we were defeated in the referendum. Q: What are the priorities for the remainder of your term? A: We are fighting for a bill on the de-monopolisation of insurance and of alcohol production, which is a state monopoly. We will keep on trying; it's always difficult because it's difficult to get consensus among members of parliament. Then there is always the menace of a plebiscite. You only need 10,000 people to sign a petition.</p>

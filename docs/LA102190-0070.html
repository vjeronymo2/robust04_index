			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLARE'S MISSION  </P> <P> Not all children have a morbid interest in the obscene -- in fact, I have found  the ones who have just such an obsession are children from homes where  censorship ranks No. 1 on the list of "values" to be learned.  </P> <P> Values, respect for oneself and others, religious and political preferences,  begin at home. (And not necessarily just a good Christian home.)  </P> <P> When Loeffel educates my children by paying for their school, books, food,  clothing and shelter and taxes, I'll let her move in and live with us!  </P> <P> SITA HOYT  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

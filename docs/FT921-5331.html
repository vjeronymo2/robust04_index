			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / ITT sells remaining Alcatel stake ALCATEL-Alsthom, the French telecommunications equipment group, is buying the 30 per cent stake held by ITT of the US in Alcatel, its main telecommunications subsidiary, in a deal worth FFr18.7bn (Pounds 1.9bn). The acquisition marks the end of a six-year partnership between Alcatel-Alsthom and ITT. It also represents a strategy change for the US conglomerate, which has been examining ways to help its lacklustre share price. Alcatel-Alsthom will pay FFr13.2bn in cash, in three instalments, for the stake. ITT will take a 7 per cent holding in the Alcatel-Alsthom group, making it the second largest shareholder after Societe Generale, the French bank. The deal surprised and pleased Wall Street, where ITT's shares rose Dollars 3 1/8 to close at Dollars 69 3/4 amid speculation this might be the first of a number of restructuring moves by the company. ITT's shares have advanced strongly during the past week, from about Dollars 60, after Mr Rand Araskog, chairman, said he was considering a number of options to make the company 'more exciting to the investment community'. ITT and Alcatel-Alsthom came together in 1986 when they merged their telecommunications interests in Alcatel, enabling it to outstrip American Telephone &amp; Telegraph as the world's single biggest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment. ITT, whose origins lay in the telecommunications business, retained a 37 per cent stake in the combined operation (later reduced to 30 per cent), while its French partner held just over 56 per cent. Under the terms of the original agreement each partner could exercise pre-emptive rights if the other sold all or part of their shares. Alcatel-Alsthom decided to do so when ITT said that it wanted to sell its shares. Alcatel, which is the largest single part of Alcatel-Alsthom, made net profits of FFr4.09bn in 1990, and recently reported an 18 per cent increase in sales to FFr109.7bn in 1991. Alcatel-Alsthom is funding the share purchase with debt, increasing its gearing from 16 per cent to 26 per cent. ITT said it would record an after-tax gain of about Dollars 400m. Some analysts were surprised the figure was not higher, but the company faces a steep US tax bill on the deal. Lex, Page 18</p>

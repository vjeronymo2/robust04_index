			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Clarification" by unidentified official spokesman of the </F> Patriotic Union of Kurdistan; date and place not given--read by  announcer]    [Text] During an interview with Radio Monte Carlo, Jalal  Talabani, secretary general of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan  [PUK], spoke frankly about several important issues, including  an attempt by the Iraqi regime to negotiate with the Kurdish  people's liberation movement. He explained the PUK's  understanding of this issue. It is worth noting that certain  parties used particular parts of the interview for their own  interpretations and to serve their own objectives. Therefore,  to avoid misleading the masses or distorting the PUK's views and  policies, we would like to declare to the masses of Kurdistan  that the PUK considers federalism a gain for Kurdistan because  it establishes the status of Kurdistan within an Iraqi framework  on a federal basis. The PUK considers this to be the fruit of  the blood of hundreds of thousands of martyrs and of a long and  bitter struggle by the Kurdish people.    The PUK played an effective and important role and has made  sacrifices to accomplish this. Under no circumstances will the  PUK accept lesser gains for narrow party interests and  developments; this is impossible.    Self-rule is not a PUK slogan. However, no other political  party can be prevented from raising the self-rule slogan instead  of the slogan of obtaining our people's legitimate rights. The  PUK adheres to the idea of federalism in form and content.  Establishing relations between the Kurds and Arabs in Iraq on  the basis of federalism without achieving democracy remains an  impossible dream. Therefore, eliminating the dictatorship and  achieving democracy in Iraq are two prerequisites for  establishing and safeguarding federalism in Kurdistan and Iraq.    Negotiating with Saddam Husayn for any reason whatsoever  will  only result in repeating the tragedies of the Kurdish people and  the destruction of Kurdistan.    All the countries and people of the world consider Saddam  Husayn and his regime to be big war criminals, genocidal  criminals, and a contributing factor to instability in the  region. Negotiations between Kurds or any Kurdistan party in  Iraq with this regime constitutes a link with a collapsing  regime that is ostracized by the countries of the region and the  world. In effect it would mean substituting a considerable and  realistic gain for an illusion.    The PUK considers dialogue one of the ways and means of  struggle. However, initiating a dialogue with Saddam  Husayn--with his criminal killers of Kurds, enemies of mankind,  democracy, peace, and human rights, the chauvinists, and  racists--would be inexcusable under the current circumstances.  This is because Saddam Husayn and the Ba'thists do not  recognize any of our Kurdish people's rights. They consider  death and destruction as the only legitimate right we Kurdish  people have left.    Our people have tried to engage in dialogues with the Iraqi  regime several times, and they must have learned a lesson from  this experience. The Baghdad regime may provide funds and arms  to those who side with it, but it will never recognize the  Kurdish people's rights, nor will it improve the living  conditions of the Kurds.    The PUK considers the gains made in Iraqi Kurdistan,  embodied  in the parliament and federal government, freedom, and peace, to  be great gains that cannot be safeguarded through dialogue with  Saddam Husayn. In fact, a dialogue with Saddam Husayn might  destroy these gains. Safeguarding these gains can be achieved  through the unity of the people and cooperation among the  Kurdistan Front parties and the sons of our people. We believe  that safeguarding and promoting these gains is a turning point  for establishing a firm entity in Kurdistan. No one has a right  to make us lose this opportunity.</p>

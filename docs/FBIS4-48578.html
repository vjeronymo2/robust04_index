			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Edyth Bulbring] </F>   [Text] The government plans to sell off state assets,  including property owned abroad, to fund its reconstruction and  development programme, Minister Without Portfolio Jay Naidoo  said this week. "I am keen to ensure that assets that are not  directly linked to the delivery of the reconstruction and  development programme, that are merely a symbol of the white  glory macho projects of the past, are sold. I have absolutely  no reservations about that," Mr Naidoo said in an interview.    These funding "windfalls", Mr Naidoo said, could include  power stations that had been mothballed, and embassies abroad.  "We are reviewing all our assets," he said. The government  would also have to assess all its properties abroad. Properties  that could go first were those owned by the former TBVC  [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] states.    He would also support moving away from holding on to  embassies that were more the style of Western countries and not  in line with a developing Third World country like South Africa.  "We don't have to live the lifestyles of First World Western  countries. We are a developing country and we must relate to  that reality and first strive towards a sustainable economy," he  said.    Mr Naidoo said there were four other sources of funding for  the reconstruction and development programme. These were slices  from the Budget, which would increase year by year. One of the  scenarios put forward by the National Institute for Economic  Policy was that by the end of five years, this would have  totalled R[Rand]80- billion, with R39-billion being spent in the  fifth year. Other sources of funding were development aid from  foreign donors, and contributions from the private sector and  non-governmental organisations.</p>

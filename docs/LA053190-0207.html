			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> PULIDO ACCUSED OF 'EMPTY PROMISES'  </P> <P> More than 80 people crowded onto Councilman Miguel A. Pulido Jr.'s front lawn  Wednesday night to protest what they call his "empty promises" concerning a  major redevelopment project. Pulido was not home during the demonstration.  </P> <P> "He makes a lot of commitments in public, but in private, he shows a different  face," said Nativo Lopez, who organized the demonstration and is director of  the Latino group Hermandad Mexicana Nacional.  </P> <P> The protesters, members of Hermandad and the Civic Center Barrio Housing Corp.,  objected to Pulido's actions concerning the $335-million Bristol Street  Redevelopment Project.  </P> <P> Lopez said Pulido has not moved to protect 1,000 homes and businesses from  possible demolition to make room for the city's latest development project.  </P> <P> "Pulido told us he would do all he can to save the properties," said Lopez.  "Now he is backpedaling."  </P> <P> The City Council is still debating what to do about the houses and businesses  that lie within the project area. The project includes a 3.5-mile stretch of  Bristol Street from Central Avenue to 17th Street. It also affects portions of  1st Street and 17th Street.  </P> <P> The city's redevelopment staff is recommending that the city include the  properties in the project area. Hermandad, the primary opponent of the  redevelopment project, maintains that the city can save 1,453 parcels and  should be more considerate of the hundreds of people who may lose their homes  if the buildings are included. In January, Hermandad sued the city in an effort  to halt the project. The suit is now pending.  </P> <P> In a recent interview, Pulido said the project affected too many properties. "I  think it's too broad as it stands," Pulido said.  </P> <P> Pulido said he has complained that the redevelopment staff had not contacted  affected property owners and had not prepared a report detailing which  addresses will actually be affected by the project.  </P> <P> "He told all of these people what he would do but he never did what he said he  would," said Olga Castor, who said she worked on Pulido's council campaign. "He  made promises he hasn't delivered."  </P> <P> Lopez also used the occasion to take issue with Pulido's place of residence. He  charged that the councilman does not actually live in Santa Ana but in  Fullerton. Pulido, whose address is listed on West Harvard Street in Santa Ana  in county registrar of voters records, was not available for comment on the  allegation about his place of residence.

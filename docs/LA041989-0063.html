			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAEL ACCUSED OF CONDONING ATTACKS ON ARABS  </P> <P> Amnesty International on Tuesday accused the Israeli government of effectively  encouraging troops to kill or wound Palestinians during the uprising in the  occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> The international human rights group also urged Israel to set up an independent  judicial inquiry into what it called a wide range of rights violations by  security forces.  </P> <P> A spokesman said Amnesty International believes authorities were "in effect  encouraging" misuse of force by failing to speak out against excessive violence  or issue clear guidelines to soldiers.  </P> <P> In Jerusalem, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's spokesman Avi Pazner called the  charge "outrageous."  </P> <P> "Our troops are under strict instructions not to cause any casualties and we  take great care when it happens that there is an inquiry in every case," Pazner  said.  </P> <P> In continuing violence in the occupied territories, three Palestinians were  killed by unknown assailants in Nablus on the West Bank and in Gaza City.  However, Palestinian sources said Tuesday they believe the killers were other  Arabs retaliating against suspected "collaborators" with Israel's secret  police.  </P></p>

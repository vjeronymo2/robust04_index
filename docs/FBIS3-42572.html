			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Economic report by the Center for Economic and Business </F> Conditions of the Russian Federation Government: "On the  Commodity Structure of Exports and Imports"]    [Text] The Center for Economic and Business Conditions of  the Council of Ministers--Government of the Russian Federation  has used official reporting data from state statistics organs to  conduct an analysis of the dynamics of the physical and cost  indices of exports and imports of the most important commodities  in Russia's foreign trade turnover with the states of the far  abroad for the period January-October 1993.    It follows from the analysis conducted that in comparison  with the period January-October 1992:    --exports, amounting to $31.4 billion, were maintained on  the  level of the same period of 1992, this basically due to the  influence of extensive factors;    --an increase in export production was observed in:    --ferrous metallurgy--by $1.34 billion;    --timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper industry--by $0.37  billion;    --fresh and frozen fish--by $0.2 billion;    --a reduction took place at the same time in the export  production of:    --the fuel and energy complex--by $0.7 billion;    --uncut diamonds--by $0.66 billion;    --machine building--by $0.47 billion;    --chemicals and petrochemicals--by $0.16 billion;    --nonferrous metallurgy--by $0.16 billion;    --imports, amounting to $15.5 billion, decreased by almost  46  percent, 3 percent more than for January-September 1993;    --in absolute terms, the reduction in imports came to $13.2  billion;    --proportion of the total reduction in imports attributable  to specific commodity groups:    --machinery and equipment--45.4 percent;    --foodstuffs--28.1 percent;    --nonfood consumer products--10.2 percent;    --medicines--5.1 percent;    --other products--11.2 percent.  <H6>  EXPORTS </H6> <H5>  Production in the Fuel and Energy Complex </H5>   A weak but steady trend toward diminished percentages of  commodities representing fuel and energy production output was  observed in 1993. Thus, in January-August of 1993, this index  amounted to 53.2 percent; in January-September it was 52.7  percent; and in January-October it was 52 percent, approximately  2 percent lower than the levels seen for the same period of 1992.    Aggregate deliveries of fuel and energy complex output in  physical terms (taking into account gas converted to standard  tonnes) increased by 23 percent in January-October 1993 as  compared with the same period of 1992, at the same time that  hard currency proceeds decreased by 4.1 percent. The total  reduction in export production output in the fuel and energy  complex from the level of January-October 1992 amounted to $695  million.    Oil shipments in January-October 1993 increased 30 percent  over the level of the same period of 1992. The contract price  for oil over this period was established at the level of $105.10  per tonne, 18.9 percent lower than the January-October 1992  price. The rate of decrease of contract prices for oil in 1993  correspond to the price decrease rates on the world market. In  spite of the increased volumes of oil shipments due to the drop  in contract prices, hard currency proceeds increased by just 5.8  percent.    The rate of increase in deliveries of oil products (in  physical terms) continues to grow. In January-August 1993, as  compared with the same period of 1992, this rate comprised 36.8  percent, in January-September it was 40.7 percent, and in  January-October--45.2 percent. While the average weighted  contract price in January-October 1993 amounted to just $95.70  per tonne, having decreased by 42.4 percent from the level of  the same period in 1992. As compared with the contract price  level for January-September 1993, the January-October price was  reduced by another $7.50.    In this manner, the average weighted cost of a tonne of oil  products in 1993 was almost $10 lower than the cost of a tonne  of crude oil. The price ratio for these products in 1992 was  contradictory in nature: In January-October, the price of a  tonne of oil was fixed at the level of $129, while the price of  a tonne of oil products came to $166.30. The emergence in 1993  of the situation outlined here is related primarily to a  significant change in the structure of oil product shipments due  to increased exports of the less expensive products in this  group, in particular--fuel oil.    This process is showing a trend toward more active  development in 1993.    Changes in the Coefficient Indicating Ratio of the Average Weighted Price of  One Tonne of Oil Products to the Price of Oil   Year    January-March    January-June    January-September    January-October   1992    1.22             1.26            1.29                 1.29   1993    1.14             1.04            0.96                 0.91      In January-October 1993, shipments of natural gas increased  over the January-October 1992 level by 2.7 percent. However,  hard currency proceeds over this period decreased by $411  million (6.7 percent). This can be explained by the average drop  of 9 percent over this period in the contract price.    The physical volume of coal shipments in January-October  1993  increased by 11.6 percent over the same period of last year. The  rate of increase of the export of coal is gradually  diminishing--in January-August 1993 this was 19.6 percent; in  January-September it was 14.2 percent.  <H5>  Ferrous Metallurgy Output </H5>   In January-October 1993, the share of total production  output  export volume attributable to ferrous metallurgy was 8.8  percent, as opposed to 4.5 percent in January-October of 1992.    The main increase in hard currency proceeds from the export  of commodities representative of this sector is directly  attributable to the ferrous metals group (rolled metal, steel),  which provided for 98 percent, or $1.3 billion, of the increase  in sector exports. In cost terms, the export of rolled metals  and steels in January-October 1993 increased by a factor of 2.3  over the January-October 1992 level, amounting to $2.3 billion.    The rate of growth of cast iron exports in physical terms  over January-October 1993 was 29 percent greater than the  January-October 1992 level, while the contract price over this  period decreased by 27 percent. As a result, hard currency  proceeds were reduced by $10.4 million.    The rate of reduction of hard currency proceeds from the  export of ores and concentrates--amounting in January-October  1993 to a 16 percent drop from the level of January-October  1992--is slightly outpacing the rate of reduction of their  shipment volumes--13.2 percent.  <H5>  Nonferrous Metallurgy Production Output </H5>   The share of nonferrous metallurgy output commodities  (aluminum, nickel, copper) of the total export volume in  January-October 1993 amounted to 4.8 percent, or $1.5 billion,  as opposed to 5.3 percent in January-October of 1992. The same  indices for January-September 1993 were at the level of 3.2  percent, or $0.9 billion. The significant increase in export  volumes for October 1993 (of $0.6 billion) is related primarily  to insufficiently exhaustive statistical information for the  previous months, especially with respect to the export of copper  and nickel.    The share of nonferrous metals exported in January-October  1993 attributable to aluminum increased to 63.5 percent, as  opposed to 56.4 percent in January-October of 1992.    In physical terms, the volume of aluminum exported increased  by 50.6 percent. However, the growth of hard currency proceeds  from the export of aluminum in January-October 1993 was just 2  percent greater than the January-October 1992 level--caused by  the sharp drop (32.4 percent) in average contract price.  Preliminary estimates indicate that aluminum exports amounted to  about 172,000 tonnes in October, while more precise data for  September show a level for that month of 125,000 tonnes.    Rate of Change of Physical Volumes and Contract Prices in the Export of  Aluminum, Calculated With Respect to January-March Indices   Year    January-March    January-June    January-September    January-October                                                                Compared With                                                                January-September   Shipment Volume   1992    1.0              2.13            3.43                 1.12   1993    1.0              3.06            5.42                 1.24   Contract Price   1992    1.0              1.04            1.12                 1.04   1993    1.0              0.94            0.93                 0.99      In January-October 1993, the export of nickel in physical  volume terms decreased by 27.5 percent from the January-October  1992 level, while the contract price dropped by 10.4 percent.    The export of copper in physical terms in January-October  1993 was reduced 12.6 percent from the January-October 1992  level, while the contract price increased by 19.2 percent.  <H5>  Uncut Diamonds </H5>   The share of total export volume attributable to uncut  diamonds in January-October 1993 dropped to 1.5 percent, as  opposed to 3.6 percent in January-October of 1992. This is the  result of a 59 percent reduction in shipment volumes and a 27  percent reduction in contract prices.  <H5>  Chemical and Petrochemical Production Output </H5>   The share of total export volume attributable to chemicals  and petrochemicals in January-October 1993 amounted to 3.3  percent, as opposed to 3.8 percent in January-October of 1992.    The structure of export of representative commodities of  this  sector in January-October 1993 changed somewhat compared to the  same period of 1992:    --the proportion of fertilizers of all varieties decreased  from 75 to 66 percent;    --the share of ammonia exports increased from 12 to 18  percent;    --the share of synthetic rubber exports increased from 8 to  10 percent.    The aggregate export in physical volume of fertilizers of  all  varieties decreased by 16.2 percent in January-October 1993, as  compared with the same period of 1992, while hard currency  proceeds decreased by 23.2 percent.    Significant changes are being observed in the export  structure for fertilizers. The export in physical terms of  nitrogen and potash fertilizers decreased by 37.1 and 30.4  percent, respectively, while the export of compound and  phosphoric fertilizers increased by 98.6 and 10.7 percent.  Contract prices dropped from 1992 levels for all varieties of  fertilizers, except nitrogen fertilizers.  <H5>  Timber, Woodworking, and Pulp and Paper Production </H5>   The rate of increase (in physical terms) of shipments of  sector commodities under observation in January-October 1993  slowed down somewhat as compared with January-September of 1993,  amounting to:    --52.3 percent for unprocessed timber shipments, as opposed  to 73.2 percent;    --43.5 percent for plywood shipments, as opposed to 103.1  percent;    --113.7 percent for pulp shipments, as opposed to 137.6  percent.    The trend toward increased deliveries which was  characteristic of previous months continued only with respect to  newsprint--240.4 percent, as opposed to 219.9 percent.    In addition, the gap between 1993 and 1992 contract prices  narrowed somewhat, as 1993 contract prices tended to converge  gradually upon the 1992 level. Thus, whereas in  January-September of 1993 prices for unprocessed timber amounted  to 81 percent of the level for the same period of 1992, this  ratio for the January-October period came to 98 percent. With  respect to plywood, the figures were 57 and 65 percent,  respectively, and for pulp--60 and 64 percent, respectively.  <H5>  Machine-Building Output </H5>   The share of total export production volume attributable to  machine building in January-October 1993 decreased by 7.3  percent, as compared to 8.7 percent for the same period of last  year.    Recent months show a continued augmentation of the drop in  machinery and equipment shipments as compared with last year. In  January-October 1993, the decrease reached the level of $473  million, as opposed to $394 million in January-September. At the  same time that export volumes of civil-sector machine building  have been decreasing in 1993, certain changes in its commodity  structure are also being observed. However, means of ground  transportation (excluding railroad transport) continue to occupy  the leading position--with 47.7 percent of the total export  volume of this sector, along with technological equipment  (excluding electrical equipment)--38.8 percent. In this regard,  the share of total shipments attributable to these equipment  varieties increased by 1.5 and 4.2 percent, respectively, as  compared with 1992 levels. It is significant that the share of  export of aircraft decreased by 2.2 percent.    The only product group in the machine-building sector that  showed a slight increase in the share of production over the  period in question was shipbuilding. In addition, hard currency  proceeds increased by $4.5 million as compared with  January-October 1992.    For the remaining production groups in the machine-building  sector, a drop in share was observed, ranging from 0.6 to 1.4  percent. These include optical instruments and devices,  electrical machinery and equipment, railroad equipment and  rolling stock.    In assessing the influence of various types of production  output on diminished export volumes in the sector, we note that  $185.8 million (39.2 percent) of the reduction took place due to  reduced exports of means of ground transportation, $102 million  (21.5 percent)--due to aircraft, and $69.3 million (14.6  percent)--to technological equipment and machinery (excluding  electrical). The share of reduction in hard currency proceeds  with respect to the remaining varieties of machine-building  output fluctuates within the 6-10 percent range.  <H5>  Fish and Fish Products </H5>   The share of shipments of fish and fish products in  January-October 1993 came to 1.7 percent, as opposed to 1.1  percent for the same period of last year.    The shipment increase in physical volume terms amounted to  33.1 percent. The total increase in hard currency proceeds over  this period reached $197 million, contributing factors here  including a growth in contract prices--amounting to 57.6 percent  in January-October 1993.  <H6>  IMPORTS </H6> <H5>  Ferrous Metallurgy Production Output </H5>   The share of imported representative products of the ferrous  metallurgy sector increased significantly in January-October  1993, amounting to 3.5 percent, as opposed to 2.0 percent in  January-October of 1992.    Despite the overall decrease of 45.9 percent in import  purchases in general seen in January-October 1993 as compared  with the same period of 1992, import volumes of ferrous  metallurgy production remained virtually at last year's level.  Purchases of production output in this sector amounted to $541  million, as opposed to $560 million in January-October of 1992.  The reduction in expenditures for imports came to just $19.3  million.    It must be noted that the structure of imported production  in  this sector also changed in January-October 1993 as compared  with the same period of 1992. Thus, the percentage of sector  import volume attributable to pipe increased from 54.3 to 76.3  percent, while the share attributable to ferrous metal imports  (rolled metal, steel), on the contrary, decreased, amounting to  23.7 percent as opposed to 45.7 percent in January-October 1992.  <H5>  Machine-Building Production </H5>   The import of machinery, equipment, and means of  transportation in January-October 1993 was virtually halved,  amounting to $5.2 billion as opposed to $11.2 billion in  January-October of 1992.    The rate of decrease in the import of machine-building  production is rising. Thus, in January-October 1993  machine-building output amounted to 53.2 percent of import  production--4 percent lower than was the case for  January-September 1993.    We note that the share of rolling stock purchases was  reduced  from 8.3 to 5.1 percent, and of electrical machinery and  equipment--from 20.1 to 14.8 percent, while the share of  purchases of all types of ships increased from 1.2 percent to  5.4 percent, and that of ground transportation means--from 11.9  to 13.3 percent.  <H5>  Foodstuffs </H5>   Food product purchases continue to diminish. Their share of  the total volume of imports decreased from 21.5 percent in  January-October 1992 to 15.8 percent in January-October 1993. In  cost terms, food product purchases were reduced from $6.2  billion to $2.5 billion. The rate of decline of food  purchases--reaching 60 percent--is significantly outpacing the  rate of decline of imports on the whole (45.9 percent).    Food products totaling just $110.7 million were purchased in  October--this comprises just 5 percent of the import volume  increase for October 1993.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Structure of Food Product Purchases, Percent                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Item                     |January-October 1992     |January-October 1993     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Grain                    |60.5                     |52.4                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Raw sugar, white sugar   |16.3                     |29.7                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Poultry                  |6.6                      |4.5                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Flour                    |4.1                      |0.6                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Macaroni products        |4.0                      |2.0                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Vegetable oil            |3.5                      |1.5                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Milk and cream, butter a-|2.0                      |2.7                      |  |nd other fats            |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tea and coffee           |1.9                      |5.0                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Citrus fruits and apples |0.8                      |1.7                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      It is evident that the change in state policy in the sphere  of centralized import purchases has exerted a significant  influence on the dynamics of the structural indices of food  product imports.  <H5>  Medicines </H5>   The share of import purchases attributable to nonfood  consumer products in January-October 1993 amounted to about 7.6  percent, as opposed to 8.8 percent for January-October 1992.    The rate of decline in the import of a number of commodity  groups is significantly outpacing the overall rate of decline of  imports (45.9 percent), constituting:    --79.6 percent, for synthetic fabrics;    --74.2 percent, for footwear;    --70.3 percent, for cotton fabrics;    --62.4 percent, for leather clothing;    --59.8 percent, for knitted articles.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Structure of Nonfood Product Purchases, Percent                              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Item                     |January-October 1992     |January-October 1993     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Clothing                 |64.0                     |79.5                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |textiles                 |28.4                     |46.3                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |knitted articles         |21.3                     |18.4                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |leather items            |11.3                     |9.1                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |fur apparel              |3.0                      |5.7                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Footwear                 |26.4                     |14.6                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Fabric, all varieties    |9.5                      |5.9                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Insofar as these commodities are being imported mainly  through the funds of commercial structures and enterprises, the  factor of effective demand exerts a decisive influence on  changes in their structure.

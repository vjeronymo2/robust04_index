			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: UK equities Part of the reason for yesterday's FT-SE record close is that the UK market seems to have been a proxy for Wall Street during the US Thanksgiving holiday. Admittedly, indications of a stronger US economy are good news for many large British companies. With prospects for a Gatt agreement favourable, there may be fewer reasons to sell the market. But London might prefer to assess the degree of follow-through in New York before setting out to scale higher peaks - unless investors are prepared to overlook the continuing impact on UK consumer confidence from rising unemployment and falling house prices.</p>

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Arts: Lost in the heart of America - Theatre The Bush has done it again: the theatre's combination of superlative acting and tight directing can make a new play seem much better than it is. This time, however, it is a close-run thing. Naomi Wallace is an immensely promising dramatist. Only when you measure the standard of the acting against the play itself do some of the deficiencies become apparent. The problem, and it is a laudable one, is over-ambition. Even the title is portentous. In the Heart of America plays with so many ideas that it is hard to know which is paramount, and there is just the suspicion that it is a trifle trendy. First there is homosexual love between soldiers (very topical). Then there is ethnic stress in the US - unusual in this case because the minority group is Palestinian Arab-American. Not least, there is the suggestion that some Americans treat all US military interventions abroad as much the same - Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, the Gulf - and cannot even remember which president sent them in: 'Johnson or Bush, whatever the hell his name is.' This last theme would make a play on its own. There is a marvellously drawn character called Boxler, played with matching dexterity by Robert Glenister, for whom war has become a way of life: 'It's the only place that feels like home.' Boxler doesn't want a war where the US has to fight with one hand tied behind its back, as was said of Vietnam. He wants an operation called 'just because'. Boxler, however, is not quite central to the play. The most arresting scenes are between a couple of Americans who go off to the Gulf together, One is conventionally white; the other is a Palestinian American who doesn't speak Arabic and doesn't want to learn. They have a fascination with technology; 'Our first kiss was like seeing an aircraft take off vertically'. These male lovers are quite beautifully played by Richard Dormer and Zubin Varla respectively. Again here is a drama in itself. I have doubts about some of the rest of it. Ms Wallace is better at male characters than female. There is a ghost-like woman from Hanoi - a senior commander of the Viet Cong, she says - who appears (perhaps unintentionally) to look back on the American bombing with nostalgia. It is well played, but doesn't quite fit. And the second act is little too like a repetition of the first. Dominic Dromgoole directs with what one might call military precision, if the military were more precise. Bush Theatre (081) 743 3388.</p>

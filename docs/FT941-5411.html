			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: State aids refuse to die - Subsidies Ask Mr Karel Van Miert, the European competition commissioner, what he is doing to improve the competitiveness of the European economy and he gives two answers: cracking down on illegal state subsidies and liberalising sectors that have traditionally been state-owned monopolies. This may seem odd. After all, the European steel industry is now convulsed by a row over the Commission's decision to sanction Ecu7bn in aid to several inefficient state-owned groups. There is also disquiet at the slow pace of Commission plans for liberalising sectors such as energy and telecommunications. By comparison with the mid-1980s, there has been progress in reducing both state aid and the incidence of monopolies. Mr Van Miert and his two predecessors, Sir Leon Brittan and Mr Peter Sutherland, have taken a fairly tough line. But many sectors of the European economy are still burdened by state aid and monopolies. Government hand-outs to inefficient companies not only waste taxpayers' money; subsidies also distort competition by placing more efficient enterprises at a disadvantage. That is currently the danger in both the steel and the airline sectors. Likewise, persistent monopolies in utility industries mean European businesses pay more than they need for telecommunications, energy, air transport and postal services. More competition would drive down costs and spur the development of trans-European networks which could act as the infrastructural backbone of the single market. The Commission has not moved more aggressively because curbing aid and opening markets often involve job losses. It fears a political backlash which could undermine its authority. 'OK, you could make it a war. But at the end of the day, what interests me is results,' says Mr Van Miert. The Commission has had some successes. It has become more insistent that subsidies be allowed only if they are part of a viable restructuring plan. And the Commission has encouraged member states to prepare aided companies for privatisation. So far, though, the fall in the overall volume of hand-outs has been small. It averaged Ecu89bn a year between 1988 and 1990, down from an average Ecu92bn in the previous three years - a drop to 2 per cent of GDP from 2.2 per cent. Equally, progress on liberalisation has been patchy. Data communications services have been opened to competition, but ordinary voice telephone services will remain monopolies in most countries until 1998 or later. Air transport is being progressively liberalised. But national flag-carriers still typically monopolise take-off and landing slots at airports. The view that even slow progress on curbing state aid and monopolies will enhance Europe's competitiveness is not necessarily accurate. Other regions of the world are also weaning their industries off subsidies and liberalising monopolies.</p>

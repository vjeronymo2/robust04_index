			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW LAPD OFFICERS TO BE GIVEN BERETTAS  </P> <P> Los Angeles police commissioners Tuesday approved the semiautomatic  9-millimeter Beretta pistol as the primary department weapon and authorized  issuing it to officer recruits to give them a better chance against heavily  armed criminals.  </P> <P> Commissioner Robert Talcott called Police Chief Daryl F. Gates' request to  begin furnishing the 16-shot Beretta to new officers "a response in a small way  to try to meet the challenges on the street that officers face on a daily  basis."  </P> <P> The approval followed a two-year pilot program in which officers were allowed  to purchase and use Beretta model 92F 9-millimeter pistols, rather than the  six-shot, .38-caliber Smith &amp; Wesson revolvers they were issued by the  department.  </P> <P> More than 4,600 of the department's 7,900 sworn officers reportedly switched  during the program.  </P> <P> Gates said the Beretta is giving officers "a sense of confidence they did not  have with a six-shooter."  </P> <P> Cmdr. Larry Fetters of the commission staff said other veteran officers may use  the 9-millimeter weapon, but they must buy their own.  </P></p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Markets Report: All eyes on the Fed It was a case yesterday of 'All eyes on the FOMC' as foreign exchanges focused on today's important meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in the US, writes Philip Gawith. The policy-making FOMC is widely expected to sanction a further tightening of monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve. Its deliberations have taken on added importance following last Friday's unscheduled meeting between President Clinton and Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed. Markets remain unsure whether that meeting signified political interference in monetary policy, or heralds an even quicker tightening of policy than previously anticipated. Markets were very quiet ahead of the FOMC with few noticeable trends in trading. The dollar finished slightly firmer in London against the D-Mark at DM1.6979 from DM1.6961 on Friday. It finished marginally higher against sterling - Dollars 1.4845 from Dollars 1.4888 - and was also firmer against the yen, closing at Y106.920 from Y106.035. The D-Mark was slightly weaker in Europe, with the market anticipating further cuts in the repo rate, while sterling weakened following the release of mixed non-EU trade figures. Trading got off to a slow start in Europe yesterday with Japanese markets closed on account of the spring equinox national holiday. London traders said the morning was 'exceptionally quiet' before the US market opened. Mr David Barrett, trader at Natwest Markets, said foreign exchanges were 'blinkered to anything but Fed rate hikes'. Many corporates preferred to stay on the sideline with much of the business inter-bank. Markets remain confused about how to interpret last Friday's meeting, but there is a broad consensus that at least a 25 basis points tightening in the Federal Funds rate can be expected. This would be in keeping with Mr Greenspan's gradualist reputation. A minority view is that there may be a 50 basis points increase in the discount rate. Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International, said the Fed should be seeking to stabilise financial markets. After Friday's meeting, though, widely condemned in the markets as insensitive, there is a risk that the Fed is in a lose-lose situation. No change, or a small increase, could well result in a dollar sell-off. A 50 basis points hike, on the other hand, could 'spook' the market by causing it to think that the inflation threat is worse than the Fed has let on. The anticipated tightening in interest rates was reflected yesterday in the Fed Funds rate which was trading in the 3.31-3.37 per cent range, compared to the 3.25 per cent target level set by the Fed. The rate later fell back to 3.31 per cent after the Fed added temporary reserves to the banking system through three-day system repurchase agreements. In the futures market the June eurodollar contract traded at 95.58, discounting interest rates of 4.42 per cent in June. Three month US money is currently trading at 3.87 per cent/3.93 per cent. Analysts were agreed that no matter what the Fed does, there is little short-term upside for the dollar. Mr Lyons said the market had already discounted the tightening. He said the upward movement in rates across the yield curve, since the Fed last tightened on February 4, was an effective tightening of policy. The D-Mark traded slightly weaker in Europe. Unchanged against the French franc at FFr3.407, it finished at L987.7 from L989.3 against the Italian lira. It was also lower against the Spanish peseta closing in London at Pta81.87 from Pta82.14 on Friday. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at the Bank of America, said the D-Mark was not going anywhere, as the dollar remained well underpinned, while a further cut in the German repo rate was a constraint on would-be D-Mark bulls. He predicted a further 5-7 basis points cut from the current level of 5.88 per cent. The prospect of higher interest rates in the US put a dampener on the futures market. The June three-month euromark contract lost two basis points to settle at 94.50. The December contract fell by three points to 94.89, indicating that the market expects rates to fall by about 60 basis points by December. Three month money is currently trading at 5.70/ 5.80 per cent. In the cash markets, German call money continues to trade at 5.70/5.80 per cent reflecting market expectations of a cut in the repo rate. Sterling had a fairly quiet day finishing at DM2.5205, half a pfennig below the DM2.525 where it closed on Friday. It weakened on the release of February non-EU trade figures. Stripped of oil and erratics, the deficit was Pounds 673m, up from Pounds 612m in January. In the discount market the Bank of England cleared a small Pounds 250m shortage with afternoon assistance of Pounds 274m. Sterling futures barely moved with the June contract closing one point firmer at 94.84. In the cash market three month money was bid at 5 1/4 per cent.</p>

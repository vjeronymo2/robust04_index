			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Come, I have a surprise for you, promised Alain  Juppe when he invited journalists to the French Foreign Ministry  this afternoon. There was in fact a surprise: the announcement  by the foreign minister of the normalization of relations  between France and the People's Republic of China [PRC]. Here  is Alain Juppe's statement recorded by Luc Lemonnier:    [Begin Juppe recording] The political weight of China and  its  economic power today and tomorrow justifies France's decision to  resume the ties of trust along the line of what General de  Gaulle did in 1964. We have thus conducted talks that have  borne their results today, and I am pleased. We have, on the  other hand, explained to Taiwan that we would honor our  commitments and that in the future we will exercise  self-restraint in the supply of arms. Now I hope that all this  will be implemented through the resumption of an intense  political dialogue with Beijing and through the strengthening of  economic relations.    I remind you that today, our share of the Chinese market is  1.85 percent, while Germany's is five percent. The Chinese  market is huge. The rate of China's development -- more than 13  percent -- is the fastest in the world. Thus I think we have  considerable possibilities that should be achieved now. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Scare by Russia stuns security conference RUSSIA yesterday threw inter-national diplomacy into confusion by announcing a radical return to a cold war foreign policy and then retracting the statement, explaining that it was no more than a scare tactic. In one of the most bizarre diplomatic incidents of recent years, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, left ministers from 52 western and eastern European countries dumbfounded when he said Russia was reneging on its post-communist policies of co-operation with the West. For good measure, he also demanded an end to the arms embargo against Serbia. His short, but explicit, statement exploded like a bombshell on the opening day of the two-day ministerial meeting in Stockholm of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, an organisation dedicated to conflict prevention and management and the respect of human rights. As stunned ministers crowded round Mr Kozyrev, long regarded as a moderate in the Russian leadership, to demand clarification, he coolly announced that they should wait for his second statement. Some 45 minutes later he rose to his feet to tell his amazed audience that he did not mean a word of what he had said. 'Neither President Yeltsin, who remains the leader and guarantor of Russian domestic and foreign policy, nor I myself, as minister for foreign affairs, would ever agree with what I read out in my previous statement.' With no apparent sign of rem-orse, the normally restrained and diplomatic Mr Kozyrev thanked those present for 'the opportunity to use this rhetorical de-vice'. It was inspired by the most serious concern that everyone should be aware of the genuine threats faced by the Russian leadership 'on our course towards a post-Communist Europe'. Mr Kozyrev has remained outspokenly anti-conservative - warning that the conduct of a rational foreign policy was being made impossible by a growing nationalist tide in Russia. His device to warn people of a conservative victory does not contradict his beliefs. 'A wake-up call' is how Mrs Galina Sidorova, the Russian spokeswoman, described Mr Kozyrev's first statement. Only an hour or so previously, however, she and other Russian delegates had been rendered livid and speechless by his intervention - of which none of them had received advance notice. Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, who left Stockholm last night to join Chancellor Helmut Kohl for an official visit to Russia, was also unamused. 'An international forum is not the place for such behaviour,' he said. Mr Anatolyi Zlenko, the Ukrainian foreign minister, said: 'Maybe Mr Kozyrev has a sense of humour, but it is dangerous to use such tactics.' Mr Kozyrev's speech was 'like smoking - dangerous to health', said Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the US secretary of state, lighting another cigarette. In his first speech, Mr Kozyrev said: 'We clearly recognise that our traditions in many respects, if not fundamentally, lie in Asia, and this sets limits to our rapprochement with western Europe.' He accused Nato and the nine-nation Western European Union defence organisation of drawing up plans to strengthen their military presence in the Baltic and other regions 'on the territory of the former Soviet Union', and of interfering in Bosnia and the internal affairs of Yugoslavia. Clearly, sanctions against Serbia were dictated by this policy, he said. 'We demand that they be lifted, and if this does not happen, we reserve our right to take the necessary unilateral measures to defend our interests, especially since they cause us economic harm.' He said the former Soviet Union was 'a post-imperial space', in which Russia had to defend its interests, if necessary by military means.

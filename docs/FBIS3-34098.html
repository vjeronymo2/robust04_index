			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Dhaka, Feb 1 (AFP) -- At least 15,000 residents of  the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka Tuesday joined a mourning march  and mass prayers for the six opposition supporters gunned down  by rivals in post-election violence, witnesses said.    The marchers, including leaders from Shayk Hasina Wajed's  main-opposition Awami League (AL) and the left-wing Workers  Party, carried coffins of the dead to the downtown Baitul  Mukarram national mosque.    They silently carried black flags and a banner demanding the  punishment of the killers, and prayed for the dead.    The marchers were mostly from the Lalbagh area, in the old  parts of Dhaka, where six people were killed and more than 30  injured Monday when AL's victory procession was fired on by  unidentified gunmen, a day after the country's first mayoral  city elections, police and witnesses said.    A policeman on duty said the number of mourners could be as  high as 30,000.    The mourners later buried the dead without incident in a  nearby graveyard, but under heavy security, witnesses said.    Security was intensified Tuesday as the residents staged a  half-day protest strike, and the atmosphere was tense, with  shops, schools and businesses remaining closed.    "We have strong police and BDR (para-military Bangladesh  Rifles) forces deployed in the area," one police officer at the  Lalbagh police station said.    No violence was reported during the stoppage.    Witnesses and police had said earlier that unidentified  gunmen opened fire on supporters of AL mayoral candidate  Mohammad Hanif, who took a commanding lead in weekend polls,  killing six. Eighteen supporters were reported to be in stable  condition Tuesday.    But Dhaka newspapers reported Tuesday that the attack was  carried out by Abdul Aziz, a member of the ruling Bangladesh  Nationalist Party and a losing candidate for city commissioner,  and his supporters.    The mass circulation Daily ITTEFAQ newspaper said Abdul Aziz  had gone into hiding, and one resident said unidentified people  ransacked and looted his home late Monday.    The government, in a press note late Monday said six  suspects  from two rival groups have been arrested in connection with the  "unfortunate incident."    Angry mourners Monday also had attacked three government  ministers when they went to the hospital to pay homage to the  dead, but police rescued them unscathed by throwing tear gas and  using batons.    During Sunday's first ever mayoral and city commissioner  elections, one school boy was killed and more than 200 were  injured in sporadic clashes between rival groups.    Hanif is leading Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's BNP nominee  ex-  mayor Mirza Abbas, by 75,200 votes, in 704 out of 737 districts  in Dhaka.    In the port city of Chittagong, AL candidate Mohiuddin  Chowdhury was unofficially declared mayor, based on preliminary  election results.    While BNP clinched victory in the cities of Khulna and  Rajshahi.    Because of the violence, the election commission cancelled  voting in 26 centres and withheld results in three others.    The official BANGLADESH SANGBAD SANGSTHA News Agency said  the  results in four districts "could not be traced," but the total  number of votes cast there was 72,080. BSS did not elaborate,  but there was a report that a recount would be held.    The elections were crucial, as it was considered the first  popularity test of the two main political groups since the 1991  parliamentary elections under a caretaker government.</p>

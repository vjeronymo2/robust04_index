			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Royal Bank of Scotland pays Pounds 32m for failed US bank THE ROYAL Bank of Scotland Group has bought the failed New England Savings Bank for a little more than Pounds 32m. The move is part of the Royal Bank's aim to derive 10 per cent of its profits from the US. The deal through Citizens Financial Group, its US subsidiary, involved the purchase of NESB assets worth almost Pounds 500m from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the assumption of about Pounds 456m of the bank's deposits, the Royal Bank said. All 21 NESB branches will re-open today under the name of Citizens Bank. In a separate deal, Citizens has signed a back-to-back agreement with Lehman Brothers to sell Pounds 114m of NESB's commercial and commercial real estate loans.</p>

Health  problems related to his gastrointestinal system have forced the  minister to resign.    Perez Davila coordinated the health area of President Rafael  Caldera's government and later headed the liaison commission  with the Health and Social Welfare Ministry.    In spite of his youth and having a good professional record,  today Perez Davila is leaving the ministry for health reasons.  He expressed his regrets to President Rafael Caldera. It was  learned yesterday morning that Perez Davila sent a letter to the  president of the Republic in which he explained the reasons for  his resignation. In that letter he told President Rafael Caldera  that he is sure the work of the new authorities at the Health  and Social Welfare Ministry will be successful, because the  persons working in the ministry are highly qualified and  motivated.    President Caldera will now have to appoint a new health and  social welfare minister, which must be a person highly qualified  to direct a ministry confronting a serious hospital crisis.</p>

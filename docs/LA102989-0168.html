			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'SOCIAL' SOLUTION FOR HOUSING  </P> <P> I must commend Hartman on his article. We have all heard the statistics  concerning housing costs, government policies and ultimately about the millions  of people who end up on the streets, but proposing a solution instead of  pussyfooting around the issue was a fresh angle that Hartman tackled superbly.  </P> <P> We all must come to the realization that providing the best housing, at the  best cost for the most people, is going to have to be a nonprofit effort.  </P> <P> Hartman's ideas about a restructured housing system and reallocated government  expenditures are not unrealistic. Before they can work effectively, however, we  have to dismount from our high horses and recognize the housing crisis for what  it is -- an increasingly severe product of a lax system which has been fueled  by greediness.  </P> <P> SARAH R.

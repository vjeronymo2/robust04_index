			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Management (The Growing Business): How to make sure your company is not sold down the river Selling your business is no easy task, particularly in a recession, and many vendors call in a merchant bank, accountant or specialist broker to help, writes Charles Batchelor. But vendors have in the past complained they were given an exaggerated idea of the price their business might fetch and that the adviser was not active enough in looking for prospects. To ensure you deal with a competent firm you should meet and compare at least three advisers, suggests Tim Lyle, a director of Livingstone Fisher,* an acquisitions and disposals specialist. Ask who will be leading the assignment and make sure that he or she will actually be available when needed. This avoids having junior staff learn at your expense. Quiz the adviser on what similar deals he has handled successfully. This ensures that he has the capability and that the deal will be important enough for him to devote time to. Find out if the firm has any experience of your sector. Obtain names of other clients you can contact for a reference. The adviser should be able to say: When it would be best to sell. It may make sense not to do a deal immediately but to turn the company round or expand it further to maximise the sale price. How it is proposed to find potential buyers from around the world. How confidentiality will be maintained. Whether the adviser has handled sales to management teams as well as to corporate buyers. A buy-out may make more sense. How the deal would be structured to minimise capital gains tax. It is important to discuss fees before going any further. Avoid a fee structure based on an hourly charge which does not set a maximum figure. Insist that the adviser shares the risk of failure by agreeing a much lower maximum fee if no deal results, including a decision on your part not to go ahead. Do not pay any fee in advance. Expect to be invoiced, say, quarterly in arrears but to pay a 'success fee' immediately on legal completion. *Acre House, 11-15 William Road, London NW1 3ER. Tel 071 388 7000.</p>

			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Banking on Mr Clarke THE LORD MAYOR'S guests were treated to two very different, but equally important, speeches at last night's Bankers' and Merchants' dinner at the City's Guildhall. Top of the bill was Mr Kenneth Clarke, promising much but revealing little on his first public outing as chancellor of the exchequer. But it was the valedictory address of Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, reflecting on the lessons of his 10 years as governor of the Bank of England, which will have unsettled the stomachs of the City dignitaries. Mr Clarke's performance, the first 'Mansion House' speech to be accompanied by June strawberries rather than October apple pie, was that of the consummate politician rather than the economist or financier. He pleased his immediate audience by stressing the importance his government attaches to maintaining low inflation and returning the public finances to order. But Mr Clarke also played to the wider gallery, emphasising his Midlands roots, his knowledge of industry and commerce while placing a new emphasis upon economic growth and higher living standards. No changes But Mr Clarke mixes political cunning with his populism. His speech contained no hostages to fortune. Indeed, it contained almost nothing of substance to exercise the minds and computers of listening City analysts. On monetary policy, the chancellor announced no changes to the framework his predecessor announced last autumn. He confirmed the government's target range for underlying inflation of 1-4 per cent and intends to monitor a broad range of indicators. But how does businesses' desire for a competitive and stable exchange rate fit into this picture? No target on display. On fiscal policy, the chancellor aims to 'restore the public finances to better health and back towards balance over the medium term'. Growth alone, he said, would not do the trick. But does this require more discretionary fiscal tightening on top of those measures announced in the Budget? And will this mean further tax increases or spending cuts? No clues on offer. As for the mix of monetary and fiscal policy that the chancellor thinks can deliver sustainable growth without running into trade difficulties, the subject was not addressed. Is the exchange rate sufficiently competitive ? If wage inflation starts to pick up, will the chancellor use interest rates to force the exchange rate higher or tighten fiscal policy to choke off demand? How can the British economy, dogged by the twin Budget and trade deficits, possibly deliver sustainable growth and higher real wages for those in work? No discussion provided. Inflation trap Yet it was Mr Leigh-Pemberton who sent chills down his audience's collective spine. 'We now have low inflation combined with economic recovery, and this offers the prospect of sustained improvement for the first time in many years,' he said, quoting from his own first Mansion House speech delivered in October 1983. 'The sad fact that I could use exactly the same words today reflects the principal failure of policy in the intervening period - that we did not keep inflation under control.' The Bank, the governor said, has learnt from this failure. 'The new policy framework which was put in place after our departure from the ERM is one which will not only, I believe, prove successful and workable in the UK , but is also being applied in other countries.' But with one exception: the Bank of England, in contrast with its European partners, remains the servant of the executive rather than of parliament. Nor is the Bank's status likely to change, despite Mr Leigh-Pemberton's advice. The chancellor has made it plain that independence for the bank is not on his own agenda, although his speech suggested he is content to let others go on debating the matter. Yet successive British governments, making promises just like Mr Clarke's, have repeatedly been willing to win elections by delivering higher living standards to those in work today at the expense of higher inflation in the future. This is the prime cause of Britain's repeated boom-bust cycles. Mr Clarke's most important task is to show that he knows how to avoid this trap.</p>

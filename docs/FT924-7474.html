			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / AT&amp;T alliances open new market AMERICAN Telephone and Telegraph aims to claim a leadership role in what is predicted to become a multi-billion dollar market for 'personal communicators' - hand-held devices that combine the functions of a cellular telephone, facsimile machine and pen-computer. Yesterday NEC and Toshiba, two of Japan's leading electronics manufacturers, announced that they will build personal communicator products based upon AT&amp;T technology. These agreements follow an alliance between AT&amp;T and Eo, a Silicon Valley company that has designed what it claims is 'the world's first personal communicator'. It is to be manufactured by Matsushita with distribution and marketing support from Marubeni, the Japanese trading company. AT&amp;T Consumer Products group will also sell the Eo product under its own label through its Phone Center stores in the US. 'These personal communications devices will become as ubiquitous as the telephone or the television,' said William Warwick, president of AT&amp;T Microelectronics, the group's semiconductor unit. 'It is more than exciting. It is a brand new communications world.' He predicts that there could be as many as 1bn of the devices in use in 10 years. Personal communicators allow users to exchange voice, facsimile and electronic mail messages via telephone lines or cellular wireless telephone links. They incorporate an electronic 'pen interface' so that users can simply jot down a note on an electronic notepad and send it by facsimile or electronic mail just by choosing a name from a phone list stored in the device. Mr Warwick said that later generations of personal communicators will incorporate graphics and full-motion video capabilities. Video conferencing and transmission of high-resolution still images will be available on the portable gadgets 'sooner than you think', he said. Personal communicators represent a potentially huge new source of data communications traffic for AT&amp;T's communications networks. AT&amp;T EasyLink Services has developed electronic mail services for the personal communicators. Polish investment, Page 28</p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TELL TV TIMES: WHAT NETWORK DO YOU TURN TO FOR NEWS?  </P> <P> During the current crisis in the Middle East, more and more people are getting  their news from television, such as from "World News Tonight" with Peter  Jennings, below. When there's a news even or crisis in the world, to what show  on which network do you turn? Please write and tell us.  </P> <P> Send responses to Tell TV Times, TV Times, Times Mirror Square, Los Angeles,  Calif. 90053. Or fax them to (213) 237-7630. Letters must be signed with full  name and address.  </P> <P> Here are responses to the Aug. 19 question: How do you rate daytime's talk  shows?  </P> <P> I watch "Live With Regis and Kathie Lee" every day. I occasionally see "The  Oprah Winfrey Show."  </P> <P> Clair Altmann, Irvine  </P> <P> Phil Donahue is caring, warm and well-spoken. He is fair to all parties when  dealing with serious topics and also very attractive.  </P> <P> Oprah Winfrey does a good job with the interviews.  </P> <P> Joan Rivers doesn't speak well and laughs too often at her own jokes.  </P> <P> Karen Louise Kent, Burbank  </P> <P> We don't like Bryant "Grumble" and can't stand Deborah Norville of NBC's  "Today." Poor chemistry.  </P> <P> Majorie Seitz, Loma Linda  </P></p>

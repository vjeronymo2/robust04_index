			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY ACTS TO EASE AEROSPACE JOB CUTS  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved two measures Tuesday aimed  at easing the blow of defense industry cutbacks on the economy of the San  Fernando Valley and other defense-reliant communities.  </P> <P> Supervisors voted to apply for a $120,000 federal grant to determine why  contractors are leaving Los Angeles and to consolidate job hunting and  retraining assistance to the unemployed.  </P> <P> They also instructed the county Economic Roundtable to join with the county's  Aerospace Task Force to study the possible conversion of former defense  industry plants into centers for civilian science research.  </P> <P> The grant is part of a fund for sudden and severe economic dislocation. The  county application cites the closure of the Lockheed plant in Burbank,  elimination of 150 jobs at McDonnell Douglas in Palmdale and extensive layoffs  at Douglas Aircraft Co. in Torrance.  </P> <P> As part of county efforts, Supervisor Edmund D. Edelman recommended that a  panel of experts from universities, aerospace firms and development agencies  determine the areas of research in which Los Angeles County is a national or  regional leader. The information could be used to develop a science park or for  such ideas as putting former defense industries to work on mass transit  systems, he said.  </P> <P> "Unless surplus research and advanced manufacturing resources are converted to  civilian applications, competitive strength of the Los Angeles region will  diminish," Edelman said.  </P></p>

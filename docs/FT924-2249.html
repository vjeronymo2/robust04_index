			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / People: Around the world to graze at Geest Kevin O'Donoghue (left), previously managing director of Phileas Fogg snacks, has had his appetite whetted by Geest's 'very big plans for added-value convenience foods' and has taken over as managing director of the newly-formed subsidiary Geest Convenience Foods. The fresh produce and prepared foods group has identified a number of chilled markets where it has been investing heavily; it has recently spent Pounds 10m on what is supposed to be the most sophisticated pasta-making production facility in northern Europe. Following two acquisitions in the past three years, Geest is the UK's leading supplier of chilled pasta and number two in chilled pizza. The incoming managing director's ambition is to expand convenience foods, via organic growth, acquisition and partnership, tenfold over the next five years. O'Donoghue, 42, joined Phileas Fogg in 1988, brought in by the founders of Consett-based Derwent Valley Foods who had, in 1982, started what became a high-profile start-up in north-east England. Very successful in developing snacks such as tortilla chips and Californian corn chips, the three founders wanted to devote more time to business interests outside the UK, and employed O'Donoghue as managing director of Phileas Fogg. He claims to have doubled turnover there, trebled profits and 'grown the brand to a must-stock item for most of the multiples'. Previously, O'Donoghue had been president of United Biscuits in Brazil, setting up a joint venture biscuit company with a Brazilian flour-milling organisation. He describes himself as having previously 'done the rounds' at United Biscuits, which he joined in 1973 from Powell Duffryn.</p>

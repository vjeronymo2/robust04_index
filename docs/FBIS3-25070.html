South Africa's ambassador to Bophuthatswana, Dr Tjaart van  der Walt, confirmed on Monday that the SA embassy in  Bophuthatswana will close in April. The homeland would then be  regarded as part of South Africa in terms of legislation  repealing the TVBC [Transkei - Bophuthatswana - Venda - Ciskei]  Status Act. Bophuthatswana has failed to achieve international  recognition since it accepted Pretoria-style independence in the  seventies.</p>

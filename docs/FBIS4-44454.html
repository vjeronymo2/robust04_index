			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Is It Depressed or Stable? An Analysis of China's </F> Stock Market"]    [Excerpt] Editor's Note The stock market  is extraordinarily sensitive. The investment psychology of major  economic decision makers and of the shareholding public may  cause stock market fluctuations. Conversely, stock market  developments also have a certain affect on the decisions of  decision makers and the shareholding public. For some time since  the beginning of 1994, the stock market has been at low ebb. How  this should be regarded -- is it depressed or is it stable? --  requires calm analysis. Both the decision making level and the  shareholding public must maintain a clear head to make prudent  decisions.    Although China's stock markets got off to a good start  during  the first week of 1994, during the remaining three weeks of  January, the overall share price index on the Shanghai and  Shenzhen markets continue to slide. By 28 January, the overall  share price index on the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets had  fallen 13.62 and 11.87 points respectively. This brings to mind  1993 when the share price index for the year fluctuated within a  narrow range, and groups active in the share market  (shareholders, share evaluators, and securities traders) reacted  the same way as the share price index, reaching the conclusion  that China's stock markets had entered a depressed and turbid  state.    The author disagrees. On the contrary, he feels that China's  stock markets are not depressed but stable.    Manifestations of the Stability of China's Stock Markets    First, for the year as a whole, the stock markets made  virtually no big leaps during 1993. The Shanghai overall share  price index bobbed around near 900 points, and the Shenzhen  overall share price index mostly shifted around 250 points. The  share price index projects the best picture of market activity.  No matter whether it goes up or down, so long as there are no  alarmingly dangerous leaps, when the share price index moves  gradually within relative limits -- including a gradually  decline -- one should feel optimistically that the stock market  is exhibiting a stable trend. Even though the overall view is  that the stock market trend was toward a slide in 1993, this  slide was gradual, and fluctuations were not great. This was the  most direct manifestation of the stability of China's stock  markets.    Second, no major surprises occurred in China's stock markets  during 1993. This precluded the most direct reasons for stock  market upheavals. Such a beneficial situation was the best  possible reminder for those engaged in stock market activity.  Thus those who directly played a part in stock market activity  were in a peaceful frame of mind and went about their business  in a steady way to lay the foundation for stability in China's  stock markets. Though some buying wars occurred during 1993, and  some spurious information circulated, causing tumult in the  stock market, the vigorous intervention of the authorities and  the close cooperation of shareholders promptly defused the  problem to eliminate disturbances. Thus, China's stock markets  showed stability.    Third, 5 billion shares were issued publicly, and they were  sold in every city in the country. Such an action was  unprercedented since founding of the people's republic.  Furthermore, the safe, orderly, and complete fulfillment of this  task even more inspired people. In addition, by comparison with  1992, listings of A shares by the Shanghai and Shenzhen  exchanges totaled 174 for a 2.35 fold increase. Listings of B  shares by the two exchanges totaled 41 for a 1.28 fold increase.  Listings of the shares of juridical entities totaled 17 for a  4.67 fold increase. This manifold issuing and listing activity  greatly eased the discrepancy between supply and demand in  China's stock markets, and the whole process was completed  without fanfare. This is the best indicator of the stability of  China's stock markets.    Fourth, departments in charge of negotiable securities  recently announced that 5.5 billion shares of stock would be  issued openly during 1994. This loosening of the "share supply"  strongly confirms the government's confidence in the stability  and momentum of China's stock markets. It may be further  inferred that it is only because of the stability of China's  stock markets that the government is extremely pleased, and has  the assurance needed to increase the issuance of shares by 5.5  billion. If one assumes that China's stock markets are depressed  rather than stable, it is very difficult to imagine that the  government would loosen rather than tighten the "share supply."  (Note: The author has coined the term "share supply," from the  term "money supply." It applies to the amount of shares issued.  If the amount issued is large, this is termed a loosening of the  share supply and vice versa).    Reasons for the Stability of China's Stock Markets    1. Gradual Founding and Improvement of the Legal System. The  turbulence in China's stock markets of recent years attests to  the truth of the saying that "without rules, nothing can be done  well." Consequently, once China's stock markets suffered  setbacks and had to try harder, the establishment and perfection  of stock market laws and regulations became a priority matter  for the Chinese Government. The "Temporary Regulations on the  Regulation of Stock Share Issuance and Trading," which the State  Council promulgated in April 1993, and "Corporation Law of the  People's Republic of China," which the NPC promulgated in  December 1993, are notable examples. This brought the Chinese  share system and stocks markets under legal regulation for the  first time. Today, the number of national level documents  pertaining to share system laws and regulations, articles,  provisional regulations, etc. number more than 20. In addition,  the securities exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen, and in every  jurisdiction in the country have drawn up regulations and  articles that apply to their own circumstances, thereby  beginning to shape a legal system for China's share system and  stock markets, which lays a foundation for the stability of  China's stock markets.    2. Loosening share supply to ease the share shortage. It  must  be admitted that the doubling and redoubling of share prices of  the past several years has been extremely abnormal. The main  reason for this was a tightening of the money supply which  produced a huge gap between the supply and demand for shares.  The issuance of 5 billion worth of shares in 1993 eased the  supply problem and expanded listings somewhat, giving more  shareholders a chance to take part in stock market operation.  Therefore, the fall in share prices is entirely normal; the  stock market positively should not be blamed. Loosening of the  share supply has been an effective means of stabilizing China's  stock markets.    3. Determined Stamping Out of Illegal Trading. Illegal  trading (including insider trading and trading between legal  entities without approval, people issuing and trading shares  unauthorizedly outside the market) poses an extremely great  threat to the legal trading of shares inside markets. It can  indirectly influence popular feeling and damage confidence, or  even cause a hedging flow of share capital inside or outside the  market, which can become a damaging factor that causes market  upheavals. In 1993, the Chinese Government resolutely stamped  out spontaneous illegal black market trading, thereby ensuring  the stability of China's stock markets.    4. Crackdown on Speculation, Improving Supervision and  Control. Improper speculation will directly set off market  upheavals. For example, spreading of false information, insider  trading, cross trading, and abuse of official position to obtain  shares are all within the category of improper speculation. Any  such conduct can alter the direction of flow of share capital  causing one party to rejoice at the expense of another party's  sadness, thereby making the market fluctuate abnormally. In  1993, the authorities concerned adopted measures and took action  to control the quality of information passed around, and  seriously punished offenders. They also firmly enforced the  "Three Impartials" [sangong 0005 0361] principle, thereby  reducing deer [lu 7773] markets to stabilize the stock markets.    5. Wringing the Water Out of the Stock Markets. The sharp  increase in share prices during recent years has been complex.  Therefore, the primary and secondary market share price, and  market value are seriously at odds with original value causing a  bubble phenomenon. The 1993 increase in shares and various  measures gradually squeezed water out of the stock market,  eliminating the bubble phenomenon for a great narrowing of the  gap between the original share price and the primary and  secondary market share price. This has restored the original  value of shares. It is a major element in stock market  stabilization.    6. Open and Fair Issuance of Subscription Forms. The  shortage  of shares and the even worse shortage of subscription forms led  directly to the "10 August affair." In 1993, subscription forms  were issued openly and fairly, most forms being issued in  unlimited numbers so that everyone had an opportunity to buy  shares. It dispelled the concentration in the hands of a few of  opportunities to buy, narrowed the difference between the  issuing price and the list price, and successfully suppressed  subscription form scalping and stock scalping by large illegal  traders, thereby creating stable conditions for truthfulness in  stock price listings.    7. Gradual Maturation of Shareholders. Risk awareness has  become a part of most shareholders. Haphazard coat tailing,  stock churning, and other stupidities are no longer in vogue in  the stock market. Many shareholders are not adept at analyzing  the market and entering in prudently. Consequently, it is only  natural that the stock market is stable.    8. Rise in Bank Interest Rates and Issuance of Government  Bonds. The continuous rise in bank interest rates in less than  two months during 1993, and the issuance of 30 billion yuan  worth of government bonds immobilized most savings, thereby  causing a severe shortage of funds for share speculation.  Interest rates stood up well to share dividends. When people  compared their confidence in the banks with stock market risk,  they chose the banks. In a certain sense, both bank funds and  stock market funds stabilized.    9. A fine political and economic situation. During 1993,  virtually no serious political or economic ups and downs  occurred. In particular, the macroeconomic regulation and  control measures of June, and the assumption that the market  economy would continue were keystones in the creation of stock  market stability.    Reasons for the Mistaken Notion That the Stock Markets  Are Depressed    Just why is it that some people have come to the conclusion  that China's stock markets are depressed?    1. Lopsided comparisons with the past several years. What  have the past several years been like? During 1990 and 1991,  share prices increased manifold. Against the special background  of the times, stock market operation was completely askew. Some  people's rambling summarization of experiences in stock  speculation at that time make others laugh when they think about  it. It was less a boom than chaos. And today? Thanks to the  building of a legal system and other factors, particularly the  gradual increase in the number of shares issued and market  trading, China's stock markets have become routine. The spread  between primary and secondary market prices is also reasonable.  As a result, wild rises in share prices have naturally  disappeared. If one makes a lopsided comparison with this state  of affairs, of course he will reach the conclusion that the  stock markets are depressed. However, what we need is stability  and not the chaos of a false boom.    2. Misunderstanding of the Expansion of Stock Market  Capacity. China's share system must be resolutely continued.  Expansion of stock market capacity is inevitable. Some people  feel that the expansion of capacity led to stock market  depression. This is a biased view. During the last half of 1993,  stock market expansion was particularly intense yet the markets  did not falter dramatically. The overall share price index on  the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges hovered around the 870 and  250 mark. Moreover, it was precisely this expansion of capacity  that eased the share supply problem, suppressed speculation,  brought in many new shareholders, and created conditions for  enterprise share system scale operation. If any difference about  depression and stability remain, that is bound to produce a  misunderstanding about this expansion. No matter, continuing to  expand stock market capacity is the inevitable result of the  on-going development of share system pilot projects.    3. Efforts To Solidify Personal Benefits. Some old  shareholders and securities traders are prone to feel that the  stock markets are depressed. This is because of the following:  1) As a result of the release of large amounts of share capital,  returns from the shares they hold have depreciated rapidly; 2)  when the cost index of shareholdings if fairly high, it is  difficult to attract shareholders to buy and sell; 3) the leeway  for speculation is reduced; 4) the market price and the original  price are close, which slows trading and reduces securities  traders' trading fees; 5) idle funds enter the market gingerly,  securities traders' business volume declining as a result. For  the foregoing reasons, both old shareholders and some securities  traders' vested interests and incremental increase in returns  are eroded. In order to solidify their personal interests, they  naturally hope that the more the market "booms" the better, and  the less market capacity expands the better, because in both  cases they can reap tremendous returns in the long run.  Because of their business interest, they naturally have a  pessimistic view.    Conclusions and Suggestions    1. The author positively does not advocate an unabated slide  in the share price index but rather stands for a correct  understanding of current market conditions. The author hopes  that the share price index will gradually rise, but not shoot  up; otherwise a share price decrease in the future will mean  greater losses for trading groups engaged in stock market  activity.    2. We should cherish the stable and favorable stock market  situation. The media and stock market trading groups should not  one-sidedly fan a stock market "boom." A stable stock market is  important to China's social stability, and it is also the key to  intensifying trials of the share system. One must understand  that maintenance of stock market stability is no easy matter,  and that its destruction may occur in an instant. Furthermore,  its destruction may rock the whole society.    3. We must continue to build and perfect applicable laws and  regulations, persist in the expansion of capacity, adhere to the  unlimited issuance of subscription forms, continue to loosen the  share supply, use bank interest rates and treasury returns  ingeniously, improve use of bank interest rates and treasury  bond returns, improve supervision and control, and stamp out  illegal trading. Then China's stock markets will certainly be  stable, and will move in the direction of a real boom.</p>

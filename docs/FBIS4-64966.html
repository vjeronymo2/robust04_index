			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri arrived in  Athens today on a two-day visit during which he will hold talks  with Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and with Foreign  Minister Karolos Papoulias, and also with the minister for  European affairs. Over to Messaoud Boulatiour for more details  about the visit:    [Begin Boulatiour recording] The main focus of the foreign  minister's visit is the consolidation of cooperation between  Algeria and the European Union [EU] ahead of the EU's finance  ministers' meeting due to be held on 16 and 17 May. This  meeting is expected to examine an EU aid package for projects to  revive and develop the economy in Algeria, particularly as  Greece is the current chairman of the Union.    Greek sources also said that Mr. Dembri's current visit to  Greece will enable both sides to discuss the supply of Algerian  gas to Athens. According to an agreement signed between the two  countries, in 1996 Algeria will start exporting gas in an amount  of between $55 and $60 million per year. By then Greece should  have completed the construction of a pipeline in the Gulf of  Salamis, southeast of the capital, Athens. [end recording]</p>

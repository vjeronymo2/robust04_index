Reports also say the U.S. secretary of state is  planning to visit the region next month in a fresh bid to  advance the peace process, especially on the Syrian and Lebanese  tracks.    The United States apparently attaches great importance to  the  current Washington talks, due to its firm conviction that peace  in the Middle East is impossible without Syria and that reaching  a Syrian-Israeli agreement will open all the doors of the region  to a just, comprehensive, and durable peace.    The Geneva summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill  Clinton centered on the essence of Middle East peace. It  concluded that there is a need to establish a real and firm  peace accepted by the peoples of the region -- a peace that  reflects positively on their countries and that can withstand  successive developments. President al-Asad called such a peace  the peace of the brave, in accordance with which occupation will  end and Arab rights will be restored.    For its part, Syria has announced it will continue to seek a  just and comprehensive peace. Perhaps the best evidence of its  belief in peace, and in efforts to achieve it, is the talks it  is holding in Washington, despite public Israeli pronouncements  that reflect no change in the Israeli position, even after the  Geneva summit. The summit tossed the ball into the Israeli  court. It proved Syria really believes in peace and is  struggling to achieve a just, honorable solution accepted by  current generations and safeguarded by future generations --  peace that enables them to devote their resources to development  and progress.    We say this because Israeli officials, especially the head  of  the Israeli government, have recently cast doubt on Syria's  intentions and sought to undermine its role and status in the  region. They did not conceal their concern about the U.S.  shifting toward Syria because it is the key to peace in the  region. President Clinton and the U.S. secretary of state said  Syria is an extremely important country that has a pivotal role  to play in the peace process.    By casting such doubts, the Israelis seek to circumvent the  objective of a just and comprehensive peace in the region. Such  peace requires full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan, southern  Lebanon, and all occupied Arab territories, and the  implementation of Security Council resolutions to the letter.    It is no coincidence that the head of the Israeli government  has raised the idea of a referendum on the Golan, contrary to  all international resolutions, charters, and principles. The  Golan has been Syrian territory since time immemorial. There  can be no peace without its full return to the mother homeland.    Threatening to conduct a referendum is only a maneuver to  circumvent the objective of a just and comprehensive peace. It  is also an attempt to contain the U.S. position and conviction  that Syria is the key to the Middle East peace process.    The current Washington talks will be a decisive test to  Israel. The whole world expects a decisive shift by the Israeli  rulers toward peace and an end to the policy of maneuver and  procrastination that has so far prevented substantive progress  leading to genuine, comprehensive peace in the Middle East.</p>

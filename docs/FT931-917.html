			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Gold probe leads to arrest of 25 CUSTOMS AND Excise officers have arrested 25 people in a series of co-ordinated raids across the UK connected to a gold smuggling network that is alleged to have defrauded the Treasury of Pounds 10m. The arrests on Thursday mark the culmination of a nine-month operation investigating gold transactions worth Pounds 60m. About 10 tonnes of gold is said by Customs to have been traded in the scheme between a series of front companies. The investigation is the biggest of a series into frauds similar to that alleged in this case. New value added tax regulations for gold announced in the Budget and to come into force in April are expected to largely stamp out such frauds. Under the new regulations, where the seller of gold issues a tax invoice the buyer will be liable to pay VAT direct to Customs and Excise. Customs said that most of the gold involved in the latest operation was freely brought into the UK after January 1 when customs barriers came down because of the Single Market Act. In earlier investigations relating to cases before the new year gangs had smuggled in gold. Customs said the gold bars were bought in Belgium at the local VAT rate on gold of 1 per cent. In the UK it was then sold on at the market price with 17 1/2 per cent VAT added. According to Customs transactions were passed through a series of companies and the VAT was never paid on to Customs and Excise. The arrests were centred on addresses in London, Sussex, Avon, the west Midlands and the Home Counties.</p>

			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Japanese working practices on offer to Rover unions: Decision on deal will be disclosed today ROVER, the British Aerospace subsidiary, will learn today whether its 32,000 employees have backed a Japanese-style package which could enable them for the first time to become significantly more productive than their counterparts at several other UK car companies. Unions will announce the results of a ballot on the package - one of the most comprehensive attempts by a UK car manufacturer to transform working practices and bargaining procedures. After nine months of negotiations union leaders have warmly embraced the package. Seen as Rover's answer to the growing threat from Japanese manufacturers, it includes plans to remove remaining job demarcations and to reduce the risk of strikes. It would also cut the number of pay-bargaining forums from two to one and require 'continuous improvement' from all workers. In spite of attractions which include improved job security and common terms and conditions for all workers, some may vote against the package because of relatively minor clauses. One fear is over the phasing-out of 'clocking on' arrangements. Some workers are wary of trusting attendance records to team leaders. The main elements of the package would eventually be introduced even if there was a vote against it. Some changes, including greater team working and flexibility, are already under way. A vote against the package would, however, arrest the progress in the introduction of the cultural change the company is trying to instil in its workforce to improve competitiveness. Professor Daniel Jones of Cardiff Business School, who specialises in motor-industry management, said full implementation would help the productivity gap between Rover and Nissan. He believes it would enable Rover to move ahead of the UK operations of Ford and General Motors in terms of hours per worker in the body and assembly plants. In the past few years, all UK car manufacturers have adopted changes in working practices and conditions. Union leaders say the Rover package embraces more change than other companies have made in one attempt. The clause which has attracted most attention is one which some observers have interpreted as offering a Japanese-style 'jobs for life'. The clause says: 'Employees who want to work for Rover will be able to stay with Rover.' Under the deal, staff reductions would be achieved through retraining and voluntary severance. In spite of the guarantee, union leaders have no illusions that if the car market dipped markedly, compulsory redundancies could not be ruled out. Mr David Bower, personnel director, says: 'It is difficult to say there would never be compulsory redundancies, but that is the intention.' The agreement does not include a no-strike clause but introduces the possibility of solving disputes with binding arbitration if both sides agree. It also includes changes which would make it harder for one union acting alone to call out its members on strike. The deal also states that 'employees will be expected to be flexible, subject their ability to do the job.'</p>

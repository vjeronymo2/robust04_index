			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Milan Clean Hands Team Will Remain </F> Intact"]    [Excerpt] (ANSA) Milan, April 30 -- Milan assistant  prosecutor Antonio Di Pietro, who holds celebrity status in  Italy through his battle against political and business  corruption, will not join the new cabinet as interior minister  and the Clean Hands team whose investigations devastated the  nation's old ruling parties will remain intact, said chief  prosecutor Francesco Saverio Borrelli.    In an official statement issued today, Borrelli referred to  the flurry of speculation in the nation's press on the chances  that premier-designate Silvio Berlusconi might lure Di Pietro  into his cabinet to take on the sensitive interior portfolio.    The chief prosecutor said, "in relation to press reports of  ideas of ministerial posts or other duties proposed to them," Di  Pietro and assistant public prosecutor Piercamillo Davigo are  honored by having their names linked to "functions of extremely  high prestige" but are saying they cannot now abandon their  posts with the Milan prosecutors office.    Borrelli also reported in his official statement that he had  dropped his own request to be named chief justice of the Milan  appeals court.    Speaking off the cuff, the magistrate said, "No one among us  considers he is indispensable or cannot be replaced but it is  good to save the unity of the operating team which worked for  over two years on this difficult investigation. Especially at  this time, when there are prospects of weakening the judiciary,  a change in the line-up could reduce the effectiveness of  operative unity."    In December, Borrelli took part in a competition for the top  job on the Milan appeals bench left vacant by the transfer of  chief justice Piero Paiardi to the Supreme Court of Cassation.  His decision to withdraw his name means there will be no change  in the management of the Milan public prosecutors office.    Earlier, speaking for publication in a news weekly, the  chief  prosecutor said he was aware of "signals of tiredness and  annoyance" coming from the public with the continuation of the  anticorruption investigations which got under way in February  1992.    "People applauded our investigations, they closed ranks  around us, they supported us. But they were also entertained to  see so many heads, some crowned, rolling in the dust," he added  with reference to figures like former Socialist Party leader and  former Premier Bettino Craxi and other powerful politicians and  businessmen brought low by Clean Hands' disclosures.    "As the investigations reached increasingly high levels in  political and public administration spheres, endemic bitterness  against the powerful was satisfied. But this was not a thirst  for justice, only a thirst for revenge," said Borrelli.    He went on to speak of a need for an "authentic aspiration  for legality" at all levels and insisted that the "renewal of  ethics must begin with the individual, with each of us. This  cannot be delegated." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] To prepare for the "second phase" of political  realignment, Sakigake [Harbinger] has increased its activities.  While secretly approaching the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]  members who are expected to leave the LDP, it is hastily making  efforts to improve circumstances for a merger with the Japan New  Party [JNP]. Sakigake has been spurred to activity by such  factors as its sense of crisis about Shinseito's attempt to  strengthen its power within the ruling coalition by luring JNP  members, and about the fact that Shinseito and Komeito have  taken initiatives in policymaking within the ruling coalition on  such issues as how to handle political reform bills in the Diet.    Thinking that House of Representatives elections will be  held  following the passage of the political reform bills, Sakigake  has drawn up a political realignment scenario under which the  party will: 1) hasten a merger with the JNP, a pending issue  between the two parties; 2) call on the LDP members who advocate  electoral reform to join Sakigake; and 3) join hands at the  final stage with some of the Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ] and the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] members to  establish a new party with a membership of about 100.    In mid-November, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa (also JNP  representative) "urged" Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet  secretary and Sakigake representative, to realize a merger  between the two parties. However, Takemura said "there are  different views (within the JNP)." As stated by Takemura, there  are two groups in the JNP, one which supports the merger with  Sakigake and the other which takes a negative stance on the  merger. Sakigake plans to do its utmost to obtain consent from  the latter group to the merger.    Sakigake believes that about 30 LDP members are prepared to  leave he LDP. Of them, Sakigake has frequently made contacts  with 20 or so LDP members close to them, including a group led  by Masayasu Kitagawa, telling them that "we would like to form a  political group composed of those who take the same political  stance" while watching carefully the developments of the  electoral reform debate.    Sakigake also gropes for measures to form an alliance with  "Democrats," a new political group composed of right-wing and  neutral factions of the SDPJ. Moreover, it has frequently held  study meetings with "Group C&amp;C," a political group within the  DSP composed of former labor union members.    Sakigake aims to achieve a "moderate multiparty" political  system, taking a different stance from Shinseito Chief Secretary  Ichiro Ozawa and others who propose a "two-party system." Based  on this stand, Sakigake will prepare for the second phase of  political realignment. On joining hands with DSP members, a  senior Sakigake official said: "We will contact only those who  do not belong to a group led by DSP Secretary General Takashi  Yonezawa, who is close to Ozawa."    With the participation by independent lower house member  Koichiro Genba, Sakigake has become the third largest force in  the ruling coalition, placing the DSP behind it. Genba was  initially expected to join Shinseito. It is likely that  friction between Sakigake and Shinseito and between Sakigake and  some DSP groups will inevitably intensify in the future.</p>

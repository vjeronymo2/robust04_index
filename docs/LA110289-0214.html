			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> NORWEGIAN FISHING BOAT SNARES SOVIET SUB; STORMY SEA FREES IT  </P> <P> A Soviet submarine became ensnared in the net of a Norwegian fishing trawler  today but was freed when a stormy sea tore open the net, a defense official  said.  </P> <P> Navy Capt. Stig Morten Karlsen of the Norwegian Supreme Defense Command said  neither vessel had been in danger.  </P> <P> Darkness and the storm in the Barents Sea made it impossible for the crews to  go on deck to free the 2,000-ton conventional submarine, and the crews had  expected to spend a rough night entangled together.  </P> <P> But the force of the storm did the job for them, tearing the fishing net to  pieces under the weight of the submarine. Neither ship suffered serious damage.  </P></p>

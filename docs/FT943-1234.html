			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Germany passes property law The upper house of Germany's parliament has passed a law to compensate former property owners in eastern Germany. The law, which will speed up investment decisions in the five eastern states, follows three years of wrangling over terms and funding. Under the unification treaty, former owners are entitled to full compensation or restitution for property confiscated by the Nazis between 1933 and 1945 or by communists between 1949 and 1990. The law provides compensation based on the valuation of land dating back to 1935. However, assessment will depend on the type of property and whether it was owned or leased, and a different system will apply for land. For example, those who had owned family houses and small businesses will receive compensation, but the 1935 land valuation will be multiplied by seven, the valuation for those who had rented property will be multiplied by 4.8, while the valuation for those who owned land will be multiplied 20-fold. The former owners will receive bonds redeemable in 2004.</p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Treasurers face a stiff test in controlling risks - Coping with volatility in the financial markets 'The smart guys were hedged already. It is a bad idea to buy insurance when your house is already burning down,' - options salesman. IF corporate treasury is concerned with the control of financial risks, recent events in the foreign exchange and money markets are providing company treasurers with a stiff test. For one thing, the cost of failure increases dramatically during periods of financial market volatility. 'At times like this you discover whether the reporting systems are working and whether there are exposures no one remembered to hedge,' said the treasurer of a multinational company. Most foreign exchange exposures faced by companies are transaction exposures, arising from trade in goods or services. However, companies which tried to hedge exposures with currency options last week found it prohibitively expensive. The cost of currency options has risen sharply in line with the volatility of the underlying foreign exchange markets. Bankers estimated that the cost of dollar options has at least doubled in the past three months. Indeed, options specialists at large banks last week gave up trying to price many types of currency option. An alternative, and immediately cheaper, strategy for hedging foreign exchange risk is to lock into exchange rates by buying forward currency contracts. However, many treasurers said yesterday that the direction of exchange rates was still too uncertain to justify locking in now. 'The cash cost of buying a currency forward is certainly cheaper than taking an option-based approach. But the opportunity cost of making the wrong decision could be huge at the moment. We are still too unsighted to take a clear view on exchange rates,' said the treasurer of a UK oil company. Many companies also face translation exposures, arising when the earnings of overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling for accounting purposes. Whether these pure accounting exposures should be hedged is a matter of deep debate. Companies which do hedge on translation, including SmithKline Beecham and TI Group, hold that a predictable stream of earnings has additional value for investors. Last week's effective devaluation of sterling will, if sustained, actually boost overseas earnings of UK companies on translation. Even so, uncertainty over the level of earnings has led some companies to look again at hedging of translation exposures. Many companies also actively manage balance sheet assets and liabilities to take account of foreign exchange movements. A treasurer can increase balance sheet exposure to the dollar by borrowing in sterling - reducing the net sterling assets of the company - and buying dollars. If the dollar appreciates, the balance sheet will strengthen. This kind of approach is not always popular with earnings-conscious investors: borrowing in sterling can also lead to higher interest charges, a cost which has to be taken through the profit and loss account. Companies which believe the dollar has turned said yesterday there was a case for shifting balance sheet exposures in favour of the US currency. For outright borrowers of sterling, the question is whether to lock into interest rates now available in the forward market or wait for further base rate cuts. Treasury sales teams at big UK banks report brisk trade from companies looking to lock-in now. For example, five-year sterling was yesterday quoted at around 8.66 per cent, as good value in the eyes of many treasurers on a long-term view.</p>

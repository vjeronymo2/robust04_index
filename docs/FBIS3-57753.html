"The euphoria which all of us experienced in a purely  political aspect when everyone advocated sovereignty, is  weakening," Karimov said, he pointed out that "political  sovereignty appeared to rest on economic issues", adding that  economic independence turned out to be more important than the  political one and that there was a growing desire to communicate  with each other in a purely economic aspect.    Karimov drew particular attention to the situation in  Ukraine, pointing out that there were times when this republic  occupied a kind of an isolated position. "I think that was a  mistake," Karimov said. "Today, we strongly need economic  cooperation which will promote the solution of political  problems," the Uzbek president said in conclusion.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Yeung] </F>   [Text] Taiwan is considering allowing mainland officials  to visit the Kuomintang-ruled (KMT) stronghold to enhance mutual  understanding, as deep mistrust bogged down talks over issues  such as hijacking.    Chiao Jen-ho, vice-chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange  Foundation (SEF) and senior negotiator on non-government issues  across the Strait said officials were conducting internal  studies on whether the time was ripe for being "more aggressive"  in inviting officials from the communist regime to visit the  island.    Mr. Chiao was speaking, to a group of Hong Kong journalists  and commentators who were visiting Taipei last week. His top  aides ended the fourth round of talks with their mainland  counterparts in Beijing last week with no accord on sensitive  issues such as aircraft hijacking.    The former close aide to President Lee Teng-hui admitted  that  the quasi-official body was "in a difficult position" after the  fruitless four rounds of working-level talks plus a more  senior-level meeting between him and his Beijing counterpart  Tang Shubei of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan  Strait. "The lack of mutual trust between the two sides remains  serious.... The mainland side does not really understand  Taiwan," said Mr. Chiao.    The SEF leader was critical of what he said was Beijing's  lack of understanding of Taiwan, as well as mixing legal matters  with politics. "Political issues cannot be solved through  negotiation. One will only be able to keep power if they win  public support. Beijing has to seek backing from the Taiwan  community if it wants to pursue political talks," he said.    "But the present gap is so large that any talks on political  issues are doomed to fail. The mainland authorities fail to  understand Taiwan when they say they are putting out hopes on  the KMT. They have overestimated the KMT. It's not powerful  enough to swing public opinion," said Mr. Chiao.    "The attitude of Beijing in treating links with Taiwan as a  relationship between father and son will not be acceptable to  the people in Taiwan. We are not asking for recognition of our  status. But they have to respect reality."    Mr. Chiao admitted that the KMT Government has banned visits  by mainland officials to the island in the past because of fears  of their "adverse influence" within the community and the  bureaucracy.    "Our policy is more conservative and defensive. Whether we  should be more aggressive now and try to influence mainland  officials is a matter under consideration," he said.    "As our confidence (regarding dealing with Beijing) grows,  we  might readjust our policy correspondingly," the SEF vice  chairman said.    Mr. Chiao, however urged Beijing to be more pragmatic and  not  to overreact. "There will be enormous scope for the  development of relations between the two sides if Beijing can  understand that. On any mainland-Taiwan matters, we have no  deadline."</p>

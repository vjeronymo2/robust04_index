			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Monetary union 'should be delayed' The Maastricht timetable for economic and monetary union should be delayed for 10 years, Mr Uwe Jens, economic policy spokesman for Germany's opposition Social Democrat party, said yesterday. During a visit to London, Mr Jens said the 1999 target date for Emu should be extended by 10 years, since Germany and other EU members were not able to fulfil the economic criteria for membership of a currency union. According to opinion polls, the SPD stands a good chance of taking power or sharing it in a coalition with the ruling Christian Democrats after Germany's elections in October. Although Mr Jens stressed his remarks were not official SPD policy, they will strengthen the impression that Emu has slipped well down the political priorities of both leading German parties. Mr Jens said he wanted all 12 members of the European Union to join Emu simultaneously, as Europe could 'split up' if a small group went ahead first.</p>

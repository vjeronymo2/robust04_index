In the letter, entitled "Romanies are  Citizens with Obligations Only, and No Rights," Scuka analyses  the problems of Romanies within the framework of European  integration. He believes that reform has to take place both in  social opinions, which should take into account Romany interests  and their position within the European Community, and in the  finding of a solution to Romany problems.    This solution should be based on a new orientation, issuing  in part from Christian philosophy and the Romany culture in  Europe as an essential basis for the broadening of the Romany  educational level. It would require the international Romany  Union to cooperate with all the international and church  organizations, with the leaders of Romany organizations and  parties, and with Romany intellectuals in Europe. There is a  need for an educational and cultural center or community which  would act in individual European states and regions and help  Romanies to find their own identity and to be not only good  Romanies but capable citizens, Scuka says.    The Czech Republic lacks a sound legal means of suppressing  racism and objective statistics on the social position of  Romanies, Scuka says in the letter, and also suggests that the  president have a Romany adviser in his office.</p>

			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> IMF Approves $1.4 Billion for Argentina: Argentina received approval for a  $1.4-billion loan from the International Monetary Fund. An IMF spokesman said  the lending agency's executive board approved the so-called standby  arrangement, which allows the country to draw down the funds over the next 16  months. The approval showed that the IMF was satisfied that Argentina had begun  the process of economic reform that lenders felt was critically needed before  new funds could be provided. Argentina has made virtually no payments on its  $60 billion in foreign debt, piling up about $4.4 billion in interest payment  arrears, according to some estimates.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Geneva Meeting"] </F>   [Text] The meeting of the presidents of Syria and the U.S.  in Geneva came to a close after about 5 hours on Sunday evening.  After their negotiations the two presidents took part at a  press conference.    Although the details of the negotiations have not yet been  made available to the media, all evidences point to the  conclusion that the American president could not get the Syrian  leader to accept the American point of view as easily as he  could prevail upon 'Arafat or his predecessor had been able to  make Anwar al-Sadat yield to the American pressure.    The Americans have probably become accustomed to the idea  that at the end of the cold war period and after the demise of  their formidable rival, the former Soviet Union, they could  summon any political leader from the Third World countries and  dictate their policies to him.    However, the American diplomats' efforts of the past few  months to lure Hafiz al-Asad to Washington have failed to bring  about any concrete result. Hafiz al-Asad only consented to a  meeting with the U.S. president in a third country.    In the course of the joint press conference, al-Asad held  firmly to his rightful stance, demanding Israeli withdrawal from  all territories occupied in 1967 six-day war or comprehensive  peace settlement with all Arab countries at once.    It is worth mentioning that one of the most effective  diplomatic stratagems employed by Israel in the past two decades  has been to insist on separate, bilateral talks and settlements  with individual Arab states. The obvious objective and natural  consequence of that stratagem is of course to create discord  among the Arab ranks.    In Geneva al-Assad exhibited his awareness of the fact that  the American president's promises could not be relied on.    Clinton -- and George Bush before him -- had made many  promises to 'Arafat. In practice, however, no serious step has  been taken to restore to the Palestinian people any of their  rights. The gap between what is promised by the American  president and what is actually done by Tel Aviv leaders is  extremely wide.    Interestingly the viewers of the joint press conference were  only told by Clinton that Syria was seeking to normalize  relations with Israel.    It would of course be quite unwise to pass a hasty judgement  on the meeting between Al-Asad and Clinton before details of  their negotiations are known. And in view of the cordial  relations which exist between Tehran and Damascus, it is quite  natural that Tehran should be expecting President al-Asad's  special envoy in the coming days with details of the  negotiations between the heads of America and Syria.</p>

[passage omitted]    At the very time Washington was announcing the decision,  GATT  director general Peter Sutherland warned in New York against the  new outbreak of trade tensions challenging the gains resulting  from the Uruguay Round "before they are even completely  operational."    Sutherland particularly criticized the "managed trade"  approach he said Washington is pressuring Tokyo to accept, in  the form of quantitative targets for some bilateral trade,  boosting Japanese imports of U.S. products and limiting Japan's  exports to the United States. Japan has firmly rejected this  approach so far.    Sutherland thinks such agreements are dangerous,  constituting  a distortion of the multilateral trade system -- and in case of  conflict, they tempt the players to retaliate, since such  accords are outside GATT and its rules. [passage omitted]    On Friday [4 March], GATT spokesman David Woods tried to  downplay the effect of the latest U.S. measure, saying that "We  need to be clear as to what re-enactment of 301 may mean and  keep a sense of proportion about yesterday's announcement. The  use of any retaliatory weapons is only challengeable if and when  that use is in conflict with the application of GATT rules. At  present there is no evidence that the U.S. intends to violate  its obligations."</p>

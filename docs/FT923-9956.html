			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / JVC to produce TV's in Shanghai JVC, the Japanese consumer electronics company, is to produce television sets in Shanghai in a joint venture which will be its first manufacturing project in China, Gordon Cramb writes from Tokyo. Production will begin in December and is intended to reach an eventual 240,000 sets a year. These will be exported, but JVC will also use the site to assemble knockdown kits for video cassette recorders, camcorders and karaoke equipment aimed at China. JVC will have 55 per cent control of the venture. The main local partner is Shanghai Video and Audio Electronics, which has 29 existing plants making televisions and video cameras, and 6,000 sales affiliates and service centres across the country. The venture, though employing only 70 people in its first year when TV output is expected to be 48,000 units, gives a boost to Shanghai's Pudong free trade zone, where it will be located.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary prepared by the News Research and Commentary </F> Group]    [Text] Diplomatic activities have started to end the recent  battles in Afghanistan, particularly those in Kabul city. Our  ambassador in Kabul met heads of some of the conflicting groups  yesterday and expressed our country's readiness to mediate  between the belligerent groups to end the conflict and establish  peace and tranquility in Afghanistan.    The Islamic Republic of Iran has repeatedly expressed its  concern over any conflict in Afghanistan, whatever its reason,  and supports a political solution. The Iranian nation and  Government, acting according to their canonical duties,  supported the just struggles by the mojahedin during the 14  years of their jehad against the communists and extended  financial and material assistance to it. During the same period,  they also hosted 2 million Afghan refugees.    The Afghan mojahedin's victory in the war against blasphemy  and atheism made the Iranian nation happy, since expectations  then were that Islamic rule in Afghanistan would be established  and the two Muslim neighboring countries, which share historic,  religious, and cultural characteristics, could live in  tranquility next to each other. Despite these expectations,  bloody clashes among rival groups that once fought against the  communists on one front, concerned the Iranian nation. So, the  Iranian Government--as a friendly, neighboring, and Muslim  country--considers it its duty to spare no effort to end the  conflict in that country.    Islamic Iran has always wanted Afghanistan's unity and  territorial integrity and, having adopted a policy of not  interfering in others' domestic affairs, it considers  cooperating and coordinating with friendly Muslim countries to  overcome their problems to be among the principles of its  foreign policy.    Afghanistan is facing state organizational problems,  problems  in economic reconstruction and in establishing social law and  order, the problem of refugees, and fuel and food problems. The  Islamic Republic of Iran has always expressed its readiness to  help the Afghan nation to overcome any need it has.    Hopefully, cooperation by friendly, Muslim, and neighboring  countries can help to end the clashes in Afghanistan and  stability and tranquility can be returned to Afghanistan. But  success in this calls for cooperation and coordination among the  jehadi forces.</p>

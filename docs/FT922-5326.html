			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Dowty moves to shore up bid defence DOWTY Group, the aerospace and information technology group, could this week bolster its defence against the hostile Pounds 494m bid from TI, the specialist engineering company, with the help of payments on a cancelled Ministry of Defence contract. Dowty could take a Pounds 3m-Pounds 4m cancellation payment as an exceptional item in the year to March, increasing the estimated profit by at least 10 per cent to more than Pounds 32m. It surprised analysts 12 days ago by estimating 1992 profits of at least Pounds 29m, some 25 per cent above most City forecasts before the bid. The MoD payment, if it were in the 1992 accounts, would further lift the Cheltenham-based group's apparent recovery from the downturn in the aerospace market and its involvement in the information technology industry. Dowty is also likely to bring forward, from June 16, its audited preliminary results to dispel scepticism among analysts and shareholders about the quality of its Pounds 29m profits estimate. Publishing these results before TI's bid closes on June 10 would allow shareholders to estimate 1993 profits, a decisive figure on which Dowty's independence turns. A TI spokesman yesterday welcomed the opportunity to 'see Dowty's full accounts and the answers to the many questions surrounding them'. In a letter to Dowty's shareholders over the weekend, TI attacked the profits estimate. It questioned restructuring and closure provisions and the extent to which Dowty has capitalised the development costs of the loss-making Cognito two-way paging company. The MoD payment which Dowty is now likely to bring into its 1992 profits relates to a naval contract cancelled last year but on which payment terms have only 'recently' been agreed, according to a Dowty adviser. The costs of the contract were incurred during the last financial year but very little of the benefit was included in Dowty's profit estimate of 'not less than Pounds 29m', the adviser said. As the bid enters its closing stages, advisers from both sides are stepping up their presentations to institutional investors. Dowty says while it made mistakes in the past, including the disastrous move into information technology, it has now stripped out a lot of costs and refocused.</p>

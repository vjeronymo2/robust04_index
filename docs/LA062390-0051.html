			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ECONOMICS OF DANCE  </P> <P> To paraphrase Lewis Segal's June 18 review of Pacific Dance Ensemble, it seems  to me he has a lot to answer for.  </P> <P> The tenor of all of Segal's coverage of Generator Eight has indicated a serious  misunderstanding of the economics of producing dance in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> If dance companies didn't self-produce or create cooperative ventures like  Generator Eight, there would be very little new and risky dance in Los Angeles  for him to criticize. Moreover, his continual focus on the "controversy" around  Generator Eight implies that he would rather people such as Danielle Shapiro  didn't try to produce dance if their efforts generate anything less than a  supportive reaction within the dance community.  </P> <P> What he doesn't seem to realize is that his perpetually negative slant on  issues like this is far more divisive and damaging to the dance community than  taking the risks and producing a festival that brings 2,500 people to downtown  Los Angeles to see and enjoy eight stimulating evenings of dance.  </P> <P> BILL BUSHNELL  </P> <P> Artistic Director  </P> <P> Los Angeles Theatre Center  </P></p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Era of market support pacts for commodities may be over YESTERDAY'S VOTE against any renegotiation of the international rubber agreement (Inra) and Wednesday's collapse of talks on a new international coffee agreement appear to be the final nails in the coffin of those commodity pacts which attempt to support market prices. Only two weeks ago delegates to the International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO) abandoned their attempts to negotiate a pact based on a stock withholding scheme. They are now planning an agreement described by one official as more than purely administrative, but well short of a full economic accord. Both the cocoa and coffee agreements have been moribund for several years. Under the present agreement, which runs out in September, the ICCO was using a buffer stock scheme in its attempts to shore up prices. The system came to an end early in 1988 when the stock reached its maximum permitted level of 250,000 tonnes. Members remain anxious to have some sort of agreement put in place in order to avoid the threat to the market of any sudden sale of the buffer stock, which still holds more than 230,000 tonnes of cocoa. The International Coffee Organisation was supporting prices through an export quota system, but that collapsed in July 1989, sending world prices crashing. The latest London talks failed over a relatively minor point, indicating that the gulf between producers and consumers has not narrowed in the ensuing years. While the present agreement expires at the end of September, it is possible that it could be extended by a further year. The International Rubber Organisation announced yesterday that a majority of its members, led by consumer countries, were against renegotiating their pact, which expires at the end of the year. Consumers voted against because they believe producers have failed to abide by the price review provisions of the present agreement. Inro will meet in May to consider the future of the agreement, but producers have said they will oppose any extension without a decision to start negotiations on a new pact. Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London futures brokers, said that the virtually simultaneous collapse of the coffee and rubber agreements showed that there was no longer any will among G7 countries to give aid to developing countries through price support systems. Another observer said yesterday that the biggest change in attitude towards commodity agreements was the realisation that, if the existing ones had not worked, any established in future did not stand much chance of working either. 'It has taken years for that message to sink home,' he said. 'People are now wondering if they should bother with the bureaucracy, the expense, and the effort.' The last 10 days of talks at the ICO - one of many similar meetings over the last 12 months - are believed to have cost around Pounds 500,000. But the pace of the negotiations was always, in the memorable words of one delegate, 'like a snail on Mogadon.' Nevertheless, the world coffee markets have had to keep one eye on the endless rounds of negotiation. Mr Peter Kettle, analyst with ED &amp; F. Man, the London trade house, said earlier this week that, even though the markets always expected nothing positive to emerge from the ICO, they were inevitably disappointed when nothing did so prices were marked down accordingly. Yesterday one London coffee trader said that the talks had been a deterrent to trading.</p>

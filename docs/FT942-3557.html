			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Christian Salvesen dip in line with warning In line with a profits warning issued in January, Christian Salvesen, the distribution and specialist hire group, reported its first downturn in annual profits since the 1970s with a pre-tax fall from Pounds 75.9m to Pounds 74.1m for the year to March 31. The shares, which have underperformed the market by almost 20 per cent this year, added 8p to close at 255p. Thanks to a lower tax charge earnings per share were steady at 19.2p (19.1p) and a recommended final of 4.8p gives a total dividend up 4 per cent to 8.1p. Sir Alick Rankin, chairman, said this reflected the board's confidence in the future. 'We expect a better year, but are, not surprisingly, treating it with caution,' he said. Analysts are looking for profits to rise to about Pounds 80m with earnings per share rising to about 20p. The company said it had tackled the problems at Aggreko, the specialist plant hire business which has been the engine of growth in recent years. Aggreko has reversed an expansion into the competitive US construction market and the workforce in the US has been cut by 10 per cent. With Aggreko's European operations also affected by recession, its operating profits slipped from Pounds 28.2m to Pounds 26.5m. The distribution side turned in flat profits of Pounds 35.6m (Pounds 35.2m), excluding a Pounds 4.2m contribution from acquisitions. Food distribution, which services most of the main UK supermarket chains, was slightly ahead. Profits from the consumer products contract with Marks and Spencer were down since its fees were based on a formula linked to UK short-term interest rates. This has now been renegotiated. Mr Chris Masters, chief executive, said grocery distribution in the UK was now a mature market and the division's growth was seen coming largely from its industrial business. This was significantly expanded by the acquisition of Swift for Pounds 84.5m in October 1993. The deal pushed group gearing from 14 per cent to 51 per cent over the year, but it should be down below 45 per cent by the end of this year. Profits from the brick business rose by 76 per cent to Pounds 3m. Vikoma, the pollution control equipment manufacturer which is up for sale, turned in Pounds 1.5m. Profits included a net Pounds 6.6m from the release of provisions, taken below the line in 1992, to cover the closure of its German manufacturer distribution business. This was offset by write-offs elsewhere to leave a net exceptional gain of just Pounds 100,000. See Lex</p>

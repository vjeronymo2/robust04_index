Tello met with German Economy Minister Gunter Rexrodt  and stated that 31 percent of all Mexican trade in the region  had been carried out with Germany and, thus, it had become  Mexico's leading commercial partner in Europe in 1993.    Rexrodt, who is in Mexico since last Thursday [17 February],  to preside over the inauguration of "Technogerma-Mexico 1994,"  expressed his satisfaction with Mexico's economic reforms. He  said the implementation of the free trade agreement between  Mexico, the United States, and Canada stirs great expectations  among German investors.</p>

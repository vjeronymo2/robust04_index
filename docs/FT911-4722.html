			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / UK Company News: Panel gives Empire more time to issue defence EMPIRE STORES Group, the mail order company fighting a Pounds 49m takeover bid from Redoute Catalogue, a French mail order group, has had to delay publication of its defence document because of a technical omission on the bidder's side. The defence document should have been posted yesterday but the Takeover Panel has given Empire until Monday April 22 to send it out. Redoute Catalogue, part of the La Redoute retail group which is in turn 54 per cent owned by Au Printemps, had failed to mention an agreement between Au Printemps and Gecos, an Italian supermarket company with a 24.2 per cent stake in Empire, covering the two companies' shareholdings in its offer document published two weeks ago. The agreement was made in February 1989 and Redoute had thought it had fallen into disuse. Redoute and Gecos have now agreed that the agreement has ceased to have effect. Empire's shares were unchanged yesterday at 126p, 1p above the final 125p per share cash offer. The chance of a white knight appearing seems slim as Redoute has 37.8 per cent of Empire's shares and could block a rival bidder from gaining full control. Empire's shareholders appear to have a choice between accepting the cash or keeping the group independent with a large minority holder.</p>

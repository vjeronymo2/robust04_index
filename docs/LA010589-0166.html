			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOCKS' GAIN BEST SINCE OCTOBER; DOW UP 33.04  </P> <P> A late burst of program trading, coupled with a sharp rise in the dollar,  combined Wednesday to give Wall Street stocks their biggest one-day advance in  more than two months.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, down 23.93 on Tuesday, climbed 33.04 to  2,177.68.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 3 to 1 in New York Stock  Exchange trading, with Big Board volume rising to 149.70 million shares, up  from 128.50 million Tuesday.  </P> <P> "It's a good, broad, impressive rally," one trader said. "I think it's got some  sustainability to it."  </P> <P> The Dow's rise was the largest since Oct. 20, when it gained 44 points, and  leaves the index just a few points below its post-crash high of 2,183.50.  </P> <P> Stock analysts attributed the market's strength to a sharp rise in the dollar,  which added nearly 2 pfennigs against the West German mark on news that U.S.  Navy jets shot down two Libyan fighters over the Mediterranean Sea.  </P> <P> "We had very strong buy programs kicking in," said Jack Barbanel, senior vice  president at Gruntal &amp; Co. Traders said futures-linked buying helped the  Dow double its early gains in the last hour of the session.  </P> <P> An early rise in bond prices also helped the stock market, as did a 28-cent  drop in the price of U.S. crude oil to $17.08 a barrel.  </P> <P> In foreign trading, the Tokyo stock market started off the new year with a bang  on Wednesday, climbing to a record close. The 225-share Nikkei index ended an  abbreviated half-day session up 84.66 at 30,243.66.  </P> <P> London shares ended near the day's highs, boosted by Wall Street's early  advance and a stronger dollar. The Financial Times index closed up 10.2 at  1,793 after a 10.3-point drop Tuesday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CREDIT  </P> <P> Bond prices were mixed Wednesday, reacting favorably to a firmer dollar but  anticipating that Friday's unemployment report might show a big increase in  jobs, boosting inflation fears.  </P> <P> The Treasury's 30-year bond fell 1/16th of a point, or 62.5 cents per $1,000  face amount, while its yield closed at 9.08%, unchanged from late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Jay Goldinger, of the investment banking firm Capital Insight Inc. in Beverly  Hills, said the bond market was anticipating Friday's release of federal  jobless figures for December.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded  at 9.125%, down from 9.625% late Tuesday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMMODITIES  </P> <P> Prices of copper futures rose sharply on the New York Commodity Exchange on  supply worries rekindled by the apparent bombing of three locomotives in Peru  and a decline in the exchange's warehouse stocks of copper.  </P> <P> On other markets, precious metals futures retreated, grain and soybean futures  surged, cattle futures rose while pork futures fell and stock index futures  advanced.  </P> <P> Copper settled 3.1 to 6.3 cents higher, with the spot contract at $1.58 a pound  and the more actively traded contract for delivery in March at $1.426 a pound.  </P> <P> The bombing of the locomotives in Peru, the world's sixth-largest copper  producer, served to remind traders that the settlement last month of a 57-day  Peruvian miners strike did not defuse the country's internal political tensions  or the potential for disruptions in the copper pipeline.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Commodity Exchange reported a 301-ton decline in its warehouse  stocks of copper to 7,964 tons. It was the first daily decline after more than  a week of steady or rising supplies, indicating that copper consumers have  returned to the marketplace after a holiday break.  </P> <P> Precious metals prices fell on the Comex in response to the dollar's strength,  which was in turn a reaction to the U.S. downing of two Libyan fighter planes  off the Libyan coast, analysts said.  </P> <P> Tables begin on Page 6.  </P></p>

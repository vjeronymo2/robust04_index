			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [INTERFAX report: "Finance Ministry Opposed to Indexation </F> in Budget-Financed Sphere"]    [Text] The Finance Ministry does not deem it advisable to  index the earnings of personnel in the budget-financed sphere  during the second quarter of this year.    Acting Russian Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin disclosed  this  at a meeting with journalists. He explained that indexation of  the earnings of workers in this category during the first  quarter was 90 percent while the level of inflation over this  period was 36 percent. "What happened was over-indexation."  Moreover, according to Dubinin, the 2 trillion rubles for  indexation during the second quarter have already been allocated  in order to satisfy the coal miners' economic demands within the  budget framework. "Any victories by strikers with regard to  meeting their demands mean somebody else loses out," S. Dubinin  stressed.</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Institutions in dock beside Bubble Lady: Robert Thomson on a high-flying Japanese restaurateur who is now facing fraud and forgery charges WHEN the 'Bubble Lady', Ms Nui Onoue, shuffled ashen-faced into the Osaka district court yesterday, she hardly fitted the pre-trial publicity about the mysterious, charismatic restaurateur who enticed bankers and brokers to fund Y890bn (Pounds 4.2bn) in stock investments. But the unfolding evidence, spiced by tales of stock certificates delivered in shopping bags and of a leading broker stationing a senior employee at her restaurant, painted her as a remarkable woman who thrived during a remarkable period - Japan's era of financial and speculative excess. Ms Onoue, 62, is on trial for fraud and forgery for having used as collateral Y342bn in faked deposit certificates from Toyo Shinkin Bank, which, coincidentally, was dissolved last week after having failed to recover from the relationship with the lady with the financial bubble. She admits fraud but not forgery. It may be Ms Onoue facing the charges but it is Japan's leading financial institutions which are in the dock. Yesterday was the turn of Mr Shigefumi Hayata, manager of Yamaichi Securities corporate fund sales department in Osaka when the country's leading individual stock investor was in full flight, receiving regular investment tips from other-worldly advisers at seances. Mr Hayata told how he became broker-in-residence at one of her two restaurants, personally dealing with the huge buy orders and checking, in advance, whether there were sufficient shares available to satisfy her interest in a chosen company. At various times, she was the largest individual shareholder in two Japanese banks and held significant stakes in a range of blue chips, including Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) and the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ). 'Madam was so charismatic. I didn't think anything could go wrong,' Mr Hayata said. He was glad to be doing business with her as, at one stage early last year, her still furious purchasing accounted for 90 per cent of his department's stock commission revenue. By that time, Tokyo stock prices were plunging to new lows and the desperate Ms Onoue began pulling collateral out of one bank to raise funds at another. Mr Hayata, sitting in the same room, overheard some of the conversations and was aware of dealings with 'about 20 banks' including IBJ, Fuji Bank and a financial company linked to the Matsushita Electric group. The defence is attempting to prove that Ms Onoue was as much a victim of Japan's financial system as she was guilty of fraud. So Mr Hayata was given a tough grilling, and in future months executives at IBJ and other institutions can look forward to the same scrutiny of their own activities during the period from 1987 until last year. The case, which began with preliminary hearings in January, is only now gathering momentum, but, with the Japanese wheels of justice slow to turn, it will take two to three years before judgment is delivered. At present, the court - also hearing charges against two managers of related financial institutions - is sitting for about four hours a month. Mr Hayata agreed that he knew mortgage certificates and other collateral was being shifted from 'bank A to bank B', though he said he was unsure whether the original collateral was being replaced. The bubble lady, fearing that she was close to exposure, had told bank A that the documents were needed by her accountant and the bank apparently believed her. 'I knew madam was losing money on the stock investment but my impression was that she had a huge amount of assets and could afford the losses,' Mr Hayata said. 'If I tried to stop her from moving the collateral, madam would have become very angry with me.' During the hearing yesterday, Ms Onoue sat slumped forward in her seat, occasionally nodding off during discussion of legal technicalities and sometimes wiping her eyes with tissues. She is free on a Y700m bond and in spite of her formal bankruptcy in June still had a car waiting for her outside the courtroom. Mr Hayata was asked whether his presence in her restaurant and the appearance of a very close relationship between Yamaichi and the bubble lady gave other financial institutions the impression that Ms Onoue was deserving of both trust and funds. 'I don't think there was any influence from Yamaichi's role. I don't think it gave madam any extra prestige,' he said.</p>

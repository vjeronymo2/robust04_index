			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / BBC expected to announce doubling of operating surplus THE BBC is in a stronger financial position than widely reported. The 1992-93 annual report, to be published at the end of this month, is expected to show a doubled operating surplus. Last year the corporation had an operating surplus of about Pounds 30m. Potential overspends on programme making of Pounds 15.9m in 1992-93 and Pounds 38m in the previous year have been compensated for by savings in the overall budget. The BBC is, however, still in deficit because of the cost of a planned restructuring programme. The four-year programme - which has one more year to run - and its associated redundancy payments are costing the BBC a total of Pounds 215m. The corporation, which has licence fee income of about Pounds 1.4bn a year, has managed to remain within its borrowing limits of Pounds 200m. Mr Rodney Baker-Bates, the new finance director of the BBC who is former group finance director of Midland Bank, has asked for further cuts in corporation overheads to put more money into programmes. Mr Baker-Bates is looking for a 10 per cent cut in the 1994-95 financial year in the budget of the BBC's central administration, which accounts for about 7 per cent of total BBC expenditure. A budget cut of 3 per cent is being levied on the rest of the BBC. As a result an estimated extra Pounds 50m is expected to be directed into programme making. Mr Barker-Bates plans to issue budgetary guidelines covering the period up to the end of 1996 - when the BBC royal charter runs out. The government has commissioned consultants from Touche Ross to check on BBC efforts to become more efficient. The Touche Ross report is expected to inform government decisions on the licence fee until the end of the charter period. The BBC hopes that the licence fee will continue to be linked to retail prices. 'I think the BBC has a good story to tell and we can defend our corner,' said Mr Baker-Bates.</p>

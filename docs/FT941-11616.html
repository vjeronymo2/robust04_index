			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / UK Company News: QMH agrees two-month standstill Queens Moat Houses and its lenders yesterday agreed on a two-month extension of its standstill arrangement which expired on Monday. The group is in talks with bankers over a restructuring of its Pounds 1.3bn of debt, which it is unable to service. Mr Andrew Coppel, chief executive, said the situation was extremely complex and 'various issues have had to be addressed and continue to be addressed.' The group was endeavouring to implement the planned financial restructuring 'as soon as practicable.' Satisfactory progress was being made. The two-month extension appeared to be something of a compromise. QMH had been believed to be seeking breathing space to the end of April, by which time it would have finalised its 1993 accounts and have put proposals for the restructuring to banks, bondholders and shareholders. The banks appeared to prefer to roll-over the standstill agreement on a monthly basis. Extending the arrangement until the end of March should allow QMH to issue its preliminary figures for 1993, but it would be a tight deadline to complete the restructuring.</p>

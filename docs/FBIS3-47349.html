The premier disclosed this plan at a meeting Wednesday  morning with leaders of the Japan Association of Corporate  Executives (Keizai Doyukai), according to government officials.    "First there will be efforts to relax various regulations on  housing construction and real estate development," Hosokawa was  quoted as saying.    Hosokawa also said he will try step by step to ease  government controls in such fields as telecommunications,  broadcasting and distribution systems.    The task force, which consists of cabinet members, will be  headed by Hosokawa himself, the officials said.    He said, "there are some 200 regulations concerning housing  construction, and if such controls are eased construction costs  should decline to two-thirds of the current price level."    Such deregulation would have an instant effect, he said.  "For instance, if controls on imported materials are lifted, we  can expect an effect as early as April."    The task force will also help boost local government  administration and reduce bureaucracy, Hosokawa said.    Meanwhile, Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet spokesman, told  a news conference that the government will incorporate measures  to ease housing and real estate controls in a pump-priming  package to be announced later this month.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address to the nation by President Rafael Caldera on the </F> appointment of the new president of the Venezuelan Central Bank  on 28 April; place not given --live or recorded]    [Text] I have the satisfaction of delivering to the  Venezuelan people news of great national interest. The crisis  created following the resignation of Dr. Ruth de Krivoy as  president of the Venezuelan Central Bank [BCV] has been  admirably overcome. The crisis was resolved in two days and the  Senate unanimously ratified the appointment of Dr. Antonio Casas  Gonzalez to fill the vacancy caused by Dr. Krivoy's resignation.    Current BCV law establishes that the president of the  Republic appoints the BCV president, but this requires a  two-thirds Senate vote. Of course, one would think that in a  Congress as diverse as this one, where there could be so many  opinions, it would be very difficult to reach this majority, and  only after laborious efforts could the end be reached.    There was awareness among parliamentary faction  representatives and their concern coincided with the  government's urgent need to make this decision in order to give  full confidence to Venezuelans and foreigners who conduct  economic transactions with our country through financial system  operations.    The BCV is a very important institution. It is an  institution that is the working hub of the network essential to  every country: the banking network, the financial system.    Dr. Antonio Casas Gonzalez is a Venezuelan with broad  experience in administrative services, in the BCV itself, and  serving Pdvsa, Venezuelan Petroleum -- the institution most  important to the country's economy. I must explain that he was  presented while the dialogue was under way. He was not  initially proposed by the government. Talks were begun, the  proper atmosphere was created through dialogue, the names of  many important Venezuelans were studied, but when the name of  Dr. Antonio Casas Gonzalez surfaced, there was such a positive  and stimulating response that the Senate, as I have already  said, approved the appointment without a single dissenting vote;  it was unanimous.    This should give Venezuelans full confidence in our  institutions. The feeling of strengthened institutions is  reinforced. The national government guarantees full respect for  the BCV's autonomy. We have had this respect in the past and we  have it now. We had certain conceptual differences with Dr.  Krivoy in the handling of the BCV. She felt that these  differences warranted the decision she made. The BCV has always  had the respect and the absolute assurance of the president.    We expect a harmonious relationship, harmony that will only  be set by Venezuela's interests -- the country's utmost  interests, the interest of the productive sector and all  participants in the country's economy. All my fellow countrymen  can have this assurance. The presidents of the legislative  chambers accompany me in reiterating to our country the  confidence people should have that in moments of great  difficulty there will always be a possibility and a need to  understand one another because the bottom line is that we are  all Venezuelans and for us, Venezuela's interest must come first  and foremost, above any other interest.    I ask my fellow countrymen to receive this news with  pleasure. Dr. Antonio Casas Gonzalez at this moment is in  London. He represents Venezuelan Petroleum's affairs in the UK  and in other European countries. He has accepted the  appointment and tomorrow he should return to Caracas to take up  this delicate and important post.    I have complete faith that in the midst of all the problems  we are experiencing and despite the attitude of some people, who  without realizing it, without caring what harm they can cause to  the country, place their concerns and interests above the  national interest. [sentence as heard] I believe that any  financial unrest that may have been generated following the  events of these past few days has been overcome in a truly  marvelous way. The Senate president was telling me that this is  the first time the Senate has made a unanimous decision. This  is a good sign; this fills us with hope for Venezuela's future.</p>

			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOUR YEARS LATER, KEFFER KNOWS HER SPORT;  </P> <P> GIRLS' TRACK: VERSATILITY HAS GIVEN THE WOODBRIDGE SENIOR A WIDE RANGE OF  KNOWLEDGE.  </P> <P> When Kaci Keffer joined the Woodbridge High School track and field team four  years ago, she had very little knowledge of the sport.  </P> <P> "I didn't know anything," Keffer said. "(Coach George) Varvas would say, "OK,  run a mile.' And I'd be like, 'Uh, how far is that?'  </P> <P> "He told us we were going to have a time trial to see who would be on the mile  relay. He lined us up on the track and said, 'OK, run a 400.' And I'm like,  'Uh, how many laps is that?' I ended up making it, but I didn't even know what  a relay was. Then everyone was talking about 'going to state' And I'm like,  'What's state?"  </P> <P> Four years and three state-meet appearances later, Keffer, The Times' Orange  County athlete of the year in girls' track and field, has an impressive -- and  wide-ranging -- understanding of the sport.  </P> <P> Keffer, a senior who was named athlete of the meet at several invitationals  this year, including the Orange County Championships, always has been  impressive in her diversity. This year was no exception.  </P> <P> Keffer led the county in both the 400 meters (56.54 seconds) and 300 hurdles  (42.84).  </P> <P> Along with teammates Kristina Lockwood, Madelline Liseblad and Michelle Muniz,  Keffer helped Woodbridge to a county-leading time in the 400 relay (48.83). In  the 1,600 relay, Keffer's anchor leg gave Woodbridge the county's second-best  time (3:55.62).  </P> <P> And, so as not to get bored, Keffer also occasionally competed in the 200, 800,  long jump, shotput and discus.  </P> <P> Asked to name a highlight and a low point of the season, Keffer summed both in  three words: the state meet.  </P> <P> She was happy that she advanced to the state meet in the 300 hurdles and  thrilled with her career-best time (42.84) in the state preliminaries, but she  was not happy with a slower time (43.07) and third-place finish in the final  the next day.  </P> <P> "Making it to state, and breaking my best time was great," Keffer said. "I was  really amazed. I was like, 'How did I do that?' . . But a 43 the next day? I  mean, you'd figure you'd go faster in the finals."  </P> <P> When she compares that to what happened last year, though, Keffer admits her  senior season was a good one.  </P> <P> As a freshman and a sophomore, Keffer had reached the state tournament as a  member of the relay team. As a junior last year, she seemed to have a good  chance of advancing to the state meet in the 300 hurdles. But at the Masters  meet -- the qualifying meet for the state championships -- Keffer went from  third to seventh in her race and did not advance.  </P> <P> "I gave up halfway through the race," Keffer said. "I was in third and I just  mentally gave up. I still haven't watched the video of it. I probably should. I  just went home that night and cried and went to bed."  </P> <P> Keffer said she considered that to be one of her most valuable learning  experiences. This year, Keffer was more mentally prepared than ever.  </P> <P> "She's grown tremendously, both in her times and psychologically," Varvas said.  "Track was something she just did in the beginning. She was not really into it.  But over the years, it's really become part of her life."  </P> <P> ALL-COUNTY GIRLS' TRACK TEAM  </P> <P> Event: 100 Meters  </P> <P> Player, School: Andrea Dean, Mission Viejo  </P> <P> Year: Sophomore  </P> <P> Mark: 12.36  </P> <P> Won 100 and 200 at county championships, helping the Diablos to the county  title  </P> <P> </P> <P> Event: 200 Meters  </P> <P> Player, School: Andrea Dean, Mission Viejo  </P> <P> Year: Sophomore  </P> <P> Mark: 25.38  </P> <P> Was integral part of the Diablos' South Coast League champion 400 relay team  </P> <P> </P> <P> Event: 400 Meters  </P> <P> Player, School: Kaci Keffer, Woodbridge  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Mark: 56.54  </P> <P> County champ; Woodbridge's most valuable -- and most versatile -- track athlete  </P> <P> </P> <P> Event: 800 Meters  </P> <P> Player, School: Christie Engesser, Ocean View  </P> <P> Year: Freshman  </P> <P> Mark: 2:12.79  </P> <P> Second at Arcadia, but illnesses ended her season before Southern Section  finals  </P> <P> </P> <P> Event: 1,600 Meters  </P> <P> Player, School: Shelley Taylor, Edison  </P> <P> Year: Sophomore  </P> <P> Mark: 4:54.44  </P> <P> Was disappointed with her fifth-place finish at state, but was class of the  county  </P> <P> </P> <P> Event: 3,200 Meters  </P> <P> Player, School: Martha Pinto, Katella  </P> <P> Year: Junior  </P> <P> Mark: 10:42.51  </P> <P> Ran the fifth-fastest time in county history in placing second at the state  meet  </P> <P> </P> <P> Event: 100 Low Hurdles  </P> <P> Player, School: Elinor Tolson, La Quinta  </P> <P> Year: Freshman  </P> <P> Mark: 14.51  </P> <P> County champion; only county freshman in any event to advance to the state  finals  </P> <P> </P> <P> Event: 300 Low Hurdles  </P> <P> Player, School: Kaci Keffer, Woodbridge  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Mark: 42.84  </P> <P> After advancing to two state meets on a relay, Keffer placed third in this  event  </P> <P> </P> <P> Event: 400 Relay  </P> <P> Player, School: Woodbridge  </P> <P> Year:  </P> <P> Mark: 48.83  </P> <P> Kristina Lockwood, Kaci Keffer, Madelleine Liseblad and Michelle Muniz  </P> <P> </P> <P> Event: 1,600 Relay  </P> <P> Player, School: Esperanza  </P> <P> Year:  </P> <P> Mark: 3:52.93  </P> <P> Melissa Ribaudo, Cyndi Boothby, Nikki Jackson and Lynn Murray  </P> <P> </P> <P> Event: High Jump  </P> <P> Player, School: Melissa McDonald, Mater Dei  </P> <P> Year: Junior  </P> <P> Mark: 5-10  </P> <P> McDonald -- a state long jump finalist -- won county title with 5-10 jump  </P> <P> </P> <P> Event: Long Jump  </P> <P> Player, School: Melissa McDonald, Mater Dei  </P> <P> Year: Junior  </P> <P> Mark: 18-3 1/4  </P> <P> Improved her best by 6 1/4 inches to reach state final, where she placed eighth  </P> <P> </P> <P> Event: Triple Jump  </P> <P> Player, School: Lisa Fager, Mission Viejo  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Mark: 39-11 1/2  </P> <P> Leap of 40-10 at county meet would have been a record but was wind-aided  </P> <P> </P> <P> Event: Shotput  </P> <P> Player, School: Kristin Dunn, Mission Viejo  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Mark: 42-1  </P> <P> Despite shoulder injury, won county title in the shotput and discus  </P> <P> </P> <P> Event: Discus  </P> <P> Player, School: Debbie Hargrove, Estancia  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> Mark: 143-10  </P> <P> Placed third at Masters, ninth at state  </P> <P> </P> <P> Athlete of the year: Kaci Keffer, Woodbridge  </P></p>

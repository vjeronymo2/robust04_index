			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: RISK-FREE FARE FROM PHIL COLLINS;  </P> <P> PHIL COLLINS " . . . BUT SERIOUSLY." ATLANTIC * 1/2: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A  SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> Since Collins hardly has deviated from the hot-selling, Grammy-sweeping formula  of his last solo album, an alternative title might be in order here: "No  Gumption Required."  </P> <P> This is stand-pat, risk-free music-making, as safe and innocuous as it gets.  Take a temperate, user-friendly singing voice, stir in plenty of catchy hooks,  shiny production and toe-tapping rhythms, punching it all up with bright horns  or mellowing it out with a caressing keyboard haze, and there you have it: more  hit product.  </P> <P> The formula would be easier to swallow if Collins were just a blithe popster  purveying silly love songs, but he tries here to stake a claim to substance as  well. We get a song about African famine and apartheid, two unrelated issues  for the price of one. We get songs about the homeless, and about the  indifference of the powers that be. But instead of poetic insight and edgy,  unsettling music calculated to bring home the roiling conflict and bitter  emotion at the heart of these issues, Collins feeds us stock images and the  sort of routine pity and vaguely helpless feeling already familiar to anybody  who reads a newspaper or watches a news broadcast.  </P> <P> A similar blandness pervades Collins' songs about broken love: How can you  capture depths of aching feeling when nearly every line is a cliche, and every  note comes across sleek and unmussed? " . . . But Seriously" may be the  sincere, craftsmanlike and well-intentioned effort of a real nice guy, but it  all adds up to the sound of a fat cat purring. MIKE BOEHM  </P></p>

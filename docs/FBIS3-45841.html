			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ma Jian (7456 0256) and Shen Wei (3088 0251): </F> "Seventh (Enlarged) Plenum of the Eighth Provincial CPC  Committee Closed; Plenum of Provincial CPC Committee Adopted  `Resolution on Implementing "Decision" of the Third Plenum of  the 14th CPC Central Committee' and `Resolution on Convening of  the Ninth Provincial Party Congress'; Chen Huanyou Summed Up  Meeting, Putting Forward Demands on Relaying, Implementing  Guidelines of the Third Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee  and Current Work"]    [Text] The Seventh (Enlarged) Plenum of the Eighth  Provincial CPC Committee ended in Nanjing yesterday afternoon  after successfully accomplishing all its missions. In a plenary  session held before the end of the meeting, the provincial party  committee adopted two resolutions, namely "Resolutions on  Implementing the `Decision' of the Third Plenum of the 14th CPC  Central Committee" and "Resolution on Convening of the Ninth  Provincial Party Congress." A member of the Standing Committee  of the provincial party committee presided over the plenum of  the provincial party committee yesterday. Addressing the closing  session, Provincial Party Committee Secretary Chen Huanyou put  forward demands on relaying, implementing guidelines of the  Third Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee and current work.    Chen Huanyou said: For the past four days, attending  delegates have been conscientiously studying guidelines of both  the Third Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the  National Economic Work Conference; hearing reports from the  provincial party committee; and enthusiastically taking part in  discussions after taking realities into consideration and  sharpening minds. With further unification of understanding,  better understanding of the guiding thoughts for work to be  carried out next year and various work and missions, and a  clearer way of thinking in respect to reform and opening up, a  good foundation has been laid for the successful implementation  of next year's programs.    Chen Huanyou emphasized: Various localities and departments  should conscientiously implement guidelines of the Third Plenum  of the 14th CPC Central Committee and have their current jobs  well done. Although leaders may spend more energy in carrying  out extra activities during New Year's Day and the Spring  Festival, we should not loosen our economic work even under  these circumstances. We should make use of the favorable, brisk  business conditions prevailing in the festive seasons to promote  operational and sales activities in the markets. We should  appropriately handle the circulation of funds for energy,  transportation and major enterprises and make early arrangements  to facilitate the transportation of passengers during the Spring  Festival. We should attach greater importance to safe  production by strengthening fire prevention, in particular, and  eliminating hidden dangers to avoid major accidents; vigorously  embark on winter irrigation construction; truly do a good job in  work relating to year-end distribution and cash payments; and  speed up preparations for next year's spring farming and  production. In improving price management and market supply,  various localities should closely watch the price movements in  the markets and conduct timely studies before formulating  measures and plans for containing commodity prices. It is  necessary to strengthen guidance and coordination over prices of  the daily necessities of the people, including grains, oils,  porks, fowl eggs, and vegetables to prevent the people's costs  of living from rising. Various localities should make greater  efforts to ensure adequate supply of festive goods in the  markets and show concern over the livelihood of the masses,  especially that of exceptionally poor families. We should  attach greater importance to the question of social order and  continue to take stern actions to prevent the crime rates from  going up. For public places having complicated problems of  social order, a concerted, special crime- screening exercise  should be conducted to wipe out all sorts of ugly social  phenomena. We should continue our efforts to severely crack  down on highway bandits, railway robbers, and local evil forces.  Deadlines should be set for solving problems in certain  stretches of roads and localities to help create a better social  environment for economic development and people's livelihood.  Chen Huanyou pointed out: It is necessary to firmly and  effectively carry on the anti- corruption struggle, making sure  that undesirable practices will not make a comeback during the  festive seasons. Currently, special efforts should be made to  simply various meetings, celebrations, and commendation  activities and vigorously promote civilized and thrifty habits.  We should strictly implement the guidelines set by the circular  issued by the General Offices of the party's Central Committee  and the State Council "On Strict Banning of Offering Foods,  Drinks, and Gifts With Public Funds and Extravagance and Waste  During 1994 New Year's Day and the Spring Festival." Leading  cadres at various levels should take the lead in practicing  honesty and self-discipline and continue to do well in  anti-corruption struggle and building party style and clean  government, making sure that New Year's Day and the Spring  Festival will be celebrated in a clean and honest way amid  festive joys. We should draw up plans to help the troops and  family members of the armymen solve practical problems and  further promote army-people joint effort in building material  and spiritual civilizations and "double support" activities.    Chen Huanyou urged various localities and departments to  appropriately relay and implement guidelines of this meeting and  make concrete arrangements for work to be carried out in 1994,  after taking into consideration realities of their own  localities and departments and clearly identifying their  objectives and ways of thinking.</p>

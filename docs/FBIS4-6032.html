			<p>BFN     [Text] Pusan, South Korea, April 18 (YONHAP) -- Two U.S.  Navy transport ships carrying Patriot missiles arrived in the  southeastern port of Pusan on Monday [18 April].    The 13,000-ton "Comet" and 16,460-ton "Meteor" left the U.S.  Navy Base in Oakland bound for Pusan on March 23, with an  undisclosed number of Patriot launch pads and other equipment  aboard.    These missiles, in addition to others due to arrive sometime  in the future, are expected to be deployed at military bases  here by April 29, military officials said.    The Patriot anti-missile missiles are a more advanced  version  than those used during the Gulf war in 1991.    A military official said, "the Patriot anti-missile missiles  will considerably reinforce the air defense capability here. It  is the most effective defense system against possible air  attack."</p>

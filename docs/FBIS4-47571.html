The  studies were conducted in order to clarify peculiarities of  transplantation immunity after the transplantation of fetal bone  with transplant revascularization. It was determined that in all  three recipients transplantation of fetal bone tissue of the  23rd to 24th week of gestation with microsurgical  revascularization in the recipient zone had not been accompanied  by rejection of bone tissue. Immunologic monitoring data were  correlated with indices of clinic, laboratory and histologic  studies. References 9: 5 Russian, 4 Western.</p>

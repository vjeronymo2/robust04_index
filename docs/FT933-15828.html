			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Prescott urges compromise MR JOHN PRESCOTT yesterday urged a compromise between the Labour leadership and the unions to avoid a damaging clash over internal party democracy at the party's autumn conference, Philip Stephens writes. But senior Labour officials underlined Mr John Smith's determination not to retreat from the introduction of the one-member-one-vote principle for the selection of parliamentary candidates. Mr Prescott, a member of the shadow cabinet and the party's national executive, said it was still possible to reconcile Mr Smith's proposals with the unions' demands for a collective voice in the party's affairs.</p>

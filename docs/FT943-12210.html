			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Government Bonds: Longer-dated US Treasuries gain ground Longer-dated US Treasury bonds gained ground in thin trading yesterday although many traders were staying on the sidelines ahead of this week's supply auctions. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  13/32 better at 85 1/32 with the yield slipping to 7.519 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was unchanged at 99 25/32 , to yield 6.101 per cent. The lack of movement on prices for shorter-dated paper reflected the approach of the Treasury's sale of Dollars 17.25bn in two-year notes this afternoon, followed by Dollars 11bn in five-year securities tomorrow. The auctions come at a time of renewed uncertainty over the timing of the Federal Reserve's next move to lift short-term interest rates. Yesterday's economic news was not compelling enough to dispel the listless mood. The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing single-family homes fell 3.6 per cent last month, a slightly weaker reading than forecast. The data added to recent evidence that the housing sector had begun to cool. European bonds ended a trendless session firmer, supported partly by the stronger tone in US Treasuries. But volume continued to decline and investor activity dried to a trickle. UK gilts ended the day slightly firmer and are expected to track neighbouring markets until tomorrow's auction of 6.25 per cent gilts due 2010. Mr Andrew Roberts, gilts analyst at UBS, expects the auction to go well for several reasons. For one, he cites core demand for long-dated paper by UK investors. Moreover, although the Bank of England will auction a nominal Pounds 2bn of gilts, he points out that only Pounds 1.6bn in market terms is being issued as the paper trades at a deep discount to its nominal value; in late trading, the bonds were quoted at 82 15/32 . Furthermore, Mr Roberts argues, 'the new paper will be perfectly placed to become a new 15-year benchmark.' Since the 8 per cent gilt due 2009 will drop out of the over 15-year bond index in September, the new bond will be left as the shortest bond in the index. French bonds put on a strong performance, rising by nearly a point in largely technical, futures-led trading. Traders said a large buy order of the September notional bond future on Matif, executed by a leading futures broker in Paris, and US buying pushed prices through key technical resistance. The contract rose by 0.86 points on the day to 117.62. The 10-year yield spread over bunds narrowed by about 7 basis points to 41 basis points. Buoyant French bonds supported German bunds, which ended the day about half a point higher. Trading was technical and the market largely shrugged off regional inflation data and news that the Treuhandanstalt privatisation agency plans to issue more bonds this year than forecast. The September bund future on Liffe rose 0.47 point to 94.03. Italian market sentiment was shaken by renewed political concerns, but prices were pulled higher by neighbouring markets and late short-covering in the futures markets. The Italian BTP future on Liffe rose by around 0.51 points to 104.03.</p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 3-AA / 3-A GIRLS;  </P> <P> BREA'S MOVE SOLVES BIG PROBLEM . . . FOR SOME OPPONENTS  </P> <P> Last season, many Southern Section 3-A girls' basketball coaches were shaking  their heads in despair, wondering what it would take to beat Brea-Olinda High  School.  </P> <P> This season, nearly half of those coaches are smiling.  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda, the defending state Division III champion, has moved from 3-A to  3-AA. The Southern Section expanded the division to accommodate more teams.  </P> <P> "Thank God they're in 3-AA," Rancho Alamitos Coach Bob Becker said. "I think  everyone in the 3-A Division feels that way."  </P> <P> For those who moved up into 3-AA with Brea?  </P> <P> Oh well.  </P> <P> Brea, 26-0 this season, the 3-AA's top-seeded team and defending 3-A champion,  is as strong as ever.  </P> <P> Point guard Aimee McDaniel, a preseason All-American, averages 16.4 points and  runs the floor as well as any player in the state.  </P> <P> Three other Brea players average in double figures -- Jinelle Williams (15.5),  Tammy Blackburn (15.2) and Jody Anton (11.2). The team averages 84 points a  game and holds its opponents to an average of 32.6.  </P> <P> Despite all this, and the fact that Brea is the top-ranked team in the State  Division III, Coach Mark Trakh continues to downplay the chances of his team,  which after a first-round bye, opens against the winner of Bassett (11-9)  against El Dorado (7-13).  </P> <P> "It's gonna be tough," Trakh said. "We got to come to play every night. We just  got to play hard and prepare for games, and not overlook anyone.  </P> <P> "Three years ago, we had a great team, and all everyone said was 'See you in  the finals. You guys got it made,' " Trakh said.  </P> <P> "But then we lost in the quarterfinals to Los Altos, a team no one had even  heard of. I reminded the girls of that a lot last year, and I keep reminding  them of that this year."  </P> <P> Outside of Brea, one team -- second-seeded Palos Verdes -- seems to have the  best chance.  </P> <P> Palos Verdes (24-4) is led by Lisa Humphreys, who averages 18 points a game.  Palos Verdes also likes to run, press and utilize a pesky man-to-man defense.  </P> <P> Of Orange County teams, Savanna (15-9) might be the biggest threat. The Rebels  are led by Carrie Fredrick and Jackie Boxley, two aggressive players who helped  Savanna come closer to beating Brea than any county team has this year.  (Savanna lost by 18 points).  </P> <P> Foothill (14-9) is the only other county team with a winning record. Still,  Foothill Coach Sheila Adams, whose team, after a first-round bye, plays Rim of  the World (16-7) in a second-round game Saturday, doesn't seem overwhelmingly  optimistic.  </P> <P> "Well, if we win our first game, we have to play Brea," Adams said. "So that  sort of explains it."  </P> <P> The 3-A, along with the 3-AA, is one of the weakest divisions. In the 3-AA, 10  teams have first-round byes. In the 3-A, 11 teams have byes.  </P> <P> Also, of 22 teams in the 3-AA, nine have losing records. In the 3-A, six of 21  teams have losing records.  </P> <P> Only three county teams are entered in the 3-A playoffs, top-seeded Rancho  Alamitos, Rosary and Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> Rancho Alamitos (18-3) is led by senior forward Jenny Newsome, who averages 24  points. The Vaqueros have a first-round bye, then meet the winner of tonight's  Covina/St. Paul game.  </P> <P> "Our main strengths are our physical condition," Rancho Alamitos' Becker said.  "We try to push the pace and run the ball, and the girls are in really good  shape. Also, we're highly intelligent."  </P> <P> Costa Mesa (12-11) is led by 5-9 guard freshman Olivia DiCamilli. DiCamilli  scored 32 points, including nine of her team's 10 points in overtime, and had  20 rebounds and five steals in an overtime victory over Trabuco Hills last  week.  </P> <P> DEFENDING CHAMPION -- Brea-Olinda (was 3-A champion last year before the  division was split.)  </P> <P> TOP TEAMS -- Brea-Olinda (26-0), Palos Verdes (24-4) in 3-AA; Rancho Alamitos  (18-3), South Hills (17-5) in 3-A.  </P> <P> DARK HORSE -- Savanna (15-9) in 3-AA, San Marino (16-5) in 3-A.  </P> <P> BEST DRAW -- In the 3-A, South Hills, which, after a first-round bye, will meet  one of two at-large teams, St. Lucy's (8-17) or Yucca Valley (13-9).  </P> <P> WORST DRAW -- In 3-AA, Foothill (14-9), the Century League champion, will meet  Brea if it defeats wins its first game against Rim of the World (16-7).  </P> <P> KEY PLAYERS -- In 3-AA, Aimee McDaniel (Brea-Olinda), Tammy Blackburn  (Brea-Olinda), Lisa Humphreys (Palos Verdes) and Nicki Manzo (Lompoc). In 3-A,  Jenny Newsome (Rancho Alamitos) and Karen Hecox (South Hills).  </P> <P> NOTEWORTHY -- Splitting the 3-A was not without consequences. In the 3-AA, 10  teams have first-round byes. In the 3-A, 11 teams have byes. Of 22 3-AA teams,  nine have losing records. In the 3-A, of 21 teams, six have losing records.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ramon Malenciano] </F>   [Excerpts] Marcher (Haiti), 26 May (EFE) -- While the  effects of Dominican Republic President Joaquin Balaguer's  decision to close the border with Haiti are still being  monitored, the military and wealthy Haitians continue to profit  from an increase in cross-border trade.    Wednesday, President Balaguer promised William Grey, U.S.  special envoy to Haiti, and UN and OAS envoy Dante Caputo that  the Dominican Republic would completely close its border with  Haiti in accordance to UN Security Council Resolution 917.  Nevertheless, Haitians buying fuel in the community of Marcher,  located next to the Dominican township of Dajabon, pointed out  that Haitians and Dominicans are still obtaining "significant  gains" from the sale of crude oil along the border separating  the two nations.    Jackson Marcelin and Benoit Antuan, two Haitians who make  their living by trading along the border, indicated to EFE that  the sale of fuel in this area "is a lot better than before."  They added that in the township of Marcher, a fuel distribution  center located on the banks of the Masacre River, the military  has posed no "problems, although it is necessary to give them  something (money)." [passage omitted]    Gerardo Gil, 30, a Haitian, agreed with his compatriots,  stating, "business between Dominicans and Haitians is continuing  as usual." Gil explained that on Monday, the Dominican  (military and customs) authorities allowed "unrestricted entry"  to those Haitians who normally cross the border every Monday and  Friday to buy and sell in Dajabon.    The so-called "gasoline market" extends for nearly 1 km  along  the Haitian side of the Masacre River in Marcher -- a region in  which Haitians have set up small shops operating in Dominican  territory. It is in this community where citizens from both  nations distribute fuel which, according to Haitians  interviewed, they then export to Port-au-Prince and other  Haitian cities subject to the UN-imposed embargo. The objective  of the embargo is to pressure the military leaders -- who, in  September 1991, toppled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide -- into  stepping down from power.    According to those Haitians who spoke with EFE, the fuel is  taken to Qanaminthe, where it is then accumulated "gallon by  gallon" before being taken to the "wealthy and the military in  Port-au-Prince." A gallon of gasoline (3.8 liters) that costs  20 pesos ($1.60) increases in value to more than 50 pesos  ($4.00) once it crosses the border. Despite this, Haitians only  receive between one-half and two and one-half pesos (between  four and 20 cents in U.S. currency) from the entire transaction.    In addition, Haitian sources said their profits tend to drop  even more because they have to pay the Dominican military five  pesos (40 cents) for each gallon that crosses from the Dominican  Republic into Haiti. The same sources noted that last week fuel  trafficking decreased because of the presence of "white men" --  a reference to UN observers. The presence of UN observers was  also the reason why the military decided to prevent movement  across the border.    In addition to the sale of fuel in Marcher, Dominicans and  Haitians also distribute rice, sugar, eggs, ice, and other items  not found in Haiti in the wake of the total economic blockade  that went into effect Sunday. These items increase in price by  more than 300 percent once they cross the river separating the  two nations that share the island of Hispaniola. Dominicans  normally purchase plastic and other household goods sold in  Haiti.    Marcelin, Antuan, and Gil confirmed to EFE reports disclosed  by other Haitians who chose not to identity themselves and who  indicated that trade along the border "is greater now than  before, because the other side (the Dominican Republic) is  experiencing an election." Nevertheless, it has been possible  to ascertain that "officially," military officials in both  nations are limiting the movements of Dominicans as well as  Haitians.    Unsuccessful attempts were made to contact gasoline  distributors in Dajabon in order to learn how the Dominicans and  Haitians were distributing and selling fuel in Haiti, because  gasoline stations were out of fuel and vehicle owners were being  forced to stand in long lines, sometimes for as many as three  days.    Nevertheless, according to Haitian sources, the considerable  quantity of fuel that has already reached the "market" has  prompted a decline in fuel prices. Citizens from both nations  selling their goods along the border acknowledged that they  "have heard" something about the embargo, but they added that so  far it is not noticeable in the region.</p>

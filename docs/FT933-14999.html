			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Arts: Relationships and real life - Radio THE SPECIAL relationship was modestly observed by the BBC on Independence Day Sunday. Radio 2 had Stars and Stripes Forever, about John Philip Sousa, with lots of pretty marches; Radio 4 had an American morning service; Radio 3 included naturalised-American Korngold in its morning concert and made him Composer of the Week. Peter Franklin gave a talk about him with music sounding like film-scores, though only one of them was. What if . . . ? is Radio 4's real-life SF, imaginative conjectures of life if various important matters had ended differently. Last week, Philip Ziegler and David Cannadine considered the chimerical reign of King Edward VIII. We should have probably had Queen Wallis, possibly Prince Simpson and Princess Wallis; but we might have had Queen Thelma (nee Furness). Lloyd George would perhaps have been prime minister, with Churchill in his cabinet, but the royal influence would have prevented war with Hitler's Germany. The Duke of York would have been found an appointment in Ottawa or Canberra. This week, we envisaged a more likely, so less interesting, matter, that Mrs Thatcher remained prime minister in 1990. I say 'less interesting' because the business discussed by Lord Gilmour and Roy Hattersley is but the shadow of today's problems as we see them; though they may be right that there would have been less enthusiasm for the Gulf War. Major would still have been chancellor, the Maastricht Treaty would have been accepted, Social Chapter and all. Less likely affairs in later programmes make for more curious arguments. Next Tuesday, a Jew, a Moslem and a Christian will wonder how we should have progressed if Jesus had been released instead of Barabas; and on Tuesday week we consider the possibility of life on Mars. Not a brilliant week for drama. Radio 3's Sunday play was a repeat of Martyn Wade's Burn the Aeneid. Roman experts with names in 'new pronunciation' had been charged by Virgil in his will to destroy this manuscript. Their troubles, and the plot, are eased by a simple last-minute discovery - slight but fun for those who care about Virgil. Radio 4's Saturday play was another 'movie'; I was hearing Boris Godunov elsewhere. Monday afternoon offered Scarlet on Black, which I gave up as soon as I found it wasn't Le Rouge et le Noir but a modern French crime story; and Monday evening was Marilyn Morris's Fit to be Tied, about four women working in a cake-shop making everyday chat. Tuesday's Thirty Minute Theatre, Disconnected, by Anthony George, dealt with a railway accident; one passenger had a mobile phone that called up the future, too slight a novelty to make up for the otherwise conventional talk. However, the two quasi-political serials, The House, by Christopher Lee, and Safe in Our Hands, by Colin Douglas (about the NHS), are doing well. Radio 5 has good serials, too, even when they only last two days. This week, we had A Very Wicked Headmistress, by Margaret Mahy. The school that she is headmistress of lies next to a farm where a volcanic eruption has mixed eggs, milk and sugar-beet into a lake of lumpy custard, the lumps being diamonds. The nymphomaniac farmer falls madly for the headmistress, she for the diamonds, but a farmboy and three sixth-form girls destroy all hopes of happy success. You don't believe a word? You haven't heard Stephanie Cole reading it. It was hilarious. Then The Chocolate Touch, by Patrick Skene Catling: John Midas (of Greek extraction?) finds a weird sweetshop where he is given a chocolate fetish; it makes everything he touches turn into chocolate, including his toothpaste, breakfast, gloves, pencil - and mother. But all is well. The sweetshop man provides a remedy and then his shop disappears. Philip Hawthorn read this, with some dodgy accents.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Irina Demchenko: "Ministry of the Economy to </F> Take Over Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations?"    [Text] Alexander Shokhin, Minister of the Economy, may  become the most influential and powerful figure at the highest  body of executive authority.    Confidential sources have revealed that the government has  prepared a draft resolution on the merger of the Ministry of  Foreign Economic Relations (MFER) with the Ministry of the  Economy (ME) of Russia. If this happens, the Ministry of the  Economy, which is already the most powerful government  department in Russia and is not accidentally compared to the  former State Planning Committee, will get the most prized piece  of the Russian economy as its subunit. In this way Alexander  Shokhin will become a figure almost as influential as Viktor  Chernomyrdin -- with all the political, economic and other  consequences arising therefrom.    Several circumstances that have made Viktor Chernomyrdin,  who  maintains good relations with the MFER's present-day head Oleg  Davydov, come to favor this variant. Despite the premier's  sympathies for Davydov, Russia's foreign economic activities  cannot be described as too successful. In January-February of  this year foreign trade turnover declined by 8 percent (12.7  billion dollars) in comparison with the same period in 1993.  Exports, it is true, increased by nearly 3 percent, but this  growth took place against the backdrop of the continued fall of  world prices. Imports dropped by more than 27 percent (3.8  billion dollars). According to eyewitness reports, these facts  are often reported to the premier by vice-premier Alexander  Shokhin, who, as a result of the latest redivision of powers in  the Council of Ministers, supervises this department.  Relationships between Shokhin and Davydov are characterized as  "very strained."    Sergei Glazyev, who was forced to resign his post of  Minister  of Foreign Economic Relations last year, and now heads the State  Duma's Committee for Economic Policy, sent Viktor Chernomyrdin  an official document with the results of the parlimentary  hearings, sharply critical of Oleg Davydov's work. It is  characteristic that his committee's recommendations are based on  the postulate that in 1992 the MFER under Glazyev's guidance  developed a plan for foreign economic activities, which is not  being followed now. As claimed by MFER employees, there were no  significant differences between Glazyev and his deputy Davydov  at that time. Today, however, the former minister, on the basis  of parliamentary hearings, has presented a serious bill to his  former subordinate on points dealing with accounting and control  over foreign economic activities which he himself did not manage  to organize during his tenure. Of special interest is that at  the end of the recommendations Glazyev suggests on behalf of his  committee that the government "examine the possibility of the  MFER's merger with those subunits of the Ministry of the Economy  of Russia which deal with foreign economic activities."    The premier's decision is unlikely to be seriously affected  by the recommendations of the parliamentary committee. But they  are significant on the political plane: for the first time  Sergei Glazyev, who has until now acted independently,  demonstrates his alliance with Alexander Shokhin, and, moreover,  on a fundamental issue. This may indicate a growth in the  "shadow" authority of Shokhin who in the event of the MFER being  stripped of its independence would then become the most powerful  and influential figure at the highest executive body.    If this happens, it will perhaps be possible to consider the  path traversed by Alexander Shokhin during four years from being  the Minister of Labor in Silayev's government, the connections  he acquired and the prestige he earned during this time both at  home and abroad to be the standard even in such a fantastic  country as ours.  <H5>  Forecast of Foreign Economic Activities Based On The Figures </H5> of the MFER of Russia    Foreign trade in 1994 is expected to equal 70.5 billion  dollars, that is, practically at the level of 1993.    Export. The overall volume of export is predicted  to equal 44 billion dollars (43 billion dollars in 1993).    The export of raw material commodities for state needs in  1994 is envisaged to equal a billion dollars or 25.5 of the  total volume of export of raw material goods, technical  assistance -- 1 billion dollars.    Imports. The total volume of imports in 1994 may  come to 26.5 billion dollars (27 billion dollars in 1993).    The forecast of the import of basic commodities and services  of vital importance for the country's economy and social sphere,  given the funds of the federal budget, is estimated at 4 billion  dollars. Moreover, in 1994, it is likely that goods will be  purchased to fulfil the federal raw material programs and other  state needs.    The import of raw materials and supplies on account of the  state budget is expected to amount to 1.8 billion dollars, plant  and equipment -- 2 billion dollars, building services -- 0.2  billion dollars.</p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Bosnian capital in shadow of war: Yugoslavia's melting pot is simmering with hate THE price of grenades has fallen from DM100 (Pounds 37) to DM20 over the past week in Sarajevo, the capital of the Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina. The peace agreement between Serbs, Croats and Moslems is not what has reduced the price. It is that supplies of weapons are now more abundant as the fear of civil war permeates the city. Sarajevo's inhabitants are on the verge of panic. All flights out of the city are fully booked. Rumours abound - Serbs have massacred three Moslems, the Moslems have killed a Serb baby. Last night, Moslems for the second night in a row massed in fear amid rumours that Serbs were marching on the capital. The medley of minarets and church spires in Bascarsija, the old Turkish bazaar, was once seen as a monument to peace among the republic's Slavic Moslems, Serbs and Croats. But the image of Sarajevo as Yugoslavia's melting pot has been destroyed. Everyone now seems to be armed. On the streets young men jump out of VW Golfs, toting machine guns and hunting rifles. They vow to defend their homes. Many are wearing maroon berets and military uniforms. They are all prepared for another cold night on the barricades. All the self-styled protectors blame someone else for the crisis. A Serb blames the Moslems, the Croats and the European Community. Moslems say Serb leaders are destroying Bosnia. But all sides agree that a conflict in Bosnia would be much bloodier and more brutal than the war in Croatia, which claimed at least 10,000 lives. 'Croatia is a gentle mother compared to what would happen here. God forbid it ever starts in Bosnia,' said one Serb gunman sipping Turkish coffee at a barricade on the road to Pale, a Serb village which lies amid snow-flecked mountains eight miles from Sarajevo. His comrades laugh, though not in an unkindly way, when a gun goes off and I look frantically for cover. On another road Paja, a Moslem and a towering bear of a man, warns of a massacre if the Serb-dominated federal army tries to take over Bosnia. 'Bosnia is not like Croatia. We have got mountains, tunnels and bridges. We can stop the army very easily. We can block them, destroying the tunnels and bridges. Tanks can't fly,' he says, directing his men to take up positions. Bosnian television desperately appeals for calm. The president of Bosnia says people should outside and enjoy the sunshine. But in this climate of deepening hysteria, the president's appeal is seen as a veiled call to arms. Back in the safety of my hotel I ask a man for a light. By way of reply he pulls out a revolver. His friends, gesturing with their own pistols, laugh. Outside gunshots pierce the twilight. In Sarajevo's neighbourhoods, where Serbs live across the street from Moslems who live next door to Croats, people prepare for another night of uncertainty. Others head towards the barricades or the airport. Vance mission to calm Bosnia tension Page 3 Editorial comment Page 16</p>

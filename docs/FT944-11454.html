			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Arts: Buster Keaton jazzed up Bill Frisell's guitar playing has always been out of kilter with the mainstream, so it seems quite natural that now he should be applying it to silent film. Commissioned by a New York arts centre to write new scores for a set of Buster Keaton silents, the elliptical tunes which resulted met with such approval from US audiences that he did more, and then recorded some too. In this European tour he brings his regular band of Joey Baron (drums) and Kermit Driscoll (bass) to accompany three of the best, the short classics Go West, The High Sign and One Week. To play alongside great American film is a natural progression for 42-year-old Frisell. He has a passion for popular American music and recent recordings have covered works from such diverse sources as Madonna, Charles Ives, Sonny Rollins and de Sousa. With musical anarchist John Zorn, he has collaborated in coruscating improvisation where Mickey Spillane's gangster yarns were the inspiration. In Keaton's deadpan hilarity, the American modernist has another ideal setting for his own cynical humour. The music, like Keaton's visual art, is fundamentally melancholic, but filled out with pratfalls and gags. The guitarist's playing combines a concentration on melody that reveals a background as a clarinettist and a love of dissonance that comes from listening to Hendrix. Frisell's studied way with solos mirrors Keaton's modus operandi of 'Think slow, act fast'. You might guess from this that the trio's music for films is anything but easy, and any preconceptions based on the traditional ragtime, lid-slamming treatment of silent films were quickly dispersed at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Wednesday. Frisell comes equipped with two electric guitars, one looking as though it has been in a car smash, the other shrunk in the wash. There are no fierce guitar licks where you might expect Frisell to join the car chase, and there are no wah-wah sounds when Keaton see-saws on the ladder. Instead, using the volume pedal to gently turn notes on and off, Frisell quietly captures the sadness and romanticism of the scenes as they roll by. The rhythm section orientates the score, Baron providing some essential rat-tat-tat and Driscoll moving the whole along but Frisell's self-contained sound is forever following The Great Stone Face's body language. Hard to take on its own, the coupling is what multi-media was made for. Bill Frisell Music For the Films of Buster Keaton Elektra Nonesuch 7559-79350/79351</p>

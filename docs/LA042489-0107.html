			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JOHNSON WELCOME AT '92 OLYMPICS, SAMARANCH SAYS  </P> <P> Ben Johnson would be welcome to compete in the 1992 Olympics even though he was  caught using steroids at the Games in Seoul last summer, the head of the  International Olympic Committee said Sunday.  </P> <P> IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch said Johnson must be treated like any  other athlete, despite being involved in the biggest drug scandal in Olympic  history.  </P> <P> "Why not?" Samaranch said when asked if he would like to see Johnson competing  for a gold medal again. "Johnson was treated like any other athlete in Seoul  when we suspended him. Now, we have to do the same. . . . He must not get more  sanctions because he is Johnson. This is not fair."  </P> <P> Samaranch spoke as the Olympic committee's executive board prepared to open  four days of meetings in this Spanish coastal city, where the 1992 Games will  be held.  </P></p>

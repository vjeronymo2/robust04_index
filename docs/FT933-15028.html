			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Minding Your Own Business: The art of running a gallery - The hard work behind the popping wine corks 'IT IS a myth,' says Anna-Mei Chadwick, 'that running an art gallery is all about opening shows and bottles of wine.' Five days after the birth of each of her children, she was back at work at her gallery in London's Parsons' Green. She regularly works 10 hours a day, seven days a week. Yet when she advertised recently for a part time assistant in The Guardian, she received 1,000 applications. Although she was an art market correspondent for seven years, Anna-Mei regards herself first and foremost as a retailer. 'The retail trade is very tough - you need stamina and a lot of help,' she says. 'Dealing with the general public takes a certain strength. Anybody can walk through that door - this year we've had a record number of flashers.' As the gallery has established a reputation for showing works by both acknowledged and unknown artists, every week several artists walk in uninvited trying to persuade her to exhibit their work. In 1986, Anna-Mei was the art market correspondent for the Antiques Trade Gazette when she realised she had learnt so much about art galleries she could run her own. With the early 1980s passion for prints on the wane, she felt there was an opportunity to sell affordable art. She found a 1,500 sq ft site on the New King's Road in Parsons' Green and after a long unsuccessful search for a suitable name for the gallery, a marketing friend suggested she used her own. She did, and the gallery opened in the autumn. Initially, she approached artists she knew and found others by going to open shows and competitions. She concentrates on artists with promise who are not necessarily well-known. In the early days, most paintings sold for under Pounds 500; nowadays Pounds 500 is the average price with a limit of Pounds 6,000. To keep costs down, she insists frames should be inexpensive and simple. She tries to create a firm market in her artists' pictures. 'We don't pay retainers and don't have exclusive contracts with our artists, so we rely on their loyalty to come back,' she explains. 'We have a set commission for all our artists and pay within 30 days of the end of the show which is unusual. Our artists know we don't juggle around with the prices on the wall. If you give discounts then people know the pictures on the wall were overpriced in the first place. Besides, if people came in from the City they'd beat me on the haggling.' At the first one-man show in 1987, featuring the paintings of Roy Freer, just three paintings were sold at the private view. By 1991, clients queued for hours outside before his show opened. That evening, Pounds 30,000 was turned over. That, says Anna-Mei, was exceptional. Each year, the gallery runs some 17 shows, some shared. The summer exhibition displays the work of about 30 artists. Private views cost Pounds 2,000: 'People always think the expensive part must be the wine, but a couple of cases of wine cost nothing compared with printing the invitations and sending them out,' she says. Attendance is unpredictable, although the presence of one or two celebrities invariably helps. 'One of the lowest turn-outs was the night that England played in the World Cup semi-final against Germany, although we did very well that night because the people who came were all serious about buying,' she recalls. The recession has had a similar effect: fewer people come to shows than in the late 1980s, but those who do, often buy. This year, Anna-Mei expects turnover to reach Pounds 250,000. Although it has risen steadily since the gallery opened, it was two years before she took on a full time assitant - and then only because her first child was due in a month's time. She now employs one full-time and one part-time assistant but feels even if she could afford to take on more, she would still need to be in the gallery much of the time. Clients and artists expect to see her. 'Running an art gallery is a very personal business - you have to be there, rather than an assistant. It's not like running a chain of shops.' When she started, her husband, a chartered accountant, took care of the book-keeping. Over the years, Anna-Mel has taken this over. Rent is the main cost, then wages. It has not been all plain sailing: a computer supplier went bankrupt and there have been burst mains and a flood. She has also had to install security tags to counter the pilfering of prints. The clientele and stock of artists were boosted in 1989 when Anna-Mei bought the client list and artists' names from Karen McGrath, the owner of the McGrath gallery on Richmond Hill, which was closing down. In spite of the offer of partnership with a West End gallery, she has preferred to keep the gallery small and independent while the children are young and has no desire to move to the West End. Besides, she says, being small means 'you can do your own thing and afford to make one or two mistakes.' The worst of these was when her former assistant rang a client's wife to inform her that she could collect a painting bought by her husband. It was then discovered that he had actually bought it for his mistress. Anna-Mei Chadwick, 64 New King's Road, London SW6 4LT 071-736-1928</p>

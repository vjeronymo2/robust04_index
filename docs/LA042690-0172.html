			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: RETAIL/TOURISM  </P> <P> Economy Hotel: Marriott Corp. has already dotted the county with hotels  offering a range of room rates. And, on Wednesday, the giant lodging chain  dedicated its newest hotel, the 135-room Fairfield Inn in Buena Park.  </P> <P> The Fairfield Inn is the economy version of the Marriott group. For prices  starting at $31.95 a night, weary travelers get few extras: For example, the  rooms offer no travel-size shampoo or bubble bath. The hotel has only one  meeting room and no attached restaurant.  </P> <P> But the Fairfield Inn, on Orangethorpe Avenue near Knott Avenue, does have a  swimming pool. Although it may sound closer to the Motel 6 price range,  Fairfield Inn spokeswoman Dee Dee Dochen said other Fairfield Inns around the  country typically draw from budget-conscious travelers who want Marriott  quality without Marriott prices.  </P> <P> While new to Orange County, Fairfield Inns now has 50 locations around the  nation.  </P></p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading VOLUME IN stock index futures showed a marked improvement from the previous three sessions, inspired by increased activity from leading securities institutions, writes Joel Kibazo. The opening trade in the June contract on the FT-SE 100 was recorded at 2,860, but after an initial advance it went into retreat when a leading securities house came into the market as a seller. This sent June falling to 2,850 and turned out to be the first sign that the larger institutions had spotted opportunities to trade; lack of interest by these large funds had been a significant feature of the previous three sessions. When the selling order had been completed, June moved steadily forward for the rest of the morning, with the news of the government reshuffle making little impact on trading. The afternoon brought a further advance and the day's high of 2,869 came around 2.30pm, although a late bout of profit-taking meant June was unable to sustain earlier momentum. It finished at 2,862, up 8 from its previous close and around 3 points ahead of its estimated fair value premium to cash of 5 points. Turnover improved to 8,911 contracts. Volume in traded options was 26,402 lots. Some 8,703 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 2,278 in the Euro FT-SE option. GEC, Argyll Group and BP were the day's most active stock options.</p>

			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> MOBIL CLEANS UP OIL SPILL FROM PIPELINE  </P> <P> A minor spill from a leaking pipe at the Mobil Oil Co. piers 10 miles north of  Ventura turned white sea foam to a frothy brown along 300 yards of beach early  Thursday.  </P> <P> By noon, a crew of 30 men in white suits had removed the oil from the water and  beach.  </P> <P> The crew spread spongy booms to soak up much of the estimated 10 gallons of oil  that seeped through a pinhole in the pipeline.  </P> <P> The spill posed no danger to swimmers and little harm to aquatic life, Ventura  County Environmental Health officials said. Nevertheless, Mobil was right to  call out a full cleanup crew, said Greg Smith, specialist in the hazardous  materials section of the environmental health division of the County Resource  Management Agency.  </P> <P> "Even a small spill spreads out over a wide area," Smith said. "And all the  small spills add up, so even the little stuff has to be dealt with."  </P> <P> Matt West, production technician at the Mobil office in Ventura, said Mobil  discovered the spill about 6:50 p.m. Wednesday. The leak, about 300 yards  offshore in the pipeline leading from the pier to shore, was stopped, but  officials did not know the cause of the leak.  </P> <P> "We want this cleaned up as fast as possible," West said. "We would rather have  overkill than not have enough." JOANNA MILLER  </P></p>

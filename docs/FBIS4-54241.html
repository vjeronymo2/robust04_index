			<p>BFN     [Text] President Clinton's decision to renew China's  favored trading status has been welcomed by American business  groups, but condemned by human rights organizations.    Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, has also  welcomed  the announcement and the decision to remove the link between  China's trade status and human rights issue. Senator Evans said  it was unlikely that the withdrawal of Most Favored Nation  status would have significantly advanced the human rights cause  in China.    [Hong Kong AFP in English at 0535 GMT on 27 May, in a  similar  report, adds: "Canberra said pressure on China to make human  rights improvements in order to get MFN status again had  appeared counterproductive, with change in China being more  grudging than it might otherwise have been. `Trade and  investment is playing a catalytic role in China's economic  reform through the introduction of ideas, capital, technology  and foreign exchange,' Evans said. Economic growth and  liberalisation would `generate their own momentum for political  liberalisation,' he said. `The Australian Government agrees  with President Clinton's sentiment that, if we are serious about  improving human rights, the best path is now to intensify and  broaden engagement between the US and China,' Evans said.    ["In a statement echoing the view of trade analysts here,  opposition trade spokesman Tim Fischer said the US decision was  correct and that withdrawal of MFN status would have threatened  Australia's trade, especially in wool. `China has been  extremely successful in value-adding to its purchases of  Australian wool and in marketing woollen clothing in the US.  This outcome is clearly a breakthrough for US trade policy that  was showing signs of faltering, and will be welcomed by  Australia's wool growers.'"]</p>

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Books: Reflections on Spain / A look at the plethora of books triggered by Columbus and the Barcelona Olympics CAN THERE be anyone who has failed to notice that this is Spain's year? Publishers are determined to remind us. Columbus, Seville, Barcelona - by the end of 1992 Spain will have spun full circle and returned to its former empire glory. Robert Hughes, art critic of Time magazine, has written an enjoyably irascible history of Spain's greatest non-Spanish city, Barcelona (Harvill Pounds 20). His view of Barcelona is, naturally, coloured by its architectural and artistic past, with wonderfully intemperate side-swipes at its designer-mania present. Hughes loves Barcelona and Catalonia but his passion is clear-headed enough to be infuriated by some of the contemporary characteristics of his beloveds. Hughes is at his most entertaining when he yokes erudition and ill-humour together, as when dealing with the Japanese tourist obsession with Antoni Gaud's unfinished Sagrada Familia: 'Nobody in Barcelona is quite sure why the Japanese have fixed on Gaud in this way . . . One thing is sure: the Sagrada Familia is the first Catholic temple whose bacon was ever saved by Shinto tourism. Not even Gaud, who believed in miracles, could have foreseen that.' It is strange that a writer who is both a native Spanish speaker and widely recognised as a great novelist should have contributed in this Year of Spain a far less impressive, indeed in some passages quite bonkers, history of both Spain and its relationship with Latin America: The Buried Mirror: Reflections on Spain and the New World by Carlos Fuentes (Andre Deutsch Pounds 20). The design of Fuentes' book - lots of lavish black and white photographs - as well as the fact that it accompanies yet another television series, indicates a coffee-table audience. With a name and pictures you can get away with anything - at least that seems the assumption. From orgasmic nonsense over bullfighting ('The matador is a tragic representation of man's relation to nature, the actor in a ceremony of remembrance of our violent survival at the expense of nature') to constructing false myths to fit preconceived views of history (such as sentimentalising Gaud at his death as 'an anonymous artisan') Fuentes' book is the kind of stuff to give apoplexy to Hughes. Fuentes promises historical sweep but ends up mailing us postcards from his sweepings. Far more entertaining is Barcelonas, by Manuel Vazquez Montalban (Verso Pounds 17.95). Vazquez is one of Barcelona's leading journalists and author of books ranging from crime fiction to Catalan cookery. His view of Barcelona is wonderfully sardonic and off-beat. Vazquez does not much like the thought of his city's Olympics and points out the social frictions the Games have exacerbated among the city's poor, many of whose squalid homes have been bulldozed out of its path. He has a grim style: 'When Franco's occupying troops entered the city, fourth on the list of organisations to be purged, after the Communists, the Anarchists and the Separatists, was Barcelona Football Club.' And he confirms Hughes' assertion that Barcelonans have a Swiftian scatalogical obsession, by analysing the sociology of Barcelona's sewers: 'regular visits to today's sewers would act as a perfect counterbalance to the conceit of urban man.' Odd, but wonderfully unlike pre-masticated cornflakes. Gijs van Hensbergen also avoids the cornflake factor in his A Taste of Castille (Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 17.95). In 1986 he upped sticks and left England in order to learn how to cook pigs' trotters (and much else) in a Segovian restaurant. That may not sound a recipe for hilarity but his Rabelasian adventure could initiate a new sub-genre, the comic-cooking-travelogue. Earlier this year the BBC produced a six-part documentary series looking at the country's history and contemporary condition; Ian Gibson's Fire in The Blood - The New Spain (Faber/BBC Pounds 17.99) is a by-product of that series. But as so often with books-of-the-TV-programme, it falls short of expectations. Not really history, it makes forays in that direction; not really sociology, it considers how Spaniards view topical matters such as abortion, feminism and environmental depradation; not a travel guide, it is written by one of the foremost non-Spanish (Gibson is Dublin-born) travellers around. Gibson's other book - Lorca's Granada - A Practical Guide (Faber Pounds 14.99), originally published in Spanish in 1989 - is sadly much less likely to be promoted. A pity; Gibson is an expert on one of Spain's greatest artists, and it is a clever idea to present a travel guide to Granada by tracing Lorca's lifesteps around the city. It is a pleasure to walk the streets in the company of someone who knows them so intimately. For those who find their history most accessible through lengthy descriptions of painting, architecture and other visual arts, Spanish Journeys - A Portrait of Spain, by Adam Hopkins, (Viking Pounds 16.99) is required reading. Like Lorca's Granada, what we have here is a novel method of gauging the development of a culture and a society. But although Hopkins writes sympathetically of such as Goya and Picasso, his book nevertheless has a feeling of pre-masticated history. Neither fish nor fowl, it is too dry, too uninvolved to inflame its passionate subject-matter. Much of the rest make warm milk-and-oats seem wildly exotic. The Sierras Of The South - Travels in the Mountains of Andalusia by Alastair Boyd (HarperCollins Pounds 16.99) might be found charming by some readers, in the way that jocosity can often be mistaken for wit. But an individual's travel must have something very special about it in order to have impact today. If you seek elegant expertise, then Cities of Spain by David Gilmour, (John Murray Pounds 17.95) is just the ticket. Enlightening and historically confident, Gilmour's book is the perfect companion piece for any traveller in Spain. Seville by Sarah Jane Evans (Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 18) is not imperative, since although she clearly knows Seville well, her writing often leadenly strives after heights it cannot reach. Everyone intending to visit Spain for either the Barcelona Olympics or Seville's Expo should be reminded that, for quality insights into this most splendid of countries there are still only two surpassing books, published some 25 years ago; Raymond Carr's history, Spain and Hugh Thomas's The Spanish Civil War. Sad that no one can quite match them here, though Hughes and Vaquez Montalban get very close indeed.</p>

			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TRIPS HELP COYOTES AVOID FALL;  </P> <P> GIRLS' TENNIS: COMPETITION ABROAD HAS TOUGHENED PLAYERS FOR TOP-RANKED  CALABASAS.  </P> <P> The Calabasas High girls' tennis team had a summer full of adventure.  </P> <P> Senior Natasha Pospich competed in the U. S. Olympic Festival. Senior Alison  Paris and her sister Tracy, a sophomore, traveled to Europe and played on a  national team that competed against players from the Netherlands, Germany and  Sweden. Sophomore Stacey Jellen took a two-week break from school this fall to  play in Yugoslavia.  </P> <P> Returning to high school tennis might seem dreary after a summer such as many  of the Coyotes had. But after an agonizing, 10-8 loss to Dana Hills in the  Southern Section 3-A Division finals, Calabasas has posted a 12-3 record and  emerged as the favorite for the 3-A championship. The Coyotes, who finish the  regular season today at home against powerful Miraleste, are ranked No. 1 in  the division, having defeated second-ranked Beverly Hills and then-No. 3-ranked  Agoura.  </P> <P> The strong showing is no surprise. Seven players returned from last season,  including the top three singles players -- Pospich, Jellen and Alison Paris.  Calabasas was 16-1 and claimed a Frontier League title last year.  </P> <P> After their summer of high-caliber tennis, the Coyotes have lost to only Santa  Barbara and San Marino, both ranked in the 4-A top 10, and Marlborough. Besides  the impressive numbers, the team's ability to remain focused has pleased  second-year Coach Bill Bellatty. He is certain the team will sustain that  motivation when the playoffs begin a week from today.  </P> <P> "Good players can get their heads together," said Bellatty, who is also the  boys' basketball coach. "This team has a goal, and they know what it is and  that it will take wins to get there."  </P> <P> The Coyotes cannot repeat as league champions because the Frontier League has  discontinued girls' tennis, thus making the chase for the 3-A title more  urgent.  </P> <P> Bellatty would prefer to compete in a league and secure one championship before  playing for the division title.  </P> <P> "It's nice to be in a league and to come in first," Bellatty said. "Now the  kids don't have that chance. That is why I made the tough schedule."  </P> <P> The strong regular-season competition can only help Pospich, the fifth-ranked  player in the most recent Southern California Tennis Assn. girls' age 16 group  and the No. 16 player in the United States -- according to the U.S. Tennis Assn  -- and Jellen, seventh in the nation in girls' 14s.  </P> <P> "The schedule has more variety," Jellen said. "I like it that we are not just  going through the motions, playing the same teams twice in one year. I think  when you face better competition it raises your play."  </P> <P> The summer trips helped many players handle the burden of being every team's  target this season.  </P> <P> "It's not as intense here as it was for me in Yugoslavia," Jellen said.  </P> <P> Pospich added: "I've felt a little more pressure, and I think the team has felt  a little more pressure, because everybody wants to beat us. But being number  one has also given us confidence."  </P> <P> Jellen accepts the No. 2 position graciously, even though on many teams she  could play in the top spot. With two more years at Calabasas, she can learn  from the veteran Pospich.  </P> <P> "We are like best friends," Jellen said. "I play number two, she plays number  one, and I've never wanted to challenge her."  </P> <P> Alison Paris, No. 3 in singles, lacks national credentials like Pospich's or  Jellen's but nevertheless is respected. She likely will play tennis at an Ivy  League school.  </P> <P> Tracy Paris and Melissa Pifko form Calabasas' top doubles team.  </P> <P> "Other teams stack their doubles teams against us," Pospich said. "The Beverly  Hills coach even admitted she put her strongest players in doubles to try and  beat us, and we ended up beating them by one game. The singles players will  have to try and motivate the doubles players, because without them we can't  win. But I think they have the talent to do it."  </P></p>

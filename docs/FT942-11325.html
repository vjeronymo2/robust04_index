			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / World Trade News: ABB grant bid opposed by GE A bid by Asea Brown Boveri, Europe's biggest electrical engineering company, to participate in a US energy department programme to develop the next generation of turbines is running into opposition from General Electric, its largest US competitor. The dispute has set off a wider controversy in Washington about a concept called 'conditional national treatment', under which subsidiaries of foreign companies are treated differently from US companies depending on conditions in their home countries. The issue has been discussed in US government inter-agency groups and may soon get an airing by the Clinton cabinet. GE and Westinghouse, another US power engineering company, have already won approval to take part in the programme, under which the energy department provides matching grants - in this case around Dollars 4-5m (Pounds 2.7-Pounds 3.4m) - to participating companies. Although the initial funding of such projects may be small, companies like ABB believe it is important that they are not excluded from key research because they are foreign companies, said Mrs Nancy McLernon, a spokesman for the Organisation of International Investment. Under the Energy Policy Act of 1992, there are two criteria in awarding grants: an economic benefits test, to determine that the award will benefit the US, and a reciprocity test. The latter requires that a company's home government allow participation in similar programmes and protects intellectual property rights. General Electric has circulated a paper implying that the Swedish-Swiss ABB should not be allowed to participate because its home governments do not protect intellectual property rights. The paper also suggests that if ABB were involved in the programme, it would use the fruits of the research not to create employment in the US but to strengthen its technological capacity in Europe. ABB already has a substantial presence in the US, where it has expanded through acquisitions of companies including Combustion Engineering, a leading maker of boilers for power generation. In the Americas as a whole, ABB had sales of Dollars 5.6bn last year and employs about 35,000 people, many of them in the US. It is understood that the US Energy Secretary failed to determine that GE and Westinghouse were eligible for the scheme on the basis of the economic benefits test. That process is now underway retro-actively.</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Doubts temper recovery German business yesterday warned that a robust economic recovery was in danger of papering over persistent weaknesses in the economy, caused mainly by pressure for higher wages and increased taxes. 'There are doubts about the steadiness of the recovery,' said Mr Franz Schoser, a spokesman for the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DIHT), which polled 25,000 companies for its autumn survey of business confidence. The survey findings are a timely reminder for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's new government already warned by the Employers Federation, which called for an urgent restructuring of the social security system. Many of the companies surveyed are waiting for the outcome of talks on forming the new government, due to end in the next 10 days, before committing themselves to medium-term strategy, the report said. Companies in western Germany will still suffer from weaker consumer demand next year, the report warned, caused by an array of taxes, including the reintroduced solidarity surcharge for eastern Germany and new insurance and health charges. They are also worried that the wage talks in the spring will lead to higher wage rises. The trade unions are likely to push for an extra 6 per cent while Mr Hans-Peter Stihl, the DIHT chairman, said recently that a pay rise close to the inflation level, now just under 3 per cent, would be acceptable following a round of zero pay rises this year. Despite the economic recovery only 9 per cent of west German companies said they were planning to hire new staff, up from 5 per cent this time last year; 28 per cent said they would be shedding jobs. The report also warned that machine running times were too slow and that more and more companies were moving production facilities abroad to take advantage of cheaper labour costs.</p>

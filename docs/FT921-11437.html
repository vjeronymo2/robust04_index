			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Renewed violence in Yugoslavia feared FEARS of renewed violence in Yugoslavia mounted yesterday after Mr Marrack Goulding, the United Nations special envoy, said he would not be recommending the deployment of 10,000 UN peace-keeping troops to Croatia. Mr Goulding, who returned to the US after ending negotiations with Croat, Serb and federal army officials, said differences of interpretation of the UN peace plan continued to block the deployment of the peacekeepers, despite a three-week ceasefire. Western diplomats yesterday expressed fears that the ceasefire could be broken if there was substantial delay in deploying the peacekeeping troops. While Croatia has some objections to the plan, the strongest oppostion comes from leaders of Serb regions in Croatia. Mr Milan Babic, head of the self-proclaimed Serb republic of Krajina, southern Croatia, is refusing to allow the deployment of peacekeepers there, and is calling for the Serb-dominated federal army to remain in Serb-populated regions of Croatia. He says Serb irregulars will not be disarmed unless Croat forces are also disbanded. The Serb-controlled state presidency, which may now exert considerable pressure on Mr Babic to accept the plan, said yesterday in a statement that 'it had drawn up an unspecified programme of activities' to gain backing for the plan from Serb leaders in Croatia.</p>

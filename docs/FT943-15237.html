			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Exaggerated death of the county council The survival of county councils now looks increasingly likely in much of England as the review of the structure of English local government approaches the end of its first stage. By the end of this week the Local Government Commission for England, chaired by Sir John Banham, will have published its recommendations for all but three counties. Of the 20 on which proposals have been published since the beginning of June, only four rule out retaining county councils. In the others the existing two-tier structure of county and district councils remains an option. The commission must now submit its proposals for local consultation. The options will be included in leaflets to be sent to every household in the counties affected. If local opinion comes out in favour of preserving counties and districts, this would offer the government the opportunity to back away from its policy of creating new unitary councils, combining the functions of counties and districts. With growing opposition to change from Conservative backbenchers, ministers could say that the review had delivered a verdict that only minimal change was necessary. The legislation setting up the review requires the commissioners to state a preferred option when they draw up their reports. However, the commissioners have presented their latest recommendations as the start of a consultation, emphasising that they would be happy with any of the alternatives they present. They insist that the exercise is not a referendum, as other factors such as cost and viability must be taken into account. But a strong vote against wholesale reform would make it hard for the commission to recommend change. Commissioners' statements also reflect lack of enthusiasm for change. Sir John told an audience in Leicestershire that 'the level of popular support for unitary districts in England is very low indeed' and that the commission was 'not in the business of changing for its own sake'. The commission is also emphasising the potential costs of reorganisation in its literature. It said annual savings could be as little as Pounds 1m from the proposed new unitary structures in Lancashire and Surrey, while the set-up costs could be as high as Pounds 28m and Pounds 44m respectively. However, some changes seem certain to emerge from the process. These include: Unitary status for older cities such as Leicester, Nottingham, Portsmouth and Southampton, and fast-growing newer cities such as Milton Keynes and Swindon. The return, with unitary structures, of some small counties, such as Herefordshire, Huntingdonshire and Rutland. Unitary structures for small counties which are easily split, such as Bedfordshire. Extension of unitary structure for towns bordering large metropolitan areas  -such as Slough and Dartford on the edge of London and Warrington near Greater Manchester. But the two-tier system now seems set to survive outside major cities, particularly in large counties which have economies of scale, such as Essex, Kent, Hampshire, Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire. Proposals for nine counties will be announced this week: Devon and Essex today (although proposals for Essex were leaked last week); Durham, and East and West Sussex tomorrow; Northumberland and Northamptonshire on Wednesday; and Norfolk and Suffolk on Thursday. Proposals for the three remaining counties - Cornwall, Hertfordshire and Shropshire - will be published in September.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITIM report] </F>   [Text] The first Gaza Strip Palestinian was yesterday  detained and locked up in the city prison. Palestinian Police  officers detained Hani' al-'Abd, who is suspected of having  committed criminal offenses.    Al-'Abd, a Jabalyah resident and an Islamic Jihad activist,  was detained at his workplace -- the Khan Yunus Technological  College. He was placed in the same cell in which he had been  held by Israeli security services.    In reaction, the Islamic Jihad distributed a leaflet in Gaza  claiming that Hani' al-Abd's arrest was the beginning of a civil  war. The leaflet argued that al-'Abd was detained because of  his affiliation with an organization that opposes the agreement  with Israel, and not because of criminal charges.</p>

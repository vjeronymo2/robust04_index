			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Supercomputers head for industry SUPERCOMPUTERS, traditionally restricted to research laboratories and government departments because of their size and cost, could soon find more general applications in industry, following the launch of a machine no bigger than today's file servers. The desk-side unit, just 29 inches high, has been developed by Wavetracer, of Acton, Massachusetts. The two Zephyr models have 4,096 or 8,192 microprocessors, so the larger machine can process more than 8,000 streams of data in parallel. (Traditional serial computers can only process one stream of data at a time.) The company says that in tests by the US Department of Defence the more powerful model, the Model 8, was capable of computing more than 700m operations per second. Although less than half the speed of a Cray supercomputer, Wavetracer points out that at Dollars 150,000 (Pounds 84,000) the Zephyr is just a fraction of the price. The machines are sold in the UK by CGI Computer General, of Chippenham, Wiltshire. Contacts: Wavetracer: US, 508 635 9000. CGI Computer General: UK, 0249 445566.</p>

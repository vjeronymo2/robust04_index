			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNFIT CONDITIONS  </P> <P> Someone once calculated that by the time a typical American child reaches the  age of 18 he will have spent more hours sitting in front of a television set  than sitting in a classroom. It shows. Employers increasingly complain about  the near-illiteracy and lack of usable skills of many young people entering the  job market; tests reveal how ignorant even many college students are about  basic history, geography and the language they speak. Now comes further  evidence that children are not only neglecting to exercise their minds but  apparently aren't bothering to exercise their bodies, either. Physical fitness  tests administered to nearly 800,000 fifth-, seventh- and ninth-graders in  California found disturbingly low levels of performance throughout the state.  </P> <P> The widespread inability to meet minimum flexibility, muscular and endurance  standards continues a trend among young Americans first noted -- and deplored  -- more than a generation ago. For all the talk in recent years about the  health benefits of adequate exercise, California's children, who are probably  representative of the nation as a whole, clearly aren't getting enough.  </P> <P> What's wrong with being sedentary at the age of 11 or 13 or 15? What's wrong is  that theinclinations of childhood all too readily become the habits of  adulthood. Research by Dr. William Dietz, director of clinical nutrition at New  England Medical Center Hospitals, has shown a clear correlation between TV  watching by kids and obesity; the more time a child spends staring at the tube,  the chubbier he is likely to be. An out-of-shape 13-year-old is far more likely  than his fit counterpart to grow into an out-of-shape and ailing 33-year-old,  with worse to come as the sedentary years roll on. A study of 6,000 men done at  Auburn University in Alabama found that those who watched TV more than three  hours a day were twice as likely to be significantly overweight -- and so more  vulnerable to major illness -- than those who watched less than one hour a day.  </P> <P> This year's California test scores provide a basis of comparison for coming  years. They also strongly support findings by the President's Council on  Physical Fitness and the Amateur Athletic Union that fitness among young  Americans is on the decline. Obviously school districts ought to be doing more  to promote physical education. Just as obviously, parents should start  encouraging their children to engage in physical activities more strenuous than  changing channels on the TV set.  </P></p>

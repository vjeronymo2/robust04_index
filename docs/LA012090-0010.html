			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN HONORABLE CHOICE FOR BARRY;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON: HIS POLITICAL CAREER MAY BE CRIPPLED, BUT THE MAYOR COULD STILL  LEND AN IMPORTANT HAND TO DEFEATING DRUGS.  </P> <P> District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry, facing federal narcotics charges after  being caught in an FBI "sting," must now be wondering about his political  future. I do not wish to prejudge the charges against him, but assuming they  are true -- assuming also that he has a substance-abuse problem of some  duration -- I have some advice for him. Instead of going forward with his  planned announcement of his reelection bid, he might consider making a speech  along the following lines:  </P> <P> Friends, supporters and fellow citizens of the District of Columbia: As you  know, I had planned to come before you today to announce my candidacy for  reelection as your mayor. But for reasons well known to all of you, I must give  you a different message.  </P> <P> For those of you who are impatient, the bottom line is that I will not run  again at this time. For those of you who care to listen, I want to tell you  why.  </P> <P> I have a problem. I don't need to discuss the details of that problem, except  to say that it is a problem that I can no longer handle alone. I thought I  could. I thought I was strong, and I am. I thought I was smart, and I still  think I have more intelligence than my enemies give me credit for. I thought I  was invincible. I am not. That is why I have decided to relinquish my duties to  my city administrator and seek professional help.  </P> <P> You ask me why I have waited so long to acknowledge that I need help, and the  answer is that denial is part of the problem with my particular ailment. At  first I denied it because I honestly believed there was no problem. Then I  denied it because I thought I was strong enough to handle it on my own. And  finally I denied it because to own up to it would have meant giving up my  political career and also giving satisfaction to my enemies.  </P> <P> I'm here today to tell you that these things no longer matter. What matters is  that I do what is necessary to restore myself to health and vigor and that my  city not be dragged down.  </P> <P> I did not reach this decision easily. Many of you have shown your willingness  not to believe the rumors about me in the absence of proof. Others have  determined to stand by me, even while believing the rumors, because you didn't  want to play into the hands of people who don't have our best interests at  heart. It had been my idea to use that support for my own political purposes,  to make the mayoral race an us-against-them campaign. Such a tactic might have  succeeded. It still might. But I have decided not to do it.  </P> <P> Why? For at least three reasons. First, my recent difficulties, added to the  rumors and innuendo that have surrounded me in the last year, make it  impossible for me to give full time and attention to my duties as mayor.  Second, a number of my friends have convinced me that while they think I could  tough it out, it is not in my interest to do so. They have convinced me that my  personal health is more important than my political career.  </P> <P> The third reason is that I have become convinced that the only way for me to  win reelection would be to divide this city along the lines of race and class.  Some of my enemies won't believe this, but I care about Washington and its  social and economic health more than I care about being mayor.  </P> <P> Some of the amateur psychiatrists out there are saying that I really wanted to  get caught, because it was the only way I could get the help I need. They are  saying that is why I lived dangerously, why I associated with some of the  people I associated with. They may be right, but I don't believe it. What I  believe is that I simply got caught up in something that I could not control.  </P> <P> I am now determined to regain control of my life, and I will seek the help  necessary to do that. Marion Barry, the mayor, is up to history to judge. I  believe that judgment will be favorable. I have been a good mayor. I have  brought economic development to the District of Columbia, and I have given hope  to its hopeless citizens.  </P> <P> But whatever history's judgment of Marion Barry the mayor, I must now turn my  attention to Marion Barry the man. My health, my self-respect and my family are  now at the top of my agenda.  </P> <P> Let me close my remarks with a word to the young people of this city. I know  you think that you are stronger than drugs, that you can handle it. That is  exactly what I thought. I thought I was strong; I thought I was powerful. I  thought my personal strength and my high office would somehow protect me and  help me to defeat the drugs that are doing so much damage to our city and our  nation.  </P> <P> Well, let me tell you, based on personal experience, that the only way you can  defeat drugs is to leave them alone. Use my experience for your own lives. Draw  strength from my successes; learn humility from my failures, pray for me, and  be the best you can be.  </P></p>

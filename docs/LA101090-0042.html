			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY TO BUILD PUBLIC HOUSING FOR FARM WORKERS;  </P> <P> SHELTER: A VARIETY OF FUNDING SOURCES WILL BE USED TO CONSTRUCT 38  THREE-BEDROOM APARTMENTS IN SAN MARCOS.  </P> <P> San Diego County supervisors voted Tuesday to move ahead with plans to build  and operate a public housing project for farm workers in San Marcos.  </P> <P> Board members voted to authorize the county housing agency to apply for about  $4 million in state and federal funds for the project. Under the plan, the bulk  of the funds, more than $3.5 million, would come from the U.S. Farmers Home  Administration, with $400,000 from state Housing and Community Development  funds.  </P> <P> The plan calls for the county to purchase 7.9 acres of undeveloped land in San  Marcos for $865,000 from a private owner and build 38 three-bedroom apartments  for farm worker families. Gabriel Rodriguez, county director of Housing and  Community Development, said the parcel is located on Firebird Lane.  </P> <P> Supervisor John MacDonald, who has been working with various government  agencies to find a way to build much-needed farm worker housing, said the  project will cost about $4.8 million.  </P> <P> "We've been talking a lot about doing something about (farm worker) housing. .  . . This action is significant because we're finally doing something about it,"  MacDonald said.  </P> <P> Farm worker and migrant housing has evolved as an emotional issue in North  County over the years. The rapid development of the area has placed newly built  communities on the doorsteps of migrant camps featuring lean-tos and other  crudely fashioned shacks. Many migrants work in the agriculture industry or as  day laborers.  </P> <P> Rodriguez stressed that all of the proposed units would be made available only  to farm workers. In order to qualify, an applicant would have to earn at least  51% of his or her income from agriculture, Rodriguez said.  </P> <P> "There is no lacking for a population group who would qualify," Rodriguez said.  </P> <P> He estimated that in San Marcos alone there are about 600 students who come  from farm worker families. He added that figures provided by the state  Employment Development Department suggest there are between 10,000 and 12,000  people employed in agriculture in North County.  </P> <P> MacDonald said the planned 38 units of housing are a modest beginning, but he  called it the start of a solution.  </P> <P> "When you look at the number of (farm workers) who need housing in North  County, it looks like a drop in the bucket. But my feeling is if you never  start, you never finish," he said.  </P> <P> There is no timetable for the project. Qualifying for federal funding remains a  major hurdle, but MacDonald said he is optimistic that serious planning for the  project can begin next summer.  </P> <P> State funding for the project will come from funds established for farm worker  housing resulting from a bill introduced last year by Assemblyman Nolan Frazee  (R-Carlsbad).  </P> <P> However, the project could also be victimized by another hitch. According to a  report submitted to the board, the city of San Marcos will have to provide  almost $730,000 in funds and fee waivers in order for the project to begin.  About $640,000 in funds would come from the city's redevelopment agency, while  about $90,000 would come in building fee waivers.  </P> <P> San Marcos City Manager Rick Gittings said that the City Council has not made  any financial commitments to the county.  </P> <P> "We've indicated that we are certainly willing to assist them on proposing and  working on the project," Gittings said. "But the city has made no financial  commitments at this point. . . . At this point there are more questions than  answers, but we are willing to work with them on this project."  </P> <P> The board took additional action Tuesday to deal with the issue of farm worker  housing. Board members approved a proposal to waive building fees for growers  who want to build housing for their employees and to speed up their  applications.  </P></p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / International Company News: Loans move signals sea-change on Wall St - Investment banks eye commercial lending Four years ago, a series of big loans to highly leveraged companies nearly brought First Boston, the US investment bank, to its knees. When the junk bond market collapsed, it was left holding USDollars 1.2bn of what were meant to be temporary 'bridge' loans, which it had planned to refinance in the bond market. But times have changed in the leveraged finance business. The junk bond market had a record year in 1993 - and CS First Boston (as it is now known) is returning to corporate lending. Only this time, the bank says, it will put the loans on the balance sheet of sister bank, Credit Suisse. The loans move signals a sea-change on Wall Street. US commercial banks have had their eyes on the junk (or sub-investment grade) bond market for some time. Now, US investment banks are arranging loans for sub-investment grade companies. Unlike in the 1980s, when they advanced large-scale bridge loans to back one-off transactions, they say loans will be a standard service. Recently, three of the country's largest securities houses - CS First Boston, Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers - hired commercial bankers to create commercial loans units. Wall Street is not planning to compete head-on with the commercial banks for lending business, though. Mr Seth Waugh, who heads Merrill Lynch's corporate bond and high-yield departments in North America, says the decision to originate commercial loans is an extension of the product line Merrill offers to clients, rather than a radical step in a new direction. At CSFB, Mr Mark Patterson, head of the firm's leveraged finance group, says: 'It's a line extension to clients whom we already serve in many other ways. We're not reinventing the banking wheel. All we'll be doing is offering clients the ability to work with our bank on the senior debt layer of their capital structure.' Industry analysts take a similar view. Mr John Keefe, and independent analyst in New York, says: 'I don't know if anyone will spend immense amounts of time and effort on it . . . It's more an effort to round out their product line, rather than to staunch any competitive move by (commercial) banks' into the bond business. There are clear similarities in the approach taken by the three Wall Street firms. Each has its eyes on the sub-investment grade loans market. Raising money for smaller companies without a strong credit rating is in some ways more profitable than doing business with big ones - there is less competition for the business and fees are higher. There are other reasons for staying in non-investment grade lending. Mr Waugh explains why Merrill Lynch does not need the capital strength of a bank to originate loans: 'Initially, the plan is to stay only in the leveraged part of the market - high-yield, not investment-grade - because it is not as intensive in terms of balance sheet usage.' The indication from Merrill and the other firms, however, is that they might begin originating loans in the investment grade sector. In another marked similarity between the firms, each has hired an executive (or two, in the case of Merrill) from Chemical Banking to lead their lending businesses. That may not be surprising, given that bank's current dominance of the syndicated loans market, and the market for non-investment grade credits. But Chemical, an agent or co-agent on half of the Dollars 22.8bn of such debt raised in the second three months of the year, denies the move will damage its syndicated loans business. There is one clear difference between the approach taken by the three firms. While CSFB will originate loans on behalf of Credit Suisse, Merrill and Lehman plan to sell their loans on to syndicates of banks, and only occasionally keep part of the exposure on their own balance sheets. Rivals question this approach. According to one senior investment banker: 'It makes a lot of sense for First Boston. It has a parent that's already a bank, a bank that has extraordinary financial strength. 'But for Merrill, it does not make much sense at all. The problem is that you need a whole infrastructure. Anybody can originate a loan, but what about syndication, administration, and how you deal with a work-out if you have a problem? Credit Suisse can do all that, Merrill can't' Mr Waugh at Merrill disagrees. Getting into the loan business is a natural move for securities firms, he says, because 'these days loans are trading much like securities. It's a pretty active and liquid market.' Many investment banks already hold loan assets bought from commercial banks in the secondary market. Moreover, he says that apart from the short-term commitment of capital required when putting together a syndicate, the new business will not be using any extra capital. Anyway, says Mr Waugh, 'if we hold fewer bonds and more loans, we're improving our balance sheet because by definition loans are more senior than securities.' Such comments carry echoes of the bridge financings of the 1980s: they were meant to be temporary. With those memories still fresh, the investment banks are likely to tread more carefully this time.</p>

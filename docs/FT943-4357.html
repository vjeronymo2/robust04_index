			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Intimate PC aims to fill in the blanks In the 21st century we will carry tiny computers with us everywhere we go. Mr Mik Lamming of Rank Xerox Research Centre in Cambridge told the British Association how these 'intimate computers' might be programmed to help locate those missing bits of information that we can spend hours looking for. Mr Lamming was speaking about a research project called Forget-me-not. The Forget-me-not, a hand-held portable computer, is programmed to remember everything a user does. When the user can only recall part of the information they need, the computer will be able to supply the missing pieces. At present the Forget-me-not monitors where its user is, what telephone calls they make and receive, and what messages they send by electronic mail. It also monitors what files are passed from one Forget-me-not to another. The position of the user is monitored using wireless transceivers in different rooms in the research centre. The researchers are investigating how other information could be collected by the Forget-me-not. Information about what the user does at work could easily be collected. Information about the television programmes watched at home would also be easy to record. But storing information is only the beginning of the problem. It will be some years before we will be able to tell whether it will be easier to get information from the Forget-me-not than from our own memory.</p>

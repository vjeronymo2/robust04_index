			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. CARS  </P> <P> Surprise. Domestic auto sales are in a slump.  </P> <P> I submit a partial list of possible reasons why:  </P> <P> My 1985 Dodge Shelby Charger has had the brakes fail, the alternator fail, the  timing belt fail, the computer fail, the headlights fail, the fuel system fail,  the radio fail, the tachometer fail, the cooling system fail, the  air-conditioning system fail, the battery fail (twice), the hatch lifters fail  and the paint fail.  </P> <P> Then there is the turbo, lurking under the hood for the warranty to expire amid  a flurry of repair dollars.  </P> <P> Is there any question why the American public is giving pause before purchasing  a domestic automobile that is (1) overpriced to start with, (2) unreliable and  will need inevitable/expensive repair of even basic systems and (3) will lose  resale value faster than back issues of Proctology Digest?  </P> <P> DANIEL A. KOBLOSH  </P> <P> Redondo Beach  </P></p>

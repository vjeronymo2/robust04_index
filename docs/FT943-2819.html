			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Major offers Ulster a vote on results of peace talks: Sinn Fein challenged to end ceasefire doubts as broadcast ban is lifted Mr John Major yesterday moved to speed up the Northern Ireland peace process by lifting the government's broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein and challenging the party to end doubt about the permanence of the IRA's ceasefire. But the prime minister balanced this with his first unequivocal commitment to submit the outcome of political talks to a referendum inside the province. He also gave his clearest assurance yet to unionists that last month's ceasefire announcement was not the result of a secret deal, insisting: 'The cessation of violence has not been bought.' Separately, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, ordered the re-opening of 10 Ulster border crossings. Mr Major said this was 'emphatically not a political decision' and was taken on security grounds. The abolition of the broadcasting ban means the voices of Sinn Fein's representatives will be heard on Britain's airwaves for the first time in almost six years. Mr Major's attempt to regain the initiative follows mounting pressure from Dublin and Ulster nationalists over the past two weeks for him to respond more positively to last month's IRA announcement. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, welcomed the moves announced by Mr Major and indicated a similar referendum would be held in the Irish Republic. Speaking in Belfast, Mr Major sought to put the onus for starting the countdown to Sinn Fein's involvement in the talks process squarely on republican leaders by making it clear he was still not satisfied the IRA had renounced violence permanently. Britain has promised to start talks on how to admit Sinn Fein to the political process within three months of a permanent end to violence. The government would 'go on scrutinising both words and actions until . . . we can sensibly make the assumption that the IRA truly intend to end violence for good', he said. The date on which the three-month period started was 'in Sinn Fein's hands. If they are able to say to me tonight, 'We have ended violence not just for a short time but in all circumstances and for all time', then the clock can start ticking before midnight'. But in Londonderry last night, Mr Martin McGuinness, the deputy leader of Sinn Fein, refused to be drawn into declaring the IRA's ceasefire permanent. Instead he repeated his earlier comment that the IRA's cease-fire covered 'all circum-stances'. Describing the lifting of border controls and of the broadcasting ban as a 'healthy development', he said Sinn Fein would take the 'next few weeks' before deciding its position on a referendum. However, he warned: 'The conflict will not be resolved until it is resolved on all-Ireland basis.' Mr Major emphasised that 'neither we nor the main constitutional parties can sit down at the table with them to negotiate under even the possibility of a threat'. In a clear attempt to reassure unionists, Mr Major said his commitment to a referendum meant it would be for the Ulster electorate to decide whether to accept any package of proposals emerging from political talks. 'My commitment means that no one can go behind your backs,' he said. 'It will be for you to decide.' Mr Peter Robinson MP, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist party, said the prime minister's speech was 'an advance'. However he believed it 'fell short' in that the prime minister was 'still capable of taking decisions outside the talks process without the consent of the people'. The prime minister said the broadcasting restrictions were no longer serving the purpose for which they were intended. All paramilitaries now had the opportunity to 'tell us directly . . . that they are truly committed to peaceful methods only, and to there being no resumption of violence in future', he said. In recent months, ministers have come around to the view that the broadcasting ban had become a weapon for critics of the government, but they were anxious not to antagonise moderate unionists and Tory backbenchers by lifting it prematurely. Yesterday's announcement comes eight months after Dublin lifted its broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein, and a day after the first full meeting of the British cabinet since the summer. Mr Reynolds, on a visit to Hong Kong, said the British and Irish governments were considering the formation of a cross-border tourism organisation.

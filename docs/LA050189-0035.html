			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF A PANTS-CHASER  </P> <P> Now that John Tower has tumbled into the abyss of celebrities past, there may  be no point in trying to find a feminine counterpart for the word womanizer.  </P> <P> Womanizer is defined as "a man who is sexually promiscuous with women." As  applied to Tower by the media, however, it had the added meaning of a man of  political power who used that power to attract and dominate women.  </P> <P> Because relatively few women hold positions of power in Washington, and because  those few are known to be exquisitely circumspect in their relations with men,  there hardly seems any need for an opposite to womanizer.  </P> <P> However, as more and more women reach positions of power, and as we cannot  expect them to be any less aggressive than men in its use, perhaps the media,  at least, should have a word handy in case the need arises.  </P> <P> Bill Wahl of Pacific Palisades suggests vamp, "a woman of seductive charm and  sensuality who is unscrupulous in her exploitation of men."  </P> <P> Tom Barnard of San Clemente suggests femme fatale -- "an alluring woman,  especially one who leads men to their downfall and ruin."  </P> <P> Excellent words, though somewhat mildewed; their fault is that they imply women  who destroy men, not merely use them.  </P> <P> Olivette Sprague says, "What's wrong with nymphomaniac?. . . . It comes on  pretty strong, but I'm sure the media would have found much worse things to  call a female who was under fire as was John Tower."  </P> <P> Maurice Zolotow, the Hollywood historian, confesses long and exhausting  liaisons with not one but two nymphomaniacs, one after the other, when he first  came to Hollywood. After they took up with other men, he searched for yet  another nymphomaniac, but never found one.  </P> <P> As a result of these not entirely disagreeable experiences, Zolotow feels, as I  do, that nymphomaniac designates a mentally unbalanced woman, not simply one  whose enjoyment of sex is indiscriminate and unrestrained. He suggests,  instead, nymphomaniste. "It has a better feel to it and besides it has the  soupcon of Gallicism which is necessary in amorous matters."  </P> <P> But my colleague Doc Johnson favors nymphomaniac. "I fancy that a nymphomaniac  would revel in the attentions of a womanizer, and vice versa."  </P> <P> But he thinks nymphomaniacs are no easier to find than Zolotow's third one.  "I'm quite willing to concede that womanizers exist and that nymphomaniacs are  as ephemeral as the mayfly, as easy to hold in one's hands as the  will-o-the-wisp, a Chimera (impossible or foolish fancy). . . ."  </P> <P> I do not concede, in any case, that nymphomaniacs are the opposites of  womanizers; and if there are such females, I doubt that a womanizer would be  interested in pursuing one, any more than a nymphomaniac would be interested in  pursuing a womanizer. Both of them, I should think, would be drawn toward the  young and innocent. Just as a womanizing senator might be expected to use his  power on a dependent secretary, so a nymphomaniac senator, if one should ever  be elected, would be interested in virile young men of a lower political order.  </P> <P> For the sake of our country's moral welfare, let us hope that Johnson is right,  and that the nymphomaniac is but a fancy.  </P> <P> Gerhard Henschke of Van Nuys notes: "The German language that had not the  Puritanic and Victorian traditions had the very colorful word Mannertoll (mad  for men) while the word for womanizer is Schurzenjager (apron hunter), which  clearly indicates the class consciousness of the 'Herren' who abuse the maids."  </P> <P> Finally, I am obliged to correct at least half of my friend Sara Boynoff's  statement: "There is no feminine counterpart for the word womanizer. Just as  there is no feminine counterpart of the word cuckold."  </P> <P> "Your reader was wrong about there being no word for a female cuckold," writes  Barry S. Rein of Azusa. "It is cuckquean. Look it up in the Oxford English  Dictionary."  </P> <P> I did. And it's there. But it's obsolete. Probably hasn't been used (until  today) since the 17th Century.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Frank W. Ellis of Los Alamitos raises another question. "There is  also no equivalent female term opposite to avuncular. Walter Cronkite is often  described as avuncular. What is Betty Friedan?"  </P> <P> That's an interesting question.  </P></p>

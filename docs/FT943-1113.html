			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Observer: Canary silenced The Corporation of London, meanwhile, is cock-a-hoop that BZW and its 4,000 employees have been dissuaded from setting up shop in Canary Wharf. Currently scattered around the City in numerous buildings, the investment bank had been poised to combine its operations under one roof on the Isle of Dogs. But a memo was circulated to staff at the end of last week to the effect that 'the overall economics' of the move would not prove 'sufficiently attractive'. The Corporation, meanwhile, has worked out that, if an organisation has to pay its people incentives worth, say, Pounds 2,000 to move to this less than fashionable part of town, it is effectively spending Pounds 10 more per square foot in rent. A nifty little calculation that has apparently been drawn to the attention of BZW's chairman Sir Peter Middleton fairly recently.</p>

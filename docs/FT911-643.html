			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Retail margins on food higher than in Germany QUESTIONS about the structure of the UK grocery industry will be raised by a study showing that a sample basket of supermarket groceries costs 12 per cent more before tax in the UK than in Germany. According to a report by KPMG Management Consulting, the German basket of goods was 5 per cent cheaper than a comparable range of UK products even after the standard rate of food tax had been added. There is no equivalent food tax in the UK. Mr Hew Dalrymple, head of KPMG's food and drink strategy group, said the findings destroyed the myth that UK food costs were among the lowest in Europe and suggested that discount food retailers might have considerable potential to expand in the UK. The comparative basket contained 11 products ranging from staple foods such as flour, white bread, butter, cheese and bacon to more exotic fare such as frozen cheese-and-tomato pizza. The UK supermarket basket cost Pounds 26.36; the German equivalent Pounds 23.53 before tax. The cost of the UK basket was split between the manufacturers' selling price of Pounds 19.17 and the retailer's margin of Pounds 7.19. The comparable split in Germany was Pounds 18.96 and Pounds 4.57. The survey, which also covered Denmark and Sweden, found that prices varied widely among products depending on the efficiency of local manufacturing and patterns of consumption. Prices of bacon and salami were substantially lower in Germany and Denmark because of the efficiency of local production. Frozen pizzas and chips were cheaper in the UK and Sweden because of high consumption. Mr Dalrymple said that price competition in the UK market would increase over the next three to five years as the big multiples completed their expansion programmes. 'Once the market has fully grown you will only be able to grow further by capturing other people's market shares, leading to more competition which will be good for the consumer,' he said. 'In Germany there is a thriving discount sector, and that clearly puts pressure on the multiples in terms of their mark-up.' Mr Dalrymple said the study showed UK corner shops gave good value compared with their German counterparts. The same basket of goods cost Pounds 29.31 at an independent grocer in the UK compared with Pounds 29.87 before tax in Germany.

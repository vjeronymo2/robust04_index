			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (18): Red tape slows pace - Property On one Warsaw corner, a building pockmarked by bullets fired during the second world war is falling down. On the next corner, a brand new set of offices, built with the money of foreign investors, is already in operation. Slums stand beside prosperous shops, unfinished office blocks dot the landscape. But the confusion is only the outward manifestation of a property market that is growing very quickly, but not always consistently. In fact, the Polish property market presents something of a paradox. On the one hand, Poland faces urgent shortages of all kinds of housing and commercial property. As in the past, young Polish couples live with their parents due to the absence of cheap housing. At the other end of the market Sprint, the American telecommunications company, recently asked Peter Choynowski, the chairman of Prime Property Inc, to find 50 large houses, built to American standards, for its employees. 'We've found 12,' he said, 'and we look for more every day.' Rents are upwards of Dollars 2,500 a month; the asking price of one new, four-bedroom house in one of the better Warsaw neighbourhoods is Dollars 450,000. At the same time, however, property prices at all but the very highest level of the market - a tiny handful of new office buildings in Warsaw and a few large, well-located houses - are relatively low compared to other prices, and have, in fact, dropped since the collapse of the communist regime. A high quality, 100 square metre flat in central Warsaw can sell for as little as Dollars 50,000, and smaller flats in new apartment blocks change hands for Dollars 10,000. This is partly because recession and rapid economic changes have forced many more properties on to a market which was artificially small in the past. Low prices are also connected to several bottlenecks which are peculiar to Poland's transitional economy. It is still legally impossible to evict anyone from his 'primary residence' and for this reason banks are wary of granting mortgages. Until the law, which is due to change, is altered, most housing property will be purchased with cash. 'Because they can't take out loans, people right now prefer to rent than to buy,' said Ryszard Strzelczyk, the chairman of the Strzelczyk Corporation estate agency. As in the past, over-regulation and the slow pace of bureaucracy also continue to affect the market. To buy land or buildings, foreigners are still required to obtain clearance from the interior ministry. While few purchasers are turned down, the procedure can add months to a transaction. Land sales are further hampered - and development projects slowed - by confusion over plans to carry out 're-privatisation', which would allow some owners whose property was confiscated by the communist government to reclaim it. Although much discussed, the law on re-privatisation has yet to pass, and until it does - or decisively does not - many transactions will remain on hold. The other important bottleneck is the difficulty of obtaining finance - a problem which Chris Grzesik of Price Waterhouse called a 'chicken-and-egg situation'. Most Polish banks will not lend money to developers, he said, until they have at least 30 per cent of their space pre-let. Yet, most Polish companies, wary of plans which often fell through in the past, will not sign a lease until a project is well under way. For those who can overcome bureaucratic obstacles, several trends are clear. Because very high quality office space is virtually unavailable in Warsaw, rents in the centre of the city are high. One Polish-American joint venture, the Warsaw Corporate Centre, has rented out 90 per cent of its office space at Dollars 50 a square metre since its completion in 1993. Most other projects with foreign funding are in the planning stages, mostly slowed by financing problems. Those which are further along include a joint venture between Skanska, the Swedish developers, and the local authority, which is designed to create 80,000 square metres of office space in central Warsaw. The development of Warsaw's suburbs is also just beginning. Standard flats in tower blocks are still being sold and purchased - they constitute, after all, the bulk of the market - but the acquisition of a dzialka budowlana, a piece of land on which to build a house, is what most Polish families are now saving for. Some are now buying land which is not yet approved for residential use. Several foreign companies have started development projects, often using identical housing 'kits' imported from abroad, although none has succeeded yet on a large scale. Already, in relatively close suburbs such as Wilanow and Anin, more carefully designed family houses are being built with the expectation that they will be worth several hundred thousand dollars. The bottleneck holding up suburban development is the absence of good roads and public transportation. This is true of all principal Polish cities, but Warsaw in particular. Many would-be suburban settlements in the more distant satellite villages also lack proper sewage, water and electricity installations. Perhaps the best sign of the increasing interest in property is the financial health, and increasing sophistication, of Warsaw's estate agents. Once famous for being little more than individual brokers who took their clients round the city on public buses, the big agencies now have catalogues, computers, and advertising campaigns. The Dragowski Agency, the largest in Warsaw, has an annual turnover of nearly Dollars 1.5m and that is before the boom which Lech Dragowski, the company's chairman, believes is coming within the next year or two. 'It is senseless for Poles to invest in property while the stock market is still rising 20 per cent every month,' he said. 'But when that ends, we may be one of the beneficiaries.'</p>

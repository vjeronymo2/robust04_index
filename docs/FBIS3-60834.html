			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A responsible Egyptian source said today that the  visit to Libya by Usamah al-Baz, director of President Mubarak's  Office for Political Affairs, has not achieved any positive  results on the fate of Libyan dissident Mansur al-Kikhya, who  disappeared in Cairo. The same source added that al-Baz received  no gesture of cooperation from Libyan officials on this issue.  He noted that al-Kikhya's disappearance is now being handled at  the security level pending the outcome of an investigation into  the incident. The source said that Egypt and its people do not  tolerate anyone harming Egypt's security or its guests.    So far, no official statement has been issued on the results  of al-Baz's visit to Libya. Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa  said Monday that Egypt's stance on the issue will be determined  by the outcome of the security agencies' investigations.    After al-Baz's return on Tuesday, some deputies asked the  government to announce the outcome of his mission to Libya and  the results of investigations.    An Arab diplomatic source has clarified that the Egyptian  Government's silence on al-Baz's visit shows its dissatisfaction  with Libya and its conviction about that government's  involvement in al-Kikhya's abduction.</p>

According to the communique, the possibility has been  eliminated to get truthful information and objective analysis of  public affairs and policies of opposition parties from radio and  television. To support the statement, the communique mentions  the elimination of discussion programmes and their turning into  monologues. In the AFD's view, another step towards political  monopoly is the dismissal of all those who insist on giving  objective information to the public.    The communique says that, according to press reports,  government forces are holding talks with a part of the  opposition about appointments at the helm of radio and  television. The AFD does not take part in any such talks. The  Free Democrats are ready to participate in consultations about  the media law but, at these talks, they seek to examine whether  the government is willing to guarantee objective and many-sided  information, the communique says.</p>

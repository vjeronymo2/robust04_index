			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 23 May (DPA) -- Fifty Haitians  traveling on a boat to the United States were arrested by Haiian  soldiers today. It is the first clear sign of the new plan  backed by the military leadership to severely punish illegal  immigration.    The frustrated refugees were arrested on a beach near Petit  Goave, a small port city located some 60 km west of  Port-au-Prince, two independent radio stations reported in the  Haitian capital.    Emile Jonassaint, the provisional president appointed by the  Haitian military leadership, following his installation in power  two weeks ago, warned that he would punish anyone caught  violating the island's laws, especially the law condemning those  who leave the country without visas or proper documents.    Several analysts said the Army and other enemies of exiled  President Jean-Bertrand Aristide hope to reduce the escape of  Haitians to prevent the United States from deciding to use its  military strength to resolve the political crisis in Haiti,  which has lasted 30 months.    Preventing the entrance of Haitian refugees has been one of  the primary objectives of U.S. policy since the bloody military  coup that overthrew Aristide in 1991.    Since the coup more than 40,000 persons have fled Haiti in  boats. Since President Bill Clinton announced two weeks ago that  his country would give Haitians the possibility of requesting  political asylum instead of returning them to the island, more  than 1,200 persons have been caught at sea and sent back to the  Caribbean nation.</p>

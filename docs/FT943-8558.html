			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Rover plans investment of Pounds 1.5bn for new models Rover Group, the leading UK carmaker and a subsidiary of BMW of Germany, is planning to develop a range of smaller Land Rover four-wheel-drive vehicles as part of a five-year new model investment plan. The group is aiming to increase investment to around Pounds 1.5bn in the next five years from the Pounds 1.2bn spent on model development in the previous five years, said Mr John Towers, Rover chief executive. 'We are now openly committed to increasing our investment in the next cycle of new models,' he said. The group has spent around Pounds 300m to develop a luxury Range Rover to be launched as a flagship for the group in the autumn, but it is understood that Rover is seeking to expand its presence in the fast growing world market for four-drive sports/utility vehicles, where it is already the leading European manufacturer. Land Rover, the group's specialist four-wheel-drive division, is planning to launch a vehicle range, probably in 1997, positioned below its current Range Rover and Discovery ranges and designed to appeal to younger car buyers. Such a vehicle would compete with rivals such as the Suzuki Vitara and the recently launched Toyota RAV4. Mr Towers said that 'Land Rover should be part of creating opportunities for people further down the range'. 'It is sensible and right to consider a business proposal to allow Land Rover to spread its net and create an ability below Discovery prices to attract people into the Land Rover fold.' The Discovery itself, currently priced in the UK between Pounds 17,600 and Pounds 26,800, has already transformed Land Rover's fortunes and has opened up new market segments since it was launched in 1989 to complement the luxury Range Rover and the utility Defender ranges. It accounted for 50 per cent of Land Rover sales last year. 'We have a further opportunity to invite people to get involved below the Discovery, but not far below,' said Mr Towers. Total Land Rover sales jumped by 30 per cent last year to a record 73,527 from 56,450 in 1992, and Land Rover output has increased further by 35 per cent to 43,600 in the first six months of this year, helped by the launch of the Discovery in the US last spring. Land Rover sales in the US in the first seven months of the year have more than doubled to 5,640 from 2,572 in the corresponding period a year ago. The Land Rover division was one of the main attractions for BMW, the German executive and luxury carmaker, which paid Pounds 800m to acquire the Rover group early this year.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article under the rubric ``Such Matters'': ``Arguments and </F> Figures'']  txt}[Text] In the last issue we reported that the subcommittee  for science of the Committee for Education, Culture and Science  of the State Duma had rejected the draft of the budget, which  was submitted by the government, in the area that concerns the  allocations for science. It was proposed to return it to the  government for fundamental revision. What prompted the  subcommittee (one of the concerns of which, incidentally, is the  adjustment of the budget for the purpose of reducing state  spending) to take such a resolute step? We offer for your  attention the line of reasoning of the experts of the  subcommittee, which was set forth in the conclusion on the draft  of the law of the Russian Federation ``On the Federal Budget for  1994'' with respect to the section ``Basic Research and the  Promotion of Scientific and Technical Progress.''    ``The amount of financing of basic and applied science,  which  is envisaged by the draft of the budget, is catastrophically  inadequate. As compare with 1991, when the share of science came  to 1.03 percent of the gross domestic product, the spending on  scientific research in comparable prices has decreased to  one-half.    The proposed draft of the budget preserves the deformed  structure of expenditures on science, which has formed in recent  years, when the share of assets for the remuneration of labor  and social insurance came to more than 81 percent. The indicated  structure completely ignores the sharp, thirty- to fiftyfold,  increase of the prices for energy resources and the substantial  increase of the cost of transportation and municipal services  and the outlays on scientific equipment, materials, reagents,  and scientific information. Thereby merely the maintenance,  moreover, the extremely inadequate maintenance, of a portion of  the scientific personnel is being achieved, without the  possibility of conducting scientific research itself.    The sum of the proposed expenditures on science of 11.8  trillion rubles [R], which appears in the aggregate balance,  should not be misleading, since the extrabudgetary research and  development fund, the deductions to which are not of a mandatory  nature and, therefore, under the conditions of the economic  crisis are unrealistic (in 1993 of the forecast R1.7 trillion of  extrabudgetary assets of research and development only R41.6  billion were actually received), makes up two-thirds of this  amount. Thus, it is actually necessary to count only on the  budgetary component--R4.5 trillion (0.6 percent of the gross  domestic product).    In the submitted draft of the budget the remainder principle  of the financing of the scientific sphere is firmly established,  since it is financed from the development budget, the formation  of which, in accordance with the law 'On the Budgetary System of  the Russian Federation,' is carried out only in the absence of a  budget deficit, but such a deficit is incorporated in the  submitted draft. Thus, science does not have in practice  guarantees of financing.    In the opinion of the subcommittee, the spending on civilian  science, which is included directly in the federal budget for  1994 in Article 15 of Section 4, should come not to R4.5  trillion, but to not less than R7.7 trillion (1 percent of the  gross domestic product and 4.2 percent of all budgetary  spending, which is half the share of the gross domestic product  that is allocated for science in developed countries and is  acceptable only in case of substantial tax, tariff and customs  benefits), of which not less than R2.8 trillion should be  allotted for material expenditures, the purchase of scientific  publications, the assurance of a modern level of information  service of scientists, as well as the compensation of the energy  outlays on the maintenance of scientific institutions and the  covering of the energy costs of energy-intensive scientific  project. Thus, the minimum expenditures on science will require  the additional allocation of R3.2 trillion.    Even these funds will make it possible to meet the needs of  only a portion of the scientific research, therefore, at the  same time it is necessary to envisage an increase of the share  of the direct financing of projects and programs and the  addressed support of scientific schools and collectives and  individual researchers. The share of budget assets (including  the assets liable to distribution through funds), which ensure  the implementation of a selective scientific and technical  policy, should make up not less than 45 percent of the total  spending on science. Here it will become possible to channel  into the financing of basic science, which is national cultural  property and creates the prerequisites for the economic revival  of the country, about R2.5 trillion (0.35 percent of the gross  domestic product, which corresponds to the pattern of spending  for these purposes in developed countries). It should be  emphasized that throughout the world the state assumes  practically entirely the financing of basic science.''    The conclusion about the necessity of allocating additional  assets was supported by the participants in a conference held in  the subcommittee, which representatives of the RAS, the Russian  Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the Russian Academy of  Education, the Russian Academy of the Arts, the Russian Academy  of Architecture and Construction Sciences, the Russian  Engineering Academy, the Academy of Technological Sciences, the  Academy of Natural Sciences, Moscow State University, the  Council of Rectors of Moscow Higher Educational Institutions,  the State Archival Service, the State Committee for Higher  Education, and the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy of  Russia attended.</p>

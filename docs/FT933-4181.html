			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Israel and PLO agree to peace: Recognition achieved as leaders exchange letters ISRAEL and the Palestine Liberation Organisation, bitter enemies for nearly three decades, recognised each other yesterday in a decision which will enable the signing of an historic peace accord between the two parties in Washington next week. Israel said Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, would sign a letter to Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, in a public ceremony this morning after receiving two letters signed by Mr Arafat last night in Tunis. The Arafat letters, which were approved by the PLO executive, were being ferried from Tunis to Jerusalem by Mr Johan Joergen Holst, the Norwegian foreign minister, who played a critical role in the Israeli-PLO dialogue. In a letter to Mr Rabin, Mr Arafat commits the PLO to recognising the Jewish state's right to exist in peace and security, to a peaceful resolution of all future conflict, to a renunciation of terrorism and violence and to convening the Palestinian parliament-in-exile to amend its founding charter which denies Israel's right to exist. In the second letter, addressed to Mr Holst, Mr Arafat says that after Monday's signing of an Israeli-Palestinian peace accord on self-government for the occupied-West Bank and Gaza Strip, he will call on the 1.9m residents of the Israeli-occupied territories to suspend the intifada - the six-year-old Palestinian uprising. Mr Rabin's letter to Mr Arafat says: 'The government of Israel has decided to recognise the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people and commence negotiations with the PLO within the Middle East peace process.' The letter marks the abandonment of years of virulent Israeli hostility to the PLO, which it had branded a terrorist organisation bent upon the destruction of the Jewish state. The move paves the way for an end to a conflict marked by terrorism, assassinations, hijackings and violence committed by one side or the other since the PLO was set up in 1964. It also paves the way for the first durable peace between Jews and Arabs. in the Holy Land and the beginnings of a Palestinian homeland. Earlier, Mr Rabin told Labour party MPs that Mr Arafat would tell the residents of the occupied territories that 'a new era has begun, an era of reconciliation, building and co-operation, and especially opposition to terror and violence'. Mr Moshe Shahal, Israeli police minister, and Mr Holst said separately that a broader agreement on Palestinian self-rule, including immediate Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho, initialled in Norway three weeks ago, could now be signed in Washington on Monday. A US official said the ceremony was set for 11am at the White House. Mr Arafat said he would attend the signing if he was invited by President Bill Clinton to the ceremony. Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, who clinched the peace deal, is expected to sign for the Jewish state. Mr Arafat is currently barred from entering the US after Washington cut contacts with the liberation movement in 1990. Mr Clinton, however, said yesterday the US would now consider resuming dialogue with the PLO 'if the PLO statement . . . meets the criteria we have repeatedly set down: renouncing terrorism and acknowledging Israel's right to exist'. Both Mr Peres and Mr Arafat appeared in an unprecedented live connection on French Television. 'This is really an historical change after 100 years of war, Holocaust and victims,' Mr Peres said. Yesterday's breakthrough on mutual recognition follows days of secret and difficult negotiations in Paris over how to word the letters. The PLO was concerned about Israel's demand that it suspend the intifada. The text was finally nailed down between Mr Uri Savir, director-general of Israel's foreign ministry and Mr Ahmed Qurie (Abu Ala), head of the PLO economics section, after it was agreed Mr Arafat could send a second letter to Mr Holst which specifically avoids using the word intifada. In Israel there were signs that virulent right-wing opposition to the agreement was waning. Mr Ariel Sharon, one of Israel's most uncompromising hawks, said the right wing led by the Likud party should accept that the peace agreement was irreversible. Israel and Palestinians, Page 4</p>

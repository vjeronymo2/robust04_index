			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> A'S KEEP PRESSURE ON, DEFEAT WHITE SOX, 4-1  </P> <P> Rather than get caught looking ahead, Tony La Russa took care of the matter at  hand.  </P> <P> La Russa brought in Dennis Eckersley to nail down the Oakland Athletics' 4-1  victory over the Chicago White Sox Thursday knowing it means he probably won't  be able to call on his relief ace tonight.  </P> <P> The A's open a three-game series against the Angels tonight in Anaheim with the  American League West lead on the line.  </P> <P> "I just pitched him twice in less than 24 hours and he was not as sharp as I  would have liked," La Russa said. "His stats speak for themselves.  </P> <P> "He did a good job today without good stuff. He is the best in baseball."  </P> <P> Eckersley allowed no runs and two hits in 1 2/3 innings, reducing his  earned-run average to 1.07 while picking up his 23rd save in 25 opportunities.  </P> <P> In 33 2/3 innings this season, Eckersley has allowed only four runs -- three on  home runs -- and 18 hits, walked two and struck out 38.  </P> <P> "The great thing about Tony is that he uses me perfectly," Eckersley said. "He  always knows when to bring me into a game. It's not his intention to burn me  out.  </P> <P> "If Tony brings me in every day, I'm not going to be able to handle it. I don't  have that kind of arm, but every other day is perfect for me."  </P> <P> Eckersley got his ninth save in 10 chances after Storm Davis (12-5) pitched six  shutout innings, allowing six hits, walking two and striking out one to win for  the ninth time in his last 13 starts.  </P> <P> Gene Nelson pitched 1 1/3 innings before La Russa went to Eckersley.  </P> <P> "Storm has done a great job and it was not a case of him getting tired,"  LaRussa said. "With my bullpen so deep, I'm not afraid to rest my starters."  </P> <P> Nelson was lifted after allowing a one-out double to Carlton Fisk in the  eighth. Steve Lyons singled off Eckersley, sending Fisk to third, and Carlos  Martinez's fielder's choice grounder scored Fisk to make it 2-1.  </P> <P> Pinch-hitter Darryl Boston also singled before Eckersley struck out Ron  Karkovice to end the inning and retired the side in order in the ninth.  </P> <P> Rickey Henderson gave the Athletics two more runs with a single in the ninth  off Donn Pall after a two-out walk to Felix Jose and a double by Mike Gallego.  </P> <P> Steve Rosenberg (3-8) allowed only two hits in seven innings, but both came in  the fourth, when the Athletics scored their first two runs on Tony Phillips'  sacrifice fly and a run-scoring single by Gallego.  </P> <P> Rosenberg was upset with himself for walking Mark McGwire to start the inning.  </P> <P> "It led to the two runs," he said of the four-pitch walk, "and while I gave up  only two hits, you can't throw four straight wide ones like I did to start an  inning."  </P> <P> Rosenberg walked five and struck out one.  </P> <P> Chicago had 10 hits to five for the Athletics, but White Sox Manager Jeff  Torborg was upset at his team's failure to convert its opportunities.  </P> <P> "We just screwed up and it cost us," Torborg said. "But our starting pitching  has been great the last month and Rosenberg gave us seven quality innings."  </P> <P> Milwaukee 10, Cleveland 3 -- Joey Meyer drove in five runs and Robin Yount had  four hits as the Brewers trounced the Indians at Cleveland.  </P> <P> The defeat prevented the Indians from moving to the .500 mark and closing to  within two games of Baltimore in the AL East.  </P> <P> Ted Higuera (8-4) won his fifth straight start, giving up two runs on 10 hits  in 5 2/3 innings before leaving because of a sore left ankle.  </P></p>

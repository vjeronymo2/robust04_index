			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Bankers hold emergency talks on Argentine debt ENTINA'S leading creditor banks are holding emergency meetings in an attempt to complete restructuring of the country's Dollars 23bn (Pounds 12.9bn) commercial bank debt, writes Robert Peston in Washington. Senior bank executives are in Washington for the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund. Citibank, which chairs the advisory committee of Argentina's banks, has called many of them together in midnight meetings at its Washington office in the hope of ending the impasse which has prevented completion of the debt restructuring. However, a banker present at the first meeting, which finished at 2am yesterday, said progress was 'painfully slow'. In spring the banks had agreed that Argentina's debt would be converted into two types of bond  - discount and par. The deal could not be completed as the banks wanted to convert too much of their debt  - 80 per cent of it  - into the par bonds. Mr Domingo Cavallo, Argentine economy minister, is making it clear to banks this week that, because of expense, they must take more of the discount bonds; the government has to provide more collateral for the par bonds than for the discount bonds.</p>

			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAME EXIT POLL USED BY ALL TV NETWORKS  </P> <P> Something was different about those instant network projections of who won and  who lost Tuesday's elections.  </P> <P> To save money, NBC, ABC, CBS and CNN for the first time pooled their resources  for a single exit poll. In exit polls, the basis for network projections,  voters in selected precincts are interviewed as they leave the polling place  and are asked how they voted and why.  </P> <P> This year, the networks used a commercial polling operation, VRS or Voter  Research and Surveys, run by former CBS polling director Warren Mitofsky. VRS  conducted about 60,000 separate interviews in 49 states, including nearly  10,000 for a separate poll designed to measure what Americans felt about such  issues as the Persian Gulf and abortion, aside from specific campaigns.  </P> <P> In addition to the networks, nearly 60 local TV, newspaper and radio news  organizations bought local results from the poll, making VRS an influential  source of political data.  </P> <P> "The difference this year is that all the competition is going to be done on  interpretation and presentation. All the data is the same," VRS spokeswoman  Susan Morrison said.  </P> <P> Although that might still leave room for competition as to when a network was  willing to project a winner, some network executives said that, with only one  poll, they intended to be more cautious about the results.  </P> <P> "Certainly, I wish there were others out there doing this poll," said one  network polling executive privately. As a result, this pollster said, "we want  to be careful with what we have" when it comes to making projections.  </P> <P> Polling professionals warned that using a single source could increase the  possibility of mistakes. In the past, network pollsters would informally  compare data throughout the evening, which was a check on errors.  </P> <P> In the end, however, it came down to economics. Amid declining network ratings,  the change will save each network "multimillions," said Mary Klette, who  directs polling for NBC News. In 1986, the previous midterm election, for  instance, NBC alone had to conduct 36,440 interviews for its own exit poll.  </P></p>

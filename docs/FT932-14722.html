			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Finnish foreign minister named Farmers' leader Mr Heikki Haavisto will replace Mr Paavo Vayrynen as Finnish foreign minister, a senior government official said yesterday, Reuter reports from Helsinki. Mr Haavisto is known to be a critic of proposed Finnish membership of the European Community although he is showing signs of softening his anti-EC stance. Finland applied to the EC in March last year and the government aims for membership in 1995 after a referendum. But public support for joining the Community has declined. Mr Vayrynen said this week he would leave the four-party coalition government led by his agrarian-based Centre party to concentrate on campaigning for the presidential election in January next year.</p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Harbor Police expect assault charges to be filed this week against a  27-year-old man who allegedly fired a spear gun at two officers when they  confronted him as he fished in San Diego Bay near Seaport Village.  </P> <P> Harbor Police Chief Arthur G. LeBlanc said Tuesday that Brian James Ray of San  Diego was snorkeling and fishing in the water about 2:15 p.m. Monday. Such  diving is illegal, LeBlanc said.  </P> <P> "You're not allowed to swim there, or do any fishing, plus . . . you're not  allowed to be diving in the bay without a permit," he said, citing heavy boat  traffic and unsafe water conditions.  </P> <P> Harbor Police Officers Gary Leeson and James Bird were patrolling the area in a  boat when they spotted Ray and ordered him out of the water. Ray responded by  shooting a spear at the officers' boat, then swam ashore, LeBlanc said.  </P> <P> Ray reached shore and had reloaded his spear gun by the time the Harbor Police  officers docked their boat and stepped ashore, LeBlanc said. Leeson raised his  own gun, ordered Ray to drop his weapon, and arrested him on suspicion of  assault with a deadly weapon.  </P> <P> LeBlanc said Ray faces other charges including fishing without a license.  </P> <P> Ray was being held at County Jail in lieu of $6,060 bail.  </P></p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Revco refinancing scheme aimed at cutting interest bill REVCO, the large US drugstore operator which emerged from a four-year stint in bankruptcy last June, yesterday unveiled a major refinancing plan, aimed at cutting the company's interest bill and improving its balance sheet. Under the refinancing scheme, Revco would raise around Dollars 110m from the sale of new ordinary shares, by way of rights to existing shareholders, plus a further Dollars 125m from the sale of new senior notes. It also proposes to implement new credit facilities - comprising a Dollars 150m secured term loan facility and execute a Dollars 150m secured revolving credit facility, co-agented by Banque Paribas, Continental Bank and GE Capital Corporate Finance Group. The drugstore chain would then repay in full its three existing classes of debt securities, at a cost of Dollars 433.2m, and replace the existing working capital agreement. The company said that board approval for the rights issue part of the package was predicated on the subscription price ranging between Dollars 7 and Dollars 8. Yesterday, Revco's market price eased by Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 8 3/8 . Revco operates around 1,149 outlets in nine eastern states and has some 16,000 employees. In late-September it reported a small Dollars 1.54m loss after tax in the first quarter to August 22, since it emerged from bankruptcy. At the operating level, the company was marginally profitable.</p>

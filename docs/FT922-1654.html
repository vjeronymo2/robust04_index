			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Abbey hit by broker revision HIGH street clearer Abbey National failed to benefit from a bounce in the banking sector, retreating on high turnover after one agency broker weighed in with a heavy forecast cut. Following a discussion with the bank, James Capel is now widely believed to be expecting profits to be no more than Pounds 580m, for the current year, down from its previous forecast of Pounds 635m, and well below Abbey's 1991 profit of Pounds 618m. Capel cut the following year's forecast by Pounds 40m to Pounds 710m. There were suggestions that at least one other securities house will soon follow suit - possibly going as low as Pounds 560m - in order to take account of losses on mortgage repossessions, and higher provisions in the company's European subsidiaries. The shares were 6 higher early in the session but when the news of the forecast cut leaked into the market they fell back to end 7 off at 269p, the day's low as volume rose to 8.5m shares, unusually high for Abbey. Pilkington active Hefty turnover in Pilkington helped the shares gain 6 1/2 to 137p and added further fuel to rumours surrounding the speculative intentions of fellow glassmaker, PPG Industries of the US. More than 12m shares were traded yesterday as talk in the market suggested PPG may have picked up 4m. There was further speculation that the stock was part of the old BTR stake, a large chunk of which failed to find a home last month. Pilkington was also very active in the traded options market where the equivalent of 4.2m shares were dealt. However, the talk failed to be substantiated and analysts were generally sceptical about the possibility of a bid. 'PPG would run into regulatory problems on both sides of the Atlantic,' said Mr Lawrence Ambold at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken. 'But this is a low point in Pilkington's share price and there have been a lot of people waiting in the wings ready to jump aboard - perhaps including PPG,' he added. Dark clouds overshadowed British Aerospace as a clutch of brokers took a negative view on the outlook for profits this year, sending the shares into retreat. The downward slide started after Strauss Turnbull decided that the company would make no profits this year, having previously forecast full-year profits of Pounds 170m, to allow for provisions on the company's regional aircraft division. The cut was made following an analysts trip and discussion with the BAe chairman at the Berlin Air show. Strauss remain buyers of the stock. UBS Philips &amp; Drew and SG Warburg were also reported to have turned sour. Dividend fears again dogged the shares which, at the day's worst, were down 19 at 258p. Bargain hunters helped them rally off the bottom to end 10 lighter at 267p on turnover of 4.3m. Enterprise Oil gained 11 to 414p on announcing a successful attempt to raise funds through a Dollars 150m (Pounds 81m) issue of fixed rate perpetual preference shares. Analysts regard the deal as good for Enterprise, because it means the company, with high borrowings and a full capital spending programme, can avoid going cap in hand to the banks. It was suggested that gearing will be around 80 per cent by the year-end. There was some question however whether the fund raising exercise was enough on its own to account for yesterday's share price rise. Traders suggested that a fairly illiquid market in the shares and the fact that there is no traded option facility added support. Lasmo continued to fall, losing 5 1/2 to 193 1/2 p, reflecting the company's high level of debts and Strauss Turnbull's recent forecast of a loss this year and next. County NatWest downgraded its profit forecast for the company and agreed with Strauss that the dividend is unlikely to be covered. ICI was subject to a series of downgrades, following Thursday's gloomy meeting with analysts, and the shares tumbled 18 to 1217p. Kleinwort Benson lopped Pounds 50m off its profit forecast for 1992 down to Pounds 850m, while Hoare Govett is looking for Pounds 830m, down Pounds 70m. Banks outperformed a rising market, recovering from recent falls which had left the sector oversold. Midland jumped 6 to 426p on unusually heavy turnover of 13m, benefiting from the improvement in the HSBC share price in Honk Kong. Barclays gained 11 to 345p while National Westminster improved 7 to 330p. Reuters was in in demand ahead of next week's launch of Globex, the company's new derivatives dealing system. The shares bounced 15 to 1109p. Ladbroke reversed its recent decline on the back of Thursday's buy notes from two brokers. The shares jumped 9 to 217p. Forte edged up 3 to 212p as it announced an Italian hotel coup and the continuation of its long-winded negotiations to sell its Gardner Merchant subsidiary. Granada was in demand, the shares climbing 14 1/2 to 267 1/2 p. However, Rank's dismal run continued as worries resurfaced over its Rank Xerox subsidiary, the shares shedding 6 to 673p. News that 49 per cent owned associate Rank Xerox's Crum and Forster insurance unit has agreed to fund a Dollars 128m (Pounds 69.1m) settlement in the US underpinned the worries. Mining group RTZ Corp fell 10 to 610p after Smith New Court trimmed its profit estimate for 1992 and 1993. The house cut its forecast of attributable profit for 1992 to Pounds 380m from Pounds 385m and to Pounds 479m from Pounds 498m for 1993. The shares also suffered from an overhang of stock. Ratners, which little more than a week ago announced the sale of its Watches of Switzerland subsidiary, continued to attract concern about its debt. In high turnover of 3.7m, the shares fell 2 1/2 to 10p, and have lost a third of their value since the start of the month. Suggestions that negative comments about Boots had been overdone, after the company's results earlier this month, particularly with regard to the costs of the Manoplax drug, lifted the shares 6 to 453p. Dixons also rallied after recent selling pressure, climbing 9 to 254p. Williams Holdings shed 4 to 319p on reports of a James Capel profits downgrading. Shares in Vosper Thornycroft continued to benefit from an institutional visit organised by broker Charterhouse Tilney earlier in the week. The shares ended 14 better at 345p. Hopes that the groundwork is in place for a gradual economic recovery supported food retailers. Among the big three supermarket chains, Argyll rose 8 to 358p, J. Sainsbury improved 6 to 468p, and Tesco put on 5 to 282p. Iceland was also firm, rising 8 to 523p. Shoprite, with interim figures due next week, climbed 9 to 545p. Tate &amp; Lyle continued to suffer from adverse comments from analysts, declining 8 to 352p, while United Biscuits, the subject of a failed attempt to place a large block of shares on Thursday, slipped 4 to 358p. Unilever has been one of the best performers of the sector this week, and put on 5 to 940p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (19).

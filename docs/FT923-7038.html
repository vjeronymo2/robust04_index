			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Low subscriptions to Czechoslovak country fund INTERNATIONAL investors have subscribed Dollars 30.8m for the first closed-end Czechoslovak country fund, seven months after the fund was launched with the aim of raising Dollars 100m, writes Richard Waters. The delay and low level of subscription were caused by uncertainty over the country's future, said Robert Fleming, the manager of the fund. The fragmentation of Yugoslavia had left many potential investors concerned about the aftermath of a division of Czechoslovakia, it said. Investments will initially be made in the Czech republic, though Fleming does not rule out investments in Slovakia. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which has two seats on the board of the Czechoslovakia Investment Corporation, committed Dollars 10m of the capital.</p>

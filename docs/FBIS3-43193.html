			<p>The     cat has become a common symbolic subject of political  cartoons in China since Deng Xiaoping said "It doesn't matter  whether the cat is black or white as long as it catches the mouse."  This sentence is often interpreted by reformers as Deng's defense of  a pragmatic, non-ideological approach to economic reform.     The cartoons presented in this Foreign Media Note reveal that  during 1993 the symbolic message behind the cat has gone from  positive to negative. The cat has been portrayed as a successful  mouse catcher and money maker to a corrupt official who takes bribes  from the mouse in exchange for power, as a cat that is at the  disposal of the mouse who is now the successful businessman, as an  official who awards the mouse with a certificate of good citizenship  in exchange for a bribe, and finally as a street book vendor,  selling books for mice entitled "How To Escape the Pursuit of Cats."      Cartoon number one was inserted here on hard copy      "The Year of the Cat" (Beijing, Zhongguo Qingnian Bao 2 Feb 93  p5)  In this cartoon the cat's eyes are represented by traditional  Chinese coins and the cat is holding a mouse with coins around its  tail, all of which encourages the positive pursuit of monetary  rewards.      Cartoon number two was inserted here on hard copy      "Why Isn't the Mouse Afraid of the Cat"? (Beijing, Guangming  Ribao 10 Dec 93 p 2) In this cartoon the cat is dressed in a black  cadre hat and black overalls that say "corrupt." The fish in the  cat's hand is his reward, which says: "personal gain through power."  The bag on the mouse's back says "bribes."      Cartoon number three was inserted here on hard copy      "Now That the Mouse Has Money" (Tianjin, Tianjin Ribao 18 Jul 93  p 9)  In this cartoon, the mouse, with a western business suit  symbolyzing success and money, has enslaved the cat.      Cartoon number four was inserted here on hard copy      No title  (Jinan, Shandong Huabao Oct 93 p 60)  In this cartoon  the cat is wearing a cadre uniform and is presenting a certificate  of good citizenship to the mouse.  The fish under the cat's tail  reads: bribe.      Cartoon number five was inserted here on hard copy      "News From Book Stalls"  (Kunming, Yunnan Ribao 16 Oct 93 p 5)  In this cartoon the cat is hawking books entitled "How To Escape the  Pursuit of Cats."

			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Relief of Maglaj bolsters Moscow's role: UN convoy reaches 20,000 people trapped in Moslem-held enclave since autumn Moscow's importance in the Yugoslav peace process was boosted yesterday when Bosnian Serb forces allowed a United Nations aid convoy access to the besieged Moslem-held enclave of Maglaj, in north-central Bosnia. A UN official said the Serbs had abandoned their checkpoints on the road to the town as the convoy, carrying 80 tons of food, reached Maglaj. In a letter sent to Mr Sergio de Mello, UN civil affairs officer, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Mr Radovan Karadzic, said he hoped that the 'ordered ceasefire will succeed' in Maglaj. His remarks followed last week's warning by Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's special envoy to the former Yugoslavia, that Bosnian Serbs had to take a more 'constructive approach' in the peace process led by Washington and Moscow. About 20,000 people had been trapped in Maglaj by joint Serb and Croat offensives since last autumn. Despite this, the Bosnian government/Moslem forces had held on to the city, a strategic point in any eventual linkage of this part of the republic with other territory held by Bosnian-government troops. Access by the UN convoy to Maglaj also follows on from Russia's broader attempts to persuade President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to decide when, and how, he is prepared to sue for peace, which would lead to an overall regional settlement. As part of this process, Mr Churkin is expected to hold talks tomorrow with Croatian officials and Serb leaders from the self-styled republic of Krajina, in south-western Croatia. In the talks in the Russian embassy in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, Mr Churkin wants to persuade Croatian leaders to grant wide autonomy to Serbs in Croatia. In return, Serbia might be persuaded to sign a peace treaty with Croatia. That treaty would involve Serbia giving up claims to Krajina in return for Zagreb gaining complete control over the south-western and central part of Croatia. UN officials said at the weekend that any process towards attaining a peace treaty between Croatia and Serbia would involve the US and Germany applying pressure on Croatia to make substantial political concessions, and perhaps some territorial ones. But they added that the federal treaty between Bosnian Croat and Bosnian Moslem forces was holding. Several hundred prisoners of war and detainees were exchanged at the weekend following the signing of the treaty in Washington last Friday. Meanwhile, in Sarajevo Mr Karadzic pledged to respect the ceasefire around the Bosnian capital. The ceasefire has held since February 10 following Nato's ultimatum to deploy air strikes against Serb-held positions overlooking the city. Yesterday at least 8,000 people attended a football match between a Sarajevo club and a UN team. General Sir Michael Rose, the British commander of UN troops in Bosnia, told reporters that the match showed that normalisation was 'an irreversible process'.</p>

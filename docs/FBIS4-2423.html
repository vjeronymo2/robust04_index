			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] On 8 April, President Li Teng-hui harshly condemned  the Chinese communist authorities' utter disregard for human  life as shown in the fire aboard a cruise-boat on Chientao  [Qiandao] Lake. President Li said: The Chinese communist  authorities are killing our countrymen and behaving like  bandits. Can such a government [zheng fu] be called a  government?    President Li said the Chinese people should have renounced  such a regime [zheng quan] a long time ago.    President Li stated: [begin Li recording] A large group of  evil forces, (?with the support of) a party, have behaved like  bandits. Look, they have killed many of our countrymen! Right?  How can such a government be called a government? The people  should have renounced it a long time ago! [end Li recording]    President Li made this comment at a meeting with 336  township, town, and city mayors--a meeting sponsored by the  Taiwan Provincial Government in Chung Hsing New Village.    President Li stressed that while the Republic of China now  enjoys the most democratic period and greatest freedom in its  history, people in government offices should still understand  that power comes from the people, and thus the government must  properly accomplish all assignments entrusted by the people.  People in high office should by no means think they have  absolute power.</p>

			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / International Company News: Henkel hit by rationalisation The costs of implementing rationalisation measures helped depress Henkel's pre-tax profits by 7 per cent to DM375m (Dollars 218m) last year, the German chemicals, cosmetics and cleaning products group said. The rationalisation stood to benefit the group this year, however. It was likely that the group would develop in a positive way this year despite difficult economic conditions in many important markets, Henkel said. Stripping out the costs associated with the reduction of employee numbers from 42,244 to 40,480 last year, operating profits rose in 1994, the group said, without giving details. Turnover for the group dropped by 2 per cent to DM13.9bn but Henkel explained that without the impact of currency fluctuations - which led to a 3 per cent drop in sales - turnover would have risen. Turnover in Germany dropped by 3 per cent to DM4.16bn while sales generated abroad dropped by 1.7 per cent to DM8.95bn. This was mainly due to a sharp fall in turnover in continental Europe. Outside Europe, sales increased 13 per cent. The group's two biggest businesses are chemicals and cleaning products, which account for 27.4 and 31.3 per cent of group sales respectively. Henkel said it was pleased with a 4 per cent increase in sales in this market segment, reflecting recovery in the US. There was a 4 per cent fall in cleaning products sales, chiefly due to currency fluctuations.</p>

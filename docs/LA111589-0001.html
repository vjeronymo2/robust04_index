			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SALVADOR CIVILIANS FLEE AS REBEL POSITIONS ARE STRAFED  </P> <P> Thousands of civilians waving white flags fled their embattled neighborhoods  Tuesday as the armed forces declared an around-the-clock curfew in one-third of  metropolitan San Salvador and stepped up aerial strafing of guerrilla  positions.  </P> <P> Panic erupted in several neighborhoods as word spread that the army was  preparing to move against the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front rebels  who had staked out positions in public housing complexes.  </P> <P> The army fired rockets at hills on the northern edge of the capital on the  fourth day of the rebels' biggest urban offensive in 10 years of war. The  fighting showed no sign of abating.  </P> <P> Civilian and military casualties continued to rise. Hospitals and forensic  officials reported at least 180 dead and 680 wounded. The army and guerrillas  put the toll higher.  </P> <P> In a communique read over their clandestine Radio Venceremos, rebel commanders  vowed to push the offensive "to its ultimate consequences."  </P> <P> Having enforced a nationwide traffic ban for two days, the rebels called a  general strike and threatened any businesses that oblige their employees to  work. They also urged supporters to form "popular governments" in territory  that they claim to control in eight of the country's 14 provinces.  </P> <P> Since Sunday, the country has been under a state of siege that suspends  constitutional guarantees and gives the government control over all licensed  news broadcasts. A nationwide dusk-to-dawn curfew is in force.  </P> <P> The armed forces expanded the curfew Tuesday in seven densely populated  neighborhoods on the northern and eastern edges of the capital -- Ilopango,  Soyapango, Santa Lucia, Mejicanos, Zacamil, Ayutuxtepeque and Ciudad Delgado.  </P> <P> Residents were ordered to stay off the streets at all hours, a measure that  effectively made those poor and working-class areas free-fire zones. The area  is home to about half of San Salvador's 2.5 million people.  </P> <P> The army's action, coupled with reports of aerial strafing, drew cries of alarm  from international human rights organizations. Americas Watch, a New York-based  group, urged U.S. Ambassador William Walker to support its call that the army  refrain from "indiscriminate attacks" that threaten civilian life. It urged the  guerrillas to take similar precautions.  </P> <P> Army and government officials charged that the rebels are using civilians as  shields and said the military is taking precautions to avoid civilian  casualties. Army spokesman Col. Raul Arturo Lopez said the curfew "allows us to  carry out our actions with as little risk as possible" to civilians.  </P> <P> The expanded curfew was announced early Tuesday. Men and women, many of whom  have gone for days without food, ran out of their neighborhoods carrying  babies, dogs and paper bags with a few meager belongings.  </P> <P> "They told us to get out," cried 15-year-old Cristina Hernandez in the northern  neighborhood of Zacamil. "The army is coming."  </P> <P> "We don't have any food," shouted an elderly woman carrying her parakeet.  </P> <P> Outside Soyapango, men caught away from home stood helplessly on the roadside  watching a C-47 gunship pour fire on communities where their families were  stranded. In the distance, a spotter plane fired rockets at suspected rebel  positions on the slope of San Jacinto volcano, just beyond a populated area.  </P> <P> "I haven't had any information about my family in four days," said Carlos  Lareynaga, 45, a resident of Norwalk, Calif., who was traveling from San  Salvador to Soyapango. "I have four children, my wife and a grandson there. I  came to see my children for the first time since I left five years ago. . . . I  never imagined the situation would be so delicate."  </P> <P> President Alfredo Cristiani, in his first news conference since the offensive  began, denied that the rebels hold any territory and said their assault has not  threatened his right-wing government. But a Western diplomat said the  guerrillas have the military initiative.  </P> <P> "The guerrillas are clearly on the offensive," he said. "The army's been held  at bay for 60 hours. . . . The curfew means they (the army) don't have  control."  </P> <P> To dramatize their presence and explain their offensive, four rebel commanders  held an hourlong press conference in an apartment building in Zacamil.  </P> <P> "We've had a series of victories in the countryside, but this is history," said  a rebel who goes by the name of Amilcar. "We're in the city because it's the  heart of the enemy. This is the economic, political and military heart."  </P> <P> The rebel commanders said they had many combatants fighting for the first time  in this offensive. They claimed they have enough firepower and stamina to  continue indefinitely.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DROP IN STROKE, HEART DEATHS REPORTED  </P> <P> The death rates from coronary heart disease and stroke in the United States  fell 27.9% and 40.2% respectively between 1976 and 1986, according to new  American Heart Assn. statistics that officials say illustrate continuing  progress against the country's No. 1 killer.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, cardiovascular disease claimed about 978,500 lives in 1986,  according to the annual report released Monday. That is about one life every 32  seconds and more than twice the 466,000 lives claimed by cancer, the  second-leading cause of death, the association stated.  </P> <P> The report also said that about 66 million of the estimated 241 million  Americans alive in 1986 had at least one form of cardiovascular disease. Many  deaths from those conditions, which include heart attack and stroke, are  considered preventable through changes in life style and diet.  </P> <P> Among the findings in the report:  </P> <P> * The rate of total cardiovascular disease among Americans dropped nearly 20%  between 1976 and 1986. As with coronary heart disease and stroke, the decline  is traceable to new forms of therapy and medication as well as changes in  eating and living habits.  </P> <P> * About 1.5 million Americans will suffer a heart attack in 1989. More than  500,000 of them will die, most before they reach a hospital. Studies suggest  that 50% of heart attack victims wait more than two hours before going to an  emergency room.  </P> <P> * Among adults, 38% of black men and 39% of black women have high blood  pressure -- compared to 33% of white men and 25% of white women. Elevated blood  pressure, indicating that the heart is working harder, may contribute to heart  attacks, strokes and atherosclerosis, also known as hardening of the arteries.  </P> <P> * The heart association estimates that the cost of cardiovascular diseases in  1989 will be $88.2 billion. That figure includes $56.3 billion in hospital and  nursing home care, $15 billion in lost productivity, $12.5 billion in physician  and nursing services and $4.4 billion in medication.  </P></p>

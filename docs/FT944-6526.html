			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Rooney denies Spring Ram stake sale Mr Bill Rooney, the former chairman of Spring Ram, yesterday denied reports that he was looking for a buyer for his 13.5 per cent stake in the kitchen, bathroom and furniture group. Mr Rooney, who unveiled a Pounds 6.6m deal last week to take control of Atreus, the bathroom goods supplier, said he had no plans to sell the Spring Ram stake. However he acknowledged that he would sell, if offered the right price. He said he had received several inquiries, 'but no serious approaches', following newspaper reports that he was seeking a buyer for his shares. At current prices, his stake in Spring Ram is worth about Pounds 26m. The shares were unchanged yesterday at 43p. Mr Rooney was forced off the Spring Ram board by institutional investors 14 months ago following revelations of false accounting at its Balterley Bathrooms subsidiary and three profit warnings in eight months. Before this, the group had enjoyed 13 years of rapid growth. Spring Ram announced on Friday that it was continuing its recent expansion with the Pounds 4.6m cash acquisition of Pland, a maker of stainless steel sinks. For the year to September 30 Pland reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 676,000 (Pounds 570,000) on turnover of Pounds 10.8m (Pounds 10.5m). Net assets at the end of the period were Pounds 4.7m. Mr Roger Regan, who took over as Spring Ram chairman last year, said: 'The acquisition is further evidence of Spring Ram taking opportunities to make strategic bolt-on acquisitions. In June, Spring Ram acquired a furniture company and in August announced a Pounds 5m investment to start a cabinets business. For the six months to July 2 it reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 34.4m) after an exceptional charge of Pounds 2.5m for the closure of its Artisan Tile factory.</p>

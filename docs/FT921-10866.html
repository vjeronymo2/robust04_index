			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Latest figures indicate fall in German industrial production GERMANY'S economic slowdown was underlined yesterday by the latest industrial production figures, showing a 3 per cent drop between November and December last year, writes Quentin Peel in Bonn. The sharpest falls were in construction and manufacturing, although there was growth in consumer goods and food production, according to the seasonally adjusted figures. A comparison of both November and December with the two previous months suggests a less drastic slowdown of about 1 per cent, while the year-on-year figures for the same two months put the slowdown overall at just 0.3 per cent. Leslie Colitt adds: East German unemployment rose to nearly 17 per cent last month, from 11.8 per cent in December, according to the Federal Employment Office. The increase - equivalent to more than 250,000 unemployed - partly resulted from the ending last month of short-time work for many employees. But the basis for calculating unemployment also changed; previously, 8.8m people were considered capable of gainful employment but this was lowered to 7.9m.</p>

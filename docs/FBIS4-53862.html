			<p>BFN     [Text] Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]--whose members have  begun to criticize party Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa because  of the Social Democratic Party of Japan's [SDPJ] secession from  the coalition after formation of the lower house parliamentary  group, Kaishin [Innovation]--held a standing executive council  meeting on 10 May. At the meeting, the council tried several  times, including a decision to reshuffle its members, to  tranquilize the criticism. The meeting, which was held in the  morning of 10 May, decided to assign former Home Affairs  Minister Akira Fukida and lower house Dietman Ichiji Ishii as  standing executive council members to replace Moriyoshi Sato,  director general of the Hokkaido and Okinawa Development Agency,  and Shigeto Nagano, former justice minister, who resigned from  the justice minister's post over his remarks that the "Nanjing  massacre was a made-up story."    Both Fukida and Ishii joined Shinseito after it was formed.  It is pointed out that some Shinseito members were "becoming  `anti-Ozawa'" because, in addition to the fact that the  coalition became a minority government as a result of the SDPJ's  secession, they were not informed of a plan to form Kaishin.  Some of the party members are even worried that the situation  "may develop into a repeat of the situation Keiseikai (the  Takeshita faction) of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] was in  when it split" into two groups after a fierce strife within the  faction.    The decision to assign Fukida and Ishii as standing  executive  council members was also designed to pacify the dissatisfied  party members" (according to a close associate of Ozawa), and,  at the same time, to "make the party's decisionmaking process  more open" (according to a senior Shinseito official).    Moreover, other party members who seceded from the LDP to  form Shinseito, were also complaining about Ozawa. At the  party's 27 April general meeting the SDPJ immediately split from  the coalition, the party's backbone figure and young members  roundly criticized Ozawa, saying that "it is important for us to  say whatever we want to say and be understood and the secretary  general is not an exception" (according to Norio Sugiyama,  former director of the lower house Budget Committee). On 6 May,  Koichiro Aino, former Economic Planning Agency director general,  said: "It [decision to form Kaishin] was a very careless  blunder unbecoming of Ozawa. The party needs to establish an  official decisionmaking organ."    At the executive council meeting, Ozawa said: "We are in  this situation because of the (the SDPJ's) unexpected secession  from the coalition. It is a time for us, who play central roles  in the government, to strengthen our unity." However, it seems  that this remark is aimed at tightening the unity [taga] that  loosened following the confusion over Kaishin's formation.    On 9 May, Aino met with Ozawa and apologized for the  criticism aimed at the executive department, saying: "I am  afraid we put you in a lot of trouble." It seems that the  situation within the party has calmed down for the time being.  At the 10 May news conference, Ozawa said that "no blunders  were made in the past." Nevertheless, some party members are  saying that "we now can say whatever we want to say, thanks to  Ozawa's careless mistake" (according to a senior party official).</p>

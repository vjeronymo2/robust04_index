			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Electricity shares jump despite crackdown on profits Shares in the regional electricity companies of England and Wales rose sharply yesterday as investors welcomed a regulatory review which consumer organisations and opposition parties dismissed as inadequate. Prof Stephen Littlechild, director-general of the Office of Electricity Regulation, said he was cracking down on the companies. He said the price controls would save families, on average, a total of Pounds 70-Pounds 90 over the next five years. His prices formula, through which allowed prices in power distribution businesses will fall next April by 11-17 per cent, were accepted immediately by three of the 12 regional electricity companies to which they apply. Although the other nine could still appeal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, they are expected to follow the lead of Yorkshire Electricity, East Midlands Electricity and Seeboard inaccepting the regulator's decision. After next year's price cuts, electricity companies will be required to restrict annual distribution price rises, which make up more than a quarter of final bills, to 2 percentage points below inflation. The stock market was pleased by the review. Share prices in the companies rose by up to 10 per cent with London Electricity, up 61p to 645p, leading the way. Southern Electric, up 51p to 714p, was also among the day's strong gainers. Eastern Electricity rose 30p to 739p, a new high. The National Consumers' Council, however, said the cuts did not go far enough and failed to redress the balance between companies and consumers after recent excessive profits. Environmental groups were angered by the absence of stronger measures to encourage energy efficiency. Although Prof Littlechild gave companies new incentives to save electricity, he decided not to provide new funding for the Energy Savings Trust, the government-sponsored agency which is supposed to promote energy efficiency projects. The lower prices will also blunt the effect of the recent introduction of value added tax on electricity bills which is supposed to cut consumption. Greenpeace, the environmental group, said last night that the result would be higher atmospheric emissions and a greater danger of climate change. Prof Littlechild said the package would produce savings to consumers totalling Pounds 2.5bn over five years. Average household bills would be Pounds 12-Pounds 16 a year lower because of the controls. He said present prices in the regional companies' distribution businesses were too high, but added: 'If companies are going to make significant profits they're going to have to work much harder than at present.'

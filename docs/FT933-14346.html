			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Community prepares for enlargement EUROPEAN Community foreign ministers will discuss a proposal to create a committee of 'wise men' to examine streamlining EC institutions in order to deal with enlargement, the Belgian Presidency of the EC announced yesterday. The proposal could serve as the platform for a new constitutional debate on the future of the EC, raising sensitive questions such as the balance of power between large and small states and a reorganisation of the European Commission and rotating EC presidency. The idea of opening up a 'post-Maastricht' debate has been circulating for several months in the European parliament and among European think-tanks. Proponents suggest a high-powered independent committee could be modelled on the 'Dooge committee' which paved the way for the 1986 Single European Act creating an integrated market by 1992. Mr Willy Claes, Belgium's foreign minister, made clear that the Belgian presidency was not endorsing the idea which was put forward in the parliament yesterday by Mr Willy De Clerq, a Belgian MEP and former EC Commissioner. But he agreed to submit it for ministerial discussion. Under the Danish and UK presidencies, ministers agreed that minimal change only was required to cope with the four new applicants, Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway. Last year, a European Commission paper suggesting that smaller states may lose out in a future reorganisation of the Commission created a furore. The mere hint that not every state might run its own EC presidency or send its own commissioner to Brussels may have helped to trigger the narrow Danish rejection of the Maastricht treaty. Mr Claes declined to answer how broad a mandate might be given to a putative committee of wise men. But some institutional questions would have to be examined before a final decision on the admission of the four applicant countries, notably their allocation of MEPs and the number of votes in the Council of Ministers. A UK official said the government was 'relaxed' about an institutional discussion before the 1996 intergovernmental conference to review the Maastricht treaty, providing it took a narrow definition of the need for change. Mr Claes told MEPs that the Belgian presidency was determined to restore the authority of the European Commission and improve relations with the European Parliament. He added: 'The treaty of Maastricht is (thereby) not an endpoint but rather a point of departure for further deepening and democratisation.'</p>

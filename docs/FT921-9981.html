			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Soccer: Why Taylor can't please everyone ON MONDAY at 1pm, England soccer manager Graham Taylor will put his head in the lion's mouth again. He will announce his squad for the international against France and brace himself for a roar of public disapproval. England is a nation of would-be managers and every fan thinks he could name a better team. This is part of the ritual that accompanies each of England's mid-week internationals during the season. It starts tomorrow when the Sunday papers offer Taylor some tips for his team, and ends two weeks later when the same papers take him to task for not following, or following, their advice. In Taylor's 19 months as manager England have lost only once, but the fans are growing restive. His considerable PR skill has been stretched to the limit as he confronts the dilemma that faces the national team managers in every leading soccer country. On the one hand, England expects its men to qualify for both the European Nations Cup and the World Cup. Anything less could cost Taylor his job. On the other, it is not whether you win or lose but by how much you win. Taylor has picked industrious, effective teams which have been criticised by fans and journalists who yearn for a side with flair and are reluctant to accept that English football is short of creative players. It is not a uniquely-English problem. Carlos Bilardo, who as a player and a manager epitomised the pragmatic side of Argentinian soccer, steered a mediocre squad to the last World Cup final where they lost to a dubious penalty. That was not enough when set against the example of Argentina's exuberant triumph at home in 1978. President Carlos Menem criticised Bilardo's defensive approach and he was replaced after the cup. Taylor is fortunate that England's only World Cup win, in 1966, came under Alf Ramsey, an uncompromising utilitarian. His midfield contained Nobby Stiles and Alan Ball, who employed their undoubted talent strictly in the traditional role of the combative British wing-half: tackling, running and making sensible passes. The manager's dilemma is particularly acute for Taylor because of his approach to the game. As the job of managers has become less and less secure, they try to exert more and more control over the events that determine whether they stay in work. Since they cannot kick the ball on Saturdays, what counts is what they do on the training field the rest of the week. In 19 years as a manager, Taylor has never been fired. He must be doing something right. His last team before England was Aston Villa, where chairman Doug Ellis has always been quick to pull the trigger on managers. Taylor says: 'I made it very clear from the word go that I was definitely going to be in total charge of the football side of things.' At Elton John's Watford, Taylor was one of the pioneers of the systematic, long-ball game. It took Watford from the fourth division to an FA Cup final and second place in the first division. At Villa, a slicker but equally industrious and well-drilled team went from the second division to League runners-up in three years. He knows better than to put his fate at the feet of creative players. 'Don't kid me football is about style.' he says, 'If that's what you want, okay, I'll produce an England side that plays lovely football. But it won't win us many games.' His problem is that fans want style. At Watford, for all his success, he was barracked and once carried a placard saying 'I'm sorry' on to the pitch - but stuck to his winning style. England fans remember and are suspicious. On a recent television 'phone-in, Taylor found himself defending (yet again) his decision to drop Tottenham's Paul Gascoigne, the archetypical unpredictable midfield genius, for an international in November 1990. The fans have also criticised Taylor for insisting that Gascoigne must have recovered 100 per cent from his crippling knee injury before being considered for the European finals in July. They suspect he is giving himself leeway to omit Gazza again. Taylor has learnt his lesson. Against Turkey last October, he brought back two favourites, Bryan Robson and Chris Waddle. Both played poorly in a poor England win. The public got the message: Robson was too old; Waddle, for all his talent, was too erratic - and Taylor had a valid reason for discarding them. The struggle to replace Robson and Gascoigne has highlighted the problems facing Taylor, Colin Bell, who played 48 times for England, said it took 20 games to find his international feet. Over the past 12 months, England have appeared in just 12 games - four of those on a trivial summer tour. In that time Taylor has played 12 midfielders. Six were included in his squad against Poland in November. Of these, David Platt had won 20 caps. David Batty and Geoff Thomas both made their debuts in 1991 and none of the other three had started an England game. Platt's goal-scoring touch apart, this group is short on flair. They are dependable in the Stiles' mould - and at least four of them will be in Monday's squad. But Taylor could not pick any other sort of player, even if he wanted to. World-class players are always a scarce commodity. England fans may pine for the time, just six years ago, when the World Cup squad contained Robson, Glenn Hoddle, Peter Reid and Ray Wilkins, but that team was short of top-class defenders. Injuries permitting, Taylor will be able to pick a back four of Des Walker, Mark Wright, Paul Parker and Stuart Pearce to play France on February 16, and again in Sweden in July. It is, for Taylor, a happy distribution of wealth. The talent available suits his approach. His team may not surprise opponents, but a tight defence and a smothering midfield means that he is not going to get any nasty shocks, either. His team's approach play is methodical rather than imaginative. But that is a price Taylor is prepared to pay. With Gary Lineker in attack, plenty of well-rehearsed free-kicks and corners plus a touch of luck - Taylor has always been lucky - some of the unprepossessing players in his squad on Monday could find themselves collecting European medals in six months.</p>

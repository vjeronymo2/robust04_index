			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Friendly society rule change - At a Glance Members of the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Assurance Society approved a rule change at the friendly society's annual general meeting on Wednesday, sanctioning a 12 per cent levy imposed on their policies to create a compensation fund. The decision followed a high court ruling last year that 39,000 policyholders who lost money because of unauthorised investment in property by the society must be compensated. Compensation is due to be paid in September or October, after which members will be consulted on the society's future.</p>

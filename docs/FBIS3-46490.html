			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [New Year message by Prime Minister Chuan Likphai; date and </F> place not given -- recorded]    [Text] Dear fraternal Thai people, on the auspicious  occasion of the approaching new year, 1994, on behalf of the  government I wish to invite you to convey greetings to their  majesties the king and queen and members of the royal family.  May the power of the three gems and all sacred things in the  universe protect them and provide them with prosperity,  happiness, and long life so that they will remain figures  beloved by the Thai people forever.    Fraternal Thai people, in 1993 the world situation has been  improving steadily. This is because most countries have paid  strong attention to the development of democracy and upholding  human rights. At the same time, the arms race has been replaced  by investment in economic benefits and improvement in the  quality of life. This has resulted not only in happiness for  the majority of the world's population, but has helped to  steadily improve the international economy. Although the  improvement of the international economy has not reached the  level expected, it obviously exceeded that of the previous year.    Regarding our country, although there were two major  tragedies in the middle of 1993 which resulted in many deaths,  the compassion and cooperation of the Thai people enabled the  tragedies to be less severe than they might have been. The  tragedies serve as valuable lessons for those concerned that  they must be aware of their responsibilities and duties. The  lesson is that if a problem is created, its effects will  eventually surface.    Fraternal Thai people, the general situation in 1993 was  relatively peaceful and there was some progress. Data from the  public and private sectors agree that the Thai economy was in a  recovery stage. Economic growth increased in comparison with  the previous year. This recovery demonstrates a degree of  success of the government's efforts to tackle the continued  recession, which resulted in reduced investment, as we all know.  The government measures, however, particularly investment  promotion measures and the development of Thailand into the  regional financial center, as well as proper management of the  capital market, have created confidence among local and foreign  investors. This has resulted in private sector investment  increasing 5.8 percent in 1993, compared with 0.9 percent in the  previous year.    A welcome point in this investment is that part of it  occurred in the regional areas, corresponding with the  government's prosperity distribution policy which the government  worked on earnestly throughout the year. The statistics show  clearly that after the announcement of the prosperity  distribution policy, about 1,200 investors applied for  investment promotion privileges, a three-fold increase over the  previous year. Total investment was about 300 billion baht and  generated nearly 300,000 jobs. Of this investment, 60 percent  was in Zone 3, which encompasses 60 regional provinces.    Another important measure in the prosperity distribution  policy is the care for the farmers, who make up the poorest  group of the population. Three examples of the government's  concrete action in this regard are:    First, the government carried out land reform, issuing land  use documents to farmers for 4.5 million rai of land. This is  more than the total land reform achieved in the previous 18  years.    Second, the government increased the budget allocation for  construction of small water sources from 3.3 billion baht in  1992 to 6.6 billion baht in 1993. This allocation will increase  to 9 billion baht in 1994.    Third, the farmers' production costs have been lowered by  cutting the loan interest rate to 5 percent on average for  farmers who joined the production structure readjustment  project. Low-priced fertilizer -- about 25 percent cheaper than  the market price -- was also supplied to farmers. Some 300,000  tons of this fertilizer were available in 1993, compared with  80,000 tons in 1992. Some 500,000 tons will be available in  1994.    Fraternal Thai people, many foreign and local institutions  in  the government and private sectors predict that Thai economic  growth will go even higher in 1994. I wish to say to you that  although such growth figures are a good sign, the government  will not be complacent and will try to spread this growth among  people in all sectors. It will adhere to the policy of  distributing prosperity to the regional and rural areas, as  mentioned in its policy statement to parliament. It will do its  best to make this increase in national revenue go to the people  in the regional and rural areas so that they will be able to  eventually help themselves.    Therefore, the central task of rural and agricultural  development in 1994 will be to adjust cultivation methods to  meet market demands. This will raise the incomes of the farmers  and reduce the risks associated with their occupation. The  government has allocated 13.5 billion baht for this purpose in  1994. Some 40 billion baht will be allocated through 1996 for  continued efforts in this regard. Farmers have called loudly  for implementation of this program. In addition, the government  will act to stabilize prices for major crops.    Regarding social and environment development, the  government will give assurances for the continued development of  human resources and the quality of life. It has allocated  nearly 100 billion baht for this purpose. Some 74 billion baht  have been earmarked for health care. Some 23.5 billion baht  will go for expansion of education opportunities. For  environmental conservation, restoration, and development, some  11 billion baht have been allocated. Violators of environmental  law and those who intentionally destroy environmental and  national resources will be prosecuted. I have emphasized often  that industrial decentralization must not amount to spreading  destruction among the people in the regional areas.    Regarding workers, the government established the Ministry  of  Labor and Social Welfare in late 1993 to oversee and protect the  benefits of workers, promote their welfare, and develop their  skills. In 1994 emphasis will be given to the protection of  child labor, woman labor, and Thai workers abroad, as well as  arranging an appropriate social security system, as evidenced by  the government's submission of the social security bill, the  compensation fund bill, and the job placement and workers  protection bill for the consideration of parliament.    Fraternal Thai people, 1994 will be a year of hope for  people  around the world. In particular, the recent successful  conclusion of the GATT negotiations can be regarded as a New  Year gift for the whole world. This is because the GATT accord  will enable trade to become more free, which will benefit every  country in general. Thailand is expected to gain some benefits,  but how much will depend on our ability to compete in the  international arena. On the government's side, it will adjust  the direction and mechanisms so that the country will be best  able to compete. As for the private sector, whose adjustment is  more rapid, I am confident that it has prepared to cope with the  new international situation.    Regarding the drought and water shortage which is the  concern  of everyone, I wish to emphasize that the government has  prepared many measures. These measures may not be effective  without the cooperation of the people. Therefore, to enable all  of us to overcome this crisis, I wish to appeal to you to pay  attention and cooperate with the measures which the government  will announce from time to time.    Regarding the drought, the government is grateful to the  suggestions for long-term solutions to the water shortage which  the king enunciated on his birthday anniversary, particularly  the urgent projects to build dams on the Pa Sak, Nakhon Nayok,  and Pak Phanang Rivers. I and the government will adopt these  suggestions and pledge to the people that they will accelerate  these projects.    Fraternal Thai people, on the anniversary of the 50th year  of  the king's enthronement in 1996, the government has planned  major celebrations, which the king has given the name:  Kanchanaphisek. The government has appointed a committee to plan  these honorable and customary celebrations. It will invite the  people to participate in the creation of a memorial or other  objects as gifts for the king. The government will make  announcements soon on this matter.    Fraternal Thai people, in 1993 the government spent  considerable time explaining and solving various problems  through the parliament and its mechanism. There were two  ordinary sessions and two extraordinary sessions in the same  year, which was unprecedented, considering that two annual  budgets have to be deliberated in the same year. The government  presented 48 bills for parliamentary consideration. Thanks to  the cooperation of parliament, 29 bills were promulgated into  law, which have contributed to the government's solution of the  country's problems and to its national development efforts.    In any event, the solution of national problems in  accordance  with the parliamentary democracy system may feel to some people  to be too time-consuming. I wish to explain that it is not  right to solve problems in a superficial and biased manner. The  ancillary issues within the entire system must be considered in  the search for long-term effective solutions. It is undesirable  to enact a short-term solution to a problem which will invite  negative repercussions in the future. The principle of  righteousness must be upheld, although to do so may run against  the prevailing current of thought. I am confident that if we  solve problems basing the solutions on rationality and technical  knowledge, we will be successful and see good results for the  country in the long term.    In any event, I agree that there are areas on which action  has been taken that has not achieved the level of progress  desired. This includes the solution of the traffic congestion in  Bangkok. More than 400 additional cars enter the streets daily.  For long-term results, there will have to be other solutions,  not just limiting the city's growth. I pledge to march forward  to effectively solve the outstanding problems and give the  assurances that the government will administer the country  honestly, keeping the interests and happiness of people in all  sectors in mind.    On this New Year, the cabinet and I invoke the power of the  three gems and sacred beings, as well as the might of their  majesties the king and queen, to provide each of you happiness  and prosperity in 1994 and forever after.    Goodbye.</p>

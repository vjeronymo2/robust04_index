			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / World Trade News: BMW points way with its first US assembly plant BMW of Germany yesterday began production at its first US assembly plant, a key step in the overseas expansion of the European car industry, writes Kevin Done, Motor Industry Correspondent. BMW becomes the only European car maker with a passenger vehicle assembly plant in the US, although it will be joined in 1996/97 by Mercedes-Benz, its big domestic rival, which is developing a plant in Alabama. Japanese car makers have been expanding rapidly in North America during the last decade, while the European presence has shrunk drastically. None of the European volume car makers has a production base in the US following the move by Volkswagen of Germany to close its plant at Westmoreland, Pennsylvania, in 1987 after nine years of production. BMW has invested Dollars 400m to develop its new plant at Spartanburg, South Carolina. It said yesterday that production would reach 300 cars a day by the end of 1996. Toward the end of the decade the capacity of the plant will be increased to 90,000 units a year. Initially BMW is producing its 3-Series car range at the US plant, but from the end of 1995 the Spartanburg facility will become BMW's only production source for a new range of two-seater sports cars, which will be sold both in North America and in other BMW markets worldwide. Mercedes-Benz is investing Dollars 300m to develop a plant near Tuscaloosa, Alabama, for the production of a new range of four-wheel drive sports/utility vehicles, which are to be launched in the world market in 1997. The plant will employ 1,500 people and will produce 60,000 vehicles a year. The European car production presence in the US will still be modest by comparison with the capacity developed by Japanese vehicle makers, which last year produced more than 2m cars and light trucks at 10 plants - wholly owned and joint ventures - in the US and Canada.</p>

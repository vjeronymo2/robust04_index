			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Rail white paper paves way for gradual sell-off: BR split in two under 'radical changes' A WHITE PAPER on the future of British Rail yesterday paved the way for a step-by-step privatisation starting as early as next summer. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said the proposals comprised the most radical changes to Britain's railways since nationalisation in 1948. However, the 21-page document set out only the basic framework of a process which seems likely to leave BR in charge of much of the passenger railway to the end of the decade and beyond. Mr MacGregor said it was impossible to predict when privatisation would be complete but confirmed that it would not be within the five-year lifetime of the present parliament. The white paper was due to have appeared in December but became bogged down in embarrassing ministerial differences about the best way to proceed. The result is a watered-down version of the proposals first put forward by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the previous transport secretary, and containing little detail about how the privatisation goals are to be achieved. The biggest immediate change is unlikely to be perceived by passengers. BR will be split into two, with one part owning the tracks, and the other running the trains. The government will then attempt to privatise the train services. However, only the freight services will be sold outright: the passenger services will be contracted out under franchise. The white paper gives few details about how or when the franchises will be offered. Mr MacGregor said that there would be 30 to 40 of them, and that franchising would be carried out 'flexibly and progressively.' Legislation paving the way for the changes will be introduced in November. If royal assent is obtained the following summer, the first freight services could be privatised almost immediately, but the first passenger services are unlikely to be franchised before spring 1994. The white paper also provides for the private sector to get involved in running stations. Some might be rented to franchisees, it says, and the government may also be prepared to consider other selling or leasing arrangements 'provided that the interests of operators and passengers using them are protected'. Would-be train operators reacted with interest to the proposals, although most will want to see how much BR proposes to charge for the use of its tracks before pursuing the idea. The white paper was also welcomed by Tory MPs, although some qualified their enthusiasm with reservations about the time the benefits would take to show. But Mr John Prescott, Labour's transport spokesman, predicted a contraction in rail services, saying the white paper was 'ripe for exploitation by property speculators, route operators bribed by public subsidies, and inevitably by the Tories' City friends'. Although the proposals are much less radical than BR had at one time feared, they were given a muted response by Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman. He said it was the government's job to determine policy, and BR's job to manage. 'We believe we have got something we can manage.' The TUC attacked the proposals, saying the white paper would 'shunt BR into the sidings of further decline and neglect'. The Confederation of British Industry welcomed the move but said it was important that improvements to the network were not abandoned.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Ayhan Halit Acarkan, speaker of the Turkish  Republic of Northern Cyprus who is on an official visit in  Ankara, and his accompanying delegation have been continuing  their contacts. The guest speaker visited the leaders of the  political parties at the parliament and exchanged views.    Acarkan first visited the Republican People's Party leader  Deniz Baykal. Later, he visited the Nationalist Action Party  leader Alpaslan Turkes and communicated to him that the Turkish  Cypriots supported continuing with the negotiations however, he  added, the confidence-building measures were in favor of the  Greek Cypriots. Turkes, in turn, said that the Cyprus issue is  costing the Turkish nation, but notwithstanding the Turkish  nation, nobody can give concessions on the Cyprus issue.    Subsequently, Acarkan and his delegation visited Democratic  Left Party leader Bulent Ecevit. Ecevit stated that it is  incomprehensible that those who are not intervening in the  cruelty in Bosnia-Herzegovina are intervening in the peace in  Cyprus.    Lastly, Acarkan and his delegation visited the Prosperity  Party leader Necmettin Erbakan. Erbakan stated they do not  recognize an issue such as Cyprus, that peace was established in  the island in 1974, and that the issue was resolved then.</p>

			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ASK DR. RUTH: AGING BODY ELICITS WIFE'S RIDICULE INSTEAD OF ROMANCE  </P> <P> Q. My wife makes fun of my sexual needs. We have been married 43 years, and I  still love to pleasure her but I am not up for intercourse -- no erections.  When I approach her, she says things like, "Hey, King Kong, lust rising in you  like a volcano again?"  </P> <P> Lately she has been doing comic striptease acts -- "to arouse me," she says.  She is really making fun of our bodies and of golden-years lovemaking. She  refuses to be tender or serious or romantic. It is a total turnoff. What can I  do?  </P> <P> A. You have to tell her that it makes you sad that she wants to cause you this  kind of pain. Tell her you are going to seek marital counseling, by yourself if  she won't come with you, because what she is doing is seriously troubling to  you.  </P> <P> And do go for that help. The marriage counselor may suggest a way for you to  reason with her. Or she may see that she is harming her marriage and you, and  agree to go to counseling with you. I think she is resentful or angry with you,  and you had better find out what it is that makes her act that way. If she  weren't resentful, why be so mean to a lifelong companion?  </P> <P> Q. Ten months ago I walked in on my boyfriend having an affair with himself and  wearing women's lingerie. I had known him for more than a year and never  suspected. He has been doing this since he was 6. And he has tried to make me  think he feels very guilty about it, but I don't think he even wants to stop  it. I think he is addicted to the feeling it gives him.  </P> <P> I have tried to understand and even went to the length of researching the  problem, but I could find no help. How can I get help in ending this problem,  or at least in understanding it? This is important, as I hope to marry him  someday.  </P> <P> A. I can't imagine what research you could have done, since you write as though  you had been told nothing about transvestism. Before marrying this man, you  definitely should talk to a psychologist specializing in this kind of behavior  -- in hopes of understanding it.  </P> <P> I don't think there is much point in trying to "end this problem." But if you  do love this man and want to marry him, you should know that you would be  joining a great many wives who know that their husbands do feel compelled to  dress like women at times. It is not an addiction. It is a powerful psychic  need, established a long time ago, even before he was 6.  </P> <P> Authorities agree that the majority of married transvestites are not  homosexual. In fact, they like women so much that they need to dress like them.  I can't make you understand that in so many words, which is why you must talk  to a counselor or psychotherapist. Not for him but for you, to help you  understand.  </P></p>

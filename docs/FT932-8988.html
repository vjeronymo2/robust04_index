			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Motoring: Top marks for the Alfa THE ALFA Romeo 164 has had its first serious revamp in nearly five years. As a result this big, front-wheel driven saloon's appeal to user-choosers of two- and three-litre cars has been strengthened. Some Alfa Romeo buyers always have put performance before everything else. They get a 164 Cloverleaf - wide-tyred, sprung firmly and fitted with aerodynamic body extensions. Its leather seats are as unyielding as a hunting saddle but it leaps from standstill to 100 kph (62 mph) in well under eight seconds and owners can boast of an unusable 245 kph (152 mph) top speed. The secret of the Pounds 28,100 Cloverleaf's vigour is a new, 24-valve development of Alfa Romeo's classic short-stroke, three-litre, V6 engine. It puts out a lusty 235 horsepower at 6,300 rpm and develops maximum torque (in plain language, pulls hardest) at 5,000 rpm. As overall gearing is fairly low at 24 mph (39 kmh) per 1,000 rpm in fifth, the V6 spun freely when I drove it briskly on uncrowded, hilly roads in north-east Scotland the other day. It pulled nicely in fifth in town traffic and cruised in relaxed fashion on dual carriageways. Alfa's figures suggest it might give an uncharacteristically light-footed driver around 27 mpg (10.46l/100km). Even by Alfa Romeo standards, it cornered and held the road exceptionally well. The Cloverleaf's stablemate is the slightly less potent (200 hp) but more resiliently sprung 164 Super. Both come with air-conditioning, heated and power-adjusted front seats, six-speaker radio/CD player and ABS brakes. The Super, which lacks the Cloverleaf's aggressive looks, costs Pounds 25,100 (or Pounds 26,504 with automatic transmission). I liked it even better because ride comfort means more to me than the ultimate in handling. I thought a 164 Super might seduce the user of a Saab 9000 2.3 turbo hankering after a bigger engine; or a Ford Scorpio driver in search of greater charisma. Entry model in the revised 164 range is the Pounds 16,850 Twinspark. It lacks the sheer muscle of the V6 but the two-litre, four-cylinder twin-cam is no weakling, with 146 horsepower on tap. The Twinspark had the neatest handling and the best ride of the lot. The Alfa Romeo 164, Fiat Croma (no longer sold in Britain), Lancia Thema and Saab 9000 share the same underpinnings. They started off as a joint exercise because neither Fiat Group nor Saab could contemplate the cost of developing a big, new car on its own. Inevitably, they grew apart; now, the Alfa Romeo 164 is arguably the most individual and best looking of the four. Alfa Romeos always have let their drivers feel in more intimate contact with the mechanics than most other cars although you get the same feeling in a Porsche. All the 164s make lovely growly noises when you put your foot down and let the engine soar to high revolutions. The three I drove all had a slight whimper in the transmission when going from power-on to power-off. I was happy to put this down to character, because they felt solidly built and one could believe they would be mechanically enduring. Speaking of which, it really is time Alfa Romeo and Lancia were allowed to come in from the cold. The bad old days, when Italian car makers took a cavalier attitude toward mundane matters like corrosion resistance, have long gone but the stigma remains. Most of the sheet steel used in Alfa Romeo and Lancia bodies is galvanised and the anti-rust warranty has been extended from six to eight years. Mechanical and electrical frailties, too, are said to be things of the past. There is no way of proving this in a brief test drive; only extended use can do that. But Grant and Taylor, a London firm of information technologists, has had more than 200 Lancias as company cars in the past 20 years and runs a fleet of 31 now. For some years, half the Alfa Romeos sold in Britain have been 164s, more than 5,500 in all. I know of no reason why they should not be just as reliable as Grant and Taylor's Lancias.</p>

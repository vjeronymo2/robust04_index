			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Economic Watch: Current account deficit declines Final current account figures produced by Germany's federal statistics office show a revised deficit of DM33.2bn (Pounds 13.6bn) for 1993, compared with a provisional DM35.2bn, the Bundesbank said. The capital account surplus was unchanged at DM20.8bn. For 1992, the current account deficit was DM39.2bn; the capital account was DM134.8bn in surplus. Changes in the way trade data are gathered because of the European single market have led to long delays in reporting since early 1993. The statistics office said recently it also expected an extensive revision in first-half 1994 figures, due for release late on August 26. Spain's consumer price index is expected to have risen nearly 0.4 points in July, to put the year-on-year inflation rate at 4.7 per cent, the same as June's, according to a Reuter survey of analysts' forecasts. Expectations for the figures, due on Friday, range from 0.2 to 0.7 per cent for the monthly increase and 4.5 to 5 per cent for the yearly rate. The Dutch trade surplus narrowed to a provisional Fl 1.3bn in April from an upwards revised Fl 2.3bn in March, the central bureau of statistics said.</p>

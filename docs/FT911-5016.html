			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities falter after early show of strength Wall Street A signal from the Federal Reserve that interest rates are to remain unchanged for the time being and a mixed bag of first quarter company results left share prices looking for direction yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 12.38 at 2,933.17, but it had already moved from strength to weakness several times before then. The broader-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was also slightly firmer, ending up 0.97 at 381.37. The Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks, however, ended down 0.78 at 500.84, unsettled by a big fall in Apple Computer shares. After a bright start trading tailed off. By the close turnover on the New York SE reached only 162m shares. Advances outpaced declines by 923 to 670. Equities opened higher on hopes that the Fed would cut interest rates after last week's promising inflation figures. Those gains disappeared after the Fed's mid-morning money market operations made it clear to Wall Street that the authorities were not ready to ease monetary policy just yet. There was a late afternoon rally, but it lacked conviction. The over-the-counter market was troubled by disappointing first quarter earnings from Apple Computer. Apple tumbled Dollars 9 1/2 or 13 per cent to Dollars 62 1/4 , on turnover of over 15m shares, after the company reported profit of Dollars 1.07 per share for the first three months of 1991. The market had been expecting a better showing and analysts quickly downgraded their second quarter earnings forecasts. NCR, the computer group fighting off an unwanted bid from AT&amp;T, slipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 96 5/8 on news that its earnings fell from 73 cents a share to 70 cents a share in the first quarter. In a recent special ballot AT&amp;T failed to win the 80 per cent support of shareholders required to remove NCR's board of directors. AT&amp;T shares rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 35 3/4 . Tonka, the toy manufacturer, fell Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 4 3/4 after Hasbro said it was ready to raise its bid for Tonka debentures but lower its offer for the company's common stock. The new offer, which increases the total value of the bid from Dollars 470m to Dollars 486m, left Hasbro shares Dollars  1/4 lower at Dollars 26 on the American stock exchange. Among financial stocks PaineWebber edged Dollars  1/2 higher to Dollars 24 3/8 (the shares had been more than Dollars 1 higher earlier on) after the company reported a threefold increase in first quarter profits to Dollars 31m. A big rise in income at Smith Barney, the securities subsidiary of Primerica, helped the financial services group make a 30 per cent improvement in first quarter earnings. News of the 95 cents a share profit lifted Primerica's stock Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 32 3/8 . The market also responded favourably to Chase Manhattan, up Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 18 7/8 in brisk trading after it unveiled a rise in opening quarter income from 20 cents a share to 73 cents a share. Canada Toronto stocks closed slightly higher in trendless trade after fluctuating in a narrow range in line with first quarter earnings results from the US. Investors are waiting for further signs of a discount rate cut by the Fed. The composite index closed 7.04 up at 3516.43. Advances led declines by 278 to 266 on volume of 25.1m shares. 'First quarter earnings results are coming in from the States. They've had quite an effect on the markets both on the upside and the downside,' said Mr Don Vialoux, a vice- president with Richardson Greenshields of Canada.</p>

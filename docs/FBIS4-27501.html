			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam Sends </F> Letter to UN Secretary General Over Establishment of New Peace  Arrangement" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- Vice-Premier and Foreign  Minister Kim Yong-nam sent a letter to UN Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali on May 28 regarding an important measure  taken by the DPRK Government recently to establish a new peace  arrangement on the Korean peninsula.    Recalling that the DPRK Government, through a statement of  the Foreign Ministry April 28, proposed to the United States to  hold negotiations to establish a new peace arrangement that  would replace the old armistice mechanism, the letter says:    As you confirmed personally during your visit to our country  toward the end of last year, an unstable state of truce, neither  peace nor war, has lasted for more than 40 years on the Korean  peninsula.    The situation on the Korean peninsula has become all the  more  strained and the possibility of a total armed conflict is  increasing because the United States, entering this year, has  massed huge reinforcements in and around South Korea and stepped  up its military actions against the DPRK on the pretext of the  "nuclear issue".    The Korean Armistice Agreement and its observation mechanism  should have controlled such actions, but they have failed to  play any role due to the U.S. side's systematic acts of breach  and destruction.    In 1956 the United States expelled Neutral Nations  Inspection  teams stationed at the appropriate ports of entry under  Paragraph C, Article 2 of the Korean Armistice Agreement from  the area under its control and, on June 21, 1957, it  unilaterally renounced Subparagraph 13d of the Korean Armistice  Agreement which stipulates that the introduction into Korea of  reinforcing combat equipment shall be ceased. Since then the  United States has shipped sophisticated weapons including more  than 1,000 pieces of nuclear weapons into South Korea without  any restrictions and it has become all the more undisguised of  late in its shipments of such combat equipment.    Having systematically destroyed the military armistice  mechanism, the U.S. side completely paralyzed it by unilaterally  appointing as the senior member of the "UN Forces" side to the  Military Armistice Commission (MAC) a South Korean serviceman  without any legal justification or qualification in view of the  Armistice Agreement on March 25, 1991.    The present-day reality in which the basic provisions of the  Armistice Agreement that should guarantee peace on the Korean  peninsula have been scrapped and the armistice observation  mechanism now remains only in name requires that a decisive  measure be taken to establish a new security arrangement for  saving the situation which has reached the danger line and  preventing arms buildup and the outbreak of another war.    In fact, the Korean Armistice Agreement signed on July 27,  1953, was a tentative measure taken to stop combat actions  between the belligerent parties and taken in anticipation of its  conversion to a peace agreement in the future.    The adoption of the resolution (3390, b) calling for the  dissolution of the "UN command" and the replacement of the  Armistice Agreement by a peace agreement at the 30th session of  the UN General Assembly in 1975, therefore, was a very just  measure to ensure a lasting peace on the Korean peninsula and it  opened a bright vista for the final solution of the Korean  question.    The DPRK Government has taken initiatives and proposed  negotiations on many occasions to ensure a durable peace on the  Korean peninsula and made tireless efforts to carry them into  effect. Nonaggression was vowed by the North and the South  through the "agreement on reconciliation, nonaggression,  cooperation and exchange between the North and the South"  adopted in 1992 as a result of our positive efforts. But we are  still in a state of truce vis-a-vis the United States which  keeps its Armed Forces stationed in South Korea.    The "UN command", known as a signatory to the Armistice  Agreement, serves for the strategic aim of the United States to  isolate and stifle the DPRK and establish control over Asia and  the Pacific region, an aim which has nothing to do with the UN  mission to keep peace in South Korea. I think, therefore, that  there is no condition for the U.S. Forces present in South Korea  to act "UN Forces" any longer. [sentence as received]    Taking into consideration the actual conditions where a  grave  situation threatening peace had been created on the Korean  peninsula but there was no rational institutional mechanism  capable of controling it, the DPRK Government proposed to the  U.S. side to negotiate the establishment of a new durable peace  arrangement that will replace the old armistice mechanism and,  at the same time, took practical measures of recalling all the  members of the Korean People's Army (KPA) side from the MAC,  setting up the KPA mission at Panmunjom as a new mechanism for  negotiations with the U.S. Forces side and of appointing the  chief and members of the mission.    This is, to all intents and purposes, an innovative and  well-  intentioned step to make a breakthrough in establishing a new  security arrangement for peace on the Korean peninsula and a  peaceloving step that took into account the publicly accepted  international usage whereby some countries abandoned the  relationship of hostilities after the Second World War and  declared peace relationship instead.    I consider that the United Nations must pay due attention to  our proposal in the sense of liquidating its unpleasant past  vis-a-vis the DPRK, its member state, and in the sense of  fulfilling its resolution to replace the Armistice Agreement  with a peace agreement.    The "nuclear issue" over which some countries are now making  a fuss is, in fact, not a question to be discussed by the United  Nations, but one that must be solved through negotiations  between the DPRK and the U.S.    Taking "sanctions" against the DPRK, yielding to the unjust  demand of some countries, it will, no doubt, bring devastating  consequences menacing peace in Asia and the rest of the world,  not to speak of the Korean peninsula.    With a view to accelerating the process of the replacement  of  the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement in accordance  with the resolution of the 30th General Assembly, the United  Nations must take a practical step to dismantle the "UN  command", the framework of the old armistice structure.    In the letter Kim Yong-nam expresses the hope that the UN  secretary-general will pay a particular attention to the peace  overture of the DPRK to establish a new peace arrangement  through the medium of the DPRK-U.S. negotiations and actively  cooperate in its materialisation.</p>

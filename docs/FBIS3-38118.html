As he waited for his flight to New York at Dublin airport he  said he thought the United States could play an influential role  in resolving the Ulster conflict.    "They can encourage the British, without taking sides, and  move the situation on," he said.    Asked whether he had renounced violence, one of the  stipulations for a visa reportedly laid down, Mr Adams replied:  "My attitude is quite simple and straight forward -- I want an  end to violence."    He planned to make a number of speeches while in the United  States and his message would be that there is an opportunity for  peace.    "We are now in a very critical phase in the process towards  that. We are not going to squander the opportunity for peace.  President Clinton's administration can play a very helpful and  encouraging role now."    Asked about the still-awaited response of Sinn Fein and the  IRA to last month's Downing Street peace declaration, Mr Adams  replied: "You can have a response as quickly as the British  Government explains where they see the declaration fitting in  the overall peace process. While they refuse to clarify the  situation they build a road-block to forward movement."</p>

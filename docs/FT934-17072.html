			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Giving information to members THE REPORT stresses that providing information to members is important in the smooth running of the pension scheme. Clearly, members must understand the benefits to which they are entitled and must be told of any changes. Access to information can also help members to investigate the financial security of their scheme and to judge if it is being run properly. Despite improvements in the past few years, the committee found evidence to suggest that the sheer volume of information sent to members, much of which is gibberish to most people, simply defeats the purpose. The report suggests that the following basic information 'should be set out in a simple format and in plain English and should be given to each employee before joining the scheme and be available throughout scheme membership': A statement of whether the scheme is registered with the regulator and its registration number. A full statement of the nature of the pension promise detailing contributions payable, scheme benefits, and how these benefits are secured. (The report also suggests that these rights should be enshrined in the employment contract). A statement of the scheme's past policy with respect to pension increases, which should be contained in the annual report. Details of trustee arrangements. A general statement of the powers to make scheme amendments; the use of surpluses; the application of funds in the event of wind-up; and the steps to be taken if the scheme has a deficiency. A statement of the member's rights to further information and how this can be obtained. In addition, all active members and pensioners should be sent automatically an annual statement, in plain English, showing both their individual benefits and key information about the scheme including its solvency level, the basic distribution of assets, and fund movements. The annual report and accounts should also be written in accessible language and made available at any time to members.</p>

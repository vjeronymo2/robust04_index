			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Technology: Europe's liquid assets - Philips is leading an assault on Japanese dominance of the active LCD market A European joint venture is trying to squeeze in to the market for active liquid crystal display units, a market dominated by Japanese manufacturers. The Flat Panel Display company, led by Philips of the Netherlands, believes its success could lie in a technology different from the one used by Japanese manufacturers making active LCDs. These can accommodate fast-moving pictures, unlike passive units used mainly for watches and calculators. Three European manufacturers set up the joint venture last year, with Philips taking an 80 per cent stake and its French partners, Thomson and Sagem, holding 10 per cent each. Philips later reduced its holding to 70 per cent to make room for Merck, the German supplier of liquid crystals, which now also owns 10 per cent of the company. The European industry believes that by seizing on an alternative technology it has an advantage that may outweigh the handicap of starting so far behind the Japanese. In the 1970s, European electronics companies dismissed LCDs as a fad that would not last beyond the heyday of the digital watch. Active LCDs are used in computer monitors as well as navigation systems in cars and film screens that pop up from armrests in in-flight entertainment. So far, the FPD's robot-equipped factory in Eindhoven is the only production facility outside Japan that has launched mass commercial output of active LCDs. The European manufacturers are keen to challenge not only Japanese dominance, but also to beat US companies to a share of an industry growing at an annual rate of 30 per cent. 'These are the same rates of growth seen in the early days of the integrated circuit,' says Chris Stuve, FPD's chief executive, underlining the strategic importance for Europe of gaining a foothold. Having begun commercial production earlier this year at a rate of 40,000 screens per day, the company is currently boosting output to 75,000 per day. By the turn of the century, the company aims to have captured 8 per cent of the fast-expanding world market for active LCDs. It has only a tiny market share now, with Japanese producers accounting for more than 90 per cent of sales. Between now and 1998, the total market is expected to surge nearly three-fold to Fl 14bn (Dollars 7.9bn) a year from Fl 5bn in 1994. Entering the market is not cheap. FPD's partners have spent a combined Fl 500m on capital investment alone in the Eindhoven plant. Besides the European initiative, the Japanese are facing plans for commercial production from South Korean manufacturers, while the Clinton administration has targeted active LCDs as a strategic growth area for US companies. To lay claim to a portion of the market the Europeans will have to prove that their screens - and their technology - are at least as good as those produced in Japan. The difference in the European and Japanese approach to LCDs lies in the way electrical current is moved around the screens. Japanese manufacturers use thin-film transistors in their screens, a logical consequence of the development route they have taken since LCDs first emerged 20 years ago. Philips and its European partners have opted for what they say is a simpler thin-film diode as the main switching device in their LCDs. Unlike transistors, which require three electrical connections, the diode uses two. The Europeans say these smaller switches make their screens brighter because they block out less light. More important, the company says the simpler switching system means the screens can be made in fewer manufacturing steps, enabling Europe to produce at a lower cost than Japanese market leaders, such as Sharp and NEC. Indeed, the European joint venture says its screens can be made in just three or four 'maskings' compared with seven or eight for the Japanese technology. Maskings are the cycle of substrate-depositing, photo-lithography and etching needed to convert the glass screen into an active LCD. The Philips-led venture is not the first to explore using diodes rather than transistors. But it is the only one so far to have harnessed the technology commercially. This is because it has overcome one of the problems associated with diodes: they tend to produce screens with variations of light across the display. By adding an extra pulse of voltage in a new, patented process, Philips says, it has produced a uniform display. Philips does not intend to license other producers to use the technology. Instead, the technology will be used as a bargaining chip in the European joint venture's quest to build a second factory. The new plant, expected to cost around Fl 500m, is likely to be built somewhere in Asia, putting the Europeans in their Japanese competitors' back yard. Stuve says the company is looking for joint-venture partners for the new factory, with the transfer of technology as one of the attractions of striking a deal. The decision on whether to go ahead with an Asian factory is expected in the next 18 months. Asia is attractive because that is where greatest number of active LCDs are sold. While Philips and its partners intend to challenge this Asian pre-eminence, they have already stopped trying to rival Japanese dominance in the field for very small LCDs used in camcorders at the consumer end of the market. They have also had to accept another fact of life that again highlights Japanese dominance in the market: the specialised, high-quality glass they use in their screens must still be imported from Japan because it is not yet made by any of Europe's glass manufacturers.</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Samsung bond marks the return of Koreans KOREAN companies are expected to begin a return to the Euromarkets today with the launch of a Dollars 150m convertible bond for Samsung Electronics. It will be the first international equity-linked issue by a Korean company since the country's stock market was opened to foreign investors at the start of the year. The ability of foreign investors to buy shares in the domestic market, rather than through equity-linked euro-offerings, is expected to have an impact on the yield investors demand on securities issued internationally. 'The terms of the convertible will have to provide an attractive alternative to buying stock in the secondary market,' one banker close to the issue said. Samsung's 15-year issue is due to be followed by others from Korean companies in the months ahead. Chonju Paper, another part of the Samsung group, is expected in May to seek between Dollars 20m - Dollars 25m from international investors through an issue of Euro-depositary receipt arrangement. These are similar to global depositary receipts, except that the securities will not be traded in the US. It is also believed that Hyundai Motor, another leading Korean company, would seek to raise up to Dollars 150m this summer through an issue of global depositary receipts. Salomon Brothers International in London has lost the latest head of its equity syndicate desk, the second such departure in recent weeks. Mr Jeremy Palmer is believed to have taken up a similar position with JP Morgan in London. He has been replaced temporarily by Mr Alex Graham, who was brought in from Salomon in New York this week to fill the gap.</p>

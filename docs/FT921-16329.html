			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / The Long View: Voting against inflation WILL index-linked gilts prove to be the surprise winners among investments in 1992? To judge by the wave of devaluation talk over Christmas and the New Year you could be forgiven for thinking so. There is an inclination to blame the Germans, and more specifically the Bundesbank, for behaving irresponsibly in the middle of a global recession. But the Bundesbank is just about the last defender in the world of honest money, and at times like this the cost of preserving the value of a currency can become painfully obvious. In any case, Britain's inflation is a British problem. Underlying inflation is still between 5 1/2 and 6 per cent, and pay inflation continues to run at some 7 1/2 per cent. Since the UK became a full participant in the European Monetary System 15 months ago British pay rates have risen by some 10 per cent in spite of the recession and the rapid growth of unemployment. The UK is plainly drifting towards a currency crisis created by itself, not the Germans. Another manifestation has been in the continued excess of demand relative to the British economy's ability to supply. Forget the misleading squeals of the retailers, the fact is that at the national level imports still exceed exports, even in the depths of a serious recession. Any period of sustained economic growth at the current exchange rate will inevitably lead straight to an unmanageably large trade deficit. Devaluation is a means of restoring a balance, at least temporarily. Externally it can be seen as a cut in real wages, so that exporters become competitive again, and demand for imports is reduced. Internally, however, the mechanism is more complicated. Inflation has the effect of pricing overpaid workers back into their jobs, so that they are not required to accept humiliating cuts in nominal pay; but inflation also tends to damage investors, most obviously by reducing the purchasing power of bank deposits, but also in other ways, such as by making it difficult for companies to earn profits large enough to replace their stocks and physical capital at updated prices, a problem which hits share prices. At the same time, inflation helps borrowers to evade their full commitments. When the vulnerable groups in society, such as investors and pensioners, are unprotected against inflation a comparatively small change in prices may be enough to achieve the required shift in wealth. But when they are well-prepared, through ownership of inflation-proof assets or the benefit of index-linked pensions, the inflation may need to be much more rapid. Ultimately you arrive at Latin American-style hyperinflation, although in the UK bursts of inflation of around 20-25 per cent, in the early 1920s and the 1970s, and again at the beginning of the 1980s, have been enough to solve the worst problems. As I have said before in this column, the UK approached the challenge of the European Community's exchange rate mechanism the wrong way round. We should have aligned the economy first, reducing monetary growth and inflation over a period, and then joined at a stable long-term exchange rate. However, I am conscious of being vulnerable to charges of political naivete, because without a tough external constraint the necessary measures could never in practice be imposed. So John Major as Chancellor in 1990 did it in reverse. The once-famous 'Madrid conditions' were ignored. As a pragmatic politician he entered the ERM with UK inflation over 10 per cent precisely as a means of bringing prices under control. But the contradiction remains. If the country did not have the political gumption to solve its own inflation problem will it have the determination to remain within the ERM when the going gets really tough? In their New Year messages we have been able to observe John Major and Norman Lamont still wriggling with embarrassment over the economic 'recovery', which Lamont continues to claim will be gathering momentum over the coming months. It would have been much better to say there can, and should, be no recovery until pay inflation has collapsed: no more than 4 to 5 per cent is tolerable even in normal conditions, and in the present recession 2 to 3 per cent must be the target. Unfortunately, this kind of battle can be faced only by an administration that has just won an election, not by one that must face the country within the next six months. Low inflation is one of the government's chief policy objectives, and quite rightly so; but there seems to be great nervousness over whether it will win many votes. Norman Lamont's remark some months ago that high unemployment is a price well worth paying in order to achieve low inflation is still being used against him; it appears to have been too brutally honest for widespread public consumption, which is not a good sign. But it is no use just relying on the Bundesbank to beat British inflation. The government will come to regret its failure to encourage a quicker adjustment in the labour market. As for the asset markets, the crisis in property was inevitable, but surely should have been presented as a necessary step towards affordability in housing, not as some sort of emergency to be solved in 48 hours just before Christmas. It will take a brilliant exercise in political leadership if the transition to low inflation now being attempted is to be accomplished successfully; the mumbled apologies, deceptions and excuses now being put about by leading ministers do not inspire much confidence. I am not a devaluationist, but the pound sterling cannot be saved on the basis of minority support. At any rate, during the past week or two the London stock market has been influenced more by New York's cheap money and devaluation boom than by the expectation of a harsh domestic struggle. In the event gilt-edged securities did not manage to achieve a higher annual rate of return than UK equities, which gained 5 1/2 per cent in the final four trading days of the year. Index-linked gilts were the dullards of 1991, as inflation came tumbling down and real interest rates stayed high. But they could still be a valuable part of a portfolio for 1992.</p>

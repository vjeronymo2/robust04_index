			<p>BFN     [Summary] According to an opinion poll carried out by  Slovak Radio in May to find out current voting intentions, and  based on the answers from 1,065 respondents, the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] polled 21.1 percent, the Party of the  Democratic Left [SDL] polled 8.7 percent, and the Christian  Democratic Movement [KDH] polled 7.9 percent of votes. The  other parties failed to reach 5 percent of votes and would not  therefore be represented in parliament.    The respondents also answered the question about how would  they vote if parties and movements were grouped in coalitions.  The coalition of national oriented parties--the HZDS, the  Slovak National Party, and the Christian Social Union--would win  1999 percent of votes. The coalition of left-wing parties--the  SDL, the Social Democratic Party, the Green Party, and the  Farmers' Movement--would win 15.1 percent of votes. And the  coalition of right-wing and liberal parties--the KDH, the  Democratic Party, the National Democratic Party, the Democratic  Union, and the Party of Entrepreneurs and Small  Businessmen--would win 13 percent of votes. The coalition of  Hungarian parties received the support of 7.5 percent of  respondents.</p>

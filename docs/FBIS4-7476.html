			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Sz.Sz."-signed report: "Konya: The Government Controls </F> the Police"]    [Text] The legal provision that has now been accepted  makes it possible to create a strong and determined police force  that protects the citizens but which exercises its rights in  accordance with the guarantees of the constitutional state,  Interior Minister Imre Konya said after the police law had been  passed. He said that the process that advocates the  establishment of a strong and determined body for the police,  which became somewhat uncertain after the change of the regime,  has lasted some one and a half to two years now. The reason for  the uncertainty was that the rights of policemen had not been  laid down in law before. The minister emphasized that the law  regulates in detail the conditions of coercion that can be  applied by policemen; therefore, policemen performing their  duties legally will no longer be liable to suffer political  attacks. Naturally, the law also contains adequate guarantees  to prevent abuse of violent power.    In Konya's view, it is of utmost importance that the law  regulates the collection of secret information in accordance  with the constitutional state. The police are placed in the  state apparatus in accordance with the rules of parliamentary  democracy; according to the law, the police are part of the  executive power, therefore they are under the government's  supervision, the minister said.    In reply to our question what was the cause of the  impressive  majority in accepting the law, Konya said that the drafting of  this law that requires a two-thirds majority was the result of a  very long coordination. In his view, the successful voting was  also helped by the fact that, before the elections, none of the  parties wanted to have the responsibility of preventing the  acceptance of a law that is fundamentally important for  strengthening public security. Konya also pointed out that, in  recent months, the parties that had previously had reservations  about creating a strong police force have also acknowledged  society's need for public security.</p>

			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROFITS MADE IN CARTER YEARS;  </P> <P> PLAYING FAVORITES AT HUD: LATEST TWIST ON OLD GAME  </P> <P> When Ronald Reagan was elected President in 1980, developer John L. Allen told  a city official in Durham, N.C., that his firm would have to "switch aisles" to  win federal funds for a housing project for the elderly.  </P> <P> Replacing a Democratic Administration with a Republican one meant wrenching  changes in the nation's housing policy, a new cast at the Department of Housing  and Urban Development and profitable new opportunities for developers with the  right connections.  </P> <P> But not everything changed.  </P> <P> Indeed, evidence suggests that the Reagan crew simply added a new twist to the  old game of using influence and favoritism in awarding HUD grants and subsidies  -- though even conservative analysts agree that the Reagan Administration  system led to abuses of unprecedented magnitude.  </P> <P> As the current congressional hearings on HUD agency practices have amply  demonstrated, winning housing grants in the Reagan years depended heavily on  hiring the right Republican consultant, such as former Secretary of the  Interior James G. Watt or former Florida Republican Party Chairman William L.  Taylor.  </P> <P> But the congressional investigators have heard little testimony about the fact  that from 1976 to 1980, while Democrat Jimmy Carter was President, developers  with Democratic ties grew rich building and rehabilitating housing for the poor  and elderly with millions of dollars in HUD funds. Instead of hiring  politically connected consultants, these developers contributed to the right  campaigns.  </P> <P> Particularly in the last 18 months of his presidency, according to one former  senior Carter strategist, Carter "littered the country" with HUD grants in an  attempt to rescue his failing campaign.  </P> <P> Real estate and housing developers are traditional bankrollers for politicians  because they depend on favorable government decisions at almost every stage of  a project and the stakes can be enormous.  </P> <P> HUD was thrust into the relationship because it could loan developers money at  low rates and provide subsidies that guarantee the financial success of housing  projects. As a result, candidates for the presidency and seats in Congress were  able to count on hefty contributions from developers.  </P> <P> "The fact is that the system was designed to have influence driving it because  profits are so big and because those on the supply side of housing find it in  their interest to compete in this way," said Stuart M. Butler, director of  domestic policy studies at the Heritage Foundation think tank in Washington.  "This is sort of endemic to a system that operates on the thesis that you help  low-income people get housing by enriching developers."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Developer Funds  </P> <P> For instance, 70% of the money Carter raised for his reelection campaign in  Massachusetts in 1979 came from HUD-connected developers. And every developer  who contributed got a new HUD project, according to a 1980 study by the Boston  Herald American.  </P> <P> One Carter backer who got new HUD projects under his Administration was Gerard  F. Doherty, a veteran Boston developer and lawyer, who headed Carter's 1976  campaign in New York, where he won a crucial victory.  </P> <P> Chicago developer Thomas B. Rosenberg -- who contributed thousands of dollars  to Carter and raised an estimated $700,000 for the 1984 presidential bid of  Walter F. Mondale, Carter's vice president -- obtained HUD approval for 35  housing projects across the country during the Carter years.  </P> <P> Large contributions to Democrats also have helped open doors for A. Bruce  Rozet, whose Associated Financial Corp. of Santa Monica and various affiliates  are among the nation's biggest syndicators and managers of HUD housing.  </P> <P> One of Rozet's favorite candidates is Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), whose  position as chairman of the Senate subcommittee that oversees housing gives him  enormous influence at HUD. Rozet and a handful of associates have contributed  more than $17,000 to Cranston in the last decade, federal election records  show.  </P> <P> Lawrence B. Simons, federal housing commissioner under Carter and now a  Washington lawyer, acknowledged in an interview that political contributions  helped developers with the Carter Administration.  </P> <P> "As long as you have a democratic process, there is going to be politics,"  Simons said. It was "all part of the political process."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Illegal  </P> <P> This does not mean that the politicians, government officials or developers  were doing anything illegal. Congressmen argue that HUD projects help their  constituents. Developers contend that contributions represent support for  friendly politicians, rather than a nefarious quid pro quo.  </P> <P> "I wanted Carter to win because I thought the FHA (Federal Housing  Administration) would be stronger under Carter than it would under Reagan,"  said Rosenberg, who added that he did not submit another application to HUD  after Carter lost.  </P> <P> Similarly, Rozet maintained that his support of Cranston and other Democratic  candidates stemmed from shared ideals and brought him only a "receptive ear"  for his ideas on housing.  </P> <P> "What is important is to have input into the legislative process," said Rozet,  who was appointed by Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) to a  national commission whose report forms the basis for pending legislation to  extend tax credits for investors in low-income housing.  </P> <P> But it does appear that campaign contributions provided access to decision  makers in the Carter Administration in much the same way that hiring the right  consultant did in the Reagan era.  </P> <P> Several factors, however, appeared to have lessened the impact of influence  under Carter compared to Reagan.  </P> <P> "The big difference is that the people who were in HUD under the Carter  Administration had some interest in the subject and were interested in serving  the constituencies the department worked with -- cities, poor people and the  housing industry," said Anthony Downs, a senior fellow at the Brookings  Institution.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Couldn't Give a Damn'  </P> <P> "The Reagan Administration put people in HUD who couldn't give a damn about  housing or HUD policies, and when you put those kinds of people in charge of a  program, good things don't happen."  </P> <P> In addition, the level of HUD funding under Carter was far higher and it was  easier to help friendly developers without slighting those with no connections.  HUD housing programs for new construction and major rehabilitation were  eliminated under Reagan and the department budget was slashed.  </P> <P> Also, local housing authorities had a stronger say in choosing projects in the  Carter period, which diminished Washington's influence. From 1983 on, a change  in the law meant that key decisions on awarding the dwindling supply of HUD  funds were made at headquarters.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Sort of Popped Up'  </P> <P> "Washington became sort of a bottleneck and some political consultants just  sort of popped up," said Doherty, who cut back on his HUD involvement during  the Reagan years.  </P> <P> Indeed, the concentration of decision making in Washington and the far smaller  pool of funds helped spawn a cottage industry of instant consultants, often  without any housing expertise, who became necessary to get HUD funds.  </P> <P> The role of the consultants appeared to dumbfound Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.)  during the current hearings on HUD when he was questioning a developer who paid  $300,000 to Watt for bringing her project to the attention of former HUD  Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr.  </P> <P> "You would rather pay $300,000 than ask your senator or congressman?" Frank  asked Judith Siegel. "The reason I say that is that, you know, sometimes I'm in  a bad mood and people call me and I'm grumpy, but geez, I never think I'm  $300,000 grumpy. I mean, I can't imagine that someone would say: 'Well I could  call my congressman or I could pay 300 grand and boy, he might be in one of his  moods and I'd rather pay the 300 grand.' "  </P> <P> "I think the system is very bad, too," Siegel responded.  </P> <P> Boston developer John Allen anticipated that Reagan's victory would affect his  2-year-old effort to obtain HUD financing to turn an abandoned hosiery mill in  Durham, N.C., into housing for the elderly.  </P> <P> Paul Norby, Durham's top planning official, recalled in a recent interview that  Allen had said he would have to "switch aisles" and rely on a partner with  better Republican ties.  </P> <P> Allen did not return telephone calls to his Boston office. But records show  that the project languished until Louis Kitchin of Atlanta, a Reagan campaign  strategist with no housing experience, was hired as a consultant and Durham's  new Republican mayor, Charles Markham, a one-time associate at the same law  firm as HUD's Pierce, began actively supporting it.  </P> <P> HUD records and congressional testimony indicate that Pierce ordered a generous  package of benefits for the project in 1985 over staff objections and despite  the refusal of his assistant secretary for housing to approve it.  </P> <P> Because Pierce told the House subcommittee that he was not involved in specific  projects, the Durham decision has emerged as one focus of the inquiry.  </P> <P> In his congressional testimony on May 25, Pierce tried to shift some of the  spotlight to Democrats who benefitted through HUD under Carter. He said that,  when he came to Washington to join the Reagan Cabinet in 1981, lawyers told him  that HUD funding for new construction was being "sold" for $1,000 to $2,000 a  unit.  </P> <P> But Rep. Frank -- a former chairman and longtime member of the housing and  community development subcommittee of the House Banking, Finance and Urban  Affairs Committee -- berated Pierce for bringing up the issue and criticized  him strongly when the former secretary refused to identify specific Democrats  who benefited.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Let It Get Worse'  </P> <P> Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.), who has been an outspoken critic of his own  party's operation of HUD, said in an interview: "The Reagan Administration had  its chance eight years ago and instead of ferreting out waste, fraud and abuse  at HUD, they just let it get worse. There is no doubt in my mind that there  were abuses in the Carter Administration, but that happened a long time ago and  we are concentrating on the last three or four years."  </P> <P> He predicted, however, that some Democratic developers may wind up before the  subcommittee through their use of Republicans "who opened the doors."  </P> <P> Some Democratic developers withdrew from the HUD scene when Reagan was elected  and others who have remained have taken their lumps.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Called 'Scandalous'  </P> <P> During a tour last month of a Washington housing project owned partly by Rozet,  HUD Secretary Jack Kemp called the complex "scandalous" and threatened to bar  the owners from doing business with the department if conditions were not  improved.  </P> <P> Similar criticisms have been aimed at a San Francisco project, Geneva Towers,  partly owned by Rozet. Robert J. De Monte, HUD regional administrator, vowed in  an interview to foreclose on the property by September unless the partnership  makes substantial improvements.  </P> <P> But Rozet blames the Reagan Administration for failing to provide enough money  for the Washington complex and said that his partners have responsibility for  improving Geneva Towers.  </P> <P> Since it started in May by examining allegations of favoritism in one HUD  program between 1983 and 1988, the subcommittee's inquiry has broadened  dramatically, sometimes using information provided by Democratic developers.  </P> <P> Rozet acknowledged in an interview that he has provided "unsolicited"  information to members of the subcommittee.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Providing Information  </P> <P> "Nobody is relying on me," he said. "They are asking lots of people for help. I  am merely providing information gratuitously."  </P> <P> A source close to the investigation said that the California developer offered  a tip about a Florida project involving Republican Carla Anderson Hills, the  U.S. trade representative and former HUD secretary, who has done legal work for  developers.  </P> <P> Rozet did say that he has complained to HUD about the project, in which his  proposal to develop a piece of property in Jacksonville with HUD assistance was  rejected in favor of one backed by a developer represented by Hills.  </P> <P> In testimony before Congress, Hills denied any impropriety in the transaction  and said that she billed it at the hourly rate she charged legal clients,  rather than at the $1,000 a unit that was the going rate for consultants during  the Reagan Administration.  </P> <P> Staff writers Douglas Frantz reported from Washington and Dan Morain from San  Francisco.  </P></p>

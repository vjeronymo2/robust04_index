			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Opt-out school audits attacked PUBLIC MONEY is at risk in grant-maintained schools because of inadequate audit arrangements, the Audit Commission says in its annual report today. The local government spending watchdog's claim was denied by the government. The Labour party has called for an investigation by the Commons public accounts committee. In England and Wales, grant-maintained schools - which opt out of local authority control - are allowed to appoint their own external auditors. Sir David Cooksey, chairman of the commission, described this arrangement as 'unprecedented in the public sector'. Although it is accepted practice for companies to appoint their own auditors, Sir David said extra 'checks and balances' were necessary in the public sector, because boards of governors are not answerable to shareholders. He said: 'Large sums of money are being given to those who have little experience of handling public finance. In some cases funds may be misused or even misappropriated. 'The rights of the public to challenge things which are going wrong and have auditors to issue public interest reports have been withdrawn.' He said external auditors should be appointed independently, and audits should include value for money reports. 'Without a rigorous approach to value for money and without the availability of national comparative benchmarks of performance, managers with delegated budgets will be unaware of their own relative performance.' In a swift response, Mr Eric Forth, the schools minister, said: 'The audit arrangements of grant-maintained schools are entirely appropriate and proper.' He said opted-out schools had annual external audits, while the Funding Agency for Schools, the government body created by this year's Education Act, would be able to commission value for money studies from the Audit Commission. The National Audit Office, the government spending watchdog, also has to report to parliament on the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the schools, he said. Mr Forth suggested that the commission was looking to create more work for itself, and said: 'There appears to be a certain amount of 'vested interest' here. The Audit Commission is, perhaps, understandably, disappointed that its bid for a monopoly role in GM schools was rejected by parliament during consideration of the recent education bill.' Sir David denied that the commission wanted a monopoly role. He said his concern was that auditors for schools should be externally appointed. Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said that the schools should have been made answerable to statutory audit procedures, and attacked the new funding agency's powers as 'entirely discretionary'. She said: 'Whilst there is a grant-maintained sector its expenditure must be properly audited. It is not good enough for government ministers to have discretion over the issue.' The Grant-maintained Schools Centre, which provides central services for opt-out schools, said the right to appoint auditors allowed schools to shop around for cheaper audit fees.</p>

			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RUNNING ACROSS THE FREEWAY -- DON'T PENALIZE THE MOTORISTS  </P> <P> Re "2nd Latino Youth Killed on I-5 in Less Than a Day" (Aug. 10): The American  Friends Services Committee and their bleeding heart friends are overlooking the  simplest solution to the recent deaths of Latinos on Interstate 5 at the San  Clemente checkpoint.  </P> <P> I propose that Interstate 5 be closed to all vehicular traffic from the Mexican  border to Santa Ana. This will enable thousands of illegal aliens to wander  into the heart of Orange County in perfect safety.  </P> <P> If successful, the closure of Interstate 5 could be extended into downtown Los  Angeles, providing us with another stupendous benefit: the elimination of our  daily traffic jams!  </P> <P> RUDY DOMENIE  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

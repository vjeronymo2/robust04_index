			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Strength of recovery uncertain: CBI Industrial trends survey THE Confederation of British Industry yesterday gave an upbeat view of prospects for manufacturers later this year, but warned that the timing and strength of the expected recovery was uncertain. The assessment came in the CBI's latest quarterly survey of industry trends, conducted among 1,328 manufacturing companies in 50 sectors between March 27 and April 13. Of the total responses, 94 per cent were filed before the general election result. The survey said output and orders had continued to fall in the past four months, but more slowly than last year. Business optimism had shown its biggest jump for nearly four years, supporting indications of a hesitant upturn. Factors that could hold back the recovery included slow world growth, which could dampen export demand, high company and consumer debts, and a continuation of high interest rates caused by the UK's commitment to the European exchange rate mechanism. Another negative aspect was reduced spending on manufacturing investment. The CBI believes this will fall by about a third by the end of this year compared with late 1990  - before the onset of the UK recession. This is not the first time the CBI's quarterly survey has pointed to recovery. Last October it provided similar indications about an imminent upturn, a message which turned out to be false. Mr Andrew Sentance, the CBI's director of economics, said the latest survey gave stronger reasons for believing a revival was on the way. 'It is giving us the strongest indications for two years about the future levels of orders and output,' he said. A quarter of the companies in the survey said they were more optimistic about the next four months, with 17 per cent more pessimistic. The balance expressing optimism of 8 per cent compared with a negative balance of 24 per cent in January, and a positive balance of 2 per cent in October last year. A balance of 5 per cent of companies believe output will rise over the next four months, compared with a negative balance of 4 per cent in January. In the four months to April demand for new orders continued to fall, but at the slowest rate since January 1990. Increases in unit costs are running at their lowest rate since the survey was launched in 1958, indicating that companies are benefiting from low prices charged by suppliers and reduced wage claims. Pressure to cut prices remains strong, though it is slightly weaker than in the January survey. A balance of 5 per cent of companies is reducing prices of goods for the UK market, compared with 19 per cent in January. A balance of 8 per cent said export orders had declined in the past four months, compared with 16 per cent in January and 20 per cent in October last year. The manufacturing workforce is expected to shrink by 44,000 in the second quarter, compared with 62,000 in the first quarter.</p>

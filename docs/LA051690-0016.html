			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STANFORD'S REVISED CURRICULUM  </P> <P> There can be no place but Stanford where the text of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" is  pored over so seriously.  </P> <P> It was a trash novel in its day, written by a housewife who never set foot in  the South. It is a device for the study of Western culture just as "Teenage  Mutant Ninja Turtles" is a device for the study of animal biology.  </P> <P> If the privileged children of Stanford must immerse themselves in the doings of  Little Eva, Topsy, and company, let it be as an artifact of the Civil War era.  Don't put it on the shelf next to Plato and the Bible.  </P> <P> RICHARD HEALEY  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Profits surge at SSAB for nine months SSAB, the Swedish steel group, yesterday reported nine-month pre-tax profits of SKr1.39bn (Dollars 189.1m), a near four-fold increase from SKr355m in the same period last year. The group has reaped the benefits of improved demand and rising prices in Europe. SSAB said it expected full-year pre-tax profits to be about SKr2bn if trading conditions continued. This would be more than double last year's SKr776m. Sales in the first nine months rose 20 per cent to SKr11.2bn from SKr9.38bn, due to higher volumes and increased prices, SSAB said. Operating expenses advanced to SKr9.34bn from SKr8.58bn, leaving operating profits after depreciation at SKr1.4bn, compared with SKr343m last time. The group's biggest division, the Tunnplat steel plate operation, saw operating profits jump to SKr829m from SKr142m on sales of SKr5.8bn. SSAB said steel consumption in western Europe was expected to increase 6 per cent in 1994, bringing consumption back to 1987 levels. In the US it was expected to rise 9 per cent, reaching the highest levels of recent years. Price increases, and the effects of a weak Swedish krona, meant the group's steel prices in kronor rose 17 per cent compared with last year.</p>

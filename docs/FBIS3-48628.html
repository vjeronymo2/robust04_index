Hosokawa made the call at a special government  committee to discuss trade issues that require a cross-ministry  approach.    The committee is expected to decide on a new action program  for making the government procurement process more transparent  and fair at the next meeting on February 3, the officials said.  The backbone of the measures will be the compiling of a manual  for the procedures and creation of a database for bidding  information, they said.    Hosokawa will present the measures to U.S. President Bill  Clinton when they meet on February 11. The latest steps will  cover all the government's procurements of goods, but not  services.    The subcabinet-level committee, which held its first meeting  in August 1985, was set up to handle trade issues that require  cooperation and cordination among ministries and agencies.</p>

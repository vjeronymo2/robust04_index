			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Management: Saints and sinners - How to achieve an ethical balance in business operations Most commentators accept that commercial life is increasingly hedged around with choices about profits and ethics. But while the debate on how an individual's standards are formed has been under way for centuries, how can organisations sensibly develop an ethical position? The diagram alongside shows how US academics Eric Reidenbach and Donald Robin, professors of marketing at the University of Southern Mississippi, have established a sort of moral pyramid to demonstrate the range of corporate attitudes. European companies, too, can use this theoretical model as a basis for dealing with ethical issues. It is important to note that a multi-divisional company may occupy several stages at the same time, and companies may also regress from higher to lower levels. At the base are the amoral or 'ethically challenged' companies, none of whom, one suspects, will be reading this. They are around strictly for the short term, and are characterised by 'winning at all costs'. Obedience is valued and rewarded and there is little concern for employees other than their value as an economic unit of production. The ethical climate of a stage one organisation can be summed up by phrases like 'they'll never know', 'everybody does it', and 'we won't get caught'. At the heart of this organisation is the philosophical conviction that business is not subject to the same rules as individuals and that there is no set of values other than greed. At stage two are the legalistic organisations. They obey the law, though ethical concerns are judged on the basis of adherence to the letter if not the spirit of it. No breach of law often means no breach of ethics. 'If it's legal, it's OK and if we are not sure, have the lawyers check it out,' typifies the legalistic approach. Economic performance dominates evaluations and rewards. A legalistic company's code of ethics - if it exists - would be dominated by 'don't do anything to harm the organisation' statements. Some legalistic companies have no ethics code, and do not accept the necessity. Often they see little purpose in expressing explicit ethical standards, and indeed some feel any such statements could lead to difficulties and complications. Most stage two companies would leave ethical concerns aside until they become a problem; only then would they consider remedial action. This ignores two crucial points. First, all organisations have ethical standards even if they are not explicit. Some things are seen to be acceptable, others are not. However, when there is no consistent understanding and application of those standards the inevitable result will be internal, and ultimately external confusion. Second, waiting for a problem to occur is not sound management practice. And the consequences can be very serious, particularly in terms of risk to reputation. As never before, the media and others are now sensitive to ethical breaches. It is increasingly unlikely that ethical transgressions will go unnoticed. Remember the nostrum: 'News is what someone somewhere doesn't want to see in print, anything else is advertising'. Stage three contains the responsive companies. Managers in this category understand the value of not acting solely on a legal basis, even though they believe they could win. Although a reactive mentality may remain, it is coupled with a growing sense of balance between profits and ethics. Nonetheless, the basic premise still may be a somewhat cynical 'ethics pays'. Management begins to test and learn from more responsive actions. A responsive company's ethics code would reflect a concern for other stakeholders, but additional ethics support vehicles, such as hotlines, are less likely to be found. Reidenbach and Robin describe stage four companies, somewhat controversially, as 'emerging ethical'. A better term might be 'ethically engaged'. Managers have an active concern for ethical outcomes: 'We want to do the 'right thing'.' Values are shared across the organisation. Ethical perception has focus but may still lack organisation and long term planning. Ethical values in such companies are part of the culture. Codes of ethics are action documents, and contain statements reflecting core values. A range of ethical support measures are normally in place, such as ethical review committees; hotlines; ethical audits; and ethics counsellors or ombudsmen. Problem solving is approached with an awareness of the ethical consequence of an action as well as its potential profitability, and pains are taken to uphold corporate values. For example, the European region of a leading international chemical company surveys staff understanding of corporate ethical standards and acts on any dissonances. Most progressive European companies would, one suspects, see themselves as stage three or four. At a minimum they do have ethics codes aimed at all stakeholders. They recognise that ethics comes from the inside out, and that a mission statement, for instance, is not the same as an ethics code. They are not blind to the promotional advantages of high ethics in the 'caring '90s' but they understand that without employee commitment, any form of ethically orientated marketing may be at least meaningless or at worst, counterproductive. Stage three and four companies also accept that their code of ethics is a starting point - any code not monitored and enforced rapidly becomes a dead letter. One leading UK bank has put in place a range of instruments for enlisting staff commitment to its code, including ethics hotlines and regular assessment of code effectiveness. Lastly, stage five represents what the researchers call the ethics organisation. Here there is a total ethical profile, with carefully selected core values (and an approach to hiring, training, firing and rewarding) which reflect it. The answer is not to attempt to turn staff and companies into saints, but rather to strike a suitable ethical balance in business operations, to minimise reputational risk.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Through the methodology outlined above, the Agency analyzed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the cost implications of waste management alternatives involving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste minimization in today's rule. The analysis shows that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is a potential savings of $25 million per year quantifiable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in comparing current management practices to waste minimization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities which could be implemented. The Agency presents the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost impact of today's rule as a range from $0 to $25 million per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year, representing the cost savings possible through waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimization activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In performing the waste minimization analysis, the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> focused on specific process for two industries for which data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were available. This approach allowed the analysis to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detailed in nature, providing a close examination of facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance alternatives. However, in doing so, the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes it has underestimated the potential savings due to waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimization. In addition, the Agency has not attempted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address any further source reduction, waste minimization, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> innovative technology development which may result from today's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> d. Economic Impact Results  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> For the 14 companies with non-commercial, or captive,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> landfills that receive the company's waste (from the TC Survey),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only one company would have a ratio of incremental compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost to cost of operations greater than one-half percent; all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other facilities would experience even lower economic impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting from today's rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since no costs are associated with the treatment standards for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coke by-products, no economic impacts are expected. Based on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ratio analysis of incremental cost to total sales, none of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chlorinated toluene generating facilities is expected to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experience significant impacts as a result of the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> e. Benefit Estimate Results  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The benefit estimates for today's rule include both reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in risk to human health, as well as incremental cost savings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cost savings are estimated for the Universal Treatment Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (UTS), cost savings resulting from changes to the hazardous waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recycling exemptions. Human health benefits are estimated for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cancer and non-cancer risks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, there are some benefits which the Agency has not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attempted to quantify which are potentially attributable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> today's rule. For example, the Agency has not attempted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantify any potential non-use value benefits from protection of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resources through treatment of hazardous wastes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, the risk analysis performed by the Agency for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> today's rule does not account for many other potential benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from today's rule. Ecological risk reduction from treatment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes under today's rule has not been quantified. Nor do the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency's air and groundwater benefit estimates account for karst  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terrain, complex flow situations, or other factors which could contribute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to underestimates of benefits. These unquantified benefits are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed at greater length in the regulatory impact background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document for today's rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> i. Universal Treatment Standards Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The Agency's analysis of the cost impacts realized due to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Universal Treatment Standards requiring/allowing a change in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment technology from that required under the existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards produced a cost savings of approximately $100,000 per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year. The only wastes for which the Agency found that the UTS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards required/allowed a change in treatment were the cyanide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency received a number of favorable comments on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adoption of the UTS standards. These commenters stated that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> UTS would allow them to save much more in operation costs than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Agency has quantified in the above analysis. One commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that they would save approximately $366,000 annually and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1736 hours per year in manhour savings associated with the UTS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for F024. And another commenter stated that they would save  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately $740,000 per year as a result of the UTS. A more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thorough description of these cost savings is shown in the Regulatory Impact Analysis background document developed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> today's rule, which has been placed in the Agency's docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> ii. Hazardous Waste Recycling Exemption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The analysis performed by the Agency for the cost impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with the recycling exemption for K069 produced a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> savings of approximately $2 million per year. A detailed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> description of the cost savings for K069 is shown in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Impact Analysis background document developed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> today's rule, which has been placed in the Agency's docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> iii. Results_Groundwater Pathway  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> This section presents results for the baseline and post-regulatory risk analyses. For each case, results for individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cancer and non-cancer risk are presented for both high end (i.e.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 90th percentile of the distribution) and central tendency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i.e. 50th percentile of the distribution) risk estimates. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section concludes with population risk estimates for cancer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The results, presented in full in the RIA background document  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which is included in the docket for today's rule, show that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> central tendency cancer risk estimate is expected to be zero.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The high-end individual cancer risk is 4 &times; 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> ^7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . For the post-regulatory scenario, EPA assumed that all constituents would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treated to universal standards. For the post-regulatory case,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the central tendency risk estimate is zero, and the high-end risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimate is 3 &times; 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> ^6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Using the distribution of individual risks, the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculated baseline and post-regulatory cancer population risks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on these assumptions, EPA estimates the baseline population  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cancer risk to be 0.24 cases per year in the central tendency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The post-regulatory population cancer risk is about 0.02 cases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per year in the central tendency. In other words, the regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option reduces 0.22 cases per year in the central tendency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the non-cancer risks, the analysis shows that the 99th  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentile baseline exposure level is less than the reference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dose, using central tendency assumptions. The population risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimates show 2000 people, in the central tendency scenario, who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are exposed to non-cancer risk above the threshold.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are a number of limitations to the groundwater pathway  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis. The timeframe to which these benefits are attributable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> begins 30 years following promulgation of the rule. The analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not account for any existing regulations which would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mitigate risks from groundwater (e.g., Clean Water Act). In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, one of the wastestreams which contributes a large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proportion of the groundwater population risk is made up  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primarily of PCBs, which are not expected to migrate any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appreciable distance in groundwater. The DAF used in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis was calculated based on drinking wells being within one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mile of the facility, and was not adjusted to accord with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population estimates used in the analysis which are based on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two-mile distance. The DAF distribution is not constituent-specific and accounts only for homogeneous flow situations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> iv.

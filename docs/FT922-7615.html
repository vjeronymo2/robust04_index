			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Letter: The Archbishop, shareholders and re-thinking the purpose and standards of business Sir, Charles Handy ('Priorities and purposes at the heart of capitalism', May 12) ignores shareholder behaviour in his analysis. Shareholders invest because they expect a competitive return. If 'more and more companies are . . . putting customers and employees ahead of shareholders in the pecking order', it is to be expected that their shareholders will sooner or later realise that they are receiving less than the market rate, and will switch their holdings into companies where shareholder interests are given more weight. The remark 'now . . . that the investing institutions own two-thirds of the equity of British business . . . they must become guardians (though not owners)' seems to hanker after the cosy corporatism of the Heath-Wilson era. The priority in widening the benefits of capitalism should be to encourage the break-up of these grotesquely large holdings and their distribution among small investors, such as company employees.

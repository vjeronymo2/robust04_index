			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENDPAPERS: OXFORD FOR COMPANY, CAMBRIDGE TO GUIDE  </P> <P> Call it, if you like, the Battle of the Two Margarets: Drabble took the field  first, with the 1985 fifth edition of "The Oxford Companion to English  Literature"; enter now Atwood, with the late 1988 first edition of "The  Cambridge Guide to Literature in English." Actually, Margaret Atwood only  contributes the foreword to the Cambridge book, which has been edited by Ian  Ousby; Margaret Drabble is Oxford's Ousby. But call it the Battle of the Two  Margarets anyway.  </P> <P> Now then, which Margaret wins?  </P> <P> Let the two thick volumes fall open to the middle. They are about the same  size. Cambridge's 1,109 pages are fewer but a bit larger than Oxford's 1,155.  Both, for the record, are bound well enough and printed on good enough paper  that they do indeed fall open and lie quietly at the page the reader is  consulting. On this last point, Cambridge gets the nod, but not by much.  </P> <P> With both books open in the middle, try a few sample mid-book entries in  Cambridge:  </P> <P>  -- Le Guin, Ursula, the distinguished author of "anthropological" science  fiction, resident in Northern California: 36 lines.  </P> <P>  -- Le Sueur, Meridel, the early radical feminist writer, who began in New  York, living in a commune with Emma Goldman, but did some of her most important  writing in Hollywood: 28 lines.  </P> <P>  -- Magic Realism, a school of writing mainly identified with South American  writers, above all with Gabriel Garcia Marquez: 80 lines.  </P> <P>  -- Malouf, David, one of Australia's most serious novelists and poets: 43  lines.  </P> <P>  -- Maltz, Albert, the late playwright and screenwriter, whom many would call  the most talented of the Hollywood 10: 20 lines.  </P> <P>  -- Mamet, David, younger American playwright, author of "American Buffalo" and  other works: 14 lines.  </P> <P> What does Oxford have to say of these? With the exception of Magic Realism, a  phrase it says was coined by Franz Roh in 1925 for an exhibit of  post-Expressionist German art and only later used to characterize a current in  Latin American literature, Oxford has no entries on any of these.  </P> <P> And yet, from the same middle section, one may easily compile a list of Oxford  entries unmatched by Cambridge, among them: Maeterlinck, Maimonides and  Mandelstam.  </P> <P> How to explain this difference? Oxford is the revision of the original  "Companion," edited by Sir Paul Harvey in 1932. Margaret Drabble explains a key  regard in which she continues Harvey's approach:  </P> <P> "The coverage of foreign authors has been dictated largely by Harvey's own  criterion; they are included 'as matter of allusion in English, not on any  scale of merit which would satisfy students of those literatures.' A few have  made their way on merit alone, but most have been treated in the context of  English literature. In the entries for American authors, emphasis has been  placed on Anglo-American connections and responses: The selection for  contemporary American authors has been partly guided by British appraisals,  which sometimes differ considerably from those current in the United States,  although indisputably major figures have been included as a matter of course.  There has been no attempt to provide comprehensive coverage of Commonwealth  literature, although many individual new entries have been added."  </P> <P> It is important to note that this criterion dictates not just exclusions but  also inclusions, such as that of Maeterlinck, Maimonides and Mandelstam, none  of whom is from England, America or the Commonwealth.  </P> <P> The Cambridge approach is strikingly different, as editor Ian Ousby explains:  </P> <P> "This volume aims to provide a handy reference guide to the literature in  English produced by all the various English-speaking cultures. Its scope thus  extends beyond the United Kingdom and Ireland to represent also the U.S.A.,  Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Africa, India and the Caribbean. . . . Because  of this very broad range, it has been necessary to restrict the consideration  of non-English literature which sometimes creeps into such guides." Or as  Margaret Atwood a bit more exuberantly puts it: "Perhaps we should say 'the  English languages,' since, being a viral organism, English has mutated,  producing many variants which share its main characteristics but which have  diverged to become species recognizable in their own right. Thus novels by, for  instance, William Faulkner, Chinua Achebe or Anita Desai may contain words and  even grammatical constructions which are foreign to readers from the British  Isles; American English may sound strange to an Australian, West Indian English  to a Canadian; yet each of these 'Englishes' can be read by any English  speaker, who, by virtue of common ground, is in a position to make at least an  educated guess at understanding."  </P> <P> The Battle of the Two Margarets is thus a draw. For the reading of the  literature that was written in English during the centuries when the influence  of other European literatures on English writers vastly exceeded that of other  literatures in English, Oxford is a boon companion. For the reading of the  literature that is being and will be written in the newer, non-European  English-speaking cultures, Cambridge is an indispensable and indeed a  path-breaking guide. Oxford, at $35, is a bargain. Cambridge, at $39.50 -- not  a new edition but a completely new work -- is an even better bargain. Buy both,  or at the very least, insist that your local library do so.  </P></p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee pact deadline extended THE DEADLINE for negotiations on a new coffee pact was extended by three months from December 31 as talks in London drew to an inconclusive close yesterday. However, prices on the world markets were rising yesterday, mainly because other factors had emerged to push the International Coffee Organisation negotiations to the sidelines. The rise in New York began on Monday as traders returned from an extended Thanksgiving Holiday. The March arabica contract rose through resistance levels to close 2.65 cents ahead at 73 cents a lb on Monday, and continued upwards yesterday, trading at 75.55 cents near the close. In London the January robusta contract rose close to the Dollars 1,000-a-tonne level. Ms Judy Ganes, analyst with Merrill Lynch, said that two weeks ago if traders had returned from holiday to read reports of an impasse at the ICO the price would have turned down. The extension to the deadline had bought more time, but in addition the mood of the market had changed, she suggested. Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London brokers, said the main reason behind the rise was technical tightness, with traders surprised at the slowness of Brazilian marketing. The 1992-93 crop had been forecast to be between 18m and 22m bags, and had come in at 19m bags. 'People who had been cynical about the forecasts suddenly realised they were genuine,' said Mr Eagles. In addition the Colombians had delayed January export registrations and Central American crops were running late. European roasters were thought to be short of coffee, and while stocks are high, they were in strong hands, said Mr Eagles. Certified stocks of coffee for delivery on to the New York market also fell for the first time for months this week, although by only 8,321 bags to 5.318m bags. The ICO last night agreed to meet again at the end of January. One London trader described the past 10 days of talks as 'mildly positive as they were not negative'.</p>

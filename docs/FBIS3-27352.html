The conference was held by the provincial party committee  and  government. Its major tasks were to summarize and introduce  Shandong's experiences in sports work gained in the past few  years and to discuss the major plans for developing Shandong's  sports work in order to upgrade its level of competitive sports  and build Shandong into an advanced province in sports as soon  as possible.    Jiang Chunyun said in his speech: Like other work,  Shandong's sports has also yielded notable results over the past  few years. Compared with advanced provinces, however, there is  still a large gap, which is manifested conspicuously in the slow  pace in upgrading the level of competitive sports, the failure  in emphasizing key sports, too small a number of outstanding  athletes, especially first-rate ones, the small contributions to  the state, the outdated concepts on sports, the weak sense of  competition, the weak scientific and technological forces  related to sports and the lack of personnel, inadequate  investment in sports, and the lack of complete and extensive  necessary sports facilities. We should give in-depth reflection  over this issue, unify our thinking, and have great  determination to promote our sports undertakings as soon as  possible.    Jiang Chunyun pointed out: Developing sports is a  long-cherished strong desire of the people of the province.  Shandong totally has the conditions and ability to promote  sports. It has no reasons, whatsoever, to fall behind. Based  on the requirements on sports work put forward at the sixth  provincial party congress, we have defined a strategic target of  building Shandong into an advanced province in sports and  ranking it among the strong provinces in sports in seven years.  Shandong's sports work for the present and for some time to  come should be dominated by reform, focused on competitive  sports, and led by the endeavor to achieve technological  progress. It should learn from the advanced experiences at home  and abroad, seize the opportunity to bravely conduct  explorations, go all out to catch up with others, and blaze a  new road for sports development with Shandong's characteristics  as soon as possible.    Jiang Chunyun emphasized: Strengthening leadership over  sports work is the basic guarantee for attaining the strategic  target of building Shandong into an advanced and strong province  in sports. Party committees and governments at all levels across  the province should regard sports as an important component of  the socialist modernization drive, include it on their agenda,  and study and resolve the issues on sports reform and  development. The province, as well as prefectures and counties,  should establish the leadership responsibility system at every  level, enhance their work, implement specific measures, and  promote sports work in a realistic manner. Leaders should be  held responsible in the localities where sports cannot be  promoted for long periods. From now on, achievements in sports  work should be taken as a criterion for appraising party and  government leaders at all levels. We should be willing to send  competent personnel to work in sports departments, increase  investment in sports undertakings, formulate and implement  sports standards and plans, and strive to build Shandong into an  advanced province in sports and rank it among the strong  provinces in sports.    Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee and governor of the province, also spoke at the  conference. Vice Governor Wu Aiying read the decision to  commend the personnel who had made contributions to the seventh  national games and advanced units. Responsible persons of the  provincial trade union council, the provincial women's  federation, the provincial commission for physical culture and  sports, and the work committee of the organs of the provincial  government also read the decisions to commend the personnel and  units who had achieved outstanding results at the seventh  national games.    Han Xikai, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee, chaired the conference. Attending were Lu Maozeng,  chairman of the provincial committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference; Ma Zhongcai and Miao Fenglin,  vice chairmen of the provincial people's congress standing  committee; and Ma Changgui, special adviser to the provincial  government.</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Barclays to implement offer BARCLAYS BANK is to implement a pay deal for 70,000 employees averaging slightly more than 3 per cent - the lowest among the big four in recent years - in spite of union opposition, Michael Smith writes. The implementation of the increase on Monday signals a tougher line by the banks on pay and conditions. The Barclays pay package will be implemented in spite of a ballot concluded yesterday by Bifu, the financial services union, which showed a majority of members in favour of industrial action. Members of the Barclays Group Staff Union have voted against the pay offer and are being consulted by their leaders on whether they want to vote on industrial action. In spite of the union votes, it is extremely unlikely that there will be industrial action. Bifu agreed that the ballot majority was small.</p>

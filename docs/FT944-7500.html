			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Tate &amp; Lyle Tate &amp; Lyle is difficult enough to understand at the best of times; yesterday's decision to present less detailed segmental information is a retrograde step. The move may be justified commercially, but it will hardly help Tate dispel investors' doubts about the quality of its earnings. These have long been viewed as vulnerable to swings in the commodity-like markets in which Tate operates. That said, the swings in the last financial year worked decidedly in shareholders' favour. Pre-tax profits were at the top end of analysts' expectations and the dividend was up by a generous 10.8 per cent. But with the shares up 18 per cent against the market this year, and a 20 per cent yield premium to the market converted to a small discount, this kind of earnings performance has already been anticipated. The question now is the extent to which the profits momentum can be maintained in the current year. The pointers are good. The favourable supply/demand equilibrium in north American and European starch and sweetener markets seems set to continue. There is likely to be a modest recovery in the US sugar market. Elsewhere in the group there is ample scope for loss elimination - for example, at recently acquired Orsan - and for cost-cutting. Healthy cash-flow will enable Tate to pursue further acquisition opportunities and pay a substantially higher dividend. Tate will remain a core holding, notwithstanding the greater obscurity of its accounting.</p>

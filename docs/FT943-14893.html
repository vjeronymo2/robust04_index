			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of France (1): A revolution in a state of slow motion  -Mr Balladur is carrying on with labour, tax and welfare reforms and privatisation, but full economic recovery may not come in time for the presidential election next spring France is still in a state of slow motion, before the burst of activity that will come with next May's presidential election and the French presidency of the European Union from January 1 nest year. This impression of slow motion derives in part from the economy, recovering only very gradually from the 1993 recession, and in part from the current division of power between the lame-duck Socialist president, Francois Mitterrand, and the cautious conservative Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, a division that militates against bold policy moves. But there is also the picture of the various presidential rivals, at this stage only circling around, each determined to be ready for the final sprint towards the Elysee but not wanting to be seen to jump the gun. However, one dramatic change in the line-up has occurred, with Mr Michel Rocard being removed from the Socialist starting-block after his poor showing in the preliminary heat of the June 12 Euro-election. The man chiefly responsible for spiking him on the Euro-track was Mr Bernard Tapie, the maverick populist whose Energie Radicale list gained more than 12 per cent of the Euro-vote - only a couple of percentage points behind the Socialists, who dropped to their lowest electoral level since the 1960s. The Socialists' awful performance, plus the fact that the new Socialist leader, Mr Henri Emmanuelli, is not a serious Elysee runner, has had two contradictory knock-on effects on France's governing conservatives, who won nearly 80 per cent of seats in the 1993 parliamentary election. The first has been to increase the number of presidential hopefuls on the right, making them believe that almost any conservative could beat a socialist for the Elysee. For instance, despite his low public rating these days, ex-President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the centre-right UDF federation, refuses to rule out that he might seek to re-occupy the office he left 13 years ago. Socialist weakness has also given Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the RPR Gaullists, fresh hope that, after failing to win the presidency in 1981 and 1988, he might be lucky the third time. But the possibility that the Socialists might eventually field Mr Jacques Delors, after he returns to France at the end of this year from his decade in Brussels, introduces an element in Mr Balladur's favour. It is far from sure that the outgoing European Commission president will respond to the entreaties of the 'Draft Delors' movement among the Socialists; apart from anything else, he would want to avoid a disastrous electoral flop which might jeopardise the career of his daughter, Mrs Martine Aubry, a rising star in the French socialist firmament. But if he threw his hat in the ring, Mr Delors is the one Socialist who, according to the polls, would come near to beating Mr Chirac in the final run-off presidential race. In the endless opinion polls by which the French constantly take their political temperature, only Mr Balladur still appears to outdistance Mr Delors. That is his trump card in his increasingly acid rivalry with his former patron, Mr Chirac, to carry the conservative colours into battle next year. Mr Balladur's moderate Gaullism and consensual nature fits him better to compete with Mr Delors, a centrist socialist, for the vital middle ground of French politics. For precisely that reason, Mr Balladur is almost more popular in the UDF than in his own RPR party. These two parties reflect a cleavage that goes back to the Revolution, with RPR 'Jacobins' who believe in a strong central government and the UDF 'Girondists' who believe in a more decentralised system and economic liberalism (always a relative term in France). It is therefore unlikely that Mr Balladur, even as president, could ever bring them together in a single unified conservative party. But from the day he became prime minister of a government with 16 UDF ministers and only 13 ministers from his own RPR ranks, Mr Balladur has been clearly angling for UDF endorsement for his presidential candidacy. And he will probably get it, at least from the UDF's largest constituent party, the Republicans. This party has itself been split by the highly successful campaign that one of their number, Mr Philippe de Villiers, ran on an anti-Maastricht ticket in the European Parliament elections, winning Euro-seats for himself, Sir James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French financier, and 11 others. But, in general terms, the Republicans are increasingly restive under the nominal tutelage of Mr Giscard d'Estaing, who has himself drifted closer to the Christian Democrats within his federation, because they are more in tune with the ex-President's strong pro-Europeanism. In French presidential races, party labels are never very important anyway. The Elysee is won on a candidate's ability to act as a rassembleur, or builder of coalitions. The run-up to a presidential election, therefore, is generally considered not the right time to launch bold new initiatives. And Mr Balladur has no quarrel with this conventional wisdom, because it accords with his own innate caution. Mr Balladur has had his caution reinforced by two policy blunders over the past year. To most foreigners, neither initiative seemed very daring, but both triggered an explosive domestic reaction. At the turn of the year, the government passed a bill allowing local authorities the possibility of meeting some of the capital expenditure of private schools. (Under a long-standing concordat between church and state, the latter pays almost all teacher salaries of private schools.) Fearing this would end in neglect of state schools, several hundred thousand demonstrators took to the streets. The government backed down. Exactly the same pattern was repeated later over a government law, allowing employers the possibility of paying young apprentices less than the so-called Smic national minimum wage provided they spent the saving on training. There followed uproar from the unions, street protests by students, silence from cowed employers - and Mr Balladur finally said that he would pursue his aim of trying to price young people into jobs by paying employers a direct subsidy to hire them. Part of the problem lies in France's ineffectual parliament, where measures are nodded through, leaving the real debate for the streets. In a classic gaullist response, RPR leaders such as Mr Chirac and Mr Philippe Seguin (ironically, president of the National Assembly) propose putting measures to combat unemployment to a referendum. The upshot is that Mr Balladur resembles a man walking on eggs as he continues his 'reforms'. Privatisation has slowed down, partly because the stock market's state is not propitious for new flotations but also because he does not want to tangle with the unions, who remain strong in state companies such as Renault. To French capitalism's long term detriment, the much mooted creation of capitalised private pension funds has been put on ice, for fear of alerting people to the inadequacies of the state pension system and alarming them. Only in fiscal and macro-economic policy does Mr Balladur seem to be plugging on with his original aims. His goal is to see the budget deficit decline from FFr 320bn last year to FFr 301bn this year, to FFr275bn next year. If realised, this will be a considerable achievement, given that he is also reducing social payroll charges on the lower-paid to try to stimulate employment. It will also require nerve, given the temptation to loosen budget strings in an election year. His end-game is to get the deficit down to 2.5 per cent of gdp (nearly half the present ratio) by 1997, to preserve for France the option of being able to join any European monetary union created then.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "cs": "Austria's Problems Can Be Solved </F> Better Within the EU"]    [Text] Linz -- A majority of 60 percent of Austrians  believe "that Austria will in the future be better able to solve  its tasks as a member of the European Union [EU]." A total of  38 percent represent the opposite thesis. This is the result of  an opinion poll carried out by the Market opinion research  institute in April for the Europe Barometer of DER STANDARD.    According to the poll, younger Austrians are particularly  confident: A total of 65 percent of those under 30 believe that  Austria's interests will be well looked after in the EU; the  results are similar in the higher education and income groups.    Even among declared followers of the Freedom Party of  Austria  [FPOe], a 54-percent majority holds the view that Austria could  solve its problems better within the EU. Among farmers,  however, the opinion continues to predominate that Austria  should not join the EU.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Phaisan Sicharatchanya and Saritdet Marukhathat: "More </F> Than a Goodwill Visit"]    [Text] Bilateral Thai-Korean trade issues and regional  security are expected to dominate official talks between Prime  Minister Chuan Likphai and South Korean leaders during the Thai  premier's official visit to Seoul beginning today.    The agenda of the Thai side is clear: of the US$2.3 billion  worth of two-way trade in 1993, Thailand suffered a US$1.2  billion deficit and this deficit is expanding as a result of  growing Thai imports of South Korean automobiles. So one of the  key missions of the Thai delegation is to negotiate for larger  South Korean imports of Thai products.    "For a country that now ranks as the eighth or ninth largest  trading partner of Thailand, the level of knowledge and interest  in South Korea from the Thai side has been minuscule," said a  senior Thai diplomat based in Seoul.    Unlike the deep-rooted relations between Thailand and other  major diplomatic and trading partners in Northeast Asia, such as  Japan and China, there has been far fewer exchanges between  businesses and educational institutes in Thailand and South  Korea. As such, Thailand knows or understands little about South  Korea.    The Thai side is not to be blamed entirely, however. It took  four years for the South Korean side to hold what was supposed  to be an annual, rotational meeting of the two countries' trade  ministers. Following numerous delays, the meeting was finally  held in Seoul last August and it is Thailand's turn to host the  meeting this year.    All this could change for the better as a result of Mr.  Chuan's visit. The prime minister brings with him about 10  ministers responsible mainly for trade and investment plus a  small delegation of Thai businessmen.    "The visit underscores Bangkok's recognition of South Korea  as an important trading partner," said Surachai Sirikrai,  director of Thammasat University's Institute of East Asian  Studies.    "This should pave the way for more Korean investors to set  up  business here instead of in Indonesia, which is one way of  easing the trade imbalance," he added.    In ASEAN, Indonesia has been preferred by South Korean  investors partly because of its abundant natural resources and  partly because they want to avoid stiff competition with  Japanese businesses that are already well-established in  Thailand.    Outside ASEAN, major South Korean corporations such as  Hyundai, Daewoo and Ssang Yong are actively investing in  Indochina, especially Vietnam, where they enjoy the same head  start as other foreign investors and even a competitive edge  over the Japanese.    The Thai emphasis on expanding economic ties will certainly  appeal to South Korean leaders, who are not only intent on  improving bilateral relations with Thailand but also on grander  schemes.    South Korean President Kim Yong-sam made clear in an  interview with the Bangkok Post that he wanted Thailand to serve  as a base for South Korean businesses venturing into Indochina  and Burma.    He also held out hope for the dynamic economies of both  countries to work jointly in leading economic growth in the  Asia-Pacific region.    Judging from those statements, it is clear that Seoul is  adopting a foreign-policy strategy similar to the Japanese as  far as its relationship with Thailand is concerned.    Former Japanese prime minister Kiichi Miyazawa, during his  Bangkok visit in January 1993, also proposed a Japanese-Thai  partnership to undertake the task of helping to rehabilitate the  Indochinese economies.    In sum, Seoul is placing a greater emphasis on both economic  and diplomatic relations with ASEAN. And just as South Korea  sees itself as the centre of Northeast Asia, it also regards  Thailand as its strategic partner in ASEAN.    Seoul also sees itself playing an important role within the  broader framework of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  (APEC) forum. South Korea is chairman of APEC's Trade and  Investment Committee, which is one of the few institutionalised  bodies in the regional grouping.    "As a dialogue partner of ASEAN on one side, and enjoying  close economic linkages with North America on the other, we want  to serve as the bridge between AFTA (ASEAN Free Trade Area) and  NAFTA (North American Free Trade Area)," said Assistant Minister  for Foreign Affairs Choi Dong-chin.    The US is South Korea's biggest trading partner, taking  one-third of its exports. Though ASEAN ranks fourth in terms of  trade, it is South Korea's second-largest investment partner  after the European Union.    Economic issues aside, the Thai and South Korean leaders  will  discuss measures to enhance cooperation on regional security.    In fact, security matters are topmost on the minds of the  South Koreans. This is hardly surprising in light of the  South's preoccupation with the North's suspected nuclear weapons  development programme.    Asked what specific issues he would raise for discussion  with  Mr. Chuan, President Kim responded: "First of all, we will  focus our attention on how our two countries should pull  together to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, which is  threatening the security of not only this region but also of the  entire world..."    As part of its diplomatic lobbying for international backing  to force North Korea to halt its nuclear weapons programme,  Seoul intends to solicit Thailand's support for sanctions  against Pyongyang.    Bangkok has all along maintained a low-key stance on the  Korean nuclear conflict, apparently preferring to leave the  issue to the major global powers to resolve. But the Thai  Government is on record as saying that it would go along with  any sanctions resolution adopted by the United Nations Security  Council.    However, the prospect of imminent sanctions has now been  momentarily blunted by North Korean leader Kim Il-song's pledge  to freeze the North's nuclear programme plus his offer to hold  the first-ever summit meeting with his southern counterpart.  These messages were conveyed to former US president Jimmy Carter  during his recent visit to Pyongyang.    Nonetheless, measures to resolve the nuclear dispute on the  Korean peninsula will still feature highly in talks between the  Seoul leaders and Mr. Chuan.    The South Koreans are attaching much importance to next  month's meeting in Bangkok of the ASEAN Regional Forum. The  last thing they want is to fight another Korean War with the  North. Hence they are placing high hopes on the forum to evolve  into a venue for addressing vital regional security matters such  as arms control and preventive diplomacy.    "We'd like to actively participate in the Southeast Asian  security forum," said Assistant Minister Choi. "We want to  defuse potential conflict and promote confidence-building  measures."    In the final analysis, Seoul wants to develop an economic  and  diplomatic partnership with Thailand so that both countries can  help promote growth and security in the Asia-Pacific region.    Given such high expectations, South Korean officials say Mr.  Chuan's visit will be more than just a goodwill trip.</p>

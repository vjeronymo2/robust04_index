			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / UK Company News: Chelsea offers Cabra up to Pounds 13m for Bridge owner CHELSEA Football Club has not given up its fight to stay at Stamford Bridge, even though the deadline for paying Pounds 22.85m to buy the west London ground is only two days away. It is understood that negotiations have been going on which could involve Chelsea offering Cabra Estates, the heavily-indebted property company, up to Pounds 13m for the subsidiary that owns Stamford Bridge. Cabra has an 83.5 per cent stake in SB Property, which owns the near 12-acre ground. If SB's net assets are Pounds 30m, that stake would be worth about Pounds 25m. Chelsea's argument would run that amounts should be deducted from that Pounds 25m for a loan from SB to Cabra and for the stake that SB has in Vincenza, owner of Fulham FC's ground at Craven Cottage. The amount left for Chelsea to hand over in cash to Cabra could be Pounds 10m to Pounds 13m, although no information is forthcoming on where that money might come from. It has been described by Chelsea's connections as 'an elegant solution'. It would reduce Cabra's debts of about Pounds 52m, clear the way for Fulham FC to move to Stamford Bridge and end outstanding litigation. But Mr John Duggan, chairman of Cabra, said yesterday it had received no offer. The two merchant banks - NM Rothschild for Cabra and MacArthur for Chelsea - had been in touch, but no direct negotiations were taking place. Mr Duggan, who returns today from a skiing holiday in Colorado, insisted that Stamford Bridge would be worth more than Pounds 22.85m with vacant possession. That figure, demanded of Chelsea, arises from a contract that has been confirmed by the High Court and the Court of Appeal. The issue is complicated by the recent purchase of a 29.6 per cent stake in Cabra by Mr Ken Bates, Chelsea's chairman. His Pounds 3m investment, through a company called Vanbrugh, has enabled him to call for an extraordinary general meeting, which would be held by mid-May. One of the EGM proposals is to oust Mr Duggan as chairman and Mr Andrew Mackay, the Conservative MP for East Berkshire, as a non-executive director.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno from the "Union Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Text] Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom has described  the rumor mill as a criminal tactic to undermine the country's  prestige abroad and the calm of citizens. He noted that the  rumor mill has been active these past few days, and that even  the health of President Rafael Caldera has been questioned.    Escovar Salom gave no information on the inquiry conducted  on  a destabilization plan that includes this chain of rumors but  termed them sources of unrest that seek to crumble the public's  support for the Caldera government. He insisted this thing about  the bogeyman is no cliche, but rather a conspiracy that involves  a manipulation of the public and in no way is related to social  unhappiness or protests over the water shortage.    [Begin Escovar Salom recording] Some people have made the  absurd assertion that I want to explain the social crisis by  blaming the bogeyman. I never said that. You are the first to  know that is not so. You clearly heard what I said. The social  crisis, which the government acknowledges, the economic crisis,  and severe difficulties the country is experiencing is one  matter. The manipulation and tactics by some sectors that have  an interest in heightening the crisis and seeking other goals is  another matter. That is what these sectors are trying to do. The  events that took place over the weekend are clear proof that my  remarks were serious and justified. I mean the rumor campaign.  This rumor mill is criminal. I mean all these announcements of  the future of the bolivar, devaluation, and alleged financial  and fiscal measures the government is purportedly going to take.  [end recording]    Commenting on the resignation of some members of the  cabinet,  Escovar Salom said any decision on the matter falls solely  within the purview of President Caldera. On another matter, the  Interior Minister commented on the border dispute between Merida  and Zulia States. He noted this problem must be handled with  utmost caution and prudence.</p>

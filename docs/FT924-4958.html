			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Spaniards to insist on all of Maastricht treaty WHEN Mr John Major, UK prime minister, arrives in Madrid he will be firmly told that he is killing the Maastricht spirit. Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the premier who led Spain into the European Community in 1986, will also tell Mr Major that he is determined to keep the Maastricht flame alive at the Edinburgh summit. The Madrid talks are likely to be the toughest facing the UK premier in his pre-summit tour of Community capitals. 'Major has introduced a whole set of uncertainties over European union,' a senior aide to Mr Gonzalez said. 'We stand four-square behind what was agreed at Maastricht. We are very, very firm on this.' Mr Gonzalez's platform has three planks: that the Community's budget should be appreciably increased; that the richer partners should increase their contribution to the budget; that the poorer partners should progressively receive more in order to catch up. This is essentially the basis of the so-called Delors II EC budget package agreed at Maastricht and it boils down to north-south transfers in the form of cohesion funds. While the Spanish government accepts that recession will introduce some limits on Community spending it insists that these must be minimal and that convergence must demonstrably remain as the life-force of the Brussels budget. It views Mr Major's budgetary proposals as a blatant attack on the economic cornerstone of European Union and all the more sinister since they are made by a partner that has delayed its ratification of the Maastricht treaty. Mr Gonzalez is likely to refuse any compromise on Community enlargement unless there is a more generous approach on cohesion funds. What most deeply irritates the Gonzalez government is the manner in which the EC's northern tier, which is the net contributor to the Community budgets, views the poorer Mediterranean rim, together with Ireland, as 'begging bowl' partners. Mr Gonzalez's long experience of leadership, and Spain's ranking as by far the richest and biggest economy of the Community's less developed members, makes Madrid the most articulate spokesman of the convergence process that would erode economic imbalances that lie at the heart of the European Union ideal. 'Spain may be net a recipient now but in 5 to 10 years' time it could be a net contributor,' says Mr Carlos Alonso Zaldivar, the head of the Madrid government's policy planning unit. 'What the UK and the richer members forget is that we provide the markets that fuel EC growth.' Spain has narrowed its gap with the Community's northern tier - between 1985 and 1991 its per capita gross domestic product rose by 6.4 points to 79.2 per cent of the EC average - although EC funds flowing into Spain in the past six years have averaged only 0.3 per cent of the Spanish GDP. In contrast Community transfers to Greece and Ireland over the period have represented 3 per cent and 5 per cent of their respective GDPs. In the meantime, Spain's trade balance with the EC, which accounts for 70 per cent of Spain's exports and 60 per cent of its imports, has deteriorated sharply since joining the Community. A 1986 deficit of Pounds 935.9m in trade with the EC had grown to Pounds 7.9bn by 1990. Mr Major received a taste of Spanish feelings at last Friday's 'conclave' of EC ministers in Brussels. Mr Carlos Solchaga, the Spanish finance minister, said that Mr Major's package was 'not even rhetorically a compromise proposal'. According to Mr Solchaga, 'nobody who wanted to demonstrate that the spirit of Maastricht remains alive would have made such a proposal.'</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALLENDER'S GETS NEW AD AGENCY TO AID IMAGE  </P> <P> Marie Callender's, which says "Hello, Good Pie" on its billboards, said hello  to a new ad agency on Thursday and goodby to its old one.  </P> <P> The family-style restaurant chain handed its projected $3-million annual  advertising account to the Los Angeles agency Kresser/Craig. Losing the account  was the Santa Monica agency Suissa &amp; Associates, which said that blow was  softened somewhat by its win Thursday of the estimated $2.5-million ad business  for the Sports Connection health club chain.  </P> <P> For Marie Callender's, which began as a Long Beach pie shop in 1948, the move  is part of an overall attempt to update its image and separate it from other  family restaurants. "As we move into the '90s, we will try to distinguish Marie  Callender's from the rest of the crowd," said Neil Narhoff, the Orange-based  chain's client director of marketing.  </P> <P> That may take some doing. Industry analysts say family restaurants continue to  lose customers to fast-food outlets as well as to the expanding deli sections  at neighborhood grocery stores.  </P> <P> Even within its own category, Marie Callender's has recently begun to struggle.  "Marie Callender's is over the hill in terms of being a hot concept," said John  Hollingsworth, a Laguna Hills restaurant industry consultant. "They're an  upgraded coffee shop."  </P> <P> Certainly, that's not what the new agency thinks. "It's a wonderful name that  everyone knows," said Robert Kresser, chairman of Kresser/Craig. "Our first  task will be to re-establish in the minds of consumers how valid Marie  Callender's is as a restaurant for today." Kresser, whose agency also creates  ads for Daihatsu America and Atlantic Richfield Co., said Marie Callender's  "will become a far more aggressive advertiser."  </P> <P> Some industry analysts contend that the problems at Marie Callender's have  little to do with its advertising. They said the chain has built some very  costly units at high-rent locations -- forcing it to charge relatively high  prices for its food.  </P></p>

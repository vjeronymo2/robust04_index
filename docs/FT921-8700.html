			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Opec unable to agree on oil production cut A THIRD day of tense talks by ministers from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries failed to yield an agreement on cutting production and boosting oil prices. Saudi Arabia had presented various proposals aimed at achieving a cut in output to 22.5m-23m barrels a day (b/d) from the current 24.2m b/d. Mr Hisham Nazer, its oil minister, spent most of Thursday night closeted with colleagues from the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Algeria to formulate a proposal that would be acceptable to all members. But talks foundered yesterday on Mr Nazer's insistence that his country keep its one-third share of Opec output. Mr Nazer said the kingdom had offered to cut output by 500,000 b/d, which would keep production above 8m b/d, but other producers wanted an even bigger fall. The kingdom is sensitive about the political implications of asking some of the smaller producers to share too large a part of the burden. Countries such as Venezuela and Algeria are constrained by political instability at home and are under intense pressure to boost oil prices while keeping as big a market share as they can. However, Saudi Arabia is unwilling to yield its huge market clout and appears intent on forcing other members to accept this. With the oil price dropping more than Dollars 4 since November, Opec members are prepared to haggle over every barrel of production. Any allocation of production levels is likely to be more closely allied to capacity than in the past. Some producers are believed to be unhappy that this could set a new course for Opec away from any form of production quotas linked to historic output. The oil market is watching for any signal that can give a direction to prices. But a cut of some 1.5m-1.7m b/d is unlikely to have a big effect on prices. Mr Homoud al-Rqobah, Kuwait's oil minister, commented that a cut to 22.5m b/d would push prices up but not to the target price of Dollars 21. 'If they cut production so that actual output is in the area of 23m b/d oil prices are likely to continue trending sideways,' said Mr Michael Rothman, senior energy futures analyst at Merill Lynch. 'If a credible agreement is reached to cut production to 22.5m b/d, oil prices could drift upwards but not dramatically.' Oil prices fell on the news of Opec's disarray and the futures price on the New York Mercantile Exchange dropped 30 cents to Dollars 19.40 a barrel.</p>

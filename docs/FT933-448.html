			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / The Labour Party Conference: What they had to say 'I don't want Labour MPs sitting on the green benches of Westminster fighting for a four-day week for themselves and recommending a seven-day week for miners.' Arthur Scargill, NUM president 'Let's put socialism back on the agenda.' Dennis Skinner 'I gather John Major has decided to take a fresh look at employment rights. He's finding out what it's like to be at the mercy of a particularly ruthless employer - the Conservative party. Perhaps even at this late stage he may decide that the Social Charter is a good thing after all.' John Smith 'Let's go back from conference and raise the stakes. Together we can shunt this discredited Railways Bill back into the sidings for good, and that's where it belongs.' Jimmy Knapp, RMT leader 'Mr Smith set out to meet a trade union wish list - minimum wage, guaranteed trade union recognition, a strikers' charter of new rights for unions, a politically correct list of legislation.' Sir Norman Fowler, Tory party chairman 'I don't think I should be too hard on John Major. He is beginning to understand what his party's made of. He has discovered that members of his cabinet are - let me put this more delicately than the prime minister - of doubtful parentage.' John Smith 'I hope and believe he (Mr Smith) will win this week. I hope nobody can misinterpret that in any way at all.' Margaret Beckett, deputy leader</p>

			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> A'S ECKERSLEY MAKES IT EXCITING -- FOR A CHANGE  </P> <P> That Dennis Eckersley recorded his 16th save in as many chances is not as  remarkable as how he did it.  </P> <P> The Oakland A's top relief pitcher gave up a ninth-inning run and almost issued  his first walk in 46 2/3 innings but held on to save the Athletics' 4-3 victory  over the Kansas City Royals on Friday night in Kansas City.  </P> <P> "I felt all right going in there, but I didn't feel that good when I came out,"  Eckersley said. "I made it tough."  </P> <P> Eckersley went to a 3-and-0 count on Kevin Seitzer before retiring him on a fly  ball for the second out in the ninth. Eckersley has not issued a walk in his  last 163 batters, and it became important when Kurt Stillwell doubled and  scored on Gerald Perry's single, only the second run off Eckersley in 19  appearances this season.  </P> <P> Oakland Manager Tony La Russa said Eckersley, who saved a game for the third  day in a row, would not pitch tonight.  </P> <P> "Eckersley said he felt fine -- he's very honest," La Russa said. "Every one of  our relievers will speak up when they're not right. We're playing for the long  haul. Being a hero is a losing proposition. Eck's outstanding. In this game  nothing's automatic, but he is amazing."  </P> <P> So are Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire, who homered on consecutive pitches in the  first inning.  </P> <P> After a one-out single by Carney Lansford off rookie Kevin Appier (1-1),  Canseco hit his 19th homer, a drive that hit halfway up the left-field foul  pole and increased his major RBI total to 49.  </P> <P> McGwire hit the next pitch for his 13th homer and a 3-0 lead.  </P> <P> Milwaukee 7, Toronto 1 -- Teddy Higuera, who missed his last start after being  struck on the knee by a line drive, held the Blue Jays to a run and four hits  in six innings in Toronto, and Paul Molitor drove in three runs as Milwaukee  regained first place in the American League East.  </P> <P> Higuera (5-1), making his first start since May 21 when he was hit on the right  knee by a line drive hit by Seattle's Henry Cotto, struck out six and walked  one.  </P> <P> Boston 4, Cleveland 3 -- Doug Jones, the major league leader with 17 saves,  failed for only the second time this season when Boston scored two runs with  two outs in the ninth inning in Cleveland.  </P> <P> The Indians had taken a 3-2 lead in the bottom of the eighth inning on Brook  Jacoby's RBI single, and Jones (0-2) retired the first two batters in the  ninth. But Dwight Evans singled and pinch-runner Randy Kutcher scored on a  triple by Tony Pena. Mike Greenwell singled Pena home.  </P> <P> New York 4, Baltimore 3 -- Dave LaPoint pitched 7 2/3 strong innings to end a  five-game Yankee losing streak for the third time this season, and Steve  Balboni homered in the sixth inning to break a 2-2 tie in New York.  </P> <P> Chicago 2, Minnesota 1 -- Pinch-hitter Carlos Martinez, batting only .195,  singled home the winning run with two outs in the ninth inning.  </P> <P> Steve Lyons and Ron Karkovice singled off reliever Terry Leach (2-1) with one  out. After Scott Fletcher popped out, Martinez batted for Craig Grebeck and  delivered his game-winning hit.  </P> <P> Detroit 9, Seattle 7 -- Cecil Fielder remained tied with Canseco for the major  league home run lead with 19 by hitting his first career grand slam and driving  in five runs as the Tigers broke a five-game losing streak.  </P> <P> In Seattle, the Mariners got a grand slam and five RBIs from Jay Buhner, who  played his first major league game of the season after recovering from a  severely sprained ankle.  </P></p>

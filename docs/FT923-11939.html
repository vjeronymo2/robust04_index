			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / International Company News: Roche posts interim sales gain ROCHE, the Swiss pharma-ceuticals group, has reported a 19 per cent increase in sales to SFr6.6bn (Dollars 5.03bn) for the first half of 1992 and forecast 'a considerable improvement' in profits for the full year. Extracting distortions from currency conversion, the sales growth was 14 per cent. Roche said the acquisition of the Nicholas over-the-counter medicines business last year added about SFr140m to first-half sales, while last year's disposals removed roughly SFr60m. The 23 per cent growth in sales by the pharmaceuticals division to SFr3.5bn was due to strong gains of existing drugs - including Rodcephin, an antibiotic, Roaccutane, an acne drug, and Dormicum, a hypnotic - and to acceptance of new products - such as Neupogen, a drug for reducing the side-effects of chemotherapy, Aurorix, an anti-depressant, and Inhibace, which lowers blood pressure. Sales of non-prescription medicines also increased, and the group predicted the new Roche Nicholas over-the-counter business would achieve sales of SFr1bn in the full year. Sales of vitamins and fine chemicals jumped 19 per cent to SFr1.6bn, and the US service laboratories contributed significantly to the 17 per cent rise in the diagnostics division sales to SFr800m. Sales of fragrances and flavours were up 10 per cent to SFr723m, even though the fragrances market was stagnant.</p>

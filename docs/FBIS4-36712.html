			<p>BFN     [Text] Task forces will be constituted beginning today to  tackle the ongoing insurgency problem in the seven northeastern  states of the country. This was decided in a meeting between  Mr. Rajesh Pilot and the chief ministers of Assam, Meghalaya,  Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and the governor of  Manipur in New Delhi this evening. Talking to Doordarshan  correspondent V. Mira, the minister said that the situation will  be reviewed after three months with the chief ministers of all  seven states.    [Begin recording] [Mira] How do you view the law and order  situation in the northeastern states?    [Rajesh Pilot] Well, today we had the meeting with all the  honorable chief ministers of the northeast states. We had  reviewed the situation. We had reviewed the implementation of  these decisions and also we took further steps after reviewing  the situation. What is further needed, we have also decided on  those lines and I have requested them to go very hard way  against the insurgents and their activities and what all help  could be given from center. I have totally offered them that  center is totally with them to curb the insurgency in  northeastern region of our country. I feel that Assam, Manipur,  Nagaland -- these are the three states which are slightly under  a high pressure of insurgency at the moment. [end recording]</p>

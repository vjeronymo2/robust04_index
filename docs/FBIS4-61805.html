			<p>BFN     [Text] Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar has instructed the  Foreign Ministry to demand from the Russian Foreign Ministry  clarification concerning Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's 6 May  anti-Estonian statement. The prime minister hopes that the  Russian defense minister's statement represents his personal  stance and not the official standpoint of Russia. The Estonian  prime minister expressed hope that the Russian Foreign Ministry  will refute Grachev's irresponsible and (?tension-creating)  statement. In Mart Laar's opinion, the statement by the Russian  minister of defense may increase (?a dangerous threat) to  Estonian independence and sovereignty.</p>

			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: SAVE THE PLANET 750 EVERYDAY WAYS YOU CAN HELP CLEAN UP  THE EARTH BY DIANE MACEACHERN (DELL: $9.95; 210 PP.)  </P> <P> In celebration of Earth Day (which is today, in case the Book Review happens to  be the reader's first exposure to the media in the past week), publishers are  releasing a flotilla of books (see also Just Released in Paper, Page 8) that  offer practical advice for cleaning up our acts, our homes, our communities,  our cities, our planet. But don't lament the felling of trees for the sake of  this competition; these books are far less redundant than the garden variety of  copycat publishing. While the actual advice proffered may overlap, the tone  varies considerably, and, happily for the ecological movement, there seems to  be an approach to suit every possible environmental offender, a description  from which none of us are exempt.  </P> <P> Diane MacEachern's "Save Our Planet" is a bouncy, energetic compilation of  ideas designed to be implemented easily in any family. The short-entry style of  presentation is combined with lots of graphics -- charts, boxes, lists -- so  that there are absolutely no pages merely gray with text. This approach won't  tax even the shortest attention span. Far from talking down to her audience,  however, the author writes with great directness, simplicity and economy, as if  to say that some issues are too important to clutter up with either technical  jargon or cutesy PR talk.  </P> <P> MacEachern's introductory chapter, "The Planet in Peril," is an excellent  concise introduction to the major threats to the environment. (The author has  served the Earth Day 1990 team as national communications consultant and  formerly worked with Sierra Club in the same capacity.) The 750 ideas for  cleaning up the planet are divided into areas where the plans can be put into  practice: in the home, in the garden, at school, at the office, at the  supermarket, on vacation. The text is punctuated with inserted tips under such  labels as "Bright Ideas"; the book is not without humor, either, witness the  corresponding category, "Not Such a Bright Idea."

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters argued that withdrawal rates are an academic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> matter and should not be subject to Federal regulation. Other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters questioned the basis for the standard. Some stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their belief that an institution's withdrawal rate has nothing to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> do with the administration of the Title IV, HEA programs. A few  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters said review of withdrawal rates fell within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purview of accrediting agencies; others asserted it was no longer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary for the Secretary to review withdrawal rates as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SPREs and accrediting agencies will have specific criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relating to completion and placement rates. Others simply said  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they could see no basis for using 33 percent as a standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Quite a few commenters supported the use of withdrawal rates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in assessing administrative capability, albeit as an indicator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rather than an absolute. One of the commenters believed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> language in current regulations was sufficient to allow the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary to make administrative capability determinations. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter supported the proposed regulation, as written. Others  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> had no problem with the use of a 33 percent rate as an absolute,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided that students who register, but never show up, are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the calculation. One other commenter said the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rate was too high.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For many years, the administrative capability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations have provided for the use of withdrawal rates in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excess of 33 percent as an indicator of impaired administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capability. The Secretary notes, therefore, that the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withdrawal rates as a determining factor in the evaluation of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's administrative capability is not new.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary does not accept the argument of some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters that withdrawal rates are not an appropriate measure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of administrative capability. On the contrary, the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finds that withdrawal rates are a clear measure of administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capability as they are a function of overall institutional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance and the information and support services that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution provides to its students and prospective students.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary expects that an institution that has good  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> admissions procedures and administers the ability-to-benefit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions properly will have a lower withdrawal rate than one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which admits students who cannot benefit from the program either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because they lack the academic ability or do not receive adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support services. An institution that provides proper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disclosures, such as the institutional and financial assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information required to be provided to students and prospective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students under subpart D of these regulations, and in the case of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution that advertises job placement rates as a means of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attracting students, data concerning graduation and employment,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and applicable State licensing requirements, as required in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program participation agreement in &sect;668.14(b)(10), will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing information necessary for prospective students to make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> informed decisions. The Secretary believes that if prospective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students receive adequate and accurate information, they will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drop out of an institution in great numbers. Further, if an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution provides the financial aid counseling required in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;668.16(h), the Secretary expects that students are not likely to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withdraw because of a lack of understanding about the financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resources available to them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In sum, an institution that provides students with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comprehensive, accurate information on the institution and its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs, thereby enabling prospective students to make informed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decisions about applying to the institution, screens students  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequately from the outset to determine that the student can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefit from the program selected, and provides adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> counseling to students who apply for Title IV, HEA program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance is expected to have a withdrawal rate below 33  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary notes further that students who withdraw may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be eligible for a refund, especially now that more stringent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refund policies have been set forth in these regulations at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;668.22. Were an institution to have a high withdrawal rate, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> follows that an institution might experience difficulty complying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the refund requirement. By questioning the administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capability of an institution with a high withdrawal rate, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary can monitor compliance with the refund requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary also believes withdrawal rates are related to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> default rates in the FFEL and Federal Perkins loan programs in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that students who withdraw are more likely to default. By  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dealing with institutions that have high withdrawal rates, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary hopes to reduce dollars lost due to default in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary agrees that the withdrawal rate calculation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should not include students that complete registration procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> but never begin classes. Similarly, the Secretary agrees that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student who receives a 100 percent refund (less any allowable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative fee) should not be counted for the purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this calculation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary agrees with the commenter who wrote that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withdrawal rates are a function of overall institutional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance and the support services that are provided to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students. The Secretary believes that transfer students, high-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk students, and students who withdraw for other reasons are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accounted for by allowing up to 33 percent of the students to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withdraw from the institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This provision is amended in &sect;668.16(l) to provide for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of net enrollment figures, after deduction of students who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were entitled to a 100 percent refund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters objected to this proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that an institution must not otherwise appear to lack  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ability to administer the Title IV, HEA programs competently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the grounds that it is redundant and too open-ended. They  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended that it be removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This paragraph contains language that is in current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. Obviously, should the Secretary find it necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to invoke this paragraph in support of an action, the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would provide the affected institution with detailed information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that supports the determination that the institution lacks the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability to administer the Title IV, HEA programs competently.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.17&blank;Default Reduction Measures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Default rates. Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of commenters suggested that any institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a cohort default rate above 20 percent should be allowed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeal its cohort default rate because that is the minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard for punitive action against an institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are varying types of appeals offered to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions depending on their cohort default rates. An  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution which has default rates above the thresholds for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation in the FFEL programs may appeal on the grounds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that: (1) The calculation of the rate was erroneous; (2) it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfies the criteria for exceptional mitigating circumstances;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or (3) the calculation included loans which due to improper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicing or collection resulted in an inaccurate or incomplete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculation of the cohort default rate. Institutions with cohort  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defaults above 20 percent for the most recent year may challenge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the calculation of the rate based on allegations of improper loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicing. In addition, an institution which receives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisional certification based on a default rate above 25  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent over a three year period also can show that it meets the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria for exceptional mitigating circumstances and should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive full certification under the appropriate regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. For further information on this provision, see the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Analysis of Comments and Changes  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> that addresses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards of administrative capability (&sect;668.16). Thus,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions with rates above 20 percent have a significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity to challenge their cohort default rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

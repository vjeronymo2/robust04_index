			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SWITZERLAND'S FINANCIAL ROLE SAID ON DECLINE  </P> <P> This country's role as an international finance center is declining, the  chairman of the Zurich stock exchange said.  </P> <P> "Earlier statistical observations, made honestly but with a grain of salt, that  Zurich is the world's fourth-largest financial center behind New York, Tokyo  and London have dwindled into silence," Nicolas Baer said at a news conference  announcing the exchange's annual report.  </P> <P> Baer cited a trend toward greater economic and political stability as robbing  Switzerland of its reputation as the world's haven for wealth.  </P> <P> "When one considers the flow and volume of capital in the international  financial world, one can only consider a financial investment in Switzerland as  a secondary investment," Baer said, urging that Switzerland make stock  ownership easier for foreigners.  </P></p>

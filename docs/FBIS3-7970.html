			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Urban Planning, Civil Engineering,  Transport, and Ecology today received a letter from the relevant  bodies of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] saying that,  as of 2 March, airplanes belonging to the majority of Macedonian  airlines will be banned from overflying Yugoslav territory.  This refers to Palair-Macedonia [Macedonian flag-carrier],  Vardar-Air, Macedonia-As, Avio-Impex, Meta, and Falcon. The  reason for the ban, as the letter says, is the huge outstanding  debt for the servicing of these airlines' overflights.    We have learned from our ministry that contact with Yugoslav  bodies was established; they were called on to postpone the  implementation of the decision by at least one month in order to  enable the companies to repay their debts.    The letter also says that the same measure was applied to  airlines from Bulgaria and Turkey that have incurred arrears in  payments.</p>

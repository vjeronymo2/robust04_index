The anti-logging activists had planned to interfere  with loading of logs aboard a ship bound for Japan, but the vessel sailed a day  earlier, port officials said. Environmentalists are planning widespread  anti-logging activities in coming months, designated Redwood Summer by Earth  First! organizers.  </P></p>

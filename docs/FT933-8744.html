			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / International Company News: Thomson edges ahead to Dollars 78m for second term THOMSON Corporation, the Canadian-controlled travel and publishing group, yesterday reported a slight improvement in second-quarter earnings, but cautioned that a true picture of its 1993 performance would only emerge later in the year. Net earnings rose to USDollars 78m, or 13 cents a share, from Dollars 70m, or 12 cents, a year earlier. Six-month earnings for both years were Dollars 23m, or 3 cents. Second-quarter sales dipped to Dollars 1.47bn from Dollars 1.53bn, largely reflecting weaker sterling and, to a lesser extent, the Canadian dollar. The travel division's operating earnings edged up to Dollars 31m from Dollars 30m, excluding Dollars 3m of interest income this year, down from Dollars 7m in 1992. The company said, however, that earnings for the year would largely be determined by results for the high-season third quarter. Apart from the weak pound, Thomson painted an encouraging picture of prospects for the travel business. Demand for summer 1993 holidays appeared 'approximately in line' with available capacity, and 'excessive' discounting on brochure prices was unlikely. Thomson Tour Operations' summer bookings are 14 per cent ahead of last year. Winter bookings are 23 per cent up, partly due to an earlier launch of the programme. The fortunes of the publishing and newspaper interests are mixed. Earnings at Thomson's UK regional newspapers are 'well above' last year, due to rising advertising revenues. But advertising lineage in North America was down 4 per cent in the first half, including a 7.2 per cent drop in Canada. Circulation was also slightly lower. However, Thomson said sagging revenues were more than offset by lower costs, and that both profits and margins improved. Professional publishing earnings have been dented by competitive pressures in tax and legal publications and by the impact of the US government's review of pharmaceutical advertising in medical magazines. Nonetheless, the information and publishing group's operating earnings rose to Dollars 78m in the second quarter, from Dollars 75m a year earlier.</p>

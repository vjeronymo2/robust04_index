			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. A. Sabirzyanov, D. V. Oparin, G. I. </F> Pilipenko, and F. F. Gavrilov, Ural Polytechnic Institute imeni  S. M. Kirov, Yekaterinburg; UDC546.34+541.44]    [Abstract] Luminescent lithium (deuterium) hydride could  possibly be used as a neutron scintillation detector, since it  is assumed to be highly efficient in detecting neuron  scintillation and in being highly sensitive to _g_-radiation.  Also, the simplicity of the lithium hydride structure  facilitates its fundamental study. LiH luminescence was first  detected in samples activated with magnesium. Later, studies  were made with lithium hydride activated with mercury-like ions,  although the nature of the mercury-like coloration sites in  LiH(LiD) has not yet been established. Luminescence of  palladium-group ions in lithium (deuterium) hydride has not yet  been observed. In the present work single crystals of LiH(D):Ru  were grown and their luminescence spectra studied for the first  time. The spectra displayed features related to the structure  (progression along a valent local fluctuation of hydride ions in  the doped center) and fluctuations of the base lattice. A  qualitative simulation of the luminescence site is presented.  Figures 2; references 10: 7 Russian, 3 Western.</p>

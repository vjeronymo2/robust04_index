			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Processors and importers should identify in their written  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plans only those safety hazards that are reasonably likely to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occur, rather than every conceivable hazard no matter how  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> theoretical or remote. This view is in keeping with NACMCF's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendation that firms conduct a hazard analysis and then give  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no further consideration to hazards that are unlikely to occur  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ref. 34, p. 189). FDA has tentatively concluded that processors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and importers should not be required to establish controls and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regularly monitor for hazards that are highly unlikely to occur  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the absence of those controls. If, for example, chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contaminants have never been found, or have only been found in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amounts significantly below levels of public health concern in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species from a particular location, processors and importers need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not identify chemical contaminants as a hazard that must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled for that fish.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As indicated earlier in this preamble, FDA intends to issue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a guidance document that will cover possible environmental and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing hazards for fish and fishery products as well as types  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of controls that can be applied to those hazards. The agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anticipates that it will update that guidance periodically as new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controls (or new hazards) are identified or established.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA cannot reasonably expect processors and importers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exercise controls for hazards that are beyond the scope of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current scientific knowledge. The agency does expect processors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and importers to demonstrate that they are taking precautions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are reasonable in light of available information, and that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they are adopting new controls as those controls are developed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and accepted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, the controls for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Vibrio  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> bacteria in raw  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> molluscan shellfish, which can cause serious illness and death in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain at-risk populations, are the subject of continuing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> research at FDA and elsewhere. Short of a complete ban on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harvesting, there is no known control that would prevent the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presence of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Vibrios  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in molluscan shellfish. Moreover, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> infectious dose, that is, the number of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Vibrios  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause illness, is unknown. Because these bacteria occur  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> naturally in the environment and are ubiquitous, controls that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are employed to prevent sewage-related viruses from entering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> molluscan shellfish are not relevant to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Vibrios.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is known,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, that proper temperature controls from the time of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harvest onward can at least limit the growth of these bacteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ref. 49). FDA believes that such controls are reasonable and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be applied now. (In fact, temperature controls have long  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been a feature of the National Shellfish Sanitation Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (NSSP).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the hazards listed in proposed &sect;123.6(b), pesticides and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drug residues (proposed &sect;123.6(b)(1)(iv) and (b)(1)(v)) are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forms of chemical contaminants (proposed &sect;123.6(b)(1)(iii)) but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are listed separately because they can be of special concern in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aquaculture-raised species. These fish generally have a greater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likelihood of being exposed to agricultural run-off than wild  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ocean stocks (Ref. 50, pp. 11 and 12). Aquaculture-raised fish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are known to be fed drugs for various purposes. Drug residues in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> edible tissues can be a public health concern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Decomposition, listed in proposed &sect;123.6(b)(1)(vi), is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> known hazard in those species that can generate scombrotoxin when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they decompose; otherwise, it is regarded as a quality problem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Parasites (proposed &sect;123.6(b)(1)(vii)) are not a hazard if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> killed during cooking but can be a hazard in finfish consumed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> raw, unless that fish is commercially frozen. Unapproved direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and indirect food and color additives (proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;123.6(b)(1)(viii)) are a potential hazard with most any food. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

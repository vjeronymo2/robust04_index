			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / International Company News: Time Warner operating gain TIME WARNER, the US media group, yesterday posted a 10 per cent gain in second-quarter operating income, before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to Dollars 673m. The improvement, on the back of a 6 per cent rise in revenues to Dollars 3.3bn, reflected strong profits from each of Time Warner's five divisions - music, publishing, filmed entertainment, the Home Box Office (HBO) pay-television unit and the cable operating subsidiary. Time Warner tries to get Wall Street to focus in its EBITDA figures because its results are muddied by its debt burden and heavy non-cash amortisation charges. Although the company is taking steps to restructure its debt, it posted a second-quarter net loss of Dollars 80m against net income of Dollars 9m a year earlier. At the per-share level, the company had a loss of 22 cents in the latest quarter against a loss of 40 cents the previous year. Time Warner's publishing business posted an operating profit of Dollars 105m before interest and depreciation, compared with Dollars 88m a year earlier. The music division had Dollars 136m of operating profits before interest and depreciation, compared with Dollars 126m. The filmed entertainment business had record earnings before tax and depreciation of Dollars 105m, against Dollars 101m a year ago. The company said US box office revenues were led by the films Dave, Made in America and Dennis The Menace. HBO also had a record second quarter, achieving operating earnings of Dollars 57m, compared with Dollars 53m, before interest and taxes. Time Warner's cable television business turned in a record earnings before interest and deprecation of Dollars 270m, up from Dollars 244m the previous year, reflecting an increase in the number of subscribers and continued growth in advertising and pay-per-view revenue. For the first half, Time Warner had earnings before interest, taxes, appreciation and amortisation of Dollars 1.3bn on revenues of Dollars 6.5bn, compared with EBITDA of Dollars 1.17bn on revenues of Dollars 6.1bn a year earlier. The group suffered a first half net loss of Dollars 95m, against net earnings of Dollars 12m. On a per-share basis, Time Warner recorded a first half net loss of 55 cents against a net loss of 80 cents a year ago.</p>

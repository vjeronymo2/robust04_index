			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEY, THAT'S FUNNY, MIKHAIL -- NOW DID YOU HEAR THE ONE ABOUT. . . .  </P> <P> After a day at the Russian Federation Congress that had gone his way and half  an hour of friendly chatting with reporters and Russian lawmakers, Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was in a jovial mood.  </P> <P> Told that entrepreneurs were selling jokes about him for a hefty profit, the  Soviet president was moved to mention that he had heard a good one lately --  but could not tell it because there were women in the crowd crushed around him.  </P> <P> "We give our permission," one said authoritatively.  </P> <P> "You permit it?" Gorbachev said.  </P> <P> Then he hemmed and hawed a moment, and recited:  </P> <P> "President Mitterrand has, they say, 100 lovers, and one has AIDS, but he  doesn't know which one.  </P> <P> "President Bush has 100 bodyguards, and one of them is a terrorist, but he  doesn't know who it is.  </P> <P> "And Gorbachev has 100 economists, and only one of them has any brains, and he,  too, doesn't know which one."  </P> <P> He paused for a moment, to let the laughter subside.  </P> <P> "I liked that one," he said.  </P></p>

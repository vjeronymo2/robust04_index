			<p>BFN     [Text] San Salvador, 10 May (ACAN-EFE) -- A former  Salvadoran guerrilla organization said today that, with Ernesto  Perez Balladares' victory in the Panamanian presidential  elections, that nation's civilian society "reaffirms its  conviction of the defense of national values."    Sigfrido Reyes, of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation  Front (FMLN) International Relations Secretariat, told ACAN-EFE  that, with the victory of Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD),  "Panamanians have issued a clear message to those inside and  outside that country who proposed a revision of the  Torrijos-Carter Treaties signed in 1977.    Reyes added that Perez Balladares' victory on Sunday "is an  important sign that will have positive effects on the  correlation of democratic forces in Central America." He added  that the PRD's triumph was inspired in the "ideals, values, and  nationalist views of General (Omar) Torrijos, who struggled for  many years to restore the country's autonomy, particularly  damaged by the canal treaties which gave the United States  absolute control over the zone.</p>

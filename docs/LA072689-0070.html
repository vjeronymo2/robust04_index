			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> U.S. OLYMPIC FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BRAY WINS GOLD ON SPLIT DECISION  </P> <P> John Bray knew what he wanted to do and he knew what he had to do.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the two didn't coincide.  </P> <P> Bray wanted a knockout. What he got was a split decision and a U. S. Olympic  Festival gold medal in the 201-pound division.  </P> <P> And at the end of three rounds, he felt fortunate enough to have that. Bray,  who fights out of Van Nuys, defeated Javier Alvarez of Austin, Texas, 3-2, in a  decision that was greeted unenthusiastically by a crowd of 6,632 at the Myriad  Exhibit Hall.  </P> <P> Neither fighter was particularly impressive at any stage of the fight. Bray,  who ran his record to 76-8 with 50 knockouts, was most effective in the second  round, when he circled Alvarez and scored with jabs.  </P> <P> That strategy was in stark contrast to the way he started the fight -- by  throwing roundhouse punches in search of a quick knockout.  </P> <P> "He was trying to take me out," said Alvarez, a 27-year-old veteran of more  than 300 amateur fights. "We he found out he couldn't do that, he played it  smart.  </P> <P> "It was a close fight, and he deserved it. He was working harder than me."  </P> <P> Said Bray: "I got away from my game plan. He made me lose my composure. He got  me upset and I let emotions take over the fight. I let ego come into play. I  should have fought three rounds like I fought the second."  </P> <P> Bray's victory avenged a 5-0 decision he lost to Alvarez in the semifinals of  the U. S. Amateur championships. More importantly, it gained Bray a berth in  the U. S. Olympic Box-Off in Concord, Calif., next week. The winner of the  box-off will represent the United States at the world championships in Moscow,  Sept. 17-30.  </P> <P> The Festival champion automatically qualifies for the box-off against a boxer  from his weight category chosen by a selection committee to be "the most worthy  opponent."  </P> <P> Alvarez is expected to be that boxer for Bray.  </P> <P> BASEBALL  </P> <P> Jason Evans of Chatsworth singled and scored a run, but the West dropped an 8-3  decision to the North in its first game of the tournament.  </P> <P> RHYTHMIC GYMNASTICS  </P> <P> Alexandra Feldman, the current national champion, is third in the all-around  standings after two rounds of competition.  </P> <P> Feldman, 18, of Encino, is first in the ribbon event, third in rope, third in  ball and fourth in the hoop standings.  </P> <P> Valencia's Jennifer Haase, 14, is fourth in the all-around, third in hoop,  fifth in ribbon, tied for fifth in ball and tied for 10th in rope.  </P> <P> TABLE TENNIS  </P> <P> Carol Davidson of North Hollywood and partner Jim Butler of Iowa City, Iowa,  won a bronze medal in mixed doubles with a 21-16, 21-15 decision over Dhiren  Narotam of Ames, Iowa, and Kerry Terrel of Richland, Wash.  </P> <P> FAST-PITCH SOFTBALL  </P> <P> Former Burbank high standout Debby Day was the losing pitcher as the West fell  to the South, 1-0, behind the two-hit pitching of Rhonda Wheatley.  </P> <P> Day allowed five hits, struck out three, walked one, and benefited from a  spectacular catch by center fielder Priscilla Rouse, a former Cal State  Northridge standout. Rouse jumped above the fence in the sixth inning to  prevent a home run.  </P> <P> MEN'S VOLLEYBALL  </P> <P> Dijon Douphner of Newbury Park had 26 kills as the South defeated the North,  14-16, 15-7, 15-11, 15-9, in the tournament opener for both teams.  </P> <P> Douphner, a Pepperdine junior, played a key role in defeating a team coached by  Rod Wilde, a Pepperdine assistant.  </P> <P> Coley Kyman, the City 3-A player of the year last season at Reseda High,  started at middle blocker for the North and recorded 18 kills.  </P></p>

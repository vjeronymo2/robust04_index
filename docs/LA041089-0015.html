			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> Nashville police are investigating a theory that the murder of a Cash Box  magazine researcher may have been linked to the manipulation of country music  charts, the Nashville Tennesseean reported Sunday. Kevin Hughes, 23, who  compiled the charts for the magazine, was fatally shot last month on  Nashville's Music Row as he approached his car. Police believe Hughes' attacker  might have been a professional hit man, the newspaper reported, and homicide  detectives are investigating the possibility that Hughes may have been killed  because he knew the Cash Box charts were being manipulated or because he  refused to tamper with them. Police have found no direct evidence linking the  murder to the country music business. Music Row promoter Bill Wence said he had  9 or 10 calls the day after Hughes was killed. "All of them thought he was  hit," Wence told the paper. "I believe that kid was killed because he knew  things about Cash Box." Cash Box charts, along with the more closely watched  Billboard record charts, measure the popularity of records, and high chart  position can mean substantial financial gains for performers and record  companies. George Albert, president and publisher of Hollywood-based Cash Box,  said he did not know why investigators were pursuing possible chart  manipulation. "I can't understand this whole thing. I don't know why the police  or you or anybody else are going into a story that is something that nobody, or  that we, know anything about," Albert told a reporter for the newspaper.  </P></p>

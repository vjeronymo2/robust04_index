			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Japanese market recommended THERE ARE good reasons for putting money into the Japanese market now, believes Mr Hitoshi Ishihara, vice-president of Yamaichi Securities, one of the Big Four Japanese stockbrokers. But he acknowledges that its mood is so bad that few people are convinced. About 100 investors recently attended a Yamaichi seminar: 'We asked them whether they thought it was a good time to invest in Japanese shares and almost 100 people said 'yes'. We then asked them whether they would actually invest and most said 'no'.' Mr Ishihara expects a modest recovery in Japanese equities later this year. 'The change in sentiment will come gradually.' He thinks the Nikkei index of leading stocks, now at 21,291, could fall below the psychologically important level of 20,000 but this is 'unlikely'. Mr Ishihara believes the economy is fundamentally strong, and that investors will try to anticipate recovery. But this is unlikely before the end of March, when many financial institutions close their accounts for the year.</p>

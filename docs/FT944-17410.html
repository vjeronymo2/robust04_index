			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Rover counts up the benefits of surging productivity: David Goodhart assesses the pay deal which may set a motor industry benchmark Since 1992 when Rover Group agreed its 'new deal' - giving workers job security and single status in return for much greater flexibility - it has been hailed as a model for Britain's new co-operative industrial relations. Following yesterday's generous two-year deal - giving up to a 10.7 per cent pay rise over two years - it may also become known as the benchmark for motor industry pay bargainers, at least for trade union negotiators. That role used to be played by Ford - most famously with its 13.4 per cent rise at the end of 1990. But Rover, with its surging output and exports, is now challenging hard. Part of the pay rise is a direct consequence of the 1992 deal. The introduction of single status - the ending of all status distinctions between blue and white-collar staff - was started only in 1992. This pay deal takes it a lot further. Instead of 11 grades - six for white-collar staff and five for manual workers - there will be just three for all staff. The A grade will cover lower skilled manual and clerical workers, with average basic pay of Pounds 284.50 per week. The B grade will cover skilled craftsmen and more qualified white-collar staff such as accounts clerks, with average basic pay of Pounds 311.85. The C grade covers team leaders and design engineers, with an average salary of Pounds 17,957. Different groups receive different sums for agreeing to these changes and some receive nothing at all. But the extra payments for this regrading accounts for the different interpretations of the deal. The company stresses that the 3.7 per cent pay rise in 1995 and 4 per cent (or inflation) in 1996 while the unions insist that for many people the deal is worth 10.7 per cent. Many managers in the car industry are sceptical about the benefits Rover has gained from its new deal. Many more of them - especially in the west Midlands - will be cursing the Rover Group for setting a high-pay benchmark. The current Jaguar negotiations, for example, seem likely to be affected. But whatever the scepticism, Rover can point to some remarkable productivity improvements. At Cowley, Oxford, for example, productivity has increased 30 per cent over the past two years. Overall productivity is up only 14 per cent in that period, but that is partly because of the difficulty in improving productivity at labour-intensive Land Rover. The Rover management can also point to the fact that they are paying wages according to the performance textbook. When the company was in trouble in 1992 it had a six-month pay freeze. Now that it is doing well, it is allowing a pay catch-up. In other words it is pay, rather than jobs, that is taking most of the strain of market fluctuations. Since 1992 the company has stuck to its commitment not to make anyone compulsorily redundant. Notwithstanding that commitment, the company has still had some flexibility, with a reduction of nearly 10 per cent in employee numbers between 1991 and 1993. Since then job numbers have been rising and, unlike many other carmakers, Rover has been taking people on open-ended contracts rather than temporary contracts. One economist with a leading employers' organisation said: 'When productivity is rising as fast as it seems to have been at Rover, then both workers and customers can benefit. In the past in the motor industry productivity deals have either been bogus or most of the benefit has simply returned to the workers with little or nothing going to customers in lower prices.'</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Unctad aims to be more flexible SOME 2,000 delegates from over 150 countries gather this weekend in the Colombian resort of Cartagena de Indias for the eighth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad). While the agenda of the meeting, which runs from February 8-25, is stuffed with worthy development issues, the key topic of discussion will be Unctad's future role. Mr Kenneth Dadzie, Unctad's Ghanaian secretary-general, said yesterday he expected Unctad VIII to pave the way for a more effective, relevant and flexible organisation. Industrialised countries, notably the US, have been highly critical of Unctad in recent years, regarding it along with much of the UN system as anti-western and unproductive. Created in the mid-1960s, Unctad's grand themes strike few chords today. International commodity agreements and price stabilisation provisions have bitten the dust (only that on rubber is still functioning as designed, with doubts whether it will be renewed). The buzz-words now are 'dialogue' and 'study group', one grouping producers and consumer of copper was approved last month. Unctad's major achievement in shipping, the cargo-sharing accord designed to boost developing countries' share of world shipping, applies to 1.5 per cent of world cargo traffic. Developing countries have done better by competing in the market. On trade, the initiative has switched to Gatt, where over 70 developing countries are negotiating in the Uruguay Round of trade talks covering services, intellectual property protection and goods. Suggestions that Gatt might expand its role to police global competition rules could lead to annexation of another Unctad responsibility, restrictive business practices. Finally, Unctad's one-time stress on development through government intervention and import substitution at home and huge transfer of resources from rich to poor internationally finds no echo in the current US-dominated 'new world order'. Thus, for the first time, an Unctad conference will be discussing the crucial development role of domestic policies, 'good management' (including honest government) and political freedoms, with the fashionable theme of sustainable development though environment-friendly growth. Yet neither rich nor poor countries want to see Unctad disappear. It remains the primary UN forum for debate on development in an international context, and a useful umbrella body for the more modest accords on commodities, shipping, insurance and south-south trade now emerging. But to survive, the agency must undergo a radical shake-up in its objectives and working methods. All countries agree that in the past, Unctad has squandered much energy, resources and goodwill in fruitless wrangling over issues of little importance, partly because its confrontational 'block' system obliged industrialised nations and developing countries to speak as distinct groups. In the run-up to the Cartagena meeting, both groups have announced their own demise in favour of forming flexible alliances reflecting diverse country interests. The US and other rich countries favour Unctad turning into an OECD-type organisation concentrating on analysis of development issues, with the emphasis on promulgating lessons from successful developing-country experience. Consensus-building, not just negotiation, should be the aim. Developing countries want a bigger role for negotiations in Unctad and an analytical focus on providing an alternative development perspective to that of the western-dominated IMF and the World Bank. But the basis of agreement at Cartagena exists. For that to be translated into a vigorous future role, Unctad may need changes in style as well as substance. Other UN agencies have, for example, been more outspoken on democratisation and respect for human rights as basic conditions for development. The IMF has weighed in more strongly on the scope for military spending cuts. Mr Dadzie, a career diplomat, has picked cautiously through the ideological minefields since becoming Unctad's head in 1986. Whether he will be rewarded with another stint in office when his current term expires in March will no doubt be the gossip at Cartagena.</p>

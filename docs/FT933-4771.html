			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / International Company News: Australian Woolworths beats prospectus target TWO months after its ADollars 2.45bn flotation on the Australian stock market, Woolworths, the Australian retailer, has posted better-than-forecast profits of ADollars 171.2m (USDollars 114.1m) after tax for the year to June 27. The net profits figure comfortably beats the ADollars 166.3m which the retailer predicted in its share sale prospectus. Yesterday, Mr Paul Simons, chairman, also indicated that the group was 'on target' to meet its 1994 sales and profits forecasts: in the same prospectus, Woolworths estimated that it would see sales of about ADollars 11.3bn in the 1993-94 financial year, and after-tax profits of ADollars 188.5m. Woolworths' profits were scored on sales up by 14.22 per cent to ADollars 10.5bn, with operating profit rising by a similar percentage to ADollars 282.2m. Net profits in the previous year had stood at ADollars 83.8m. Earnings per share were 17.10 cents compared with 8.38 cents previously. The retailer plans to open around 14 new supermarkets in the current year, and plans a capital expenditure budget of approximately ADollars 200m.</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / People: Departures Bill Morrison, deputy senior partner of accountants KPMG Peat Marwick has announced that he is to leave the firm at the end of September this year. Morrison, 55, insisted yesterday that his departure was 'completely amicable' and that he was leaving 'to pursue an alternative career'. He would not say what that would be, but he will remain a consultant to the firm. His departure raises a question over his continuing in the role of chairman of the Auditing Practices Board, the UK's new standards-setting body for auditors, when the current term comes up for renewal, but he says he would be happy to continue. Morrison has been deputy senior partner since KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock was formed in 1987 after the merger between KMG Thomson McLintock, of which he was managing partner, and Peat Marwick Mitchell. He was also president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland in 1984-85, and has been visiting professor in accountancy at the University of Strathclyde since 1983. ***** Barry Prichard has retired from SIDLAW GROUP because he is moving to the Channel Islands. ***** Alex Gibson has left BETT BROTHERS. ***** John O'Donnell has left the APPLEYARD car dealership group. ***** William Thomson has resigned from JESSUPS to pursue alternative business interests.</p>

He was questioned about them by authorities looking for leads shortly  before he died last year of AIDS.  </P> <P> The case was revived when Scott Thorson, the late entertainer Liberace's former  lover, came forward with information while he faced a three-year prison term in  an unrelated case. He was sentenced to three years probation last year.  </P></p>

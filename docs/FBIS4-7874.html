			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jan Forowicz: "On 7 April, Poland Will Submit </F> Motion Requesting Admission to European Union--to the West, Not  Against the East"]    [Text] The forecasts are optimistic. Poland may join the  Western structures of economic cooperation and security earlier  than was predicted by most analysts.    No specific dates have been set yet. However, we can see  phenomena that are not any less convincing than precise  schedules. Integration is clearly faster now. The government  has confirmed its desire to further increase this rate. It  unanimously empowered Prime Minister Pawlak to submit a motion  requesting full membership in the European Union [EU], one of  the most important political establishments of today's world.  <H5>  A Historical Moment </H5>   Also, according to parliament members, if the external  conditions are favorable, this initiative may enable Poland to  achieve a true European character, democracy, and well-being.    They emphasize that such a firm intention to develop the old  and establish new links to the West results from the social  assent as well as from the agreement among politicians on this  issue.    Sometimes it seems that it is all happening in conditions  that are similar to the general agreement and support  demonstrated by Poles in such historical moments as the  regaining of independence after World War I, the bloodless  overthrow of communism in 1989, and the voluntary acceptance of  the burden of the economic reform in 1990.    The fact that our goals were clearly defined and then  presented was important. We have not always been able to act  like this. We should, then, once again recall the sharp words  of criticism spoken in November and December by Lech Walesa  about Western politicians. At that time, the NATO leaders were  still hesitant in their evaluations; they were not sure whether  the issue of admitting Poland to the organization could even be  discussed. After a few months, it became clear that the  criticism of the delay of the West, pointing to its consistency,  is beginning to yield the expected results.  <H5>  Unanimity </H5>   The most important and probably the most valued factor is  the  unanimity of the Polish political forces. At a recent meeting  in parliament with Robin Beard, the NATO deputy general  secretary for defense, Deputy Jerzy Wiatr, one of the leaders of  the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], said that "even those  politicians who look only in the direction of Russia finally  admit that the Polish pro-Western option is right."    He explained that the breakthrough moment was the Moscow  coup. Poland learned a very important lesson from the  developments in Russia: The source that radiates democracy and  the philosophy of dynamic economic progress is still in the  West. Tomasz Nalecz, of the Labor Union, added to these words  that, in the issue of our membership in NATO, we are witnessing  some kind of unique phenomenon in the Polish parliamentary  system.    If we take a look at the plenary sessions of the Sejm  discussing our membership in NATO, we would not see any  differences between the various parties, even though they are  quick to underscore their different opinions and ardently  present controversial issues.   <H5>    A Hand in a Friendly Gesture </H5>   The strategic goal of Poland is the attainment of full  membership in NATO, the EU, and the West EU, says General  Stanislaw Wozniak, director of the Department of Military  Foreign Affairs of the Ministry of National Defense. He also  stresses that our realism in the selection of Western  organizations in which we would like to have our security  structures does not mean that we want to turn our back on our  eastern neighbors.    This is proved by a number of military agreements, signed  first with our neighbors and then with others--in all, 14  states, mostly eastern and southern states. Only recently have  we reached such agreements with the United States and Canada,  and we are planning to conclude them with Sweden and Norway.    Foreign analysts know perfectly well that, in Polish defense  concepts, there is no room for an invasive expansion or attempts  to subordinate other states. The location of the Polish Army  units is no secret, and it proves that we have no aggressive  intentions or that we are grouping our forces in order to attack  any external object.  <H5>  Slavic and Modern </H5>   Similar views about our good relations with Russia and other  neighbors, especially Slavic neighbors on the other side of the  Niemen, Bug, and San Rivers, are expressed by Andrzej  Olechowski, author of the recently announced main points of the  eastern policy. He formulates several programs, based on  partnership and outlining joint action for peace, economic  cooperation, or exchange of experiences useful in the efficient  implementation of democratic reforms.    Minister Olechowski would even be ready to propose "curbing  the pro-NATO trends if the price were," let us say,  "deterioration of the position of the prodemocracy forces in  Russia."  <H5>  Solid Roots </H5>   The opinion that the road to NATO should lead via the EU is  becoming increasingly popular in the concepts of Polish  diplomacy. This opinion is backed by the Sejm Extraordinary  Committee for the European Agreement with Jan Borkowski of the  Polish Peasant Party, Piotr Nowina-Konopka of the Democratic  Union, and Professor Marek Mazurkiewicz of the SLD. The  committee was the first to definitely support the intention of  the head of the Polish diplomatic service; he wanted to obtain  consent from the government to submit a motion requesting full  membership in the EU for Poland.    This committee also issued a positive opinion on the solid  ground that had been prepared for Poland for the so-called  second and third pillar of the Maastricht Treaty. Even though  the first pillar--economic integration--may still seem rather  weak, we can certainly cooperate in the areas of foreign policy,  security, the justice system, and internal order.    All of our initiatives set off these solid foundations of  integration and stress the time factor. The Treaty on the EU  came into effect on 1 November 1993. On 1 February of this  year, Poland obtained the status of a state associated with the  EU. The time span is not very big.    Now the government is showing that we are doing our best not  to allow the distance to increase, or even that we want to  believe that it will be reduced earlier than expected.</p>

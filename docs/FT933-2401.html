			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (4): Everything under one roof - Private banking / The implications of high street banks' entry into a hitherto exclusive sector COMPETITION IS entering the genteel world of private banking, a market increasingly coveted by providers of financial services as a relatively risk-free way of selling services and products lucratively. The high street banks have begun to invade territory mainly at the expense of the traditional private banks. In July, Adam &amp; Co, an Edinburgh-based private bank, was taken over by Royal Bank of Scotland. Earlier this year, Barclays launched a private banking arm in Mayfair, to cater to the investment needs of those with Pounds 500,000 or more in liquid assets. Lloyds' private banking arm, launched in 1985, adopted a different strategy from other private banks by requiring a minimum of only Pounds 75,000 of disposable assets from its customers. 'The attraction of private banking for UK banks such as Lloyds and Barclays is that it is almost exclusively asset management,' said Peter Kinahan, editor of Private Banker International, a newsletter published by Lafferty. 'It does not tie up capital, it is non-lending and is very profitable for the banks which get it right.' Coutts and Lloyds are the two largest players in the UK market. Coutts, perhaps the best-known name in private banking because of its association with the royal family, has Pounds 6bn of client funds under management, while Lloyds has Pounds 4.1bn, according to Datamonitor. Barings, Hill Samuel and Guinness Mahon merchant banks are the next largest players. Private banking originally offered wealthy investors a safe deposit for their funds, with the possibility of loans. Today, increased demand for investment advice and fund management has broadened the range of services, until they are similar to those offered by other institutions such as merchant banks or stockbrokers that have private banking arms. Services include discretionary portfolio management, money market accounts, trust management, insurance, school fees planning and tax advice, though each bank is likely to have its own definition of what a private banking service should offer. 'Private banking is not a defined set of services,' said Ian Woodhouse, private banking consultant with Price Waterhouse Management Consultants. 'It is a personalised service oriented towards investment.' The emphasis in all cases is on the customer-banker relationship. 'We will handle anything relating to our customers' financial affairs including buying them a vintage car,' said Michael Maslinski, head of business development, at Coutts private bank, speaking of the Campbell's Office, the integrated financial and banking service offered to very high net worth individuals. Flexibility is also a defining characteristic. The minimum level of assets can range between Pounds 75,000 and Pounds 1m, depending on the bank, but you could still be accepted with nothing like this amount if you are the son or daughter of a valued customer. The same flexibility extends to charges. Private banking's bread and butter comes from fee-based services, such as investment advice and moving money between countries. But what you pay depends on how frequently you use the services and the size of your portfolio. Charges are usually negotiable if your portfolio is large. 'In the past, customers would not question the fees, but now prices tend to be broken down so that you know how much you are paying for individual services,' said Woodhouse. 'Whereas there used to be a fee for the overall service, the tendency now is to make a charge for the service used.' You may, however, be paying over the odds for personalised service. For example, at Coutts, the basic banking service comes free only if you maintain an average minimum of Pounds 3,000 in your account, otherwise there is a quarterly charge of Pounds 30. However, James Cooper, chief executive of Lloyds private banking, argues that it can be cheaper to have all your financial needs managed in one place. 'We charge a fee of 1 per cent for assets under management; you might find yourself paying more by going to a series of advisers or fund managers.' He says another advantage is that the charge for financial advice can often be rolled into the fund mangement fees. Assuming you have sufficient assets, why go to a private bank rather than an investment house, stockbroker or a series of specialists, such as a financial adviser and an accountant? Cooper argues that the great attraction is the ability to have your banking and other financial needs, including tax affairs, administered through the private banking executive appointed for each customer. Other advantages are enhanced banking facilities: the Lloyds service offers an automatic borrowing facility of Pounds 17,500 at preferential rates of interest, as well as a Pounds 500 daily cashpoint limit and a cheque guarantee card for Pounds 250. Woodhouse says that the form of assets you hold determines to a large extent the type of bank you need. 'If your assets are mainly liquid, on deposits or in bonds, there are banks which specialise in this. If your assets are predominantly in securities, you'll look for a securities-oriented institution with a global network. But if your assets are mainly in property, you might choose a property/tax adviser.'</p>

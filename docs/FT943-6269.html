			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Conflicting influences on Stockholm bourse - Swedish equities The Swedish stock market has been getting plenty of what it likes in recent weeks, as a stream of interim reports from the big multinationals have more than matched expectations. Unfortunately, there have been equally big doses of what it dislikes: volatile interest rate and currency movements, lowered economic growth forecasts and a lot of political uncertainty. Given the two competing influences, it is not surprising that shares have struggled to make headway. But making headway they are. Progress is modest but equities are still in positive territory for the year to date. At yesterday's close, the Affarsvarlden General index stood at 1,462.30, up 3.40 on the day. The central bank's increase in key interest rates earlier this month, the first for nearly two years, gave the stock market its biggest jolt since the country's November 1992 devaluation. In three days, shares plunged by 5 per cent, wiping out the year's entire advance. The mood remains nervous. Sweden is entering the run-up to September's general election and a referendum on membership of the European Union in November. The markets are fast becoming reconciled to the prospects of a Social Democratic government, which is well ahead in the polls, but they are still troubled about the state of the country's finances. The SKr61bn budget strengthening programme which the Social Democrats announced 10 days ago has brought bond yields down; but there is a widespread feel-ing that the sums are inadequate, and the market remains unsettled. Mr Mike Young, Merrill Lynch's director of European investment strategy, says the market will remain nervous 'at least until we see what kind of initial budget steps are taken' by the new government. 'The market can only discount probabilities until we see reality,' he adds. Among other things, the Social Democrats plan to increase capital gains taxes and restore double taxation of dividends. Bond and stock markets have decoupled somewhat in recent days, with shares managing to climb in spite of bond market volatility. This is partly because there is rising optimism about the corporate outlook and a Swedish entry into the EU. Even so, equities remain overshadowed by developments in the bond market, not least because rising long-term interest rates have led to a readjustment of economic growth rate projections. The general view now is that Sweden's economy will grow by 1.5 per cent to 2.0 per cent this year, rather less than the 2.0 per cent to 2.5 per cent forecast earlier. The gloomier tone was reinforced last week when several leading banks indicated that their 1994 results would be hit by worries over the state of the economy. In spite of this, shares have been making headway precisely because the country's blue chips, with 80 to 90 per cent of their sales abroad, are so insulated from the problems in the domestic economy. Indeed, they may benefit from a difficult economic climate at home if it holds down wage costs and prices and keeps the Swedish currency weak. The current results season has provided plenty of cheer, with a string of impressive results from such heavyweights as SKF, Ericsson and Electrolux. Companies still to report, including Astra, the high-flying pharmaceuticals specialist, and Volvo, are also expected to produce spectacular figures. Astra, the biggest Swedish company by market capitalisation, has seen a particularly strong rise in its share price over the last few days in a run which has partly been fuelled by takeover speculation. One sector which is experiencing a particular revival is pulp and paper, where rising prices and operating rates are starting to feed a strong profits recovery. Stora, Europe's biggest pulp and paper group, confirmed this trend last week, increasing profits to SKr1.51bn from SKr30m. The 25 per cent fall in the value of the krona over the last two years, heavy cost-cutting and the improving economic outlook in the US and Europe provide the platform from which the strong corporate revival is being made. It explains why Kleinwort Benson in London was expecting Swedish corporates' first-half operating profits to improve by 107 per cent and pre-tax profits by 141 per cent even before the interim reporting season got under way. And it explains why the market has its supporters even during the current turbulence. In the longer term, the market's ability to outperform will still depend on the political arena. Should the next few months produce a 'yes' to Europe and a tough budget strengthening package, interest rates should fall on a strengthening krona. This would provide a solid background for further equity market gains, especially as corporate profits are expected to make further advances next year. A vote against joining Europe, on the other hand, would undoubtedly cast a deep shadow over the market. This is why a number of analysts remain cautious in the short term but more optimistic over a longer time frame. Mike Young of Merrill Lynch expects the Swedish market to underperform over the next three to six months, but outperform on a 12-month view.</p>

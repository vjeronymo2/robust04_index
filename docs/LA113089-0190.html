			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER;  </P> <P> FIREWORKS DECISION WILL GO TO VOTERS  </P> <P> The battle over the possible banning of fireworks continues in Westminster.  </P> <P> This week, the City Council voted 3 to 2 to rescind an ordinance banning  fireworks that was passed on Sept. 12. The move was prompted by a referendum  drive mounted by a citizen's group opposed to the ban.  </P> <P> The council must now decide whether to hold a special vote in March to let  residents decide if fireworks should be banned, or hold the referendum later  during a primary or a general election.  </P> <P> A special March election would cost the city about $38,000; a June or November  vote would cost about $13,000, said City Clerk Mary Lou Morey.  </P> <P> Although the 3,734 signatures needed to qualify the referendum have been  certified by the city clerk, they are being reviewed by the Orange County  district attorney's office, since 11 of the petition circulators were not  registered voters.  </P> <P> Cathy Zoellner, leader of the citizen's group against the ban, urged the  council to place the issue on the November ballot, saying that a June vote  would be ill-timed because it would all but cancel this year's fireworks  fund-raising hopes.  </P> <P> "The 29 organizations who have permits to sell fireworks will be in limbo,"  Zoellner said. "Let these organizations have the chance to make the money they  need to make."  </P> <P> Emmett Fennimore, a resident involved in fireworks fund-raising for more than  25 years, also spoke out against a June vote.  </P> <P> "There's no way I can sell fireworks if I have to wait until the June election  to find out if I can have them at all," he said.

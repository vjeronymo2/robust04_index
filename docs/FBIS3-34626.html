The "threat assessment" paper, released at a recent meeting  of the consultative committee attached to the Defence Ministry,  has drawn attention to the massive Pakistani military build up  in recent years and termed it serious. Describing Pakistan as a  major military threat, the note warns: "Its internal compulsions  and the narrowing edge (of the Pakistani forces) vis-a-vis our  armed forces may tempt it to resort to a military option at an  opportune time. This could come about if it perceives India to  be weak-willed and embroiled in internal turmoil.'    The Defence Ministry points out that from the 1987 peak  budgetary allocation for the Indian armed forces has been  declining in real terms every year. lt warns that economic  measures cannot be continued indefinitely without leading to  adverse effects on the capability of the Army.    Pakistan is spending 7 per cent of its gross domestic  product  (GDP) on defence, as against India's 2.5 per cent. The country's  armed forces have been consistently inducting modern equipment  and expanding their numbers, the note stresses. After acquiring  300 tanks from China. Pakistan is now shopping for more from the  UK, France and other countries. It has increased its anti-tank  capability with the induction of anti-tank missiles from China.    Similar acquisitions have been reported for Pakistani army  aviation artillery, air defence artillery engineer and infantry  units, the note says. It draws attention to the induction of  surface-to-surface missiles with a range of approximately 300  kms, again purchased from China.    Force levels of the Pakistan army have gone up sharply with  induction of two armoured brigades, four infantry brigades, two  artillery divisions and one surface-to-surface missile brigade.  Future plans of the army include induction of such force  multipliers as electronic warfare capability, induction of AWACS  [Airborne Warning and Control System], raising of army aviation  units and specialised troops like "ski-troops" for Siachen  operations. To top everything, it acquired nuclear capability.    The Defence ministry's threat perception on China is far  less  serious in the wake of the gradual warming of Sino-lndian  relations. The Ministry feels China is unlikely to disturb  status quo along the Indo-Tibetan border -- at least till the  turn of the century.    However, it notes that China's stepped-up arms sales to  Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar [Burma] are an attempt to gain  a strategic foothold in the South-East region. Among the  activities of China which have a direct bearing on the security  environment in the Indian sub-continent is the whopping increase  in its defence budget -- 14.8 per cent--thus allowing for rapid  modernisation. A Rapid Reaction Force has been created in each  of China's military regions. A final point of concern -- the  country has upgraded its military infrastructure in Tibet,  setting up vital communication channels.    Above everything else is China's comprehensive and full  indigenous nuclear programme. The major elements of her nuclear  arsenal include a stockpile of nuclear devices, multiple  independent recovery vehicle capability, delivery systems,  surface-to-surface ballistic missiles, satellite communications  and surveillance capability.    In her quest for superpower status, China is building up her  economy, not only in the areas of agriculture, industry and  science but also her defence structure, according to the Defence  Ministry perception. In the regional context China expects tc  play a dominating role -- initially in the Pacific Rim,  gradually extending it to South East Asia and the Indian Ocean.</p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / How to Spend It: Big spenders are hitting the factory floor  -Lucia van der Post reports on the latest shopping fad - one-stop retail 'happenings' that sell top brands at low prices IT IS fashionable to think that most of the ills the Western world has been suffering in recent years are due to a familiar cyclical event known as a recession. Some of us - what you might call the deeper thinkers - have other views. We perceive more profound shifts in the psyche than are accounted for by mere economic downturns. Attitudes to life, to the things that really matter as well as to more mundane, considerations such as expenditure: all have changed so much that the entrepreneurs who make it successfully to the year 2000 will have to be a fleet-footed mix of economist, accountant, trader, sociologist and clairvoyant. Retailers, in particular, are going to have to be exceptionally nifty. Anybody who nurtures an old-fashioned nostalgia for the days when shopping meant a cosy chat at the corner shop and a dear little man in a striped overall trimming your Sunday joint had better fasten their seat-belts and prepare for a bumpy ride. In the pipeline is a whole range of different retailing experiments to cater for new-age shoppers. Yesterday, for instance, television shopping in the shape of QVC (Quality Value Convenience) Channel started on BSKyB and though nobody can be sure that we in the UK will embrace it as enthusiastically as our transatlantic cousins it clearly marks a new era. Factory outlets are another of the coming things. In America they are the fastest growing sector in the highly competitive retail world. They are what students of the genre call 'Destination Shopping Centres'. Chuck Bloom, perhaps the daddy of the whole outlet business and the man behind the hugely-successful Woodbury Common and Liberty Village in New York state, has defined the ideal of outlet shopping: 'It should never sell stuff that nobody wants. It is over-runs or samples of mostly current ranges that bring in the customers. There should be a good mix of designer labels as well as dresses and shoes and things for the kids. Then you need to be a 'happening' as well, somewhere worth visiting for a fun day out.' Outlets are not round the corner from anybody. Nobody goes there once a week. What Mr and Mrs Middle America (or a whole gaggle of Mrs and Miss Middle Americas) seem to do is to plan a visit as they might a jaunt. They make a day of it, buying junior's new trainers and anorak at the same time as they pick up a new designer frock, a few presents, Dad's socks, having a jolly good lunch and coming home all the cheerier for a good day out. 'The mall,' say some observers of the American scene, 'is the latterday village green,' and nowhere more so than the outlet mall. Whether the concept will work as well in Britain remains to be seen . . . In Hornsea, East Yorkshire, the Hornsea Freeport Shopping Village has been operating successfully for three years, selling a range of reduced price clothing and china from 17 different tenants. However, few in the more densely populated south east and Midlands seem to know about it. At Street in Somerset, Clarks Village, modelled carefully on the American genre, is up and running. A themed village with plenty of parking, nicely arranged shops, good restaurants and children's play areas, it sells a raft of merchandise from 22 well-known names (Laura Ashley, Benetton, Aquascutum, Dartington Crystal, Royal Worcester) all at prices discounted by up to 60 per cent. More factory outlet malls are in the pipeline. Gerald Ratner, the former jewellery shop magnate, is advising the consortium that bought Tobacco Dock in London from the receiver when it went bust. 'I first decided outlet shopping was the coming thing,' he says, 'when I found that the Calvin Klein boxer shorts I paid Dollars 8 for in New York and Pounds 8 in London's Harvey Nichols, were on sale at Dollars 1.75 at Bells in Orlando. 'What I want for Tobacco Dock is to get bargains in big designer names like that - that is what gives the mall its glamour in America.' Still angling for top-quality tenants, too, is Value Retail, a consortium which opens a 105,000 sq ft purpose-built outlet village outside Bicester, Oxfordshire, next autumn. Modelled on the Woodbury Common and Liberty Village outlet centres it plans to make sure that the mix of shops is right and that the merchandise is irresistible. For the consumer perhaps the biggest disappointment initially is the prices  -they are good but not as low as one expects. I arrived at Woodbury Common and Liberty Village expecting the kind of free-for-all and mouthwatering prices that I had found when bargain-hunting on the Lower East Side of New York. I found nothing of the sort. Here were smart shops, each clearly labelled - Calvin Klein, Donna Karan, Cole-Haan, Stileman - selling current merchandise at prices that were reasonable, but far from dead cheap. On average prices seem to be 30 per cent lower than full retail on things such as china, glass, luggage and shoes and about 50 per cent on the highly fashionable items. But - acid test  -I (and my companions) all bought something. Chuck Bloom himself admits: 'They're not giving the merchandise away. Nobody is selling rubbish. The customer these days is sophisticated. He or she knows the labels so although Dollars 600 may still be a lot to pay, it is less than the Dollars 900 they know it will be selling for in Manhattan.' If Value Retail can get those sorts of names at those sorts of prices, the purveyors of the coach trips swanning through Oxford and Stratford-on-Avon may soon find another destination even more popular with their punters. We shall have to wait until next autumn to see but in the meantime watch this space - factory outlets are on their way.</p>

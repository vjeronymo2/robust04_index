			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SARAH FLORES SEEKS TO INTERVENE IN RIGHTS  CASE  </P> <P> Sarah Flores, whose campaign for Los Angeles County supervisor was thrown into  limbo by a court decision striking down the county's redistricting plan, sought  Friday to intervene in the voting rights case.  </P> <P> In papers filed in federal court, Flores said the case has thrown her campaign  into chaos, making it "impossible for me to raise significant sums of money,  form plans for effective campaigning and generate enthusiasm among volunteers  and voters."  </P> <P> Flores was the top vote-getter in the June 5 election to fill the seat being  vacated by Supervisor Pete Schabarum. Because she failed to receive a majority  of the vote, she is due to face Superior Court Judge Greg O'Brien in a November  runoff. But lawsuit plaintiffs have asked U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon  to call off the runoff and schedule elections under new district lines in  November.  </P></p>

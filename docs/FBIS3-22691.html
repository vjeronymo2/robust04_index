Today, after a great many information campaigns,  newspaper articles, and TV and radio programs, hardly anyone has  escaped hearing about the HIV virus and the immune deficiency  disease, AIDS. A new HIV-infected person is found in Sweden  every day and the number of infected people is approaching  4,000. The likelihood that someone at a place of work may be  infected is increasing all the time.    In the beginning, business executives were at a loss when  one  of their employees turned out to be HIV-positive. Today things  are different and more and more businesses are now drawing up  action programs for these problems. One of the first businesses  to produce an HIV policy was Volvo.  <H5>  Everyone Informed </H5>   "We made a move very early. Back at the beginning of the  1980's Leif Wallin, who was the corporation physician at that  time, advocated spreading information about HIV and AIDS," said  Lennart Dimberg, company physician at Volvo Airplane Engines in  Tollhattan and former corporation physician.    Volvo issued easily understandable written information to  all  its employees. With the help of comic strips everyone was  informed about what HIV and AIDS are, how the infection is  spread and how it is not. It is at least as important to tell  people about the latter as it is to describe the actual methods  of infection.    The Volvo corporation has decided that HIV should not be a  reason to refuse to allow people to work for Volvo.    "I have taken part in hiring HIV-positive people," Dimberg  went on. However the company advises employees not to tell  fellow workers and job supervisors that they have HIV.    "They tell us in the company health care system, that is  enough," said Dimberg. "People don't tell everybody if they have  hepatitis, syphilis, or any other disease, so why talk about  HIV?"    There is a risk that complications will arise and rumors  will  spread and that the infected person will not get any of the  support and security from the job group that he or she needs.    "Anxiety is the big problem, not infection," Dimberg said.    SCA [Swedish Cellulose Company] is another company that has  a  policy on this problem. It was produced after company executives  received an inquiry from their employees abroad in the  mid-1980's about what preparations they had for HIV/AIDS.    "We had none at all, so we appointed a working group that  included union people, corporate executives and members of the  safety committee and assigned them the task of coming up with a  policy," said Rolf Gatugard, chief safety adviser at SCA  Ortviken, Inc.  <H5>  Test Not Required </H5>   SCA does not require that employees be tested for HIV,  whether this involves new job applicants or existing personnel.  However the company does recommend that all employees who work  abroad be tested both before and after their trip.    "The group discussed whether or not an infected person  should  tell his or her fellow workers. We reached the conclusion that  it should be a matter between the doctor and the infected  person," Gatugard said. "If someone tells, there is a big risk  that it will create a lot of anxiety among fellow workers and  they may reject the infected person instead of providing  support."    SAS [Scandinavian Airlines] has no formal HIV policy.  However  the corporation has produced some internal guidelines that the  company health care system follows. We were told this by Anders  Huss, one of the company physicians at SAS. SAS employees are  not tested, whether they are new employees or existing  personnel. With one exception: pilot training applicants must be  tested for HIV. It is an important goal not to give people with  HIV infection special treatment.    "I do not feel that it is of any importance from the  company's point of view that an employee is a symptom-free  carrier of the HIV virus."    There is no reason to dismiss or reassign anyone because he  or she represents a risk of infection to others, Huss said.    "On the other hand there may be good reason to consider  reassignment to protect infection-prone HIV-positive workers who  have a lot of contact with customers in their work and are thus  exposed to a risk of infection themselves. The goal is to move  them to a less exposed job."    SAS applies the same principles to HIV as it does to any  other disease when it comes to reassignment and sick leave on a  full-time or part-time basis. The deciding factor is the  person's ability to work in relation to the job requirements.    There is no single answer to the question of whether  infected  people should tell their fellow workers or not, Huss feels. They  must decide this for themselves.    "Personally I usually advise those who are unsure not to  tell. The people around them may be frightened and the result  can be that the HIV-infected person is rejected by the group  instead of receiving support." Huss thinks that the "hysteria"  surrounding HIV has largely disappeared.    Like SCA, SAS recommends that its employees be tested before  and after working abroad. In addition the company has placed  "emergency kits" containing intravenous drip units, needles, and  syringes in all the places around the world where SAS personnel  are stationed.</p>

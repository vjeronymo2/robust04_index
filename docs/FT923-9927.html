			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / SFO drops final Blue Arrow case THE UK's Serious Fraud Office has finally abandoned its Blue Arrow prosecution by dropping proceedings against four City advisers still charged with fraud over the affair. The SFO's widely expected decision to scrap the next two trials followed the Court of Appeal's criticism earlier this week that the first trial  - which lasted a year and cost Pounds 35m  - was a 'costly disaster' which should never be repeated. The four advisers who will now be acquitted of conspiring to mislead the markets are Mr Charles Villiers, former chairman of County NatWest, Ms Elizabeth Brimelow, County's former compliance director, and Mr Paul Smallwood and Mr Tim Brown, both former equities directors with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. The SFO decided there was no longer any public interest in prosecuting these four in the light of the appeal court's criticism, made during its judgment explaining why it was quashing the convictions of four other advisers found guilty of conspiracy to defraud. Mr Nicholas Purnell QC, who brought the ill-fated prosecution for the SFO, will tell the trial judge, Mr Justice Brooke, on Monday that no evidence will be offered against the remaining four. The decision to drop the charges came as no surprise in the City. One regulator commented: 'In the light of the outcome of the first trial the SFO could not have done anything else. It would not have been fair.' It is widely accepted that the four played only peripheral roles in County's and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew's handling of the issue. A UBS Phillips &amp; Drew official said the firm was 'absolutely delighted' with the decision. The company still employs Mr Smallwood and Mr Brown, although neither has been involved in investment work since their arrests in November 1989. Restrictions placed on their working by the Securities and Futures Authority are expected to be lifted next week. Neither Mr Villiers nor Ms Brimelow would comment yesterday in advance of Monday's court hearing. Mr Villiers is currently the head of corporate development at Abbey National. Ms Brimelow has been out of work for almost three years.</p>

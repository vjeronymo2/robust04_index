			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Volume rises as shares resume slide A TROUBLED session on the UK stock market took a turn for the worse yesterday afternoon when the latest ruling from the US Supreme Court brought heavy falls in tobacco shares in London and New York. At the day's low the FT-SE Index was 33 points down, but the market rallied as losses in the tobacco leaders were halved after analysts took a closer look at the US legal ruling. The final reading put the FT-SE at 2,532.6, down 28 points on the day. At least two large two-way trading programmes helped boost the day's equity turnover to 582.1m shares from the 369.2m recorded in the previous session. The split between buying and selling orders underlined current trends in the London stock market; fund managers are selling stocks considered to have over-performed in the euphoria which followed the UK general election, but are also buying stocks likely to hold steady until a genuine recovery in the economy appears. Dealers reported substantial but highly selective business in equities. BAT Industries was traded very heavily, and selling pressure was seen in oil issues until Wall Street cheered London by commencing its new session with a gain of 16 Dow points in UK hours. ICI, however, fell sharply on turnover of fewer than 1m shares, while Lloyds Bank, several pence firmer at the close, saw less than 500,000 traded. The market was held back by the list of new issues known to be overhanging fund managers. Lasmo edged higher after disclosing details of its plans to sell the US assets acquired with Ultramar; the prospective pricing was at least no worse than the London market had feared. Wellcome, which will give details today of its planned public offering of stock, weakened but traders pointed out that barely 500,000 shares changed hands. The London market's other worry is still the international front, where concern regarding Wall Street lifted somewhat after an unexpected fall of 2.4 per cent in US durable goods orders last month prompted suggestions that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates again in order to stimulate economic activity. But deeper concerns regarding the outlook for the Japanese equity market, as well as the economy, continued to unsettle analysts in London. On the home front, the resumed slide by equities brought the FT-SE 2,500 line into hazard. Some analysts fear that, if this level is breached, then the market could be challenged all the way down to 2,420. However, the more sanguine analysts hold to the view that London is well supported on valuation grounds and will stabilise - if only Wall Street and Tokyo hold firm. Retail, or customer, business in equities has remained relatively light during the most recent shakeout in share prices. The daily total has topped the important Pounds 1bn mark only once in the past seven trading sessions. The market is still nearly 100 Footsie points above its pre-general election level and the absence of heavy selling indicates confidence ahead of the end of the second quarter, now only a week away.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Japan and the United  States have fundamentally different interpretations of the  overall goal of the so-called "framework" trade talks, a senior  Trade Ministry official said Friday.    The perception gap emerged during the latest meeting between  Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor in Marrakech, Morocco, said the  official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  (MITI), who declined to be named.    The MITI official was referring to "basic objectives"  mentioned in the joint statement on the Japan-U.S. framework,  which was issued after the summit meeting between then Japanese  Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and U.S. President Clinton in  Tokyo in July last year.    "The U.S. interpretation was found to be fundamentally  different from Japan's understanding," said the official, who  attended the Hata-Kantor meeting on April 15 in Morocco.    But the official did not explain the difference. He also  refrained from specifying which part of the joint statement was  discussed during the Marrakech meeting.    The Hata-Kantor meeting fell short of setting a specific  time  for resumption of the stalled framework talks.    The MITI official said that Kantor requested Tokyo to give a  "satisfactory" answer to U.S. proposals made during the  Marrakech meeting on three areas -- macroeconomic areas,  objective criteria and overall goal. But the official declined  to reveal details of the proposals.    The MITI official said the U.S. proposals on the three areas  were "far from" acceptable for Tokyo. He said Tokyo will make a  reply to these proposals by sending an official to Washington  probably after the Golden Week holiday season ending on May 8.    The Japanese understanding is that Washington is prepared to  reopen the framework talks through informal channels, only when  the Japanese answer is found "satisfactory," the MITI official  said.    During the Hata-Kantor meeting, Kantor sounded "softer" on  the issue of numerical targets, the idea of which Hata flatly  dismissed at the outset of the meeting, the MITI official said.  But the official did not elaborate, only saying Kantor did not  show any response.    Asked if the Japan-U.S. trade ties have worsened after the  Hata-Kantor meeting compared with the situation immediately  after the February 11 breakdown of the summit, the MITI official  said it is difficult to judge. Tokyo could avoid discussing the  conceptual gap over the "basic objectives," if it focuses on  sector-by-sector discussion, the official said.</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Uncertainty deters house buyers Lack of confidence in the recovery from recession is continuing to deter prospective house buyers, a survey published today shows. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which conducted the survey, said prices remained broadly stable in the three months to the end of June compared with the previous three months, but estate agents reported that there had been a further marked slowdown in the number of people searching for new homes. This continues the downward trend first reported in April after a buoyant first three months of the year. The institution said potential homebuyers were being unnerved by talk of rising interest rates and frustrated by lack of choice. Fragile consumer confidence and the continued stand-off between buyers and sellers meant that the number of sales and purchases was similar to last year. Mr Peter Miller, the institution's residential property spokesman, said: 'Buyers seem unwilling to take on long-term commitments. To return to a sustained recovery so essential for the wider economy, the volume of sales must increase so that the market can acquire its own momentum.' Many properties remained overpriced, the survey said, but 72 per cent of chartered surveyor estate agents reported no change in prices in the last three months. The remainder split evenly between those reporting higher and lower prices. London and East Anglia enjoyed the busiest conditions while the market was weakest in the north-west. Letters, Page 14</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 4 (AFP)--China reacted strongly  Wednesday to the U.S. decision to sell military electronic  systems to rival Taiwan, demanding that Washington scrap the  deal immediately.    "We are gravely concerned and strongly oppose the move by  the  U.S. side to interfere in China's internal affairs," a foreign  ministry spokesman said, adding that the latest sales violated a  1982 Sino-U.S. communique that called for the gradual reduction  of U.S. arms sales to Nationalist Taiwan. "We demand that the  U.S. Government strictly abide by the communique and immediately  stop transferring advanced weapons or other military equipment  in any form to Taiwan," the spokesman said.    The high-tech military electronic systems -- including radar  and electronic countermeasure systems -- will be used to equip  six La Fayette frigates Taiwan has ordered from France.    Announcement of the latest deal came after the U.S. Congress  on Thursday voted to give President Bill Clinton the authority  to boost arms sales to Taiwan, effectively relaxing the  restrictions contained in the 1982 communique. U.S. firms had  applied for permission to sell high-tech military equipment to  Taiwan almost two years ago, but were turned down.    The spokesman said the United States had repeatedly violated  the 1982 accord in recent years and accused Washington of  seeking "to destroy the peaceful reunification" of Taiwan and  the mainland.    Nationalist forces fled to Taiwan after losing a civil war  on  the mainland to the Chinese communists in 1949. Beijing views  the island as a renegade province.</p>

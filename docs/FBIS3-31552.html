			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 21 Feb (TANJUG) -- General Stanislav  Galic, the commander of the Sarajevo-Romanija Corps, said today  that his units had fullfilled all the obligations regarding the  movement of its artillery and its placement under UN control, in  compliance with the decisions of the Srpska republic army's  supreme command.    "Some very insignificant deviations from the general trend  of  the withdrawal were caused by weather conditions, but we are  ready to agree on that, too, and to finalize that part of the  job at any moment," General Galisc said.    Asked about the current situation in the zone of  responsibility of the Sarajevo-Romanija Corps, Galic stressed  the soldiers of his corps were in a state of increased combat  readiness, primarily because they expected that the Muslim  forces could take advantage of the current circumstances.    "Whoever attacks us is our enemy, and we shall defend  ourselves to the very end," Galic added.    Commenting on the arrival in Sarajevo of the Russian  UNPROFOR  [UN Protection Forces] battalion Galic said this was a case of  the Russians coming back to their old, primordial friends and  that the friendship ought to continue to be fostered.    "We welcomed them as brothers, as people, and as soldiers.  We shall do our utmost to facilitate them in performing their  task of peacekeeping in the area."    "The Russian battalion will be deployed between the warring  parties; that is, in front of our defense lines. UNPROFOR does  not have a sufficient number of soldiers to cover the whole  front line, but the Russians will take certain positions from  which they will be able to efficiently supervise the  cease-fire," Galic said, adding that he had visited the Russian  battalion with General Soubirou, UNPROFOR commander for Sarajevo.    Asked what was the subject of his talks today with General  Michael Rose, Galic gave a brief answer: "General Rose was doing  his routine tour of the area, and he called on the command of  the Sarajevo-Romanija corps for consultations over coffee,  something that is a part of his professional duties and  cooperation."</p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> NEW PRINCIPALS IN AUSTRALIAN BALLET'S 'GISELLE'  </P> <P> A second set of principals could not entirely energize the Australian Ballet's  production of "Giselle" Wednesday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center.  But at least the new dancers made Act II somewhat eventful and interesting.  </P> <P> Fiona Tonkin brought wide-eyed naivete to Giselle, registering emotions broadly  on her face. But she was so self-effacing and childlike that one could hardly  credit Albrecht's interest in her. Her dancing, despite explosive, fast turns  and spongy pointe work, remained curiously earthbound. But her mad scene  included such arresting moments as her flinching from unseen ghosts and her  struggling at the deadly coldness creeping over her.  </P> <P> After a rough start in the unsupported balances of the adagio in the second  act, she revealed greater control and security, and danced with more lyric  vulnerability and pathos.  </P> <P> Steven Heathcote as her Albrecht began as a standard, smug playboy,  impatiently, hotly attentive to her. He introduced a nice character touch,  however, with his look of aristocratic disdain as Giselle's mother mimed her  dream of Giselle becoming a Wili. Ah, the benighted superstitions of the  peasants. Unfortunately, his dancing here frequently lacked finish and  carry-through of impulse.  </P> <P> But in Act II, he earned his noble stature, emerging from a kind of demented,  insulated grief to commitment to Giselle. Similarly, his dancing evidenced  greater amplitude and strength, and he ended his trials with the Wilis with an  extraordinary series of high-bounding leg beats.  </P> <P> As Myrta, Queen of the Wilis, Jayne Beddoe made an impressive entrance, with  glittering, skimming steps, but she may have been thrown off by the person in  an upper balcony who could not muffle a disruptive sneeze that sent laughs  through  </P> <P> the audience. Her second crossing the stage looked less seamless and secure,  and her extended balances became shaky and effortful. Still, she brought  commanding, fierce attack to the role.  </P> <P> In Act I, Stephen Morgante had made an intense, almost obsessive Hilarion. Lisa  Bolte danced with careful, statuesque placement in the Peasant pas de deux.  Campbell McKenzie offered her shaky partnering, but in his variation displayed  springy leaps and clean beats.  </P> <P> Stephen Baynes' "Catalyst," previously reviewed, completed the program. John  Lanchbery again conducted the Pacific Symphony.  </P> <P>  The Australian Ballet performs through Sunday at the Orange County Performing  Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. At 8 tonight, "Giselle" and  "Catalyst." Tickets: $14 to $47. Information: (714) 556-2787.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Recovery uneven in east Midlands Small quoted companies in the east Midlands are trailing large groups in recovery from recession. Their turnover was static and both pre-tax profits and dividend payments declined in 1992-93, according to analysis of the performance of the region's quoted companies by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountants. The financial plight of companies with a stock market value of less than Pounds 50m emphasises the uneven progress of recovery in one of the most economically diversified regions, where only 21 per cent of total sales of quoted companies are made overseas compared with 38 per cent of west Midlands companies. The KPMG analysis shows that while collectively the region's 71 quoted companies increased their turnover in 1992-93 by 1.9 per cent, turnover of the small companies fell by 0.5 per cent. Against a regional average of a 6.9 per cent decline, the operating profits of small companies fell by 71.3 per cent. Although all quoted companies reduced their debt levels, the poor trading performance of small companies meant profits covered interest payments only 0.5 times, compared with 6.0 times for large companies. Overall, companies increased dividend payments by a greater proportion than the rise in attributable earnings. But, said KPMG, 'the 12 per cent reduction in dividends paid by small companies has offset reduced profits and increased dividend cover'.

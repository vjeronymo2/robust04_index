			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ladies and Gentlemen, [Culture Minister] Melina  Merkouri is gone. Her death has touched the whole nation. At  1545 today, this great Greek woman died at Memorial Hospital in  New York. What an irony for this great Greek woman to die away  from the country she loved. Exactly one month ago, she left  Greece for some scheduled medical exams, saying: I am dressed  in our blue and white national colors to give me courage, to  come back again.    Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said the following upon  learning of Merkouri's death: Greece today mourns the death of  Melina. She was a courageous fighter, great performer, and a  wonderful person. Greece today mourns the death of the woman  who, with her art and struggles, identified her name with Greece  itself. All Greeks, who loved her and formed a particular  relationship with her, are in mourning. It is a relationship  that will outlast today's tragic moment. As prime minister,  chairman of the PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement], and a  close friend, I bid farewell to Melina Merkouri with real  sorrow. My wife and I express our sincere condolences to her  partner Jules Dassin and to her family.</p>

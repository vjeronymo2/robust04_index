			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / OECD set to criticise UK aid policy The controversy over British aid for the Pergau dam project in Malaysia and its possible links with a Pounds 1bn arms deal has prompted concern within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development over the conduct and formulation of British aid policy. Sharp criticism of British government aid policy is expected in a report being prepared by a team of OECD examiners appointed by its development assistance committee (DAC). The OECD sets international standards for aid from western governments. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, reiterated last week that the UK adheres to its guidelines. Belgian and Finnish examiners were in London last month collecting data on the British aid programme. They met Baroness Chalker, Foreign Office minister responsible for aid, who opposed UK assistance to the Pergau project on economic grounds. One senior official who has closely monitored the project for the OECD said this week: 'We want there to be a strengthening of public and parliamentary confidence in the UK aid programme. For this you need transparency. You don't sweep this (Pergau) under the carpet.' There are allegations that the UK offered Malaysia Pounds 234m of aid for the construction of the Pergau dam in order to secure a Pounds 1bn arms deal in 1988. This would have been a clear breach of OECD and government guidelines. The aid was granted in spite of opposition from Baroness Chalker and Sir Timothy Lankester, then permanent secretary at the Overseas Development Agency (ODA). The OECD's development assistance committee report will be discussed at a general meeting on February 24, and will be published within a month. The committee is examining the extent to which the formulation and management of British aid policy is effective in terms of achieving the UK's own objectives. These objectives, recently submitted to the committee, define the overall aim of UK aid policy as 'promotion of the sustainable economic and sound development in order to improve the quality of life and reduce poverty, suffering, and deprivation.' Aid to Malaysia appears to have been an anomaly within that policy. Between 1990 and 1993, Malaysia was consistently among the top 20 recipients of bilateral aid from the UK. However, Malaysia's GNP per head, at Dollars 2,490 (Pounds 1,671), is four times greater than any other top 20 recipient of aid. An ODA official said that GNP per head was normally an important determinant of whether aid was granted to a country. However, Malaysia's aid had not been provided under a 'country programme' but under the aid and trade provision, which links the granting of aid to benefits for British trade. The aid and trade rules were changed last year so that a country as prosperous as Malaysia could no longer qualify. A previous DAC report in April 1991 was critical of UK aid policy, saying the use of trade-related aid carried 'inherent risks'. Mr John Major, the prime minister, has defended Pergau on environmental and economic grounds, and in terms of job creation and bilateral commitments.</p>

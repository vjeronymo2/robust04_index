			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Nuclear fears spur Europol European Union interior ministers moved a hesitant step further towards creating a pan-European police agency yesterday, spurred in part by fears of a trade emerging in weapons grade plutonium smuggled from Russia and the former eastern bloc. But they remain sharply divided over the role and nature of Europol, with Germany and France on opposite sides. The issue is a top priority for Germany, which wants a range of responsibilities, including plutonium smuggling, to come within the agency's remit. Spain insists that counter-terrorism be part of Europol's intelligence sharing. France and Britain want to go more slowly, and rule out any frontline role for the agency. Both countries, with some support from Italy and Spain, are also determined to keep Europol under national governments' control. Their partners want to develop the Maastricht treaty 'third pillar' on co-operation in justice and home affairs, which allot a still undefined role to EU institutions. The meeting took up a suggestion by Mr Michael Forsyth, UK home office minister, that a rapid assessment of the plutonium risk be made.</p>

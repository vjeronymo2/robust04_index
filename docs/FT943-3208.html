			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Some like it hot - Alan Mitchell believes targetted postcodes are vital to direct marketing Some FT readers will have recently received a missive from Lloyds Bank inviting them not to make a move 'until you check with us' about the company's buildings insurance. They probably never gave a thought to how closely targeted they were: they were not hot prospects, or even hot, hot prospects. They were hot, hot, hot prospects. Targeting, the elimination of the hated 'junk' from 'junk mail', is the holy grail of direct marketing. The better it is done, the less the exercise costs, the fewer consumer noses are put out of joint and the higher the response rates are. Now marketers are combining data from a wider variety of sources - including the gold mines of information that usually lie unexploited in their own accounting and other records - to get closer to that holy grail. Lloyds Bank Insurance Direct's building insurance campaign is an example. To isolate its best prospects Lloyds first compared the prices of its panel of insurers with the competition - postcode district by postcode district. If one of its panel was 30 per cent cheaper than the average competitor price in that postcode, the postcode was identified as 'hot'. The rest were dropped. Next, Lloyds trawled its own customer records to identify which of these 'hot' postcodes had recorded higher than average conversion rates from inquiry to purchase and lower claims rates. That produced a refined 'hot, hot' list. Then, to maximise the efficiency of leaflet door-drops, it used recent census data to identify those postcodes where property values were higher than average, and where there were particularly high concentrations of home ownership. The resulting 'hot, hot, hot' target areas look like a few tiny isolated dots in a postcoded map of the country. But they are a sizeable market. Further, by using data from a lifestyle survey company, NDL, which generates detailed information, including brand preferences and house moving dates from millions of named individuals each year, Lloyds has been writing to 'hot, hot, hot' individuals who moved house 12 or 24 months ago. They are particularly ripe because their insurance is likely to be due for renewal. Philip Loney, Lloyds Bank Insurance Direct general manager, says: 'We want to progressively target our marketing expenditure where we get the maximum benefit. This is beautifully simple. We have identified the people who we can offer the best deal to, and now we are talking to them - and the results are markedly better.' Technical developments such as this are doing more than generating better response rates. According to Chris Lovell, managing director of Lovell Vass Boddey, the marketing consultancy that helped Lloyds in this project, future media planning could be shaped by this type of 'micromarketing'. Posters can be sited more accurately on key local roadside sites, for example. Bus-side ads can be placed on routes travelling through the postcodes in question. 'Too often,' says Lovell, 'advertising effectiveness is a matter of post-campaign evaluation rather than pre-campaign planning.' Others are going further, trying to move their direct marketing beyond its traditional sales promotion by mail role to become relationship-building exercises. Next month, for example, the car park at stately home Packington Hall, near Birmingham, will fill with Jaguars, Mercedes and other luxury cars. After refreshments, their owners will be chauffeur-driven to the door of the Motor Show, a privilege not even granted to big exhibitors. Before going home, they will be able to play at chauffeurs themselves - driving BMW's new Seven Series car. Over the next few years BMW will keep in touch with these carefully selected prospective customers, sending them glossy magazines, stories about BMW, and the occasional chance of a freebie such as the Motor Show. By the time they come to replace their old car, BMW hopes it will have persuaded them to buy its new car. The next step is to combine both approaches, using data from a variety of sources to target individuals for long-term, direct, relationship-building programmes - as Ford is now attempting. In July it sent out questionnaires to 1m named individuals - people who it knew from lifestyle surveys currently drive rival brands. The Ford Driving Survey asked them details such as car age, replacement intentions, most important considerations in car purchase, marital status, occupation, number of children and income. Existing customer records were then examined, using sophisticated modelling techniques to identify the key characteristics of who buys which Ford models, and why. This information was then matched to the 200,000 Driving Survey replies, so that the people most likely to choose each Ford model could be selected for the right sort of soft-sell mailing. Says Anthony Marsella, strategic analysis manager at direct marketing specialist Wunderman Cato Johnson, which runs Ford's direct marketing operation: 'With car buying cycles you need to keep in touch with a potential customer over three years or more. When it gets to the point where they are going to buy, we will communicate a selling message to them.' Marsella estimates that Ford, by fine-tuning its technique, has doubled its direct marketing efficiency over the past five years. But such technical developments are also having a more profound effect: they are beginning to change the way some marketers think about marketing. Says Grant Harrison, loyalty controller at Tesco, which is currently testing a Club Card with enormous data-gathering potential: 'Marketing is moving very significantly away from trying to change or twist consumers' behaviour to understanding them and giving them what they want.' The ultimate aim, says Mark Patron, managing director of CMT, one of the main lifestyle survey companies, is to use technology to mimic the days of the old corner shop. 'The owner would say, 'Hello Mrs Brown, how's Doris? I know she likes orange sherbets. Now we've got some lemon flavour. Give her this, and see if she likes it.' Most marketers are still a long way away from that, but as they get closer Mrs Brown may find herself investing as much care and attention in choosing which organisations deserve her trust and information - her 'relationship' - as she does in choosing which brands deserve her hard-earned cash.</p>

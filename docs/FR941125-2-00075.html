Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop permitting programs to ensure that MSWLFs comply with the Federal Criteria. Subtitle D also requires that EPA determine the adequacy of State municipal solid waste landfill permit programs to ensure that facilities comply with the revised Federal Criteria. To fulfill this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing the State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal programs must satisfy to be determined adequate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA intends to approve portions of State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of the STIR. EPA interprets the requirements for States or Tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits or other forms of prior approval to impose several minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority to issue a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe also must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA. Finally, EPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an ``adequate'' program based on the interpretation outlined above. EPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the State/Tribal Implementation Rule. EPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF program before it gives full approval to a MSWLF program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> B. State of North Dakota  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> On June 25, 1993, North Dakota submitted an application for partial program adequacy determination for the State's MSWLF permit program. On October 5, 1993, EPA published a final determination of partial adequacy for North Dakota's program. Further background on the final partial program determination of adequacy appears at 58 FR 51821 (October 5, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA approved the following portions of the State's MSWLF permit program:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Location restrictions for airport safety (40 CFR 258.10 (a), (c), and (d)), flood plains (40 CFR 258.11), wetlands (40 CFR 258.12), fault areas (40 CFR 258.13), seismic impact zones (40 CFR 258.14), and unstable areas (40 258.15).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Operating criteria for cover material (40 CFR 258.21), disease vector control (40 CFR 258.22), explosive gases control (40 CFR 258.23(a)), air criteria (40 CFR 258.24), access requirements (40 CFR 258.25), run-on-run-off control systems (40 CFR 258.26), surface water (40 CFR 258.27), and liquids restrictions (40 CFR 258.28).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Design Criteria requirement for composite liners (40 CFR 258.40(b)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Ground-water monitoring for applicability and duration of monitoring (40 CFR 258.50 (a) and (e)); ground-water monitoring systems including casing, number, depth, and spacing of wells (40 CFR 258.51 (c) and (d)); and ground-water sampling and analysis including documentation procedures, frequency, and ground-water elevation measurements (40 CFR 258.53 (a), (c), and (d)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Closure and post-closure care requirements including final cover design (40 CFR 258.60 (a) and (b)), final cover description (40 CFR 258.60(c)(1)), waste inventory and schedule (40 CFR 258.60(c) (3) and (4)), beginning and completion of closure (40 CFR 258.60 (f) through (j), post-closure care period (40 CFR 258.61 (a) and (b)), and post-closure plan and land use (40 CFR 258.61 (c)(1) and (c)(3)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Financial assurance requirements including applicability (40 CFR 258.70) and allowable mechanisms (40 CFR 258.74).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA did not approve the following portions of the State's MSWLF permit program:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. North Dakota will revise its regulation and add a ``FAA notification'' requirement to comply with Part 258.10(b) (airport safety).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. North Dakota will revise its regulations to incorporate the Federal operating requirements for the exclusion of hazardous waste (40 CFR 258.20), explosive gases control including monitoring and detection/remediation (40 CFR 258.23 (b) and (c)), and recordkeeping (40 CFR 258.29).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

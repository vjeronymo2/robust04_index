			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ma Zhiping: "More Firms in Private Sector Set Up"] </F>   [Text] Private businesses in China continued to grow  rapidly in the first quarter of this year, thanks to strong  government support.    The number of individually-owned businesses and private  firms  expanded by 17 and 14 percent respectively, in the first three  months this year compared to the same period last year,  according to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce  (SAIC).    "Private firms" in China are those companies employing more  than eight people. Those which hire fewer than eight workers  are called "individually-owned businesses."    During the first quarter, 33,500 new firms were set up in  the  private sector with 12.9 billion yuan ($1.48 billion) of  registered capital and a workforce of 480,300. This brings the  total number of private firms in the country to 271,400 and the  amount of their registered capital to 81 billion yuan ($9.3  billion), said a SAIC report.    Private firms in towns and cities grew faster than those in  rural areas, according to the report.    Guangdong, Zhejiang, Shandong, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Sichuan  and  Hebei provinces led the expansion of the private sector. Each  of them now has more than 10,000 private firms.    The SAIC report noted that more and more private firms are  switching over to manufacturing, commerce, consultation,  catering services, transport and construction projects.</p>

Addressing the Human Rights  Commission in Geneva yesterday, he said that the Indian  occupation forces are resorting to the most brutal means to  crush the legitimate struggle of the Kashmiri people for their  right to self-determination. He said that the Indian forces  during the last four years have badly trampled the basic rights  of the Kashmiri people. Dr. al-Ghabid said that the continuous  curfew in occupied Kashmir has crippled the people's life. He  said that the ICO at its summit and foreign minister-level  conferences has repeatedly appealed to peacefully resolve the  Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the UN resolutions.    The leader of the Pakistani delegation at the Human Rights  Commission, which is meeting in Geneva, has said that Pakistan  has made persistent efforts to hold purposeful talks with India  on the Kashmir issue, but India never responded positively to  the Pakistani proposals to resolve the Jammu and Kashmir  problem. He said this while addressing the ICO meeting in  Geneva yesterday which reviewed the draft resolution on the  Jammu and Kashmir issue. The meeting was held after the the ICO  secretary general's address to the Human Rights Commission. He  said that Pakistan wants a resolution which calls for sending a  fact-finding mission to occupied Jammu and Kashmir to assess the  grave situation there. The Islamic countries' ambassadors  expressed serious concern over the serious violation of human  rights in the occupied Kashmir. They noted that although a  number of resolutions were adopted at the ICO ministerial and  summit meetings, but there was no improvement in the situation.  The ambassadors lauded Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto's  address to the Human Rights Commission.</p>

			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Four sports agents charged with signing former University of Florida athletes  to secret contracts also have been accused of withholding tax returns to the  Internal Revenue Service and failing to provide accurate information to the  U.S. Department of Education.  </P> <P> Agents Gerald Gratenstein, Gregory Latimer, John Kasbar and Glenn Haft are  scheduled to go on trial Monday on charges they defrauded Florida and two  smaller schools with secret payments to basketball player Vernon Maxwell and  five football players who played all or part of their college careers with the  Gators.  </P> <P> The government contends those secret payments voided the athletes' amateur  eligibility, and because the agents helped hide the payments from university  officials, they defrauded the university of scholarship money the athletes  never should have received.  </P></p>

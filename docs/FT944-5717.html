			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Blair's school choice starts row Mr Tony Blair's political honeymoon as Labour leader ended yesterday in a blaze of controversy over his decision to send his son to a grant- maintained school outside local authority control. Mrs Gillian Shephard, education secretary, said Mr Blair's choice of the Roman Catholic London Oratory school for his son Euan, 10, marked a U-turn for Labour. Mr John Major seized on the issue in the Commons, accusing Mr Blair of using the grant maintained system while planning 'to remove the same privileges from everyone else'. The decision also worried the National Union of Teachers, which said the school had opted out of centralised salary agreements as well as local authority financing. Mr Blair, campaigning in the west Midlands for this month's Dudley by-election, said he hoped the issue would not be 'a political football to be kicked across the political divide'. Mr Blair said he and his wife Cherie had chosen the London Oratory because it was a Roman Catholic school that regularly took pupils from his son's present school, the Joan of Arc primary in Islington, London, where the family lives. 'The Labour party is in favour of choice for people and decent schools for people,' Mr Blair told BBC television. 'I am not going to make a choice for my child on the basis of what is the politically correct thing to do.' Labour officials said there was no conflict between Mr Blair's choice of school and the party's education policy, which is being reviewed by Mr David Blunkett, appointed shadow education secretary in a shadow cabinet reshuffle last month. Mr Blunkett has dropped plans to force grant maintained schools back into the local authority system, but remains committed to ending further opt-outs and to changing the funding system. Mrs Shephard said there were two local authority-run Roman Catholic comprehensive schools in Islington which Euan could have attended. 'Mr and Mrs Blair's decision will cause huge embarrassment to his Labour colleagues, who will face the impossible task of squaring this decision with the party's words,' she said. Mr Graham Lane, education committee chairman of the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities, said Mr Blair's decision was 'not helpful to the party position'. Mr Doug McAvoy, NUT general secretary, said Mr and Mrs Blair were 'exercising a choice provided by Conservative legislation few other parents could contemplate. 'The Oratory School has not only opted out of local authority control - it is also the only school to have opted out of the statutory arrangements governing teachers' pay and conditions of service,' he said.</p>

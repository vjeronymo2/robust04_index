			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / The mouse that roared: Peter Bruce visits Andorra, Europe's newest sovereign state Come back in a few months,' says Mr Xavier Espot, Andorra's minister for tourism and sport, rubbing his hands. 'This is going to be very interesting.' Last Sunday, Andorrans, perched high up in their tiny Pyrenean principality between Spain and France, voted overwhelmingly in a referendum to grant themselves their first constitution and to end more than 700 years of feudal rule from 'down below' as they call their neighbours. As far as its people are concerned, Andorra has just become Europe's newest sovereign state. 'Now we'll get to see what its like being a real democracy,' says Mr Espot. There is excitement everywhere. In the next few weeks President Francois Mitterrand of France and the Bishop of Urgell in Catalonia, Joan Marti Alanis, will sign the new constitution into law, transferring sovereignty to Andorrans. 'Things are going to begin to happen really quickly around here,' says Mr Candi Naudi i Mora, a former minister and the country's biggest property developer. Until recently, Andorrans have been slow to seek change. Since the 13th century the principality has been ruled jointly by the bishops of Urgell in Spain and the French counts of Foix. The Foix title passed to the crown of France in the 15th century and successive French heads of state. These 'co-princes' have enjoyed complete power in Andorra - over commerce, immigration and security. And for centuries Andorrans have wanted it that way. Even now, in voting sovereignty to themselves, Andorrans have made the co-princes a single constitutional monarch, obliged to sign laws and to be consulted only on foreign policy affairs that directly affect France and Spain. Slow political development has contrasted with an increased pace of economic change. In the past 30 years Andorra has been transformed from a subsistence economy into a modern tourist mecca. Its towns are lined with expensive duty free goods. Visitors shop and ski. And the 60,000 or so locals have one of Europe's highest standards of living. The country is pretty and clean. There is practically no crime and no prostitution. Andorrans pay no taxes, get free education in schools financed by France and Spain and get cheap health care. The local government has until now raised more than 95 per cent of its revenue by charging a small import duty. No one knows what inflation might be. 'We don't have a consumer price index,' says Mr Naudi. And per capita income? 'Enormous,' says the minister for tourism. Economic development has prompted increasing demands for self-determination which has brought the people of Andorra into a series of disputes with the co-princes. In 1982 an Andorran assembly, was established with the agreement of the princes. The most serious dispute has occurred over an expropriation law passed unanimously by the assembly in 1985 but which has never been approved by the co-princes. The law would probably cut the price that the government has to pay to buy land from property-owners - many of whom have benefited from the old system. Under the new constitution, the co-princes will have to sign the law. The See of Urgell is the big loser from Andorra's new independence. The Bishop, once so influential that he could determine the credit policies of Andorran banks, failed to make catholicism a state religion in the new constitution and had to fight hard to prevent abortion being legalised. But, under pressure from the Spanish government of Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the See has been forced to accept a reduction of its power. Andorran officials say there is no resentment behind their move to independence. 'We just want to be able to do things,' says Mr Espot. 'The institutions of the old system were incapable of dealing with modern problems.' For a start, the Andorrans want to establish themselves as an offshore financial centre. 'We pay no tax but we can't even be a tax haven because we don't have the appropriate laws,' says a local lawyer. More importantly, the government wants to scrap legislation banning foreign companies from Andorra. Officials say they must change such laws to find new sources of income. Freedom from feudal rule is going to be expensive. Between 1989 and last year public spending rose nearly 50 per cent to Pta20.4bn (Pounds 118m), mainly to fund new schools. To finance a growing budget deficit the Andorrans need to create more economic activity - by changing company law and opening up to foreign investors - and then find ways to tax the new sources of wealth. 'We will never have a direct tax here,' says Mr Naudi, but there is broad agreement that indirect taxes will have to be introduced, perhaps even a value added tax. Andorrans fear new taxes just as they fear that continued economic growth will fuel immigration. Resident foreigners already outnumber locals by more than three to one - more than half the population is Spanish. The authorities, seeking to create a stronger sense of national identity, have decided to create more Andorrans. Anyone who has spent more than 30 years in the country or who was born there before 1975 is now eligible for citizenship. This may not seem very generous, but few foreigners are complaining. 'I have another 10 years to wait,' says a Basque, resident here for the past two decades.' He will happily give up his Spanish passport when the time comes. 'It's a strange, conservative, place. Everybody, especially the police, knows your business but it's a good price to pay for total security in a civilised country.'</p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Nepal Airbus crash kills 167 A PAKISTANI Airbus A300 crashed yesterday while trying to land at Kathmandu, Nepal, killing all 148 passengers and 12 crew, four guards and three engineers. The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) aircraft was on a flight from Karachi to Kathmandu. It lost contact 10 minutes before it was due to land and crashed 22km from the airport, Pakistani officials said. The passenger list included at least 34 Britons, 30 Spaniards, 14 Dutch, 10 Italians, two Swiss, two Canadians, one Japanese and three Americans. The aircraft also carried 30 Nepalese, two Bangladeshis, and 30 Pakistanis. Pakistani civil aviation staff are due to arrive in Kathmandu today to investigate. It was the second Airbus crash near Kathmandu within two months. On July 31, a Thai Airways A310-300 hit a Himalayan ridge after trying to land at the airport, killing all 113 people on board. Kathmandu airport is one of the world's more difficult airports for pilots. They have to descend steeply to the runway to avoid the surrounding mountains. The airport has no radar and aircraft are guided in by radio beacon. However, Mr Nagendra Prasad Ghimire, deputy chief at the airport, was quoted as saying that the crash occurred in scattered clouds and moderate winds. The pilot had given no indication of any problem. Yesterday's was the A300 model's first fatal accident, although there have been four previous crashes including a training accident in Egypt and a runway overshoot in India. A fifth A300, owned by Iran, was shot down by the USS Vincennes over the Gulf in 1988, killing 290 people. The A300, introduced in 1974, was the first aircraft type built by Airbus. It is a wide-bodied twin-engined aircraft capable of flying up to about 8,000km, the distance from New York to Istanbul. The crashed PIA model was one of the first built, taking to the air for the first time in 1976. PIA bought it in 1986. The design of the A300 bears little resemblance to that of the A320 model which has crashed three times, including once in France last year, and whose computerised controls have attracted criticism from some pilots.</p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL OKS LAW ON LIQUOR SALE PERMITS  </P> <P> In spite of warnings that the legislation will be challenged in court, the  Glendale City Council adopted an ordinance Tuesday requiring conditional-use  permits from gas stations that sell liquor.  </P> <P> The council vote came after a lengthy public hearing in which lawyers  representing some of the city's eight gas stations that sell alcohol warned  city officials that the ordinance would face legal challenges and would not  decrease drunk driving.  </P> <P> An AM-PM Mini Mart representative and three attorneys representing individual  gas station marts cited numerous surveys and reports, which they said show that  only a minimal percentage of drunk drivers buy their liquor at gas stations.  </P> <P> Furthermore, they claimed repeatedly that the city cannot impose further  restrictions on gas stations operating with approved liquor licenses.  </P> <P> But City Atty. Frank R. Manzano said that "there is nothing in the law that  prevents the city from terminating nonconforming uses contrary to zoning  regulations."  </P> <P> "The dispute over the ordinance is clearly going to end up in court," attorney  Robin Wiener testified.  </P> <P> "It is likely to be defeated, and will cost the council a lot of money that  could be used in hiring more policemen" to look out for drunk drivers, said the  attorney, who represents gas station-mini mart owner Charles Mussalli.  </P> <P> The ordinance was adopted by 4 to 1, with John F. Day dissenting. Council  member Jerold Milner said that approving the ordinance would send a strong  message to city's residents about the council's commitment to fight drunk  driving "because actions speak louder than words."  </P></p>

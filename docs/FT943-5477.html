			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Metals up on better prospects Metal markets were buoyed this week as traders expressed optimism about the erosion of stock levels and a labour dispute in Canada lifted the nickel price. Aluminium prices at the London Metal Exchange reached a 3 1/2 -year high on Thursday on an improvement in the fundamental prospects for the metal. Traders believe that an informal agreement between producers to cut aluminium output agreed earlier this year is finally beginning to eat into previously-high inventory levels. At the same time, a drought in Ghana and a strike at Australia's largest aluminium smelter have added strength to the market. The lack of water in Ghana is expected to lead to the closure of the Volta Aluminum Company smelter on September 10 - the plant was expected to produce 140,000 tonnes of metal this year. The Tomago smelter in Australia plans to close one of its three potlines on Monday unless striking employees return to work. Aluminium prices for delivery in three months rose by Dollars 52 a tonne over the course of the week, adding Dollars 29 a tonne on Thursday to close at Dollars 1,565 a tonne - a slight drop from the 3 1/2 -year high point of Dollars 1,570 a tonne reached earlier in the session. A further stock drawdown yesterday when LME stock levels were released reinforced the bright outlook for the aluminium market. Aluminium stocks dropped by 19,755 tonnes. But although prices rose higher during the session, the market failed to break the Dollars 1,565 a tonne mark at the close. Strength in the copper and nickel markets complete a picture of a buoyant week for metals. Nickel prices for three months' delivery increased by Dollars 400 a tonne over the course of the week after workers at Canada's Falconbridge - the second biggest nickel producer in the west - decided to go on strike over pay and conditions. Nickel closed at Dollars 6,350 a tonne yesterday - Dollars 40 below its high point as traders reacted to higher-than-expected levels of LME stocks. Copper continues to be lifted by speculative and investment fund buying even though a rise in LME stock levels yesterday temporarily dampened market sentiment. Copper prices managed to remain above a key resistance level at Dollars 2,500 as tonne, having touched Dollars 2,520 a tonne earlier in the week. After gaining ground at the beginning of the week following the closure of Forcados - Shell's big export terminal on the Nigerian coast, the oil price lost almost Dollars 1 a barrel. The price drop occurred as scares over delivery problems in Nigeria disappeared from the market and traders came to terms with high output levels in the North Sea. North Sea crude prices slipped from Dollars 17.14 a barrel to Dollars 16.20 a barrel yesterday, but at one stage dropped much further. Coffee prices rose by over Dollars 100 a tonne during the course of the week with most buying heavily influenced by technical signals and activities of investment funds. Uncertainty over weather in Brazil which remains very dry helped to lift prices towards the end of the week. The November futures contract rose to Dollars 3,830 a tonne by Friday. However, the cocoa market was depressed with prices dropping by around Pounds 50 a tonne.  --------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  --------------------------------------------------- Aluminium             -19,775  to  2,576,700 Aluminium alloy          -160  to  42,040 Copper                 +6,900  to  498,500 Lead                   -2,175  to  333,400 Nickel                   +858  to  137,316 Zinc                      -50  to  1,132,525 Tin                      +360  to  25, 780  ---------------------------------------------------</p>

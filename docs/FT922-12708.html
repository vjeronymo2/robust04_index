			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Four join race for deputy leadership MRS MARGARET BECKETT, MP for Derby South, began by ruling herself out and has now opted back in. In spite of protestations from the Smith camp that it is not running a slate, she will be privately promoted as the shadow chancellor's choice. English, a woman and a one-time leftwinger, her profile meshes perfectly with that of Mr John Smith - though to be completely ideal she should represent a southern English seat. Mrs Beckett, 49, earned a reputation as a tough-minded Kinnockite loyalist in her position as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, where she policed the spending instincts of her colleagues. But she originally comes from the hard left and is remembered for a vitriolic attack on Mr Kinnock in 1981 for his failure to back Mr Tony Benn, then running for the deputy leadership. Her transition reflects an instinctive political nose which is also shown in a confident Commons style and calm but combative technique in broadcast studios. ***** MR BRYAN GOULD, MP for Dagenham, is running for deputy leader, as well as leader. His dual candidacy, described as a 'radical' platform, is justified as offering the party a broader on-going debate than the so-called 'dream ticket' of Mr John Smith and Mrs Margaret Beckett. Furthermore, supporters of Mr Gould said yesterday that a victory in the race for either post would ensure that any tendency to believe that 'one-last-heave' was all the party needed to win an election outright would be countered by a deeper reappraisal of what went wrong last week. His appeal is intended to keep the interests of voters in the south of England prominently in the minds of Labour tacticians. He has also promised his backers that he will accelerate the internal reforms of the party's constitution. To his opponents, Mr Gould's hesitancy about Europe and his advocacy of a re-evaluation of sterling's position in the exchange rate mechanism could re-open old wounds. ***** MS ANN CLWYD, MP for Cynon Valley, has built a high profile in the party for her globe-trotting in her capacity as the Opposition's voice on overseas development. Her travels have included visiting Kurds fleeing Iraq's President Saddam Hussein. Ms Clwyd, 55, has been an MP since a by-election in her south Wales constituency in 1984. She was a member of the European parliament for five years previously. She is regarded as an internationalist and the keeper of the party's Third World conscience. She is campaigning on a four-point programme: electoral reform for Westminster, a higher profile for women's issues, a firmly pro-Community stance on Europe and more stress on the environment. Many will rank her the least likely candidate to gather the 55 MPs' votes needed to pass to the final stage of the contest. However, she has surprised before, scoring 137 votes last year to come top of the women candidates for the shadow cabinet. ***** MR JOHN PRESCOTT, MP for Hull East, is a fast-talking leftwinger. Aged 53 and an MP for more than two decades, he is a former seaman who almost deliberately cultivates the image of a lovable rogue. He is fiery tempered in political combat but meeker in private. He is far from an intellectual or ideologue but has long argued that Labour's message to its traditional working-class supporters and others, has been lost behind public-relations gloss. He had an often fractious relationship with Mr Neil Kinnock - largely because of his decision to run for deputy leader in 1988. As transport spokesman he overcame strictures on public spending by devising funding schemes with private finances. His pitch centres almost exclusively on the need to turn the deputy-leadership into an organisational post, charged with reinvigorating the party grassroots, raising membership, boosting the campaigning focus and shifting party resources to Labour's regional centres.</p>

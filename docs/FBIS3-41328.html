			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by correspondent Francisco Santacruz Meza] </F>   [Text] Hermosillo, Sonora, 27 January--The first district  judge, Otoniel Gomez Ayala, reported that the confrontation  between three DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration] agents and  the Munoz Talavera brothers, accused of drug trafficking, has  been pending since October 1993. This evidence has not been  presented owing to the lack of a petition that must be submitted  to U.S. authorities by the International Legal Affairs  Directorate of the Office of the Attorney General of the  Republic (PGR).    As he explained, the confrontation could not be held because  the official note requesting the U.S. Government's permission  for the DEA members to participate in this hearing was  mistakenly turned over to the Mexican consul in El Paso, Texas,  so that he, in turn, could attend to it. However, the PGR is the  agency legally responsible for carrying out such procedures.    For this reason, the brothers Rafael and Eduardo Munoz  Talavera have been unable to present the expert documentary  evidence, or to hold the confrontation. Both are necessary  conditions for judgment to be pronounced.    As for the action taken by the court to hold the  confrontation between the accused and the United States  counternarcotics agents, Gomez Ayala revealed that a second  official note was issued, to obtain a response from the PGR's  director of international legal affairs. However, he has not  responded to date.    The first judge specifically noted that both Rafael and  Eduardo Munoz Talavera face charges of crimes against health and  illegal export of cocaine. He added that another person  implicated in this case is Carlos Enrique Tapia Anchondo,  currently serving a sentence in the high security prison at  Almoloya de Juarez, in Mexico State. Therefore, legal  proceedings have been instituted against him here as well.</p>

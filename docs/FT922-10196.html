			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Terms of gas auction criticised BRITISH GAS yesterday released details of the gas it will sell to competitors as part of its agreement with the Office of Fair Trading to halve its share of the industrial gas market by 1995. But rival suppliers expressed their dissatisfaction over the handling of the proposed gas auction and said it could put the creation of a long-term competitive market for gas at risk. 'It will interfere in the market and attract lots of short-term players which could let down their customers once they run out of gas,' said Mr Norman Ellis, managing director of Kinetica, an independent gas supplier. British Gas said it would sell 500m therms of gas in October and was inviting rivals to bid for the quantity of gas they required. The sale price will be based on the average cost of gas to British Gas as well as a wholesaling margin of 0.25p a therm and an allowance for costs. Critics of the deal say British Gas should not be allowed to make money from its undertaking to reduce its market share. Mr Ellis said the gas should be offered to existing participants in the market to help them through an immediate gas shortage in the next couple of years. The problem for competitors to British Gas is that there is not much gas available in the market until 1995. Most rivals have signed contracts for delivery of gas after that. British Gas said it would release 400m therms for the year 1993-94, 300m therms the following year and 200m therms in 1995-96. Each applicant for gas will receive a minimum of 10m therms.</p>

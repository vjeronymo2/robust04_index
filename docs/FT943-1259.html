			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / A warm autumn breeze blows from Moscow: Interview - Anthony Robinson meets Russia's new - and friendly - ambassador to the court of St James Anatoly Adamishin, Russia's new ambassador to the court of St James, slipped quietly into London last week and tackled his first task - smoothing the way for President Boris Yeltsin, who arrives today for talks with prime minister John Major. His next job will be to ensure that all goes well next month when the Queen pays a state visit to Russia - the first British monarch ever to do so. Relations between Britain and Russia have not been as warm or as close for decades. Adamishin, a career diplomat, who has been increasingly influential in shaping Russian foreign policy, is welcomed in London as a man who embodies the 'new thinking'. He has thus been much involved in Russia's efforts to reintegrate into the wider world. Adamishin, who served as ambassador to Italy and deputy foreign minister before coming to London, says this process started when Britain's former prime minister Margaret Thatcher, described Mikhail Gorbachev 'as a man I can do business with.' This was several months before he became the last communist ruler of the Soviet Union. However at about that time, Adamishin himself was playing an important part in reshaping Russia's relations with the rest of the world, during negotiations in a most unlikely place - Africa. The quietly-spoken diplomat, was at the centre of the international effort in the mid-1980s to persuade the Cubans to remove their troops from Angola. The Cuban withdrawal ended a military threat to South Africa's security and persuaded Pretoria to grant independence to Nambibia This withdrawal was thus an important condition for the eventual ending of apartheid in South Africa. During these negotiations, Adamishin made some unlikely friends, including Pik Botha, South Africa's crusty former foreign minister. During months of shuttle diplomacy, which took him back and forth to Luanda, Brazzaville, Windhoek, New York and other more secret places, Adamishin gained the respect and trust of some of the most influential people in western diplomacy, including Sir Robin Renwick, now UK ambassador to Washington. 'It was touch and go right to the end', Adamishin says. 'The night before we were due to complete the agreement in New York the Cubans said they would not sign. I told them in that case Moscow would not sign either. But then I spelt out a whole series of negative consequences which would follow. In the morning, they signed.' Such a breakthrough would have been impossible had the veteran Soviet foreign minister Andrei Gromyko still been in charge. But shortly after Gorbachev came to power in 1985, Eduard Shevardnadze took over the foreign ministry. 'New thinking' swept through the foreign policy establishment and Adamishin, who had languished in Moscow for more than 20 years as a speech writer and increasingly influential counsellor, following his return from a six-year stint at the Rome embassy, was given a free hand to tackle an intractable problem, albeit one low on Moscow's list of priorities. The chance to use his talents fully in Africa arrived after years of frustration for a man who passed the formative years of his career in Italy and longed for the chance to help loosen and modernise the sclerotic Soviet system. By temperament and experience Adamishin is an unashamed 'westerniser' who believes that 'partnership with the west is vital for our hopes of turning Russia into a normal, economically prosperous and predictable country.' Throughout Russia's history such men and such ideas have had to contend against the 'Slavophiles' with their quasi-mystical belief in the uniqueness of Russia and the Slav soul and their suspicion - and even hostility - to the corrupting ideas and examples of the west. But, in his first interview inside the sprawling white stucco embassy on Kensington Palace Gardens, Adamishin said that 'western Europe has not yet made up its mind whether to embrace Russia and hold her tight in a democratic embrace - like Germany after the war or Spain and Greece - or draw the boundaries at the Baltic states and Ukraine as if Russia is really an Asian exile.' However, he speaks rather more warmly of Britain: 'You have shown more understanding of our problems than some others. You helped us to join the Group of Seven and helped in other parts of the world. The UK is not a simple partner to deal with, but we consider you as a reliable, long-term partner.' He is optimistic that relations with Britain and other western countries will improve further. 'Our interests coincide 80 to 90 per cent of the time and relations between Russia, western Europe and the US are moving in the right direction. But we still have to find where a balance of interests exists in the remaining 10-20 per cent of cases.' Misunderstanding and disagreement could arise from Russia's 'peacekeeping' role in the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) which were formerly part of the Soviet Union, and from its relationship with Nato. Moscow wants an equal partnership. 'We each need to recognise certain special interests, in our case we see the CIS as an area in which we have a special interest. We were also displeased to be faced by unilaterally taken decisions over Bosnia, although the situation in that respect is also much better now,' he adds. Adamishin was born of Russian parents in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine in 1934. This was the year in which Stalin ordered the assassination of Sergei Kirov and then used the murder as an excuse to purge political opponents. Adamishin, however, shows few of the characteristics of 'Soviet man.' 'I was too young to remember the purges,' he says. But he is part of the generation which grew up under Stalin and then started their careers under Khruschev. He attributes his survival as a free spirit to the influence of his grandparents, who brought him up during the war, and to a lucky break which took him into diplomacy. He was trained as a mathematician and specialised in the Italian economy. His room mate was Luigi Longo, son of the eponymous former Italian communist party leader. 'Gigi was six years older than me. He became my teacher in everything from marxism to sexology,' he recalls affectionately. The two men remain close friends. The Italian connection changed his fate. 'They needed Italian speakers and I was taken on by the first European department of the foreign ministry (devoted to western European affairs). I translated for Khruschev when an Italian delegation came to Moscow. I remember how Giuseppe Pella, the then Italian foreign minister, outraged Khruschev by asking whether it was true that Khruschev drank water while plying vodka liberally to his guests. Khruschev pushed his glass up to Pella's mouth and ordered him to drink. It was vodka of course.' Two years later Adamishin arrived in Rome as stazheur, apprentice at the elegant palace which houses the Russian embassy, less than a mile from the Vatican on the Gianicolo hill. There followed six years as interpreter and counsellor to Ambassador Semyon Kozyrev, (no relation to the current foreign minister). 'He treated me like a son, gave me my diplomatic schooling, and protected me from the KGB snapping at my heels. Thanks to his protection I was able to violate all the rules governing the behaviour of Soviet diplomats in Italy.' Like so many foreigners, exposure to the subtle arts of Italian life and politics inevitably influenced his thinking and style. But he insists that the main formative elements were his unusual 'class origins' and the influence of his grandparents. His father, Leonid, was killed along with 1m other Soviet troops, in the first Nazi encirclement of Kiev in 1941. Anatoly was then seven years old. His mother was a modest functionary in the ministry of agriculture. 'I spent my childhood in the Ukrainian countryside looked after by my grandfather, a graduate from St Petersburg University who had voluntarily 'returned to the people' to teach in the countryside, and my grandmother. She had been educated at a gentlewomen's academy but learned how to milk and grow crops.' Both, he added, were what used to be called in Czarist times raznochinits, the name given to the proud and hard working meritocracy which was not part of the hereditary aristocracy, but rose through the ranks and served the Czar with diligence and honour. This combination of inherited grit and acquired Italian subtlety marked him out and helped him to survive 25 years at the heart of the foreign ministry interspersed by events such as the Warsaw pact invasion of Czechoslovakia and the collapse of detente after the invasion of Afghanistan and martial law in Poland. It should also serve him well as he sets out on his declared path 'of doing everything in my power to make sure that Anglo-Russian relations will be confident and serene.'</p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Corporate disclosure Should companies massage investors' expectations ahead of formal announcements containing bad news? If they do give analysts a nod and a wink, do they not end up breaching laws designed to prevent insider dealing? Such questions have been raised starkly by the pummelling BTR's share price has taken since it revealed disappointing results in September. This week's trading statement did only a little to repair the damage. BTR could undoubtedly have done more ahead of its results, perhaps through an expanded analysis of trading conditions at its annual meeting in May. But Ms Kathleen O'Donovan, its finance director, was right not to give analysts a private steer as to what was coming. The dissemination of price-sensitive information other than to the market as a whole is, in most cases, banned under this year's beefed-up legislation. The practice of giving 'guidance' on profits forecasts is not specifically outlawed and certain finance directors are still willing to give off-the-record hints. But they may be breaking the law. Stock exchange rules interpreting the law should be tightened to eliminate the grey area. This would give analysts a headache, as they thrive on obtaining an information advantage. It need not upset institutional investors who can opt to obtain privileged information by agreeing not to deal. All, including small shareholders, would benefit if companies were to publish more information, more frequently.</p>

			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Observer: Claws out Ruffled feathers in the taxation jungle. The two owls at the sides of the Institute of Taxation's coat of arms are intended to signify the collective wisdom of the IOT, which comprises some 9,000 of the best brains in British taxation. Why two owls? One represents the wisdom of Inland Revenue officials, the other that of private-sector tax advisers. Malcolm Gammie, the IOT's president, now says the Revenue owl has 'fallen off its perch'. The tax advisers' owl is squawking about clause 241 of the Finance Bill, currently before Parliament. The private-sector tax industry sees the clause as a backdoor means of the Revenue poking its nose into their offices uninvited, and even - heaven forfend - removing key papers. According to Gammie, the offending clause is badly drafted and must be withdrawn. 'It confers unnecessarily wide powers upon the Inland Revenue and provides inadequate protection against their exercise'. So far, the Revenue owl doesn't give a hoot.</p>

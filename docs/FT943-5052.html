			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Arts: Lucerne loosens its collar The Lucerne Festival has begun to shed some of its inhibitions. Switzerland's premier music festival - famed for its well-heeled audiences, its conservatism and predictability - is branching out into activities which are less exclusive, more experimental. The popular hit this summer has been a late-evening open-air spectacle, in which audiences were taken round a theme-park of dance, mime and lighting shows. There have been concerts of Swiss folk music and avant-garde jazz, plus a modified version of the street music competition introduced two years ago. The line-up also includes an improvisation concert, designed to turn traditional concert ritual on its head, and an event in which the renowned Swiss clown Dimitri assumes the role of conductor. For many Swiss, all this has come as a pleasant shock. The festival has long been identified with imported culture - a parade of top-class orchestras, conductors and soloists from anywhere but Switzerland. Its traditional public is rich and stuffy - the kind of people who wear evening dress for a concert and pay SFr180 (Pounds 90) for a ticket. Locals have complained that they feel excluded, that the festival has little relevance to Lucerne and its people. That has begun to change. True, this year's programme is as strong as ever on expensive international stars, headed by Maurizio Pollini and Anne- Sophie Mutter, the Berlin Philharmonic with Abbado and the Vienna Philharmonic with Muti. Now there is a counterbalance - a series of unconventional events which have captured the popular imagination. The change has been engineered by Matthias Bamert, the Swiss conductor who became festival director three years ago. Lucerne and Bamert looked an odd couple. Bamert, 52, has spent most of his career outside Switzerland, learning his craft under Stokowski and Szell in America, before emerging as a leading interpreter of contemporary music in Europe. Since 1987 he has lived in London, working regularly with British orchestras and winning plaudits for his performances of British and French music. With his taste for the off-beat and the new, he was the antithesis of what Lucerne stood for. But the two seem to get on well. Bamert began by pledging to maintain the quality of the symphony concerts which underpin the festival's reputation. This allayed any fears harboured by the Friends Organisation - a group of 300 wealthy individuals who pay an annual subscription of up to SFr8,000 for priority booking. He has also proved a dab hand at fund-raising. Although absent for most of the year, leading the peripatetic life of a conductor, Bamert has increased sponsorship by five times. Privately-generated income now accounts for 35 per cent of the festival's SFr8m budget. Public subsidy is only 5 per cent. The rest comes from box-office. Bamert argues that as long as the festival remains financially stable, he is free to experiment. His aim, he says, is to make the festival less predictable, and to give it a more local flavour. 'Predictability kills curiosity. I don't want people to have a fixed idea of what the Lucerne Festival is like. I want them to be constantly surprised.' He is adamant that his festival should not be interchangeable with others. 'The way to make it distinctive is to reflect the colour and flavour of Lucerne. That's why I want local people to be involved. A third of this summer's performances are geared to the people of Lucerne, rather than the international festival public. Only when everyone here feels 'festival fever' will we have the vibrant festival I dream of.' Bamert inherited a smooth-running organisation which catered well for a particular public. Sceptics say there was no need to change a successful formula, that Bamert's innovations are gimmicks which have no place at an international festival. Change has involved risks. His theme-park spectacle this summer generated publicity and goodwill - but if it had been rained off, the event would have been a financial and artistic wash-out. He has placed a huge amount of faith in local 'alternative' artistes. Another gamble was to hand the opening concerts to a new festival orchestra, made up of former members of the European Community and Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestras. That paid off, thanks to the skill and enthusiasm of the players, and the experience of conductors such as Kurt Sanderling and Gennady Rozhdestvensky. Bamert's challenge is to weld together the old and the new. His programme theme this year - 'Forms of Interpretation' - was broad enough to embrace just about everything. Finding equally versatile themes for next year and beyond will test Bamert's lively imagination to the full. The festival runs until Saturday. Box office: tel (41) 233080 fax (41) 239464.</p>

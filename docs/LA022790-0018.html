			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SAVING SEAS, TREES  </P> <P> There were two articles printed recently that seem to represent, sadly, the  shortsighted vision of our nation.  </P> <P> In one, even after the irreversible damage caused by the oil spill off  Huntington Beach, President Bush sees no reason to prevent oil drilling off our  California coast.  </P> <P> The other article related that in Northern California, the Pacific Lumber Co.  has no qualms about felling 2,000-year-old redwood trees.  </P> <P> Do the people involved in these two incidents have no feeling for history; for  the eons of time the beaches and redwoods have survived; for the enormity of  what they have done or propose to do?  </P> <P> KATHRYN S. TARBELL  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

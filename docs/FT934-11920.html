			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Balladur seeks new Air France package AS THE damaging nine-day strike at Air France continued to ease yesterday, Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, said a recovery plan for the state-run airline was 'indispensable' despite his government's climbdown on an earlier austerity package. In an interview in the French daily Le Figaro, Mr Balladur said the state and taxpayers could not continue to support losses of FFr5bn (Pounds 580m) a year at Air France, the amount the airline is forecast to lose this year. But he said a new recovery plan could avoid involuntary redundancies and share equally the burden of cost-cutting across the company. Mr Balladur's comments came as the strike by ground staff, which has brought Air France to a virtual standstill, appeared to be petering out. Many baggage handlers, maintenance workers and technicians returned to work, although the airline's freight services remained paralysed at both Orly and Charles de Gaulle airports. A spokesman for Force Ouvriere, representing about 35 per cent of ground staff and which has been at the forefront of the dispute, said the union was awaiting the outcome of negotiations next week before deciding whether to relaunch industrial action. Mr Christian Blanc, who has taken over as Air France's chairman following the resignation on Sunday of Mr Bernard Attali, will meet union leaders at the beginning of next week in an attempt to resolve the dispute. Mr Attali's plan included 4,000 job cuts and a reduction in overtime pay and bonuses. Mr Blanc has said he will not impose any cost-cutting measures before discussions with union representatives. Air France services, which had been brought to a complete standstill for much of the dispute, showed some improvement yesterday. Thirty-six flights, including 24 from Paris's two main airports, operated yesterday and the airline said it hoped to double the number of departures today. But the number of flights remains far short of the 450 normally operated and a resumption of usual service is expected to be a slow process.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special  coordinator on Cyprus, arrived in Cyprus this afternoon to brief  President Glavkos Kliridhis and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf  Denktas on his contacts in Athens and Ankara. Speaking at  Larnaca Airport, Lamb said he is trying to make each side  understand clearly and precisely the positions and concerns of  the other. He also said he would try to achieve progress in the  implementation of the package of confidence-building measures.  Replying to a question, the U.S. official pointed out that the  issue of access to Famagusta is one of the most serious problems  but he said he did not want to go into details. Lamb claimed  that Ankara is looking for a way out of the situation.</p>

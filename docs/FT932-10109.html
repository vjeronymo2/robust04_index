			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Ministry admits overspend on EFA THE MINISTRY of Defence confirmed yesterday that the Eurofighter project to build a joint combat aircraft with Germany, Italy and Spain was over its budget. It said there was a 'slight overrun' on costs to the UK of just over Pounds 1bn. As reported by the FT yesterday, the present total cost estimate for the 250 aircraft the UK plans to buy is Pounds 13bn, including Britain's share of development work. The MoD said yesterday that this had risen 10 per cent in strictly comparable terms since the project was launched, and described the increase as 'not too bad' in view of the complexity and international nature of the venture. It said its projection in 1987 was a total cost of Pounds 7.8bn for a reduced purchase of 200 aircraft. At today's prices, and taking the additional 50 aircraft into account, the figure would be Pounds 11.9bn, it said. This contrasts with the government's declarations when it approved the launching of development five years ago. Mr George Younger, now Lord Younger, who was defence secretary at the time, told the Commons on April 25 1988: 'I would expect (the total cost to the UK) to be of the order of Pounds 6bn to Pounds 7bn when it is completed.' He added: 'There is no change in the United Kingdom's declared production offtake, which remains 250 aircraft.' The latest figure is also substantially higher than the MoD told the Commons defence committee last year. In a memorandum dated February 19 1992 it put the UK's costs as Pounds 2.7bn for development and between Pounds 7bn and Pounds 8bn for production. It made clear that this was based on a 'planning assumption' of 250 aircraft. The Pounds 13bn total takes into account the results of a recent cost overhaul. The total costs of the programme have been obscured by differences in accounting methods, but are expected to be about Pounds 32bn against the Pounds 21bn expected in 1988.</p>

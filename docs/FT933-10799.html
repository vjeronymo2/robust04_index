			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Observer: Sitting on the tarmac If Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister, was more polite than usual when conferring with his opposite numbers in Brussels yesterday, it may have had something to do with an unfortunate diplomatic incident at Berlin's Tegel airport earlier in the week. Heading home to Bonn after a punishing day visiting the tax offices of eastern Germany, Waigel was upset to find that his 31-year-old Fokker propeller plane would not start. Rather than repair to the bar, he decided to make the most of his enforced layover by briefing the attendant press corps on the troubles of the ERM and other matters of mutual interest in the comfort of Luthansa's Senator class lounge at Tegel. However, even Germany's finance minister has to obey the rules and, when Waigel could not produce his Senator card, the formidable lady guarding the entrance to the VIP lounge would not allow him and his entourage to pass. Lufthansa, Germany's flag carrier, is not in the best of financial shape at the moment, and may come to regret this apparent act of rudeness. However, if it fuels Waigel's enthusiasm for privatising the airline and stripping it of its near monopoly position above the German skies, then some good will have come out of the incident.</p>

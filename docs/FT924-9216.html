			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / MacSharry quits Gatt role MR RAY MACSHARRY, the European Community's agriculture commissioner, has resigned all responsibility for Uruguay Round negotiations, he confirmed yesterday. Mr MacSharry, who remains in charge of EC agriculture, is understood to believe his efforts to secure a breakthrough in protracted Gatt talks with the US were being undermined by Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president. He wrote to Mr Delors informing him of his decision on Wednesday, on his return from the last round of ultimately fruitless negotiations in Chicago. Asked to confirm a report in the Financial Times that Mr MacSharry was relinquishing his Gatt mandate to Mr Delors, the Commission president's spokesman said at midday yesterday: 'This does not correspond to reality.' By yesterday afternoon, however, all Gatt inquiries were being directed to Mr Delors' staff. Mr Delors' spokesman was not available for comment. The move was the latest twist in the increasingly bitter rift between the two men over the Uruguay Round negotiations. Mr Delors, and the French government, have accused Mr MacSharry of going beyond the mandate he received from the Council of Ministers for the talks. Yesterday, Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, French agriculture minister, said in a radio interview that Mr MacSharry had gone 'beyond his mandate', although he later said the commissioner had 'respected his commitments'. He said in the French national assembly, however, that both he and Mr Delors had told Mr MacSharry that he was going beyond his mandate. Mr MacSharry insisted yesterday that 'the negotiations that are being conducted are in the context of the CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) reform, and any provisional issues I have agreed (with the US) are within the impact of the CAP reform.' The CAP reform, agreed by the 12, including France, in May and passed into law in July, imposes severe price and production cuts on EC farm output. Mr MacSharry, and Mr Frans Andriessen, external affairs commissioner, believe the cuts sought in the Uruguay Round are less stringent than those the 12 have already agreed.</p>

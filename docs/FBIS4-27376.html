			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Robert Gallucci, ambassador in </F> charge of nuclear issues of the U.S. State Department and head  of the U.S. delegation for the U.S.-DPRK high-ranking talks, by  Washington correspondent Chong Yon-chu at Gallucci's office in  the State Department building on 26 May, Korean time]    [Text] [Chong Yon-chu] The DPRK-U.S. working-level contact  started in New York at 1100. What results do you think will be  achieved?    [Robert Gallucci] As you know, it is not customary to reveal  the content of the New York working-level contact (the DPRK-U.S.  New York contact which started at 1100 lasted six hours). At the  recent New York contact held early this week, we conveyed our  opinion on holding the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks and the  replacement of the fuel rods which is currently an issue. I hope  that an agreement can be reached very soon on the third round of  talks, and that North Korea will take corresponding measures  regarding the demands by the International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA] which are necessary in having an understanding of how the  atomic reactor was operated in the past through further  measurements of its fuel rods.    [Chong] At a recent special briefing at the State  Department,  you made an optimistic and encouraging remark on holding the  third round of talks. What is the prospects for the third round  of talks?    [Gallucci] We are prepared to hold the third round of talks  as soon as possible. We also notified North Korea on several  occasions on the basis for holding the third round of talks.  Now that basis has been provided. North Korea accepted the  nuclear safety measures revealed at the 31 March statement by  the chairman of the UN Security Council, and finished additional  inspection [chuga sachal] on the radiochemical laboratory, which  was not completed in March, and follow-up inspection [husok  sachal] necessary in maintaining surveillance equipment. In  addition, there was no diversion of nuclear material in the fuel  rods extracted from the atomic reactor. Therefore, considering  the current situation, the basis for the third round of talks  has been provided and, thus, we are prepared to hold the third  round of talks.    However, one point that we have to bear in mind is that a  precondition for the United States to continue talks with North  Korea is that North Korea must accept the demands by the IAEA to  guarantee further measurements on the fuel rods which were  extracted. If an agreement is not reached soon on selecting,  separating, and storing the sample of the fuel rods as demanded  by the IAEA, and thus it is impossible to carry out further  measurement, not only will the basis for the dialogue disappear,  but this issue will be directly handed over to the UN Security  Council. Therefore, considering the current situation, there are  both positive and negative elements. On the one hand, we are  faced with the third round of talks characterized as extensive  and thorough talks, while on the other hand, it is being  regarded that issues to be agreed upon between North Korea and  the IAEA are being regarded as a time bomb. This time bomb is  not ticking on our side but it is ticking from the North Korean  side. This is because if North Korea wants, it can stop it from  ticking any time it wants.    [Chong] You said that an early agreement must be reached.  How much time do you think it will take before the situation  aggravates, in which the expression, time bomb, is used?    [Gallucci] How quickly the situation aggravates will be  dependent on how quickly and in what pattern North Korea  extracts the fuel rods. If it postpones the replacement of the  fuel rods and agrees to the selection, separation, and storage  of the necessary samples in further measurements, the time bomb  can be stopped.    [Chong] Is the work to replace the fuel rods not being  conducted under the surveillance of the IAEA?    [Gallucci] Yes. Not only is the inspection conducted by two  to three team members on the spot at the atomic reactor, but it  is also conducted under the surveillance of the "storage  surveillance" equipment which consists of a spent fuel measuring  instrument and monitoring camera that shows when the spent fuel  was extracted and moved to the storage water tank.    [Chong] What are the prospects for discussing the issue of  normalizing relations between the DPRK and the United States at  the third round of talks?    [Gallucci] If the nuclear issue is resolved, relations  between the two countries will be able to move toward a more  normal relationship. We hope that this will be achieved.    [Chong] Please explain in detail what you mean by "a more  normal relationship."    [Gallucci] There are various models in normalizing a  relationship. I hope that you paid attention to which model the  United States chose in pursuing the normalization of relations  with Vietnam recently, and which channel the United States chose  in the past to normalize relations with China. If North Korea  resolves its nuclear issue, we will take corresponding measures.    [Chong] Looking at the experiences with Vietnam and China,  normalizing the relationships started with the opening of  liaison offices.    [Gallucci] I believe that it is important to resolve issues  of interest of the both sides amid the framework of gradually  improving relations by taking simultaneous measures. I repeat  that the third round of talks is a place to extensively and  thoroughly discuss all political and economic issues of interest.    [Chong] North Korea has been showing much interest in  introducing the light-water atomic reactor. If North Korea  introduces does this, it will be able to erase doubts regarding  the development of nuclear weapons. To what degree can the  United States help North Korea in giving a technological head  start to the light-water reactor?    [Gallucci] North Korea requested such help at the second  round of talks held in Geneva last year. We positively accepted  North Korea's proposal. We also said that we are prepared to  give help to North Korea so that it can have technology to  change into light- water reactor with the international  community.    [Chong] However, is it not true that there is in reality a  limit in giving such help in your domestic law?    [Gallucci] Assisting North Korea to introduce the  light-water reactor is dependent on whether the nuclear issue is  resolved. Even if we gave help to North Korea, it does not mean  that we would give Westing House's and General Electric's  light-water atomic reactor. There are always ways to give help  and avoiding practical restrictions. Other than the United  States, there are many countries including France, Germany,  Japan, and Russia that have light-water reactors. There are  many countries that can give financial help to North Korea as  well.    [Chong] There are various views within the U.S.  Administration on North Korea's nuclear capability. Why are  there different viewpoints on the same information?    [Gallucci] This is because the information is incomplete.  To our knowledge, there is an enormous uncertainty in the  content North Korea notified to the IAEA. North Korea notified  that plutonium was extracted according to the gram unit, but  according to the analysis based on the samples extracted by the  IAEA inspection team, there is a possibility that, in reality,  North Korea may possess plutonium according to the kilogram  unit. There is an "inconsistency" between the notified quantity  and the actual analysis. We cannot explain this inconsistency  with the current evidence. Therefore, it was necessary to  conduct a special inspection [tukpyol sachal]. This means that  North Korea may possess plutonium according to the kilogram  unit. However, that evidence is not decisive.    Nuclear materials such as plutonium and enriched uranium are  not enough to manufacture nuclear weapons. There must be a  "triggering system," a system which makes nuclear materials  explode with energy. This triggering system requires time and  expertise. Because of this, there are different opinions on  whether North Korea truly has only nuclear materials or whether  it also possesses a triggering system necessary to manufacture  nuclear weapons. Therefore, there are different opinions on the  degree of North Korea's nuclear capability.    [Chong] Exactly one year has passed since the first round of  talks. Looking back at the past year, how can you assess the  year before and now?    [Gallucci] There are both positive and negative aspects.  During the past year, the nuclear safeguard measures on North  Korea's nuclear facilities were maintained; North Korea did not  extract even one gram of plutonium; there were nuclear  inspections on several occasions; and North Korea is still under  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty system. These are the  positive aspects of the past year. There is also a negative  aspect which is that no concrete progress was made. In other  words, we do not know how much plutonium was actually extracted  and we were not able to clearly examine the "inconsistency"  discovered by the IAEA. In a nutshell, there are aspects in  which to have hope for, but there are also aspects that are  dangerous.</p>

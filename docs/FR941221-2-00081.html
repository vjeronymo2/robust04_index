The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number is 17.246. The budget shall include on separate pages: a cost analysis of the budget, identifying in detail the amount of each budget line item attributable to each of the Title III cost categories at Section 314 of JTPA for funds requested through this grant; an identification of the amount of each budget line item which will be covered by other funds, and the sources of those funds (including employer funds, in-kind resources, secured and unsecured loans, grants, and other forms of assistance, public and private); and a justification for the average cost of service per placement. This is to be computed by dividing the number of eligible workers who will not be laid off but will be placed into new jobs as a result of the project, into the total funds requested, and is to be compared to existing staff development costs and local dislocated worker program costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal funds cannot be used to provide training which an employer is in a position to, and would otherwise, provide. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal funds may not be used for acquisition of production equipment. The only type of equipment that may be acquired with Federal funds is equipment necessary for the operation of the grant. Grant funds may cover only those costs which are appropriate and reasonable. In the instance of a purchase, the cost of the equipment is to be prorated over the projected life of the equipment to determine the cost to the grant. EXPENDITURE OF FUNDS FOR EQUIPMENT REQUIRES PRIOR APPROVAL FROM DOL. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants may budget limited amounts of grant funds to work with technical expert(s) to provide advice and develop more complete project plans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> TECHNICAL PROPOSAL. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _The technical proposal shall demonstrate the offeror's capabilities in accordance with the Statement of Work/Project Summary in Part III of this solicitation.

Therefore, applicants should request the postal clerk to place a legible hand cancellation ``bull's eye'' postmark on both the receipt and the envelope or wrapper. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F.

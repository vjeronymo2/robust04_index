			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: Sears, Roebuck unveils shake-up WALL Street reacted with enthusiasm yesterday to further evidence that Sears, Roebuck, long-regarded as the sleeping giant of US retailing, has woken up and is ready to fight to regain market share. Yesterday, the company revealed details of its restructuring plans, including a Dollars 4bn five-year capital expenditure for its stores and a 58.6 per cent cut in debt and deposits. Sears has become uncharacteristically responsive to charges that it has neglected its retail operations. Over the last five months it has brought in a new head of retailing and announced plans to sell its loss-making catalogue business and spin off much of its non-retailing operations. As if to emphasise its renewed focus on retailing, the thrust of yesterday's analysts' meeting centred on upgrading about 500 of its 800 US stores. Mr Arthur Martinez, the former finance director of Saks Fifth Avenue who took the helm of Sears' retail operations in October, stressed the need to shift Sears's retail strategy from a national approach to a regional approach. 'We believe we have the best retail store locations at major regional malls in the country, which offer us tremendous growth potential. While a considerable amount of work has been done in our stores in recent years, much more needs to be done and at an accelerated pace,' Mr Martinez said. He is credited with shutting Sears's loss-making catalogue business. Sears plans to spend about Dollars 4bn upgrading its US stores over the next five years. Mr Edward Brennan, chairman and chief executive, said the company expected the share issue of 20 per cent of its Dean Witter Financial Services subsidiary to be priced and completed by the end of the month, slightly ahead of schedule. The level of interest in Dean Witter is 'about as high as one could hope', he said. The spin-off of the remainder of Dean Witter, which includes the profitable securities brokerage and Discover credit card unit, is to be completed by the end of the year. Sears expected cumulative proceeds of about Dollars 3bn from the Dean Witter share issue and spin-off, a 20 per cent share issue of its Allstate insurance subsidiary and the sale of its Coldwell Banker property broker. Sears shares rose Dollars 1 5/8 to a 52-week high of Dollars 51 5/8 . The stock was trading at around Dollars 41 before the demerger was announced in September. Sears said it was cutting its quarterly dividend to 40 cents from 50 cents to reflect its strategic repositioning. It predicted an 11.5 per cent decline in revenue to Dollars 52.3bn after the repositioning, a 29.6 per cent drop in assets to Dollars 79.8bn and a drop in debt and deposits to Dollars 15.4bn.</p>

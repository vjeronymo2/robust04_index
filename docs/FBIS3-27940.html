			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Tokyo office economic reporter Yasuhiro Suzuki; from the </F> "Kasumigaseki at the Crossroads" series; part three of a  three-part series of articles on the Labor Ministry: "Ever  Present `Sectarian Interest' Mentality"]    [Editorial Report] Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese  carries on page five of its 24 January Morning Edition a  1,500-character article by economic reporter Yasuhiro Suzuki as  the third and last installment of a three-part series on the  Labor Ministry in its "Kasumigaseki at the Crossroads" series.    The article first reports that the Labor Ministry Women's  Bureau used to be the symbol of improvement of women's social  status because the bureau was the first to hire women as senior  officials, and many women from this bureau eventually became  Diet members, or even Cabinet ministers. Therefore, it prides  itself as the sole authority on policy on women.    However, last year, Mariko Bando, who had climbed the  bureaucratic ladder in the Prime Minister's Office throughout  her career, was appointed the ninth chief of the Women's Affairs  Office under the Prime Minister's Office, an organization  created in 1975 for the UN Year of the Women. All eight of her  predecessors came from the Labor Ministry Women's Bureau. This  led to angry demands from the Women's Bureau for a clear  delineation of functions, even resulting in a written agreement  between the two rival offices. The bureau's strong opposition  also defeated the Prime Minister's Office's original plan to  upgrade the Women's Affairs Office to a division.    Suzuki writes that many instances of bureaucratic rivalry  have also been reported between the Labor Standards and  Employment Security Bureaus in labor administration, giving rise  to criticisms not only within the ministry, but also from the  labor and management groups.    The article goes on to relate that sectarian jealousies at  the Labor Ministry also affect its local offices. Compared to  other ministries, the ministry has the most local branches, but  these local offices all have separate vertical command  structures divided according to bureaus. While there had been  efforts to consolidate the command structure in the early  eighties, after the Second Ad Hoc Commission on Administrative  Reform made a recommendation, these efforts failed in the face  of strong opposition from the various bureaus desperate to  protect their vested interests.    Suzuki also points out that Diet members are reluctant to  work on labor policy because this is an area not directly  connected with money or votes. Therefore, labor issues  zoku-giin [Diet members with special interests in specific  policy areas] are practically nonexistent. Consequently, it is  particularly difficult for the Labor Ministry to have its  proposed legislations passed in the Diet.    The ministry is also characterized by a serious lack of  reemployment posts for its retired bureaucrats, unlike other  more profitable ministries with a considerable number of  semigovernment organizations under their jurisdiction.  Moreover, in recent years, more people tend to find jobs  through privately published job information magazines rather  than through the Public Employment Security Offices nationwide,  the operation of which is one of the Labor Ministry's major  functions. On the whole, the ministry is portrayed to be in the  grip of a serious lack of self-confidence, and suffering from  debilitating sectarian infighting.</p>

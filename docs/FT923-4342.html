			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Waigel to orchestrate budget debate: Any doubts the opposition cares to voice will be brushed aside A strange air of unreality hangs over the great budget debate which will open today in the German Bundestag. Mr Theo Waigel, the irrepressible finance minister, will produce his plans for 1993 and medium-term targets until 1996 with the self-satisfied air of a man who has fought and won to impose strict savings on his fellow ministers. He will mock all attempts at questioning or interruption with his earthy Swabian sense of humour, refusing to give any straight answers. Then the opposition Social Democrats, led by the eminently reasonable Ms Ingrid Matthaus-Maier, will declare the whole exercise outdated and irrelevant, and demand that the finance minister return to the drawing board and redraft the entire plan. She will declare that the whole budget exercise grossly underestimates the medium- and long-term needs of the east German economy, and that urgent action is needed to cut the budget deficit and finance investment spending there to create new jobs and revive production. The minister will win the day, but the opposition may well have justice on its side. For the truth is that since Mr Waigel proudly pushed his DM435.7bn (Pounds 156.1bn) 'austerity budget' through the cabinet last July, cutting total spending to a strict 2.5 per cent growth rate (and an average 2.3 per cent per year to 1996), a new debate on financing investment in eastern Germany has blown up. The budget as tabled is in line with Mr Waigel's absolute insistence - backed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl - that the costs of unification can be financed without new tax increases, based on strict spending control and economic growth. He has succeeded in cutting key areas like defence spending (down 2.5 per cent to DM50.8bn), family spending and pensions (minus 0.5 per cent), and regional subsidies paid by the economics ministry (down 4.8 per cent). By far the biggest increases, inevitably in view of the rampant unemployment and demand for retraining and comprehensive new infrastructure investment in the east, go to the employment ministry (up 8.8 per cent to DM98.78bn) and transport (up 10.7 per cent to DM44.25bn). That is not to mention the 14.1 per cent increase in the cost of servicing the federal debt, up from DM12bn to DM13.7bn. Overall it shows creditable restraint. Yet as soon as the budget, and the medium-term finance plan, were approved by the Cabinet, concerns started to emerge that they were hopelessly unrealistic in spurning new sources of finance. Mr Waigel's medium-term restraint has only been achieved by assuming zero growth in spending in 1995, thanks to a forecast end to federal payments to the German Unity Fund (running at DM24bn a year), and to DM6bn in federal subsidies for Berlin. At the same time he is setting aside just DM13bn from those savings as a reserve to cover the debts of the Treuhand privatisation agency - a figure described as 'totally unrealistic' by Mr Helmut Wieczoreck, the SPD budget spokesman. He reckons a minimum Treuhand reserve of DM30bn will be needed. The Treuhand is supposed to be wound up in 1995, and its debts taken over by the public purse: Mr Waigel assumes that at least half the debts (currently forecast at DM250bn) will have to be taken over by the five eastern states, although they are unanimous that they have no hope of financing them. Thus the real hole in state spending - which a compulsory levy or Germany bond might finance - falls from 1995 onwards. The government has produced plans for an autobahn toll, and possible petrol tax increase, dressed up to be anything other than tax rises to finance unification. They might help pay for the huge task of restructuring the German railway system, including the amalgamation of the western Bundesbahn and the eastern Reichsbahn. Then late last month, under urgent pressure from its eastern members, the joint parliamentary group of Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) and Mr Waigel's Bavaria-based Christian Social Union (CSU) suddenly proposed a compulsory bond or levy, to be imposed on the better-paid if they were not already investing in east Germany. It was a rabbit out of a hat, produced by Mr Wolfgang Schauble, the CDU parliamentary leader, to appease the east. Instead it has caused a new bout of blood-letting within the ruling coalition, divided the CDU itself, and launched a raft of rumours about Mr Schauble seeking to destabilise the chancellor himself. There will be repeated demands for Mr Waigel to spell out his best estimates of the full long-term cost of reviving the east German economy, and then to say precisely how he hopes to finance it. That is where Chancellor Kohl's move to summon a new conference of government, opposition, employers and trade unions, to negotiate a 'solidarity pact' to finance the future needs of the east, comes into play. It will buy the coalition time to get its budgetary house in order. It may even produce a few ideas on how to bridge the budgetary gap in the years to come.  ------------------------------------------------------------------           MEDIUM-TERM FINANCE PLAN 1992-1996 (in DMbn)  ------------------------------------------------------------------                                  1992   1993   1994   1995   1996  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Expenditure                     425.1  435.7  452.0  452.0  465.0 Increase over previous year (%)     -   +2.5   +3.8      0   +2.9 Income: a. tax income                   350.2  367.5  394.1  401.0  421.4 b. other income*                 34.4   30.2   28.6   25.0   21.6 Net borrowing requirement        40.5   38.0   29.3   26.0   22.0  ------------------------------------------------------------------ * Includes Bundesbank profits, post office transfers, etc.  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Source: Federal Ministry of Finance.  ------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 3 (YONHAP) -- Former President No Tae-u  left the country Saturday afternoon for Germany to attend the  12th meeting of the international council of former heads of  government (IAC) taking place in Dresden on June 7-10.    No will return home on June 13 from the trip which is his  first overseas travel since he left the presidency in February  last year.    He was seen off at the Kimpo Airport by about 50 former  senior administration and Chongwadae [presidential offices]  officials under his presidency. They included the five  ex-premiers under him -- Kang Yong-hun, Chong Won-sik, Yi  Hyon-chae, No Chae-pong and Hyon Sung-chong.    "I think it is significant and worthwhile for me to help the  country and government taking advantage of various experiences I  had in five years in the past," No said at the airport.    He was accompanied to the visit by former Chongwadae  spokesman Kim Hak-chun, his secretary No Mun-song and two others.</p>

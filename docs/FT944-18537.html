			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: New York Economic data due in the coming days will determine whether the Federal Reserve was right not to raise interest rates again last week, or whether it has taken too sanguine a view on inflation. September's employment report, which is due on Friday, is widely expected to show a pick-up in employment growth from the relatively low level of August. However, at a predicted 230,000 to 300,000, the increase in non-farm payrolls may not be the figure the bond market watches most closely. A fall in the unemployment rate to below 6 per cent (it was 6.1 per cent in August) would prove more damaging to fixed income prices. Among other figures the markets will have to chew on this week will be September's NAPM index, published today. After the decline in August to 56.2, this barometer of purchasing managers' activity is expected to bounce back to anything from 56.5 to 57. Evidence of faster economic growth would suggest that the Federal Reserve was wrong not to act pre-emptively to raise rates, and leave it in the unenviable position of having to act ahead of its next policy-making meeting, in November. However, at 7.8 per cent - up from around 7.4 per cent a month ago - the yield on long-dated bonds may already have anticipated much of the bad news.</p>

			<p>940316 FT  16 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Time for minister to speed up the search Sir, Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, has called for councils to handle standard enquiries 'within 10 working days' ('Quicker land searches urged', March 12). In the last years of the 20th century this is an absurd call. Mr Gummer should seek to ensure, as a matter of urgency, that the whole of the conveyancing process should become a real-time screen-to-screen process. The hardware, the software and the technical know-how to effect this are all immediately available to his department. At a stroke, conveyancing could, if the will were there, become a fast, efficient and cheap process which would benefit 99 per cent of the nation at the expense of 1 per cent (the lawyers). J M L Stone, chairman, Property Intelligence, 13-15 John Adam Street, London WC2N 6LD</p>

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Microvitec doubles to Pounds 1.1m Microvitec, the Bradford-based software, networking and display systems group, continued its recovery with doubled pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30. The surplus was Pounds 1.12m (Pounds 570,000) on turnover up 16 per cent at Pounds 20.9m, compared with Pounds 17.9m, which included Pounds 1.88m for discontinued operations. Earnings per share rose 59 per cent, from 0.78p to 1.24p. There is again no interim dividend but, following a capital restructuring in March, the board believes it will be able to return to the dividend list at the year end. Gearing has been further reduced from 48 per cent at the end of December to 38 per cent.</p>

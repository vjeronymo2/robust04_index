			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / IG Metall raises compromise hope Leaders of Germany's 3.4m-strong IG Metall engineering workers' union yesterday indicated a readiness to compromise in their current pay dispute, as more than 140,000 workers downed tools in brief token strikes. Mr Walter Riester, deputy leader of the union, gave a clear hint that he would consider flexible deals for individual enterprises, and drop the current union demand for a 5.5 per cent pay rise, in exchange for measures to ensure greater job security. He still insisted that there must be at least a nominal wage increase, as against the outright pay freeze sought by Gesamtmetall, the engineering employers' federation. He was speaking as workers across the country downed tools for up to three hours in support of the pay claim, more than double the 60,000 who took part on Monday. However, few observers believe the union would endanger jobs with a full-scale strike.</p>

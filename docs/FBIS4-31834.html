			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Jacek Saryusz-Wolski, Polish Government </F> plenipotentiary for European integration affairs, by  correspondent Roman Warszewski; place and date not given]    [Text] [Warszewski] Mr. Minister, the 10th Europartenariat  conference is due to open in a few moments. This year the  organization of the conference was entrusted to the Polish side.  What expectations does your office attach to this event?    [Saryusz-Wolski] I will not deny that our expectations are  quite considerable. The present conference is the largest  all-European event that has been organized in our country to  date. In that sense it is a kind of test for us: a practical  examination of our ability to organize undertakings of this  kind. Second, it is the first time that the Europartenariat  conference has been held outside the geographical confines of  the European Union [EU] . Depending on how well we carry it out,  other countries which aspire to EU membership may be given a  chance to organize the conference on their own ground in the  future. I am thinking here first and foremost of our partners  in the Visegrad Group. So, even though most of them are  probably very envious of us, we can be certain that they are  keeping their fingers crossed for us, too.    [Warszewski] But why was Poland selected to host the  conference in the first place?    [Saryusz-Wolski] Leaving false modesty aside, I can tell you  that it was because we have a very good rating in Brussels, that  is, in the EU central structures. We head the list of the  countries recently associated with the EU in almost every  aspect, if not actually in every single "discipline." We are  often actually ahead of the EU Commission's expectations in  submitting our recommendations and suggestions; we also record  the highest economic growth on the whole European continent.  Consequently, we regard the fact that we were offered the  opportunity to organize the Europartenariat meeting here as a  privilege, and at the same time we view it as a serious  obligation. We are aware that the EU has watched the standard  and quality of the preparatory work we have put into organizing  this event very carefully, just as it will watch us during the  course of the event itself. I hope that this test will go well  for us. In fact, I think that it could go much better than  Brussels expects.    [Warszewski] Apart from the purely promotional and  propaganda significance which it undoubtedly carries, is the  Europartenariat important from the economic viewpoint?    [Saryusz-Wolski] Its importance lies predominantly in the  economic sphere. The promotional aspect is just in addition to  that. The Europartenariat is an all-European forum for contacts  between medium-sized and small companies. It fosters creation  and tightening of close cooperation links. After all, it is  precisely that category of companies -- relatively small --  which constitute the most essential basic structures of healthy  European economies. They are the first and quickest to react to  the signals coming from the markets, they adopt technological  innovations with the greatest ease, and they are a particularly  effective tool in the fight against unemployment. In this  sphere, Poland has quite a lot of ground to cover before it  catches up with other countries. Large enterprises still  dominate the structure of our industry. This proportion must be  reversed as soon as possible, or else our strategic objective,  that is, EU membership, will recede into complete unreality. I  hope that the Europartenariat is able to successfully accelerate  all changes in that direction.    [Warszewski] When, in your opinion, will Poland stand a  realistic chance of joining the EU?    [Saryusz-Wolski] At the moment, no one in Europe is willing  to set a precise date for us. However, we believe that there is  a chance that we will be entering the new millennium already as  fully fledged EU members. As time goes on, we encounter less  and less surprise from the other side when we broach this  subject. We learn to understand the expectations harbored by  Brussels, while Brussels appears to comprehend our aspirations  better and better. It is all a rather complex process of mutual  learning about each other. Let us hope that this process will  be relatively quick.    [Warszewski] Professor Richard Baldwin's report on this  subject, which received a very thorough review and analysis in  POLITYKA not so long ago, is much less optimistic on this point.  Prof. Baldwin insists that a true accession to the EU of the  countries belonging to the Visegrad Group will realistically  take a minimum of 25-30 years.    [Saryusz-Wolski] That report is a most misleading and highly  tendentious document. We are well acquainted with it. During  his latest visit to Poland, EU Commission Chairman Jacques  Delors expressed a highly skeptical opinion about it. The  report does not actually express the official EU opinion: It is  only a study which was financed by the EU Commission. That is a  fundamental difference. After all, there are hundreds of  different reports circulating around the Commission. Many of  them are highly positive in their assessments of our chances.  In our view, the Baldwin Report suffers from a number of  methodological shortcomings. If you are determined to dissuade  someone from something, you will use any means available. We  intend to prepare an official public statement in this matter  shortly.    [Warszewski] But is it not, by any chance, the case that we  are not yet altogether certain what kind of Union we will be  joining? That organization is at present undergoing a process  of most dynamic development. It is not yet completely certain  what the transformation result will be.    [Saryusz-Wolski] Indeed it is not. However, we do not have  too much of a choice. The uniting Europe is for us the only  strategic direction for the future. Some time ago I said that  we must shoot at the duck not where it is now, but where it will  be in the year 2000. I believe that, to a certain extent, this  holds true for our situation today.    [Warszewski] Assuming that we manage that feat, will the  duck turn out to be a tasty dish?    [Saryusz-Wolski] That will also depend on us and on whether  we succeed in making the best use of the years we have left  until we join the EU as a full member. But the Union, too, must  learn certain things. I have already mentioned the need for all  Europe to engage in a learning process: It goes without saying  that it cannot be a one-sided process. Our own transformation  prior to our joining the EU is certain to take much time and  effort, but in the long run it should ultimately bring tangible  advantages to all citizens. A united Europe cannot be decreed  by official declarations: It must be a consequence of the  beliefs held by its citizens. This is the only way which can  lead to a truly united continent.    [Warszewski] I understand that the Europartenariat poses  itself the same objective. How much shorter will our road to  Brussels be after the present conference?    [Saryusz-Wolski] It will certainly be shorter, that is  beyond question. I can even tell you precisely how much  shorter. It will be shorter by the 10th Europartenariat!    [Warszewski] Thank you for talking to us.</p>

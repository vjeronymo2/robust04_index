			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Fishing: Down-at-eel duo's Test catch special WARNING: there are aspects of the following narrative which some may find offensive. There is no sex, gratuitous or otherwise, and all gross and vile language has been edited out. But there are scenes which may be considered depraved. They involve, among other things, a manure heap, worms and eels. I fear that I could incur the disgust of the purist/traditionalist - the man who splutters at limited-over cricket, quivers at the prospect of professional rugby union, and believes politicians should put the interests of the country before their own. Such a man (if he knows anything about the river Test in Hampshire) will take a dim view of someone who, invited to fish on the most famous trout stream in the world, arrives harbouring ambitions against eels. It is difficult to convey to a non-angler the degree of the impropriety. To appear at Henley in a kayak, at Lord's with a baseball bat, or to shoot at a crow on a grouse moor might give some idea of my offence. I could not help it, though. I know I should have been thinking of trout as I bowled down the Test valley past villages like Bossington and Mottisfont, hallowed by dry fly men through the ages. But the eels kept intruding. In my car, next to the fly rod and waders, was the eel tackle. The eel gets a bad press. It is despised and reviled, relegated to the piscatorial ghetto. Its appearance is hideous. Its sliminess and convulsive muscularity make it horrible to touch. Its feeding habits are not salubrious. It lurks in dark places, crawls along ditches at night, and travels halfway around the world to mate. My defence of my conduct is that it was going to be a long day and a hot one; that I knew the trout would not rise properly until the evening; that I wished to defy convention; and that I have a soft spot for eels. So does my friend Stephen, who had also been invited, which was why we were soon scavenging in a large manure heap for nasty brandling worms. While the others dozed in the heat of the afternoon, the hunters hunted. We stalked the banks, searching the water for the tell-tale wave of an eelish tail or the movement of its questing snout. Against the pale, chalky bottom they showed up well. Once located, the fun began. The skill was to land the worms a foot or so beyond the snout, to see the bait on the gravel, and to wait for the savour to activate the eel's foraging instincts. As often as not, the snout would eventually move up towards the worms, descend on them, then drift away. A sharp strike, a brief tussle, and the thrashing beast was on the bank. A boot was then jammed on its neck while the hook was removed, and into the bucket it went. It took us a while to master this new art. With only one rod there were disagreements of a who-does-what nature. The heat and the tension rendered us somewhat overwrought. Worms were cast round rushes, strikes were missed, oaths were uttered. But, by the end of the session, there were half-a-dozen in the bucket and the talk was of eel fillets on the barbecue. Stephen, an expert in such matters, described the technique of skinning. Nails came into it, and pliers, but I shall spare you the grislier details. I would, however, like to commend the attitude taken by our hosts. They were, initially, uncomprehending. Requests for a garden fork and directions to the manure were received with bemusement. Unanswered questions - 'Can they really be serious?' - hung in the air. But when they knew we were happy, they were happy, too, which made them the best sort of hosts. And when it comes to entertaining small children, live eels in a bucket beat a dead trout any time. Eventually, we exhausted the thrills of eel-hunting and our minds were recalled to higher things, such as the spotted trout. A delicious evening fell. As the sun declined, taking the glare off the water, the river came to life. Sedges began to hatch, and the trout to chase them. Stephen, who had removed his trousers because of the heat and was standing in the water in a pair of green checked underpants, rose and missed a fish four times. He looked at his hook, found there wasn't one, put on a new fly, caught a chub and yelled with rage and disbelief. Soon, though, he was catching proper fish. We all were. A glowing moon rose behind us, and between it and the molten sky in the west flowed the Test, dark and alive with feeding fish. I had a brace of spanking grayling and three trout, all returned. The last fish was a violent, hook-jawed bruiser which must have been close in weight to the four-pounder I had landed in the morning before eel frenzy took hold. Thanks to Test trout, Test eels and kind friends, it had been a magical day.</p>

			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> 3 HELD AFTER GUNS DISCOVERED IN TRUCK  </P> <P> Three men were arrested Friday after CHP officers discovered three loaded,  sawed-off shotguns in their truck during a routine traffic stop, which ended in  an altercation, authorities said.  </P> <P> Alan Westley Williams, 25, of Nipomo was arrested on suspicion of battery on a  police officer and possession of concealed weapons in a vehicle, authorities  said.  </P> <P> Driver David Grose, 30, of Canoga Park was arrested on suspicion of possession  of a controlled substance and possession of a concealed weapon in a vehicle,  CHP officers said. Grose was being held in the Ventura County Jail in lieu of  $5,000 bail, a jail spokesman said.  </P> <P> Michael Reed, 40, of Mojave was arrested on suspicion of being an ex-felon in  possession of firearms and outstanding warrants, officials said. Reed was being  held in lieu of $25,500 bail, a jail spokesman said.  </P> <P> The arrests occurred about 3:30 a.m. after two officers noticed a Ford pickup  without lights southbound on the Ventura Freeway near the Telephone Road  off-ramp in Ventura, CHP Officer Jim Utter said.  </P> <P> During the traffic stop, all three men got out of their truck. Reed looked  under the hood, apparently in an effort to figure out why the lights were not  working, Utter said. Grose followed one officer to the patrol car to receive  his citation, Utter said.  </P> <P> The second officer noticed weapons under the seat of the truck and told  Williams to step up on the curb. Instead, Williams struck him, Utter said.  </P> <P> A struggle between Williams and the officer ensued. Williams suffered some head  and rib injuries. He was taken to the Ventura County Medical Center for  treatment and was later transferred to the jail, Utter said. The officers were  not injured, Utter said.  </P> <P> Officers discovered the guns, numerous knives and a small quantity of drugs,  which are being analyzed, Utter said. CAROL WATSON  </P></p>

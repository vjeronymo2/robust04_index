			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / International Company News: The Gap posts 49% increase THE GAP, the fast-growing US fashion chain, yesterday announced a sharp 49 per cent improvement in fourth-quarter profits, to Dollars 83.9m after tax, compared with Dollars 56.5m in the same period a year earlier. The profits advance came on sales of Dollars 803.5m, against Dollars 624.7m in the three months to February 2, 1991. However, part of the rise derives from the expansion of the chain - which operates 1,216 stores - while same-store sales increased by 12 per cent. The fourth-quarter figures leave The Gap with profits of Dollars 229.9m after tax for the year. In 1990-91, the figure was Dollars 144.5m. Net sales for the year were Dollars 2.52bn, up from Dollars 1.93bn last time. Comparable store sales increased by 13 per cent. Although at the earnings per share level, the results were roughly in line with expectations, The Gap shares fell Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 45 3/4 on the news. The Gap figures came as many big US retailers posted their sales figures for February - showing a mixed bag of results, particularly when the effect of the Iraq conflict on last year's figures is borne in mind. The Gap revealed a 7 per cent improvement from comparable stores. The star remained Wal-Mart, the Arkansas-based discount retailer which posted an overall sales gain of 34 per cent, and a sharp 20 per cent rise on a same store basis. At Neiman Marcus, the rise was 5.7 per cent; at JC Penney, 8.6 per cent; Dayton Hudson, 6 per cent and Sears Roebuck, 8.9 per cent (all on a comparable store basis). Not everyone fared this well; at May Department Stores, same store sales were up by 4 per cent overall, while Woolworth managed a modest 3.1 per cent from domestic comparable stores. RH Macy plans to close five I Magnin stores, all its Fantasies by Morgan Taylor speciality stores and several other stores in its speciality store divisions in order to improve operating performance, Reuters reports from New York. After the closures, it will have 19 I Magnins. Macy said that it will focus the chain in the west coast and desert resort areas. The company said that it will close three of its 37 Aeropostale speciality stores, about 15 of its 35 Charter Club speciality stores, and all its 34 Fantasies stores.</p>

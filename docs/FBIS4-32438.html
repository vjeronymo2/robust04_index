			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Union of Freedom </F> chairman and former prime minister, by correspondent Bohdan  Onichimowski; place and date not given]    [Text] [Onichimowski] Your name is associated with the  launch of the "Polish five minutes" in the history of  contemporary Europe. Are these five minutes finished now?    [Mazowiecki] These five minutes have already lasted five  years, and those five years could well have been 15 if we judge  by the larger-than-life scale of the events that took place  then. Whether our five minutes are still going on is a different  question altogether. Certain fundamental issues have been  resolved already. We are an independent and autonomous state,  all decisions about us are made here and not somewhere else, and  the direction of our economic future has been determined. You  could say that we are now at a new moment in our history: The  first stage is gone, and we must begin to build the second one.    [Onichimowski] But is the run of good luck for Poland in the  international arena still with us?    [Mazowiecki] It is quite surprising, but Poland's economic  achievements are noted with approval against the background of  Central and East Europe as a whole. It is even said that we are  the "economic tigers" in this part of the continent. So you can  see that the judgment of outside observers is much more  favorable than those from commentators at home. Of course, I  understand that such outside arguments are no good when it comes  to convincing an unemployed person that our economy is good, but  when you look at the problem in the light of all considerations,  the opinions and the forecasts are good.    [Onichimowski] A few days ago, Jacek Kuron said that our  road to Europe leads through the East--via Minsk, Kiev, and  Moscow....    [Mazowiecki] I believe that this slogan conveyed the idea  that good, open relations with these countries will result in an  extended Europe, and, from Europe's viewpoint, the way in which  Poland relates to these neighbors is most important.    [Onichimowski] But do you not believe that, at present,  cooperation with these states has, as it were, slowed down a  little?    [Mazowiecki] There is something in what you are saying. I  believe that we must galvanize our foreign and economic  policies. I can also say that I believe Minister Olechowski is  trying to do just that. I agree with those who believe that any  oversight on our part in these areas would be a serious mistake.  However, there is also a wider phenomenon to be considered:  The green grass of our new social and economic processes often  grows faster than we think. I was once guest at a conference  organized by the Robert Schuman Foundation, attended by  delegates of a variety of associations and organizations of a  pro-European persuasion, and I realized that there are very many  such bodies in Poland. So I hope that there are also  associations and organizations that are thinking of developing  the eastward direction. And, if there are none, we must set  them up and encourage them to be active.    [Onichimowski] We heard recently from a group of Bundestag  deputies visiting Szczecin that our full participation in  European structures would be conditional on making land  available for sale without any restrictions. Would you accept  such a condition if you were prime minister?    [Mazowiecki] All countries have certain regulations  regulating the sale of land to foreigners. You must not  preclude the possibility of such transactions, but the state can  control their form and extent. Such control mechanisms are a  normal thing and should be preserved.    [Onichimowski] As I point out that next year will see the  50th anniversary of the inclusion of Szczecin within our  national territory, let me also remind you that you have special  obligations toward the citizens of Szczecin. Should we remember  our city's 50th anniversary, or should we forget it because it  was politically incorrect forces that captured the city and  politically incorrect decisions that decreed it would henceforth  belong to Poland?    [Mazowiecki] No, no.... The anniversary is a most important  occasion, and Szczecin, which is a very fine port city, has a  significant role to play in both Poland and Europe.    [Onichimowski] This sounds a bit as if you were trying to  canvas for Szczecinians' votes in the forthcoming election....    [Mazowiecki] I intend to do that, too. I believe that the  vote of confidence I received here will be extended to  accommodate voters' confidence in the Union of Freedom. I have  already noted that the influence wielded by the Union of Freedom  in this region is growing steadily, and our activists and  sympathizers are dynamic individuals who want to achieve great  things not so much for the party as such, but for the whole  region--and who are capable of achieving it. Let me tell  you--and this is not a superficial compliment--that the Szczecin  region could easily become one of the best-developing areas of  Poland.    [Onichimowski] Thank you for talking with us.</p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 21ST-CENTURY IDEAS FOR TRANSPORTATION NEEDED  </P> <P> Re "Caltrans Embarks Upon the Road to Tomorrow" (July 24):  </P> <P> More freeways, another lane on our freeways, encouraging more cars on existing  freeways achieved with new technologies have not and will not solve our  "transportation dilemma," so aptly described by Tom Nielsen, vice chairman of  the Irvine Co.  </P> <P> This "freeway gridlock thinking" will add hundreds of millions of dollars to  the cost of building freeways (what a misnomer), and increase the pollution of  our already sickly, graying atmosphere.  </P> <P> Isn't it about time we commence to break out of this "gridlock automobile-bound  thinking" and start contemplating in rational terms transportation alternatives  for moving people?  </P> <P> Engineering studies show that in many areas of Orange County, including the 5,  405 and 55 freeways, to provide for the anticipated growth by 1993-95 will  require 16 to 20 or more lanes in each direction if we think solely in terms of  the automobile. We must think in 21st-Century terms of "transporting people,"  and refuse to continue to be so influenced and dominated by the automobile  industry.  </P> <P> Japan, for example, under the theme of the "Pulse of Change," is achieving a  rapidly evolving transportation system, including its high-speed surface  transport train that has magnetic flotation linear motor propulsion with no  wheels and is virtually pollution free.  </P> <P> A recent speech by Gov. George Deukmejian has alerted us to the fact that  billions of dollars are being wasted here in California each year as a result  of our inadequate and antiquated transportation systems. The freeways and  parkways of America are among the man-made wonders of the world. However, like  the pyramids of Egypt, they are rapidly becoming archaic.  </P> <P> Rather than continuing with Caltrans' myopic approach, which is offering more  of the same congestion and seriously adding to the pollution, many citizens  say, "Let's put the 'Buckminster Fullers' to work to revive our transportation  systems to lead us into the 21st Century!" Let's continue to work, not in  defense and war efforts, but rather work together to improve the quality of  life for all of us and share with the world practical concepts for moving  people.  </P> <P> DAVID B.

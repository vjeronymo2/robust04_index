			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / World Bond Markets: Activity switches to floating rate notes  -International 'First there was the orgy, then came the uncertainty, and then the real horror sunk in.' That is how one syndicate manager describes the first three months of this year in the international bond market - and it is a view probably shared by many syndicate officials as they wonder just how to match last year's record figures. The Bacchanalian start to 1994 certainly came as a surprise, since usually the period after Christmas and New Year is fairly quiet in terms of new issuance. Yet day after day, new deals flooded into the market as borrowers rushed to get a head start with their annual borrowing plans. Then the US Federal Reserve threw a spanner in the works with a quarter point rise in interest rates on February 4, and for weeks the world's financial markets remained jittery and distinctly nervous about the future direction of US interest rates. The Fed's decision to hike up rates by a further 25 basis points on March 22 confirmed market fears that one rate rise would not be enough to nip inflationary pressures in the bud. The response among borrowers and lead managers to the rising interest rate scenario has been either to postpone their new issues until conditions improve or to tap the floating rate note sector instead. In fact, taking the strong start to the year and the pronounced switch into floating rate notes together, the total volume of new issues in the first quarter is not dramatically lower than in 1993. Total new issues amounted to Dollars 110bn in the first quarter this year, down 7 per cent on the comparable quarter in 1993. But the interesting point is that floating rate notes make up a much higher proportion of the total new issuance this year: borrowers launched the equivalent of Dollars 34.1bn in FRNs, corresponding to 31 per cent of total new issues (and mainly denominated in US dollars), compared with a total of Dollars 17.1bn in the first quarter of 1993 (or 14 per cent of total new issues), according to figures compiled by Euromoney. 'For borrowers, floating rate notes are more cost-effective than fixed rate bonds at the moment,' points out one FRN specialist at a US house. The attraction of FRNs for investors is that the coupon is reset - usually every three or six months - in line with money market rates. 'Floaters are supposed to provide investors with capital protection, trading at around par (100),' says Mr Charlie Berman, syndicate manager at Salomon Brothers. There is some scope for capital gain if the credit rating of the borrower undergoes an improvement or is seen as a likely upgrade candidate. Central banks and money funds are the traditional buyers of sovereign floaters with sub-Libor coupons, although recently this type of paper has been seen as a safe temporary parking place for money by a wider range of fund managers. The problem is that the market has probably seen too much new FRN paper launched in the last couple of months: some of the recent deals are still partly unplaced, and several have shown a disappointing price performance while yields have widened. 'The FRN sector should have been a stellar performer,' says Mr Tim Skeet, senior vice-president of Kidder Peabody syndicate desk in London, 'but there's been so much supply that, at a time when you would expect the market to be strong, the price performance of some of these issues has been disappointing. There are still opportunities for borrowers but it's a case of getting the pricing and timing right'. The glut of new - and often aggressively-priced - FRN supply has led to accusations that the lead managers are simply buying market share. 'If you are a big Eurobond house and you need to do something in these market conditions, what do you do? Floaters are just about the only thing you can do, and you have seen houses which a year ago did no FRN business suddenly bringing badly priced deals,' says one syndicate official. After the bumper profits and mega-bonuses of 1993, the shift in sentiment does not augur well for the bond houses. 'I'd be willing to bet there's a correlation between position in the league table and the amount of red ink in the profit and loss account for the first quarter,' said one official. For the lower fees brought in by floating rate paper (compared with fixed rate bonds) and the fact that syndicates are sitting on a lot of unsold paper which has fallen in price and widened in spread suggests that profitability - at least in the first quarter - will be less than a year ago.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       TOP EUROBOND LEAD MANAGERS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       First quarter of 1994     First quarter of 1993                    Dollars                     Dollars Manager              bn    Rank    %   Issues     bn   Rank    %  Issues  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CSFB/Credit Suisse  8.71     1   7.74    25      6.20    4   5.19    26 Merrill Lynch       7.96     2   7.08    30      4.78    6   4.00    21 Goldman Sachs       7.11     3   6.32    25      9.01    2   7.54    33 UBS                 5.18     4   4.60    14      3.39   12   2.84    19 Morgan Stanley      4.83     5   4.29    26      4.80    5   4.02    20 Societe Generale    4.77     6   4.24    17      0.97   31   0.81     6 Deutsche Bank       4.76     7   4.23    24     11.84    1   9.92    29 Lehman Brothers     4.58     8   4.07    20      3.73    9   3.13    21 JP Morgan           4.42     9   3.93    16      3.30   13   2.76    18 Daiwa               3.86    10   3.43    17      3.26   14   2.73    21 Industry totals   112.53        100.0   522    119.37       100.0   502  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Full credit to book runner  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Euromoney Bondware  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       EUROBOND ISSUES BY CURRENCY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1994*             Total raised   No. of    1993*  Total raised   No. of Rank  Currency    (Dollars bn)   issues    Rank   (Dollars bn)   issues  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1     USDollars       49.49        227      1         40.10        184 2     Sterling        13.62         51      3         13.56         67 3     FFr             10.86         42      6          9.12         41 4     D-Mark           9.02         35      2         23.62         54 5     Yen              8.79         44      5         11.75         47 6     CDollars         4.96         23      4         13.00         62 7     Lire             4.45         30      9          1.73         12 8     Guilder          4.41         23      7          3.07         12 9     Ecu              3.09         12      8          1.89          4 10    ADollars         1.70         19     10          1.04         10  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *First quarter  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Euromoney Bondware  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Romania approves IMF-led reforms The Romanian senate last night approved a tough economic reform package agreed with the International Monetary Fund that will clear the way for an 18-month standby arrangement and loans worth Dollars 700m, writes Virginia Marsh from Bucharest. Under the arrangement, the Romanian government has agreed to liberalise the exchange rate by April, to take measures to cut inflation which jumped to 296 per cent in 1993, and to restructure and privatise the state sector. The government reached agreement with the fund in December but, due to political disputes with its left-wing and nationalist allies, did not present the programme to parliament for ratification until this week. The loans will provide Romania with badly-needed balance of payments support. The central bank's hard currency reserves fell to just Dollars 40m in December.</p>

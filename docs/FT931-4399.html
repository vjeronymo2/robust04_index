			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Accountancy Column: Do not try to deliver the undeliverable  -The McFarlane report from the Auditing Practices Board is largely misguided The consultation period for the McFarlane report from the Auditing Practices Board on the future development of auditing closes later this month. We believe its findings are largely misguided. We favour a more effective system of monitoring and improving standards within the existing statutory framework. We believe there are limits to the assurance that auditors can reasonably be expected to provide to the ever-widening range of users of accounts. The APB's document, by contrast, invites auditors to accept responsibility for delivering the undeliverable, and blurs the crucial distinction between directors' and auditors' responsibilities. Its proposals are aimed at ending the expectations gap, and indeed they will. But only by creating an abyss in its place. The paper criticises auditors' 'narrow interpretation' of their statutory duties, causing them to focus on the company's past record as laid down in company law. But these duties have been consistently and clearly laid down in successive statutes since 1844 and there is little scope for 'interpretation', narrow or wide. A change in focus from past to future performance would require rather more than a change in interpretation. The APB says: 'There is a demand for auditors to recognise the interests of a wider group than shareholders alone.' Indeed there is, and such an awareness of other interests has been reflected in auditors' standard risk assessment checklists and planning memoranda for a dozen years or more. Such recognition of legitimate third party interests lies within the existing framework of auditing. The APB claims that the present scope of audit and the legal framework in which it is conducted 'militates against auditors successfully meeting the needs of shareholders and others with an interest in the audit process'. We believe the problem lies rather with poor standards of auditing and the seeming inability to date of the regulatory bodies or government to impose any effective sanctions on the individuals and firms responsible. It also overlooks the vast majority of audit appointments in which user expectations are amply satisfied. In cases of widely publicised 'public interest' scandals, auditors are invariably criticised for defective work within existing law and standards. The proposals ignore small company audits. This is consistent with the composition of APB's own membership, and with the fact that it has not produced any guidance on small company audits despite being presented with a complete draft guideline by its predecessor body nearly two years ago. The APB refers to 'perceived gaps in the scope of the audit, particularly regarding directors' stewardship, future prospects and risks, fraud, internal controls and interim reporting'. It is perhaps here that the lack of realism that pervades the entire document shows most palpably. This is a collection of wishful objectives; long on ends, but short on means. All third parties - especially competitors and predators - would dearly wish to have an objective evaluation of directors' performance and stewardship, and of the company's future prospects and risks. But it is grossly implausible to expect to receive such insubstantial indications from any source, least of all from the statutory auditors. The paper calls for auditors to report on the adequacy of 'financial and other relevant risk management controls' and states that 'it is realistic to expect auditors to respond to regulators' requests and to take on a role in relation to a potentially growing demand for monitoring basic ethical standards of corporate behaviour'. It is in the nature of such ethereal notions that they are not readily susceptible to audit scrutiny or analysis. If the regulators themselves, with their unfettered statutory powers of investigation, cannot satisfy themselves on these matters, can auditors be expected to do more? In our opinion, if auditors are required to trespass on the realms of regulators, audit committees and non-executives who are directly responsible for corporate governance, their existing and sufficiently onerous reporting functions will suffer serious neglect. The APB proposes that directors should provide, and auditors report on, a summary of the principal assumptions and judgments made by the directors in preparing the financial statements. Normal audit procedures are already designed to assess the reasonableness of the directors' assumptions and judgments reflected in the accounts. If the auditors regard them as reasonable, their separate disclosure would add nothing to the truth and fairness of the accounts. If they regard them as materially unreasonable, existing provisions require the audit report to be appropriately qualified. The APB is anxious to involve shareholders directly with a view to resolving the 'perceived lack of independence in the attitude of auditors and in the conduct of their relationship with directors'. It suggests creating an 'audit panel' to represent shareholders, or a small group elected by shareholders to meet the auditors to discuss issues arising from the audit. Investors in listed companies do not see it as their responsibility to take on any direct invigilating function in relation to the conduct of the directors and auditors of the companies in which they invest. Only institutional shareholders would be capable of making any sense of such a role, and they are already quite clear as to their requirements from both directors and auditors. The remedy for both corporate and audit failure is to make existing legal and disciplinary machinery more effective, not to involve shareholders in a quasi-executive watchdog role. We believe that the establishment of shareholder pressure groups will seriously undermine the legal autonomy and accountability of both executive and non-executive directors, and their ability to operate effectively in the best interests of the shareholders as a body. The paper recognises the need to rationalise the potential liability of auditors under the present legal system before extending their roles and responsibilities. What it does not address is the key issue of the exposure to litigation from all the third parties embraced by a widening of audit accountability. A flurry of law-reforming zeal follows every scandal-tainted wave of collapses - whether induced by ineptitude, delinquency or just plain daylight robbery. We are told that higher standards of stewardship and audit need to be legislated. Yet every misdemeanour committed was already against the law; and every failed audit was condemned by reference to current laws and standards. The sensible issues to focus on are therefore the enhancement and enforcement of the laws and standards we already have. Audit regulation has given the professional bodies more clout over the activities of their membership than ever before. We need prompt disciplinary hearings, widely-publicised findings, the suspension of audit registrations and financial penalties that really hurt. As to the costs, the scale of which are scarcely imaginable, we propose that the panoply of beneficiaries of the APB proposals should be consulted on what they are prepared to contribute towards this new age of auditing. In our opinion that should settle the whole issue fairly efficiently and conclusively. In all other respects, the APB has produced a great paper.

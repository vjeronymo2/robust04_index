			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ILLINOIS LEGISLATORS BLOCK ABORTION BILL  </P> <P> An Illinois House committee today voted to block further action on abortion  restrictions designed to mirror the Missouri law upheld in July by the U.S.  Supreme Court.  </P> <P> The measure fell one vote short of the 10 needed to clear the House Rules  Committee and move to the full House. Nine lawmakers voted in favor of the  measure, eight against.  </P> <P> Anti-abortion lawmakers have said they might try to bypass the committee and  bring the issue to the House, but some parliamentary experts have questioned  whether that is possible.  </P> <P> In a brief debate before the vote, anti-abortion lawmakers said the measure  adheres to the guidelines set down by the Supreme Court and that it was an  emergency.  </P> <P> Pro-choice lawmakers argued that the measure was being rushed to final passage  and amounts to "harassment" of physicians and women needing late-term  abortions.  </P></p>

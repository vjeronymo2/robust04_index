			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Shift in pension tax incentives planned THE Department of Social Security has let it be known that it is studying how to shift its system of tax incentives for personal pensions to give greater benefits to older people at the expense of younger ones. For the personal pension policyholder, this could be the best news for some time. Depending on how tax rebates are restructured, it could offer large tax incentives to those in their 50s earning high salaries. However, it will mean that people in their early 20s will no longer be offered the generous tax incentives which have encouraged millions to sign up for personal pensions. The debate over whether the government should maintain its system of flat tax rebates or stagger them according to age is a complex one. Initially, the government chose flat rate rebates for two reasons: administering staggered rebates would be difficult; and the life insurance industry believed that unless young people were offered big inducements, they would not buy pensions at all. From the government's point of view, the question is how tax incentives can best be structured to encourage people to choose personal pensions over those provided by the state. Evidence suggests that the current structure does not do so. The National Audit Office in 1991 estimated that the tax rebates offered to personal pension holders between 1988 and 1993 will cost Pounds 5.9bn more than they will save. Under the current system of flat-rate rebates, all working people are offered the same tax rebate to opt out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme. This has proved a big advantage for young people because the amount of rebate available allows them to buy a far larger pension with their contribution than they will get by contributing the same amount into Serps. However, as people age, larger contributions are theoretically needed to purchase a pension of the same size. Thus, the tax rebate is of little value to people in middle age and it is in their interest to opt back into Serps. The effect of this tax structure is that large amounts of revenue are spent encouraging people to buy personal pensions with only very small ensuing reductions in payouts by Serps. 'Only by moving to a system of age-related rebates can the government bail itself out of its embarrassment,' said Ron Spill, head of pensions at Legal and General, a big seller of personal pensions. Actuaries differ as to when it becomes unattractive to remain contracted out of Serps. But at the current level of rebate of 5.8 per cent of tax on the upper band of average earnings, most actuaries believe that men in their late 40s and women in their early 40s would be better off contracting back into Serps. On Monday, Peter Lilley the Social Security secretary, is to lay a bill before Parliament reducing the tax rebate to 4.8 percent with a one per cent additional rebate for those over 30. This is expected to cost Pounds 165m in tax rebates in the 1994-95 year but will save an estimated Pounds 200m in Serps expenditure by keeping individuals out of the system. Spill estimates that without that rebate, 1m to 1 1/2 m of the 4.7m personal pension holders in Britain would have had to opt back into Serps. Figures from the government actuary's department show that unless there is a shift to age-related rebates, the flat-rate rebate will reduce sharply into the next century. This is because the government had to set the rebate high enough to encourage older people already in Serps to opt out of it. But as those people retire, the need to maintain rebates at that high level eases and by 2016, the rebate need be no more than 3.5 percent. The department estimates that a 3.5 per cent tax rebate means that contracting out will be attractive for men only into their early 30s and for women in their late 20s. 'Women after a spell would just have to stay in Serps. It would not be worth it to contract out at all,' Spill said. If the current system remained, many people would return to Serps and no net savings would ensue. However, the government has said that it is considering a system of age-related rebates from April 1996. In addition, the government is considering whether to offer the rebates simply to personal pension holders or to members of other pension schemes such as occupational plans. Actuaries believe that because of the complexities of staggering rebates through the average 40-year working career, it is most likely that the Department of Social Security will devise a series of 'bands'. As people age and move into upper bands, they will become entitled to larger and larger tax rebates. Legal and General estimates that if the state pension age is equalised at 65, the rebate for teenage personal pension holders could be as low as two per cent rising to 11 percent for those reaching 60.</p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Sogat admits sex discrimination THE PRINT union Sogat has admitted to an industrial tribunal that it represented women members at a company less effectively than men because they were split into single-sex bargaining groups. The tribunal found that the company, security printers Thomas De La Rue, based in Gateshead, Tyne &amp; Wear, had 'knowingly aided' Sogat and its Newcastle upon Tyne branch in providing less effective collective bargaining for women than for men. The company has agreed to the tribunal findings and settled an equal-pay claim from the women. It has also promised that all future collective bargaining and access to jobs training and other benefits will be free from sex discrimination. Sogat is to reform the way it negotiates within the company. The union, led by Ms Brenda Dean, has been trying to phase out single-sex chapels (office branches) since an investigation by the Equal Opportunities Commission in the early 1980s. Four women, who had worked for the printing company for between 16 and 27 years, began their proceedings in 1989 when they claimed pay parity with male print assistants and porters. They also complained that Sogat had discriminated against them by providing less effective bargaining and protection than it provided for men-only chapels. For historical reasons, the Newcastle branch of Sogat is organised into single-sex chapels. After the claim was filed, Sogat admitted discrimination and later agreed to support the women's equal-pay claim. Mr John Mitchell, national organising secretary of Sogat, said yesterday that the union had been trying for some years to phase out single-sex chapels. The EOC, which backed the case, will have some of its costs paid for by the company. The EOC conducted an investigation in the early 1980s that led two Sogat chapels to amalgamate, and efforts had been continuing since then to end segregation. Mr Mitchell said he had put forward proposals for departmental negotiating units, instead of the current eight single-sex chapels at the factory. Mr Alan Lakin, the EOC's legal adviser, said he welcomed the positive attitude shown by the union and the company. 'Separating women's jobs for negotiating purposes is a prime cause of job segregation, which is the underlying reason for the persistent earnings gap between men and women,' he said. 'Other unions and employers must now realise that these practices have been found unlawful.'</p>

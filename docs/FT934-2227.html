			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Accounting standards changes planned Accounting standards-setters will produce proposals for changes to the reporting of pension-fund costs and deferred taxation during the next few months, the Financial Reporting Council's annual review said yesterday, Andrew Jack writes. The Accounting Standards Board, a subsidiary of the council, will also examine related-party transactions and the treatment of associates and joint ventures as part of an ambitious programme. The review shows that the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the accounting watchdog controlled by the council, considered 45 cases in the past year, as well as 19 cases outstanding at the start of the year. Eleven were not pursued, and there was action on 42 of the remaining cases. Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the council, says in the review that financial reporting is being taken seriously by all company board members. A number of 'corporate disasters' had shown the need for financial reporting to serve shareholders, creditors and employees better, he says. The review rejects any suggestion that the Accounting Standards Board is focusing on balance sheets at the expense of profit and loss accounts, or moving towards a system of current-cost accounting. It says the board will revise its process for ratifying statements of recommended practice developed by outside bodies, with new sub-committees to consider proposals in financial services and for non- profit-making organisations. It adds that the board will ask early next year for comments on the operation of its first financial reporting standard on the cashflow statement and will consider amendments.</p>

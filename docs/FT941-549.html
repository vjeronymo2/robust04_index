			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / International Company News: US carriers line up European partners American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, two of the biggest US carriers, are poised to form partnerships with European airlines. American is expected to announce next month a marketing and ticket code-sharing deal with Lot Polish Airlines, while Delta is to announce a similar deal with Austrian Airlines today. Lot has been seeking a strategic partnership as part of its efforts to modernise and expand its international services. Lot operates a modern fleet of Boeing airliners. The deal with American is not expected to involve an equity investment by the US carrier, but would lift Lot's transatlantic services to Chicago and New York by enabling the Polish carrier to tap into American's large domestic network. It is expected to help Lot compete against British Airways on transatlantic routes. The UK and Poland recently settled a four-month dispute over air services. The row, which led to the interruption of direct services between London and Warsaw, followed BA's decision to increase its flight frequencies to Warsaw. Lot argued that BA was seeking to syphon transatlantic traffic from Lot through BA connecting services from London Heathrow to the US. For American, the Lot deal would give it a partner in the growing east European market and strengthen its marketing clout when both two big US rivals, United and Delta, are establishing partnerships with European carriers. United is forming a code-sharing partnership with Lufthansa of Germany, which regards eastern Europe as an extension of its domestic market following reunification. Delta has a cross-equity link with Swissair and is about to form a marketing alliance with Austrian. Delta's deal with Austrian is not expected to involve an equity investment by the US carrier.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSM is not adopting categorical exclusions or other fixed inspection frequencies for abandoned sites beyond the minimum one per year because to do so would merely substitute one inflexible frequency for another and thus fail to achieve fully the goal of eliminating counterproductive inspections. An arbitrary fixed inspection frequency cannot account for the unique physical environment at each abandoned site nor the variation of problems that each abandoned site may pose. A fixed predetermined frequency is just as likely to yield too many inspections, or too few inspections, as it is to yield a suitable number. Categorical exclusions or inclusions also would almost certainly result in inappropriate applications of the rule in many cases. Further, the U.S. Court of Appeals explicitly acknowledged the legal defensibility of OSM's ``flexible'' implementation of statutes that allow regulatory authorities to consider the myriad site specific situations that cannot be fully anticipated in writing a Federal regulation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NWF  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hodel,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 839 F.2d 694, 745 (D.C. Cir. 1988). However, nothing in this rule would preclude regulatory authorities from establishing for administrative convenience categories of sites with similar characteristics and evaluating and documenting the necessary inspection frequency for each category as a whole. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As previously discussed, the reason inspections of abandoned sites at the frequency imposed under section 517(c) of the Act are counterproductive and a waste of resources is that enforcement actions at the inspector level are no longer effective. Alternative enforcement that must be initiated beyond the level of inspectors is generally the only viable means to compel abatement of violations or completion of reclamation at abandoned sites, even if conditions deteriorate. Where the regulatory authority is taking all appropriate enforcement action available to it as required under the definition of ``abandoned site,'' nothing more can be done through repeated inspections to reclaim a site or abate violations than is already occurring. Thus, while a fixed inspection frequency like that for active sites under the existing rules might cause the regulatory authority to be informed of a problem at an abandoned site more quickly, it will not provide any new remedy to compel compliance. Accordingly, OSM believes that the inspection frequency program under this rule strikes a sound balance between the fixed inspection frequency required for active and inactive sites and the need to periodically, but not less than once per year, inspect abandoned sites to monitor environmental conditions or other changes in the status of a site and to ensure bond forfeiture reclamation priorities are adjusted as necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since OSM is accepting NWF's suggestion to set an absolute minimum inspection frequency of not less than one complete inspection per year, &sect;&sect;840.11(h)(1)/842.11(f)(1) will not be adopted as proposed. Those proposed sections would have enabled the regulatory authority to further reduce the minimum inspection frequency required under paragraphs (h) introductory text and (f) introductory text, possibly to zero, if, based on no less than three consecutive complete annual inspections conducted during a three-year period before or after the effective date of this rule, the regulatory authority would have found in writing that an abandoned site satisfies two criteria. The first criterion would have been that no conditions or structures existed at the site that could have created an imminent danger to the health or safety of the public or an imminent harm to the environment. The second criterion would have been that the site had become reasonably stable through natural settlement or revegetation processes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eight SRAs, the NCA/AMC, the NCA and the Kentucky Coal Association supported these proposed provisions without providing substantive comments. The NWF was strongly opposed. It commented that under this proposal, inspections at some abandoned sites could be discontinued altogether even where serious deterioration of conditions occurred subsequent to the decision to suspend inspections indefinitely. They said that no State or Federal regulatory authority would have the duty to revisit the abandoned site and would have every administrative and budgetary incentive not to. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM acknowledges NWF's concern over the potential for misapplication of these proposed sections. While some abandoned sites may be so stable and so operationally defunct as to make further inspections completely unnecessary, OSM believes that deletion of these provisions will act as a safeguard against premature termination of inspections at what could be a large number of abandoned sites where conditions do not justify ending inspections altogether. OSM believes that monitoring each abandoned site at least once per year to evaluate the environmental conditions, operational status, and the bond forfeiture reclamation priority is reasonable public policy that would not excessively strain the resources of Federal or State regulatory authorities, especially since many abandoned sites are located near active and inactive sites requiring frequent inspections. Moreover, there must be some minimum in place to ensure that each abandoned site continues to be inspected at a frequency commensurate with public safety and environmental considerations present at each specific site as required under the final rule. Also, if there were no minimum frequency, the regulatory authority might not become aware, other than from information provided by citizens, that conditions had worsened to the point that a higher alternative frequency would need to be set in order for the frequency to be commensurate with the deteriorating conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

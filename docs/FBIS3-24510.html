Sokolovskiy, Atmospheric Physics </F> Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow; UDC 551.501.7]    [Abstract] A computation experiment was carried out for  retrieving geopotential and temperature by the Abelian inversion  method using meteorological field series from the data archives  of the ECHAM global model of general circulation of the  atmosphere. Numerical simulation was carried out for the  geopotential, temperature and humidity fields stipulated in a  standard Gaussian grid with a horizontal resolution 1.125  and with a vertical resolution of 19 levels in the altitude  range from the surface to 35 km. An algorithm for solution of  this problem is given. Results are presented for the  distribution of the altitude of the 200-mbar surface and the  error in its retrieval, as well as the temperature distribution  at this level and the error in its retrieval. It is shown that  the error in retrieving potential and temperature by the Abelian  inversion method is greater where the horizontal nonuniformity  of meteorological fields is greater. The maximum errors are  about 30 m for geopotential and about 1 K for temperature. These  errors indicate the possibility of using these data in weather  and climate prediction problems. Program packages make it  possible to proceed to the next step: numerical simulation of  assimilation of the retrieved (with errors) geopotential and  temperature fields in a model of general circulation of the  atmosphere for the purpose of investigating the influence of  retrieval errors on the prediction of meteorological fields.

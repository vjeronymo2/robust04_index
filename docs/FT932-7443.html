			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / British Gas set for more rows with its regulator BRITISH GAS could face further damaging clashes with its regulator following the outcome of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's investigation into the company which is due by the end of July. Instead of clearing the uncertainty surrounding the company's future business, as British Gas had hoped when it agreed to the inquiry last August, the commission could pave the way for further legal wrangles. The legal complexities could arise from the way in which the referrals to the commission were made and the expected complexity of the eventual reports. Four separate referrals to the commission were made about different parts of the company's business and under different pieces of legislation. British Gas could end up challenging any of the commission's recommendations that are implemented by its regulator. Mr Jonathan Stern, industry consultant at Gas Strategies group, said: 'There are two ways British Gas can play it. They can filibuster or they can fight it.' Sir James McKinnon, the regulator, made two of the referrals to the monopolies commission under the 1986 Gas Act and Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, made the other two under the Fair Trading Act. The commission must report on each one of these, delivering its verdicts to the body that made the initial referral. This complicated situation arose because Sir James was involved in a bitter row with British Gas last July which prompted the decision to call in the commission. Sir James had been unable to agree an appropriate rate of return for the company to earn from its pipelines business and asked the commission to investigate. British Gas retaliated by asking Mr Heseltine to widen the inquiry so that it looked at the entire market supplied by British Gas and the operation of its pipelines division. Ofgas countered with a further referral on the household supply market. The commission must firstly decide whether British Gas's monopoly in gas supply to households and in operation of the pipeline network has acted against the public interest. If it decides this has been the case, there are various remedies it can suggest. The government will have to decide whether to implement any of the commission's recommendations once it has seen its reports. This could involve passing new legislation after the commission's report has been put before parliament. Mr Heseltine can remove sensitive information from the commission's report on his referrals, before he lays it before parliament. British Gas will not receive a copy of this report until the day before publication. Separately, however, the regulator can go ahead and implement changes to the pipelines business suggested by the monopolies commission in an additional report to Ofgas without agreement from Mr Heseltine. This could draw Ofgas into conflict with the government over the details of pipelines operations. It also leaves room for British Gas to challenge Ofgas's interpretation of the commission's findings. To do this British Gas would have to request a judicial review. Ofgas will receive reports on its own referrals which it must send to British Gas straight away. The regulator must then wait until two weeks after Mr Heseltine receives his reports before it can make public the commission's findings on Sir James's referral. The number of reports and the different powers of the regulator and government over parts of British Gas's business means the outcome of the monopolies commission investigation will not be clear-cut. It could lead to months of further disagreement and shadow-boxing between British Gas, Ofgas and the Department of Trade and Industry.</p>

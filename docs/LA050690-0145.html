			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS TAKE A BEATING;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: PITCHING, HITTING PROBLEMS CONTINUE AS YANKEES BAT AROUND AGAINST  MCCASKILL ON WAY TO AN 11-3 ROMP.  </P> <P> It is a measure of the Angels' state that Luis Polonia, who has appeared in a  mere four games, already feels an urgency to do more than he can reasonably be  expected to do.  </P> <P> "Even myself, I am feeling a little bit of pressure. They expect so much from  me," said Polonia, who has scored four runs in four games. "I'm getting my hits  myself and I'm thinking I'm trying to do so much. I want to do so much for this  team. Today, I was out of control. I was getting myself out. I want to do good  so bad."  </P> <P> Bad is the way things are turning out, if not for Polonia, then for the Angels.  Their 11-3 loss to the New York Yankees Saturday before a season-high crowd of  47,933 at Anaheim Stadium was their third loss in a row, seventh in 10 games  and 12th in 17. It was also the third consecutive time their starting pitcher  was hit hard and the second time in three games their opponent reached double  figures in hits and runs.  </P> <P> In their last 26 innings, they have allowed 22 earned runs and been outscored,  26-13.  </P> <P> "As a team, we're not hitting on all cylinders," said starter Kirk McCaskill  (2-1), who had yielded three earned runs in his previous four starts and was  charged with six Saturday, all in a fourth-inning spree that brought nine  Yankees to the plate. "You can force it as much as you want, but until things  work themselves out, you have to work to get through it."  </P> <P> The 29-year-old right-hander, who is 0-4 against the Yankees in his career,  cruised through three innings and was protecting the 1-0 lead provided him on  Dante Bichette's double and Jack Howell's sacrifice fly in the second. Then  came the six-hit fourth, which was as far as he went.  </P> <P> "They put the bat on the ball and they found holes," said McCaskill, whose  earned-run average rose from 1.07 to 2.76.  </P> <P> On the surface, the most damaging hits were the run-scoring double by Claudell  Washington, who was sent to New York in the Polonia trade, and Mike Blowers'  single through the hole between short and third after the Angels intentionally  walked Bob Geren -- a .351 hitter -- to get to Blowers, who carried a .208  average into the game.  </P> <P> But Angel Manager Doug Rader rued the fielder's-choice grounder by No. 9 hitter  Alvaro Espinoza as much as the extra-base hit.  </P> <P> "After the first couple of innings, I thought (McCaskill) would breeze," he  said. "The ball that Blowers hit, I couldn't believe. Then Jackie lays back on  Espinoza's ball. We should have turned two on that. Actually, that was the  ballgame. I'm not hanging this on Jack Howell. That's what happens to you when  things aren't going particularly well."  </P> <P> Getting only one out on Espinoza's grounder kept the inning alive for Steve  Sax's run-scoring double -- which gave the Yankees a 4-1 lead -- and a two-run  single by Roberto Kelly, which put the game away at 6-1. Reliever Sherman  Corbett fared even worse than McCaskill, giving up five hits and five earned  runs in 1 1/3 innings, as every Yankee starter except Espinoza got a hit.  </P> <P> Rader didn't want to criticize his club's offense, but the facts are plain. The  Angels, who have a league-low team batting average of .231, have yet to score  more than three runs in an inning this season and haven't scored three in an  inning in their last 41 innings. They've done it only once in their last 64  innings. Opponents have scored five runs in an inning three times, six once,  seven once, and nine once.  </P> <P> "It's very difficult to do things offensively when you're behind by a great  number of runs," Rader said, "but I didn't think the game was over because we  gave up three or four runs. We need to make plays and convert outs. Kirk said  the ball was finding holes -- you give guys enough opportunities, they're going  to find holes. The whole object is to minimize those opportunities so there  will be fewer holes."  </P> <P> The Angels insisted they can't force themselves out of their doldrums, and  Yankee first baseman Don Mattingly agreed. He should know: New York was on a  five-game losing streak before prevailing over Mark Langston Friday and  McCaskill Saturday and had been sputtering offensively.  </P> <P> "It turns around quick," he said. "Wally (Joyner), Chili (Davis), those guys  are going to hit. They always have. It's just a matter of time, just like it  was for us. They could all get hot tomorrow, but hopefully they won't until  after we leave."  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> The Angels have suggested that infielder Mark McLemore give up switch-hitting  at least temporarily in favor of hitting right-handed. McLemore was hitting  .125 overall, which broke down to .077 left-handed (two for 26) and .214  right-handed (three for 14) before Saturday's game.  </P> <P> Dante Bichette entered Saturday's game with 27 hits, a figure he didn't reach  last season until his 46th game. He extended his hitting streak to 11 games  with a second-inning double. . . . Brian Downing was not in Saturday's lineup  and did not appear at all in the Angels' previous five games. . . . John Orton  started at catcher for the first time since last Sunday, when he injured his  left shoulder in a home-plate collision. He was hitless in his five previous  Anaheim Stadium at-bats this season.  </P></p>

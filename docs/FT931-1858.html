			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Companies 'fail to meet' EC health laws MORE THAN half of UK companies are not complying with six health-and-safety laws which came into effect on January 1, personnel directors have admitted in a survey. The laws - dubbed the six-pack - include new rules on using visual display units, lifting heavy loads and providing safety equipment. The laws result from the UK's implementation of European Community directives. A survey of 500 personnel directors and managers carried out by Personnel Today magazine found that 54 per cent of companies in the survey did not meet the new rules. A quarter of the total sample had taken no action, while 14 per cent had amended existing policies. A further 13 per cent had carried out assessments of potential dangers as required by the laws. Just 6 per cent of companies in the survey had studied the regulations and 1 per cent of those surveyed had allocated funds to bring them into line with the new laws. Employers yesterday defended their lack of compliance. Mr John Cridland, the Confederation of British Industry's director of environmental affairs, said: 'Expecting the world to change on January 1 is naive in the extreme, especially in the midst of recession.' The CBI said that risk assessment was the key to the new regulations. 'The greater the risk, the more the need for action and the greater the response,' said Mr Cridland. He added that government and business had a responsible approach to the six new laws. The GMB general union accused the Health and Safety Executive of failing to alert employers about the laws. Mr Nigel Bryson, the union's director of health and environment, said: 'Where are the TV programmes? Where are the posters from HSE telling employers about the need to carry out risk assess-ments?' The executive had already said the new rules would not be enforced immediately unless the 'risks to health and safety are evident and immediate . . . or employers appear deliberately obdurate and unwilling to recognise their responsibilities'. It said Pounds 350,000 had been spent on press advertisements. 'We feel we spent the money judiciously and in a way which would achieve value for money,' the executive said.</p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Names 'may sue compiler of league tables' Sturge Holdings, the Lloyd's agency, yesterday issued an injunction against Mr John Rew, the co-editor of Chatset league tables of performance on the insurance market. The action concerns alleged breaches of confidentiality in publication of sensitive information. Sturge warned that the action may lead to Names - individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market - on its syndicates suing Mr Rew, who is chairman of their own action group. The writ alleges that Mr Rew published information relating to Sturge syndicates provided to him as chairman of the Sturge Names Action Group. It seeks damages and interest for breach of contract and breach of confidence for disclosing information provided in connection with the evaluation of the legal disputes initiative launched by Lloyd's. Sturge claims this information was circulated by Mr Rew in the Chatset league tables last week, and also in a newsletter. Sturge's concerns focus on 210, a non-marine syndicate. The Chatset guide provides details including a memo to the board suggesting run-off figures of up to Dollars 800m. Mr James Macdonald, group finance director, said the information was highly sensitive and its distribution to potential claimants, reinsurers and others on the market could be extremely prejudicial. 'We are not trying to say the figures are wrong,' he said. 'This raises questions about the whole way in which Chatset gets its information and then purports to be an authority on Lloyd's' Mr Rew yesterday called the writ 'codswallop' and said it would be contested. 'The information belongs to Lloyd's Names. Any Name is entitled to get it,' he said. 'Most are just not in a position to broadcast it.' Chatset, which has proved a long-standing irritant to Lloyd's, last week predicted that Names would face demands of up to Pounds 8.65bn from the insurance market during the next 20 years. The league tables have been published since the late 1970s and have long been criticised by Lloyd's, but they have often proved accurate. 'The origin of Chatset was getting syndicate accounts which we were told were secret,' said Mr Rew. 'The point has always been to make Lloyd's more transparent but it's so hopelessly opaque.' The High Court yesterday upheld the right of Lloyd's to pay out losses from its central fund and recover these sums from Names to discharge their underwriting obligations. Mr Justice Saville ruled that defences and counter-claims put forward by Names as preliminary issues before legal action were unfounded.</p>

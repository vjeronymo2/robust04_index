			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Iwo Byczewski, </F> Poland's chief negotiator in the Polish-Lithuanian talks leading  up to the friendship treaty, by Cezary Gmyz; place and date not  given: "The Treaty Protects Minority Rights in Accordance With  European Standards"]    [Text] [Gmyz] The foreign ministers of Poland and  Lithuania have concluded a treaty on friendship and  good-neighborly relations. Why have the contents of this treaty  not been made public? That does not conform to international  practice.    [Byczewski] Ministers Povilas Gylys and Andrzej Olechowski  merely initialed the treaty. That merely signifies the formal  conclusion of the negotiation process. The contents of  important international documents like this are revealed not  after they have been initialed but after they have been signed.  The signing ceremony will probably take place in Vilnius in  April. The treaty will be signed by the presidents of both  countries.    [Gmyz] Does that mean that the president will ratify the  treaty without parliament's consent and that it will enter into  effect immediately after it has been signed in Vilnius?    [Byczewski] The ratification and the signing of a treaty are  two entirely different things. The Small Constitution envisages  two ways of ratifying international treaties. Treaties that  alter borders or result in budget spending have to be approved  by the parliaments of both countries in the form of ratification  laws before they can be ratified by the politicians. As far as  lesser treaties are concerned, the president of each country may  ratify them without the consent of parliament. The treaty with  Lithuania is, of course, a treaty of great importance, and we  want it to undergo what we in diplomatic language call major  ratification--i.e., following parliament's consent.    [Gmyz] The greatest problem during the negotiation process  was presented by history itself--to be more precise, the taking  of Vilnius by Polish General Zeligowski in 1920. How has this  problem been resolved?    [Byczewski] Treaties are concerned not with the past but  with the future. For this reason, the Polish side has clearly  been saying from the very beginning that the treaty cannot  contain any assessments of history, and it does not contain any.  The preamble does contain certain standard general references  to history. Both sides express regret at the conflicts between  our countries and the use of force that no doubt occurred, but  no concrete events are mentioned and nothing is evaluated.    [Gmyz] Is it true that, in the treaty, we guarantee Vilnius  as the capital of Lithuania and they guarantee us Warsaw as our  capital? If so, what would happen if the Lithuanians wanted to  move their capital elsewhere? Would they require Poland's  consent?    [Byczewski] The preamle mentions both cities as capital  cities, but the treaty itself contains no guarantees that they  remain capitals. This is a domestic matter for each country and  has nothing to do with international documents. The Lithuanians  have always considered Vilnius their historic capital, and I  very much doubt if they would ever want to move it somewhere  else.    [Gmyz] How does the treaty address the rights of minorities?    [Byczewski] The treaty fully guarantees the rights of  minorities in accordance with European standards. The press has  unnecessarily been reporting on the treaty only from the angle  of history and minority rights. Yet the treaty also addresses  other important spheres such as cross-border and regional trade.  After all, it calls for the opening of new border crossings and  other important matters.    [Gmyz] What were the talks like?    [Byczewski] I make no secret of the fact that they were hard  and complicated. There were five rounds of talks. The  negotiations themselves did not exhaust all issues, of course.  The ministers mentioned letters about which the general public  knows nothing. One day these will be interesting documents for  historians. The informal visits of Lithuanian politicians in  Poland were also important. First, we hosted Lithuanian  Parliamentary Speaker Jursenas, who was accompanied by  Lithuanian Deputy Foreign Minister Vladislavas Domarkas. Later  came Prime Minister Adolfas Szelevicius. Polish Minister  Andrzej Zakrzewksi headed a presidential mission to Lithuania in  February. The recent telephone conversation between the  presidents of both countries was also important.    [Gmyz] Is the treaty a success of Polish diplomacy, as the  Lithuanian opposition parties claim it is?    [Byczewski] It is the conclusion of the talks and the  resolution of all thorny issues that constitute a success. It  is a bilateral success. Of course, there are always specific  people behind every document. At this point, I must commend my  colleagues, especially Stefan Meller, who is deputy director of  Department One, dealing with Europe. He is a historian, and  there were times when his advice and remarks provided the talks  with a helpful push. The treaty completes the round of  international political agreements with our neighbors. Yet we  did not start until 1989.</p>

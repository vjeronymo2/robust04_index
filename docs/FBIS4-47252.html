Shevelukha, academician, Russian Academy of </F> Agricultural Sciences, by Viktor Trushkov, PRAVDA correspondent,  ``Science Suffers From Starvation''; the first paragraph is an  introduction, the last paragraph is a postscript]    [Text] V. Shevelukha, academician, Russian Academy of  Agricultural Sciences, deputy chairman of the Committee on  Education, Culture and Science of the Russian Federation Duma,  answers questions from a PRAVDA correspondent, Viktor Trushkov.    Trushkov: Viktor Stepanovich, permit me to  congratulate you: insofar as I recall, for the first time in the  history of Russian legislative authority the parliament has  included in its agenda a special law on science.    Shevelukha: Not simply on science, but also on the  critical situation in science. It is true that such an approach  did not sit well with some deputies.    Until now there have been no programs for the reorganization  of scientific research in our country. Accordingly, the  Committee on Education, Culture and Science of the State Duma  decided to draw the attention of the Duma, government leaders,  ministries and departments to this vitally important problem.    In world and former national practice 60-67% of all  the  appropriations for science were spent on fundamental research,  25-30% went to applied research and 8-10% went to  technical  and other development work. Such an infrastructure of  expenditures on science has been the case for many years in the  United States and other well-developed countries. So it also was  both in the USSR and in Russia up to 1990 inclusive. Now  everything is different. First slowly, and then at an  accelerated rate, the government of Russia began to reduce the  amounts of budgeted funding for science and by late 1993 had  reduced it to 0.7% of the GNP. The financial bind in  science  first of all affected salaries of scientists. In late 1993 they  received from 30 to 70 thousand rubles per month, which is two  or three times less than the average wage of all categories of  workers in the country. The payment of even this miserly wage is  constantly in arrears at many institutes and institutions of  higher and intermediate education.    Trushkov: Is it not fundamental science which has  suffered most severely? There is no real market for its product.    Shevelukha: To be sure. Here development work  cannot be turned immediately into a product which would make it  possible to obtain additional sums for the funding of science.  As a result, there has been a rapid curtailment of research in  the fields of mathematics, physics, electronics, information  science, theoretical biology and the most important branches of  the humanities. Highly qualified scientists are leaving the  laboratories and institutes for other spheres of activity and  are going abroad.    Becoming convinced of the growing catastrophe, the Ministry  of Science and Technical Policy has attempted to bring about  additional injections of funds. A fund for fundamental research  was established. But its resources are negligible: 3% of  all  expenditures on science. It was clear that this was not enough.  Then the government decided to ``rescue'' science in another  way: designate science centers for the most important priorities  in fundamental and applied sciences, based on already existing  institutes. But this also will scarcely do the job.    First of all, where is the guarantee that a proper choice  will be made of the future priorities in the field of  fundamental research? The entire history of world science gives  evidence that such priorities arise in the course of the  internal logic of development of science itself, not on the  basis of the prevision of government officials. And second, the  organization of so-called science centers in accordance with the  ``latest'' concepts of the Ministry of Science and Technical  Policy will inevitably result in the elimination of the solid  front of fundamental research making up the optimum  infrastructure of science, and also to the shifting of the  greater part of expenditures from the sphere of the fundamental  sciences into the field of technological development work.    Trushkov: Recently foreign sponsors have appeared  in Russian science. Their assistance is widely heralded. And  what is the effect?    Shevelukha: In actual practice this assistance for  the time being for the most part has a propagandistic character  and is being made available in inadequate, symbolic amounts. But  it is accompanied, as a rule, by the collection of highly  important information on the principal research directions, on  scientific priorities, on the structure and attainments of  Russian science.    Judge for yourself: Russian scientists each receive $500 in  one small grant (donative sum for a high-priority purposeful  project) from the International Soros Fund. Three years in a row  the World Bank has promised to render assistance to Russian  agrarian science. Many private proposals arrive from abroad for  our scientists asking that they carry out special-order priority  tasks in Russian or foreign laboratories, with their results  being sent abroad. But, indeed, it is well known that almost all  those who are rendering assistance to Russian science are  pursuing the objective of adapting and using the powerful  scientific and technical potential of Russia in the interests of  their own countries.  ``echelon of science'' -- in technological research?    Shevelukha: There also the conditions are pitiful.  I will cite an example from a sphere close to me. Due to the  reduction in state support there is a sharp decline in research  not only in theoretical biology, but also in bioengineering.  Laboratories are closing and specialists are departing for  abroad.    But it is precisely by modern bioengineering methods that in  the next few years throughout the entire world there will be a  qualitative improvement in plants, animals and microorganisms  used in medicine, agriculture and in the processing and food  industry.    Unfortunately, none of this is being taken into account by  the leaders of the country. Meanwhile, in the United States, in  the European countries, in Japan, and during recent years also  in China, India, Vietnam and in many countries of Africa and  Latin America national bioengineering programs are being  developed and applied. But we made the first breakthrough.    Trushkov: The picture which you have drawn is a  joyless one. The experience of Soviet science, if it is not  being slighted, is being cast aside. But there is still world  experience. Two different approaches to the choice of a state  scientific and technical policy are known. First, the  ``American'' variant, in which there is assurance of a broad  front of fundamental research carried out by budgeted and other  financial sources in the United States. The research results are  used both for national needs and for the world market. Second,  the ``Japanese'' variant, in which most of the new technologies  are based on the purchase of patents from abroad and on their  basis the latest national industry is organized. The high  competitiveness in production makes up for the cost of acquiring  patents and makes it possible to create their own scientific  potential. Which of these routes is more acceptable for Russia?    Shevelukha: Neither one of them is suitable in its  pure form. We need our own way in the development of science and  industrial technologies. And, in particular, under the  present-day conditions. It essentially involves our own research  in priority fields. This is much cheaper than the purchase of  patents. Only in this case is it possible to ensure a gradual  reduction in the volumes of importation of the latest  technologies and the creation of our own competitive production  of products with a high scientific input for our country and for  sale on the world market. Precisely for this reason it is  entirely inadmissible that there be a sharp reduction in space  programs because there is an ongoing precipitous narrowing of  the possibilities for producing the latest technologies in  almost all economic branches.    Trushkov: But not being concerned about the  future, may political favorites not put the focus on applied  research?    Shevelukha: The reduction of budgeted funding has  undermined the basis for the successful development of many  priority aspects of applied research. As an example, I will once  again cite a sphere which is close to me. The importance of  plant selection and animal breeding is obvious to all; it exerts  an enormous influence on the solution of acute agrarian and  economic problems in the country as a whole. Precisely in these  fields of applied science in the not distant past Russian  scientists attained outstanding results which received world  recognition. The genofund of varieties and hybrids of plants,  animals and birds which they formed served as a basis for major  achievements in plant selection and animal breeding in many  countries. If today the good results of selection still persist  in Russia it is due only to the enthusiasm of scientists of the  older and middle generations. Despite the wretched wages, the  lack of attention to it on the part of the state, they continue  to manifest scientific zeal. During 1993 345 new varieties and  hybrids of agricultural plants were developed and 182 were  regionalized. More than 4000 varieties and hybrids have been  developed and regionalized in Russia. This represents enormous  national wealth. But the enthusiasm of selection specialists  will soon dry up and the agrarian sector of the economy will  have to rely on the old store of varieties and breeds. However,  even that paultry economic support to selection science which  was provided for by the Law on Selection Attainments, adopted in  1993 and signed by V. N. Yeltsin, unfortunately is not being  delivered. The Finance Ministry and the Economics Ministry still  refuse to carry out the economic measures for supporting  selection work provided for in the law. Meanwhile the level of  budgeted funding for selection work in the country is already  less than 30% of the needs.    Trushkov: But is it possible that applied science  will begin to flourish with a changeover to a market economy?  Possibly the scientists in this sphere, whose ``democrats'' are  accused of inability to master market mechanisms, are  responsible.    Shevelukha: To be sure, under conditions of entry  into the market scientists working in the applied science sphere  must learn to advertise and market their scientific products.  And this also applies to research of a technological nature in  all scientific fields.    But try to visualize a situation in which a talented  scientist is forced to use more than half his time allocated for  scientific research in seeking a buyer and sale of his product.  This is a squandering of the national wealth. A scientist should  be engaged in research work. Now many branch scientific research  institutes are seeking different self- funding methods. The  institutes and experimental stations of the Russian Academy of  Agricultural Sciences, for example, cover almost of the  expenditures in their activity by the sale of seeds, breeding  cattle and vaccines, by contracting for the introduction of  scientific advances and by other kinds of commercial activity.  But in this case scientists are burdened by work which is not  really their own and there is a decrease in the efficiency of  scientific research.    Conclusion No. 1 -- more than half the expenditures on  applied research must be covered by the state budget. For  covering the second half of the expenditures it would be  possible to enlist commercial organizations engaged in the sale  of scientific products. But government agencies should be  concerned about such a dual source of organization and funding  of science.    Trushkov: Is there hope that the State Duma will  assist in the survival of Russian science?    Shevelukha: I think that it will. The adoption of  reasonable laws favoring a rebirth rather than the suffocating  of science is the primary intent of the parliament.    Postscript -- The State Duma has adopted a decree entitled  ``On the Critical Situation in Russian Science.'' In this decree  it is proposed that the government examine the problem of  ensuring the preservation and further development of the  scientific potential of the country on the basis of priority  funding of fundamental and promising practical research,  establishing a commission for developing mechanisms for the  funding of science, working out a program of state support for  the entry of national scientific and development work into the  world market, setting up a fund for the funding of expenditures  on the patenting of scientific attainments abroad and  formulating a program of measures for preserving the personnel  base of science.    The Duma spoke out for the granting of tax privileges to  scientific, planning, design and educational institutions. It  considers it to be inadmissible that monies for the funding of  higher education be transferred to subjects of the Russian  Federation and requires that in 1994 institutions of higher and  intermediate education be funded from the federal budget.</p>

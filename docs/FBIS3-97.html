The meeting was  presided over by Mr. Faustin Birindwa, prime minister and head  of government. The meeting began with a wide overview of the  general national situation, and observed that general calm  prevailed over the entire, vast national territory.  Nevertheless, according to information received from the chief  of general staff of the Zairian Armed Forces, there have been  rebel infiltrations from a neighboring country into the  Ruwenzori and Wataninga areas in North Kivu. After combat  troops were dispatched to the affected areas, the Zairian Armed  Forces rapidly repelled the invaders, kicking them out of our  country. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town April 28 SAPA -- The allegation by African  National Congress President Nelson Mandela that problems had  only occured at polling stations where blacks were voting was  extremely serious and should be backed up by facts, State  President F W de Klerk said on Thursday [28 April] afternoon.  "It is a very serious allegation and he will have to back it up  with facts. As far as I know, he has not provided one single  fact for that allegation," he said at a press conference at the  National Party [NP] offices in Cape Town.    Mr de Klerk was reacting to an earlier allegation of  "sabotage" made by Mr Mandela in an interview with SABC [South  African Broadcasting Corporation] television. "The NP has  complained that the overwhelming majority of Independent  Electoral Commission [IEC] officials at grassroots and polling  station official level have been breaking the rules and have not  been impartial. We have much to complain about. The IEC is  sufficiently representative -- and on certain levels loaded in  favour of the ANC -- of all political parties. I have travelled  far and wide and have not heard -- apart from specific polling  stations -- any accusations of malpractice which has the type of  basis of Mr Mandela's statement. I'm shocked at it."</p>

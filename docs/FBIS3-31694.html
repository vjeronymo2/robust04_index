			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Zbigniew Lentowicz: "Unwanted Immigrant May Fly </F> Away"]    [Text] Internal Affairs Minister Andrzej Milczanowski  announces that as early as March we will try to send back the  first "cumbersome" foreigners by plane. In line with the  ministry's estimates, there would be at least 1,000 unwanted  immigrants. "We know where they are, what they are doing, what  their origin is; after all, this is what the police is for,"  says Longin Beirzanek, a high-ranking officer at the Main  Headquarters. "It is theoretically possible to start a  deportation action," he adds; "however, it would have to be  precisely coordinated by the police, the voivodship  administration, and the border troops. Otherwise, we might see  a situation which has already taken place in Gdansk; there were  talks with a group of Romanian Gypsies, living in the city  refuse dump; travel documentation was prepared, and even medical  tests were made. However, the next day the Romanians  disappeared--they most probably went to a neighboring voivodship.    "We still do not have an efficient system for the  deportation  of unwanted foreigners," reiterates Tomasz Kozlowski, director  of the Office for Migration and Refugees in the Ministry of  Internal Affairs. The director is not even going to suggest  that foreigners threaten to cause some kind of an apocalyptical  catastrophe in Poland; he says, however, that every country must  have an effective method of disposing of foreigners who do not  respect the Polish law, for instance. However, the truth is  that voivodes are rarely able to fully implement their own  decisions concerning deportations. Kozlowski argues: "Certainly  no one in the Polish Republic is going to plan any mass  deportations; this is an absurd idea; all the same, the  authorities must not be so helpless."    The police have forwarded nearly 40 deportation motions to  the Zielona Gora voivode; in almost all cases, administrative  visas were placed in the passports which obliged their owners to  leave Poland by the shortest route. No one knows which routes  those persons chose. Only six foreigners were escorted by a  convoy: four to Okecie airport, two to the eastern border. In  all, the expeditions cost 49 million zlotys.    In order to avoid such expenditures, the police in Zielona  Gora increased supervision over foreigners arriving in the areas  close to the border. Whenever a more numerous group appears,  the functionaries immediately check their documents and  scrupulously implement registration regulations. "No one can  accuse us of persecuting anyone; however, after such a  reception, the guests do not usually stay long," assures Wiktor  Szopski of the Voivodship Police Headquarters, who is the author  of this method. He suggested, however, that this danger not be  exaggerated. In the Zielona Gora Voivodship, which is located  on the immigration route, there are not more than tens of  so-called cumbersome foreigners. Last year guests from abroad  committed 116 offenses here, of which at least 30 percent were  road offenses. In these statistics first are the Ukrainians,  followed by the Germans. "This is really not much," say  Szopski. The Szczecin voivode issued 120 administrative visas  last year; he already deported 18 foreigners. According to the  voivode's spokesperson Maria Bartczak, the problem has not  reached a level which would be alarming to the voivode. Lublin  Police Spokesperson Andrzej Przemyski is not as optimistic.  According to him, the present deportation procedure is  unacceptable: Within 48 hours the entire case must be completed,  even though it takes a lot of time to merely establish the  identity of the detained person; it is common for them to  destroy their documents. The police in Lublin has already  prepared its own deportation arrest location (there will be 20  such places all over Poland); however, it is not certain whether  this arrest location will be used: some provisions of the 1991  Law on Foreigners have been queried by the Constitutional  Tribunal; it did not agree that the state administration be  given the right to send people to closed places. The verdict of  the judges of the Constitutional Tribunal was then confirmed by  the Sejm; now we must wait for deputies to meet their commitment  and amend the law soon. The amendment bills aim at  strengthening the supervision over the cases of detainment  related to deportation, by giving the right of supervision to  the prosecutors' offices.    Only when the new law is passed will we be able to think  about establishing a center where deported foreigners--with  their families--would be able to wait until the procedure is  completed; in line with the agreement on readmission, signed by  Poland, this procedure allows for appropriate international  agreements. Longin Bierzanek believes that it would be best if  such a center were located in the center of Poland, near Warsaw,  where it is only a short distance to the airport at Okecie and  to the interested embassies.    Last year voivodes made over 1,000 decision on deporting  foreigners; only 617 unwanted foreigners were escorted by  convoys to the border. According to police estimates, it would  not be unfounded to deport from Poland at least 2,000 most  cumbersome Gypsies, among whom many cases of tuberculosis were  detected, and just as many foreigners from the east, who make  deals conflicting with the Polish law. "If the Romanians were  sent with escort to their homeland, they would not survive the  winter there," protest Poles in the committees for defending  Gypsies in Poznan.</p>

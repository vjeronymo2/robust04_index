			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 18 (KCNA) -- The Pyongyang-visiting  group of former heads of state and government and politicians  from different countries toured Kaesong Municipality on Sunday.    Keenly experiencing the tragedy of national division of the  Korean people, they expressed their resolution to strive for a  peaceful reunification of Korea.    They, participants in the second meeting of the summit  council for world peace, were to visit Pyongyang through  Panmunjom late March. Owing to the obstructions of the South  Korean authorities, however, they had to make a long detour,  though this place is no more than 70 km away from Seoul.    After inspecting Panmunjom, former President of Costa Rica  Rodrigo Carazo Odio who is leading the group said he had flown  to Central America and came here by making a detour of 35,000 km  through the United States and China because passing through  Panmunjom was not allowed. "This makes us feel sick at heart,"  he added.    Former Governor-General of Canada Edward Schreyer said he  learned at first hand that Korea is not building armament,  contrary to what he had heard in the West. "Your country wants  peace, not a war, and is making a great progress in socialist  construction," he noted.    William Taylor, vice-president of the Center for Strategic  and International Studies of the United States, said that the  continued tense military confrontation along the Military  Demarcation Line may create an unpredictable situation with an  accidental incident and so, the DPRK and the United States must  have further talks and find a solution to the matters, promoting  mutual understanding through talks. After seeing the concrete  wall built by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean  authorities in the area south of the Military Demarcation Line  bisecting one country, one nation and families into two, the  guests said they learned well who was the very one blocking the  reunification of Korea.    Noting that the concrete wall is a very torturous one for  the  Korean people who are suffering the sorrow of the division for  nearly 50 years, Antonio Betancourt, executive director of the  Summit Council for World Peace, stressed that the Summit Council  for World Peace will strive to achieve the reunification of the  country, the final aim of the Korean people, through  international efforts.    Togashi Takayoshi, vice-president of the Summit Council for  World Strategy of Japan, said: "To build even a barrier dividing  one nation shows that the South Korean authorities pay no heed  to the nation."    That day the guests went round the Panmunjom cooperative  farm. Noting the South Korean rulers' propaganda that people do  not live here is a sheer lie, the guests said in unison that  they could see at first hand the people in the North taking part  in peaceful construction, not in war preparations.</p>

			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Arts: The Nutcracker - Royal Festival Hall and Covent Garden The New Year always begins in these columns with The Nutcracker, and like a galley-slave at ease with his shackles, I find a nostalgic familiarity in the routine of excited tots in the audience, drifting snow-flakes on stage, and the ring of the celesta as the Sugar Plum Fairy appears. This year there have been a couple of vivid interpretations to banish the doldrums I associate with a role that is usually a drag rather than a dragee. The Sugar Plum Fairy's assignment amounts to little more than a pas de deux - but how much more that little can seem when cast with a true ballerina. Thus it was when Ludmila Semenyaka led English National Ballet's performance on Thursday afternoon, and when Darcey Bussell appeared with the Royal Ballet on Friday night. I saw Semenyaka in The Nutcracker at her Paris debut with the Bolshoy Ballet in 1973. Then, the exquisite purity of her Kirov training, made the dance seem so fresh, so pure, that one might have been seeing the ballet and hearing the music for the first time. Today, her style remains unflawed, crystalline, yet every least moment is now imbued with a noble authority, that rarest of dance blessings. Like Markova - great original of this role for Western audiences - she appears as a child's dream of a fairy, infinitely gracious and charming, made of spun sugar, magical. But there is a dignity, an inevitability of style, that sharpens and focusses the lines of the choreography. So the glorious adagio pours out its descending scales, and in Semenyaka's dancing we see a no less heart-stirring grandeur. In the celesta variation, the precision of her phrasing, the delicate radiance of her personality, born of the music, are impeccable. It is exemplary classical artistry. I hold little brief for ENB's staging, which is strongly orientated towards a youthful audience - vulgar slapstick in the party scene; epidemic winsomeness in the Kingdom of Sweets - but anything is bearable when Semenyaka and her cavalier, the Cuban dancer Carlos Acosta, are on stage. Acosta is a new and excellent recruit to ENB's impressive roster of male dancers. Only 20 years old, he has a technique already powerful, well schooled, well rounded, and he is a fine partner. His personality is wholly engaging: he possesses a joie de danser that illuminates everything he does. The dance looks happy. At Covent Garden, Peter Wright's Nutcracker redresses every error of the ENB production. The Christmas party has genuine gaiety as well as good manners; the wonders of transformations and the drama of the mouse-battle are imaginatively shown; the ensemble playing - from company and students - is beautifully judged. The Nutcracker's genius lies both in its score and in its Ivanov choreography. On Friday night the patterns of the snowflakes's waltz were ravishing, and in the grand pas de deux, Darcey Bussell displayed a bewitching sincerity. Lovely the way she took the stage, setting out the movement so lucidly that it looked newly made for her. Her partner, Zoltan Solymosi, was attentive, eager to dazzle us in his variation, but it was Bussell's generous dancing and her unaffected grace that gave the duet its effulgence. From Stephen Wicks as Drosselmeyer, from Iain Webb as the Nutcracker, from the entire cast, excellent performances.</p>

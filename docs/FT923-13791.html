			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / UK Company News: What everyone wants is a partner for Green  -The background to Amber Day's recent share slide FOR A MAN at bay, Mr Philip Green is remarkably chirpy. The chairman and chief executive of Amber Day has seen shares in his discount retailing chain collapse in recent months, reducing its market value from Pounds 157m to Pounds 51m. Mr Green, 40, is an ebullient character who elicits strong responses - both positive and negative. He left school at 16 and built his fortune in the clothes trade, selling the jeans company Jean Jeanie to Lee Cooper in the mid-1980s. He owns 7.7 per cent of Amber Day, a stake which has reduced in value by Pounds 8m. The collapse follows a series of bear raids and stories in some Sunday newspapers and Private Eye, which have made hostile comments about Mr Green's business associates, commercial deals - and even the financial affairs of his wife. Mr Green says these criticisms were scrutinised by his advisers, bankers Samuel Montagu, stockbrokers Smith New Court and auditors Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, and he has been able to reassure them on all points. However, bears were given something more substantial into which to get their teeth last month, when Amber Day downgraded profit expectations and announced the departure of its finance director and only non-executive director, both within a year of joining the company. The downgrade came because sales were running below budget at What Everyone Wants, the Glasgow-based discount chain which Amber Day bought for Pounds 46.7m in 1990. Analysts reduced their profits forecast for the year to August 2 from more than Pounds 14m to below Pounds 12m. That is still ahead of last year's figure of Pounds 10.1m, which itself was triple the previous year's level. Mr Green had been criticised over the lack of consultation and irregularity of board meetings by Mr Leslie Warman, the former Lloyds Merchant Bank director. Mr Warman was appointed as non-executive director at the time of last summer's Pounds 24.4m rights issue, at the behest of the institutions. Mr Green said Mr Graham Coles, the finance director, was headhunted by a bigger company, First Leisure, and the timing of the announcements was an unfortunate coincidence. However, an adviser to the company said: 'What upset the finance director and non-executive was that Philip Green was running around doing all these deals without letting them know what was going on. But we are satisfied that these deals have been done for the benefit of the company.' Mr Green said: 'Amber Day is not a one-man band, but you do have to be very hands-on in this business.' Mr Green certainly proved too hands-on for the founders of What Everyone Wants (WEW), Mr Gerald Weisfeld and his wife, Vera. Although they agreed to stay on the board of Amber Day for two years after selling their company, the Weisfelds resigned after nine months and sold their 16 per cent stake following policy disagreements. Despite this alarming turnover at boardroom level, Mr Green has kept almost all of WEW's 2,000 employees. His financial advisers and employees in Glasgow pay glowing tribute to the way he has enhanced the performance of WEW's 54 stores, which are mainly in Scotland and the north of England. Watching Mr Green going into his main store in Glasgow's Argyll Street is to see a man in his element. He knows the supervisors by name and immediately starts quizzing them about which lines are moving and criticising the display of some items. Mr Green has appointed five regional managers and is installing a labelling system which will give weekly reports of stocks and sales in every store. Ms Elaine Gray, Amber Day's buying director, joined the Weisfelds straight from school. She said: 'In the old days, we were flying by the seat of our pants. On Mondays we used to get an overall stock figure - but no breakdown of what lines were selling where.' Both Mr Green and Ms Gray acknowledge the achievement of the Weisfelds, but say their policy of buying up other retailers' and manufacturers excess stock would have faltered in recession, as production runs and overstocking fell. Mr Green blames the recent profits downgrade partly on discounting by more upmarket competitors and partly on the fact that WEW has not always been fully stocked with basic items such as socks and lingerie. His response has been to place firm advance orders for an increasing proportion of the stores' merchandise - much of it from the Far East, which he knows well. The principal trading concern about WEW is that as it grows it will need further controls and overhead costs, squeezing the stores' profits margins, which rely largely on low wage and property costs. Mr Green is confident that more profits can be obtained from the present stores by improving the buying and allocation functions. WEW's break-even figure is estimated at 70 per cent cent of current turnover levels, and Mr Green is confident that he can increase annual sales per sq ft from Pounds 135 to nearer Pounds 180. Mr Green sees no end in sight to the present recession, and is not counting on recovery to achieve his targets. Even when any upturn comes, he does not believe people will stop wanting to buy bargains. The main question mark over Amber Day, however, concerns Mr Green himself, who has agreed to split his role with a new chairman. It is clear his financial advisers are seeking someone with a strong City background. It is even clearer that if Mr Green and the new chairman cannot work together, then the blame is unlikely to laid at the door of the new man. One adviser said: 'It is really a case of taming Philip Green. You need a bloke on top who says 'you can't go off and do these deals without involving the rest of management.'' His backers stress that they are anxious not to lose what they call Mr Green's 'Factor X', his ability to strike deals on merchandise which attract shoppers into the stores. One estimated that Mr Green's dealmaking flair was directly responsible for about 15 per cent of the group's profits. Cynics suggest that institutional shareholders are not too unhappy to see Amber Day's share price at its present low level, since it will be cheaper to oust Mr Green, should that become necessary. One adviser said: 'We've got a battle plan for dealing with Philip without stifling him.' The new chairman will handle relations with the press and shareholders. Mr Green said he was wary of being set up, but was confident that he could work well with a new chairman. His parting words were defiant: 'I've always wanted the chance to build something. I should be given the opportunity to prove what a good business this is.' If Mr Green can work alongside whoever is appointed as chairman, his many critics may well be confounded. If not, expect further boardroom ructions at Amber Day.</p>

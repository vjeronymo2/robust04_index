			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Balladur plans job creation package The French government is expected on Sunday to announce modest job-creating measures to boost the country's fragile economic recovery. The package may include tax incentives to create jobs in services to compensate for those still lost in industry. Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, has said reversing the climbing jobless rate is his highest priority. But evidence of uneven industrial production and lacklustre consumer spending towards the end of last year have shaken government confidence in the strength and durability of the recovery. President Francois Mitterrand is sniping at the conservative premier for doing too little to create jobs and too much to cut welfare benefits. Mr Balladur's room for manoeuvre is limited. He has handed monetary policy to the newly independent Bank of France which is likely to see what Sunday's announcement contains before making any change in interest rates. Mr Balladur still has the tool of fiscal policy, but is caught between his promise not to raise any taxes this year and his commitment to reducing the budget deficit. The government is considering linking repayments to companies of value added tax (which is refunded to companies on their exports outside the European Union) to job creation. French employers have already bridled at any such restriction on their VAT refunds, which they regard as a right, not a favour. Another possible measure might be to give chain stores and petrol stations tax incentives to rehire the service staff they have laid off in recent years.</p>

			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Water supply -- A story in the Jan. 14 South Bay Edition said incorrectly that  most of the South Bay's drinking water is drawn from local aquifers. According  to the West Basin Municipal Water District, wells provide about a quarter of  the South Bay's drinking water. The rest is drawn from water supplies diverted  to the Los Angeles area from Northern California and the Colorado River.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Viktor Yadukha under the "Crimea" rubric: </F> "`National Credit' Will Be Financing Black Sea Fleet"]    [Text] Valeriy Baranov, administrator of affairs of the  Russian "National Credit" bank, and Viktor Semenov, head of the  Sevastopol administration, agreed on 7 June to open in the city  an agency of the bank which is to be turned into its permanent  branch in a month.    A limited partnership, "National Credit" is an authorized  bank of the Moscow government. Its founders are the "Olbi"  concern, the "Interkoys" joint venture, the "Mezhdunarodnyye  Otnosheniya" publishing house, the Savings Bank of Russia, and  the "Industriya Service" bank. Its start-up capital is 37  billion rubles.    The decision to open a "National Credit" branch in  Sevastopol  was made under the Russian-Ukrainian agreements on financing for  the Black Sea Fleet. Mr. Baranov stated that the bank intends  to introduce new types of services on the territory of Ukraine  in line with the laws of Ukraine or Crimea depending on which  will register it. "National Credit" is to function in Ukraine  as a foreign bank whose chartered fund at the time of  registration stands at 10 million European Currency Units. If  the Russian authorities set the promised 52 billion rubles aside  for Sevastopol, the start-up capital of "National Credit" would  grow to match this figure. "National Credit" is expected to take  the niche of the Dnepropetrovsk "Privat Bank," which up to  recently acted as an intermediary in the transfer of Russian  money to the Black Sea Fleet.    According to bank representatives, the opening of the branch  does not signify turning Sevastopol into a ruble zone oasis. It  is still not clear in which currency Black Sea Fleet sailors  will be paid.    The same day a cable came to Sevastopol from Ukraine's  Finance Ministry saying that Kiev has set aside for the city a  preferential credit to the tune of 50 billion karbovanets.</p>

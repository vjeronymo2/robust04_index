			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Tilt in the balance of power: Delors' decision creates problems for the French left and right More than 9m French people turned on their television sets on Sunday night to hear Mr Jacques Delors announce that he would not run for the Elysee. The level of interest showed how conscious they were of the consequences this would have for the presidential election and possibly for French policy towards Europe. 'This is not an easy decision to take,' said the European Commission president, who had led all other possible presidential candidates in the polls over recent weeks. Having said he wanted a break after 50 years of work, and that he did not want office for office's sake, he concluded: 'I will without doubt be criticised by certain people for an attitude that is not frequent in political life.' In fact, his decision won praise from many commentators, with the Liberation newspaper describing him as 'the best president France never had', and gained backhanded compliments from the nationalists on the extreme right and left for his honesty in recognising there was no pro-European majority in the country to elect him. However, by 'certain people' Mr Delors really meant his fellow Socialists. Most understood Mr Delors' personal reasons for not wanting another seven years in harness, though some noted that General de Gaulle was almost Mr Delors' age of 69 when he became president. What dismayed them was the openness of his analysis that winning the Elysee would be a pyrrhic victory. No Socialist president would have a hope of converting the present large conservative majority of 480 out of 577 parliamentary seats into a majority and a government he could work with. Inevitably, many Socialists see this public admission, if not as a stab in the back, then as queering the pitch for a future Socialist presidential candidate. One who might fill that slot is Mr Jack Lang, former education and culture minister. Mr Lang said he could not understand Mr Delors' reasoning. 'Jacques Delors would have been able to create a majority for his actions and ideas which would have come from the very depths of society.' Even if this were true of Mr Delors, however, it is not so of Mr Lang, or anyone else in the Socialist party. The right's problem with Mr Delors' decision is that it removes their electoral need for unity. The plan by the ruling coalition, of the Gaullist RPR and centre-right UDF parties, to hold US-style primaries to select a single candidate for the Elysee had already collapsed. Now so will the need for unity on which Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has, in particular, based his campaign strategy against his fellow Gaullist, Mr Jacques Chirac. To offset the greater hold that Mr Chirac has over the RPR party machine that he created and led for nearly 20 years, Mr Balladur has assiduously courted the UDF. There are more UDF members in his government than RPR ministers, and he has tried to cater to the UDF's centrist, pro-European susceptibilities. But to the dismay of the Balladur camp, the UDF spokesman said yesterday that 'circumstances are becoming more favourable for the UDF to advance its ideas in the presidential campaign'. This could presage presidential bids by ex-President Valery Giscard d'Estaing or his former prime minister, Mr Raymond Barre, thus driving a wedge into the constituency sought by Mr Balladur. The reason for the UDF's desire to speak up is its fear that, with the battle now being fought on the right, the main Gaullist contestants may start listening to 'the siren voices of the anti-Europeans', as Mr Jacques Barrot, a centrist, put it yesterday. In fact, both Mr Balladur and Mr Chirac have reasons for not wanting to make Europe too much of an issue. The prime minister recently criticised Euro-federalism as outdated, but this was partly a pre-emptive move to mark his distance from Mr Delors. Given the impossibility of saying anything on Europe that would please UDF Euro-enthusiasts and RPR Euro-sceptics equally, Mr Balladur would probably prefer to say nothing. Without a real UDF following, Mr Chirac has less of a balancing trick to perform. Eurosceptics are part of his natural catchment area. But he will want to remove competition for their votes by persuading Mr Philippe de Villiers, the anti-Maastricht conservative, to stay out of the race. But whatever their inclinations, the main candidates will probably have Europe thrust upon them. France assumes the presidency of the European Union from January 1 right through the campaign. Governments holding the EU's rotating presidency can usually get away with - and sometimes must adopt - a position of bland neutrality on EU controversies. But it is hard to see French politicians - particularly Mr Balladur's rivals and opponents outside government - keeping their lips buttoned for so long. Mr Philippe Seguin, the pro-Chirac national assembly president, can be counted to speak up on Europe, as may Mr Delors himself in support of whatever candidate the Socialist party chooses. Increasingly unavoidable, too, is the EU's looming constitutional conference in 1996. France's EU partners, particularly Germany and the UK, have begun to formulate their views on reforms of institutions and policies, and are impatient to know what Paris thinks. The ruling conservatives who are now likely to produce the next French president are caught in the middle. They broadly share UK government views on institutions, believing that the inter-governmental council of ministers should hold dominance over the supranational bodies of Commission and parliament. And they, conversely, dislike the institutional federalism avowed by some leading Christian Democrats. But on new policy initiatives they see little common ground with the UK, except in defence, while converging closely with Bonn on a wide range of policies. Clever technicians such as Mr Alain Lamassoure, France's EU affairs minister, have been working hard on compromises. Out of Mr Lamassoure's fertile mind have come proposals to reduce EU competences, satisfying the UK, while at the same time giving the European Parliament greater co-decision powers on remaining legislation, pleasing the Germans. He has also proposed a novel overhaul of the Council of Ministers, turning it into a directorate on internal policy, which would award bigger states such as Germany, the UK and France greater relative say, and giving it a powerful secretary general to steer external policy. But these are the sort of filigree compromises that will get shot through when the presidential candidates start firing off on Europe. What does France propose for 1996? Clearly its EU partners want a straight answer. But a presidential campaign is the wrong time to ask for one.</p>

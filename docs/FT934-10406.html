			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Bid to revive Ulster peace plan: Hume holds out prospect of total cessation of violence after talks MR JOHN HUME, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, sought yesterday to revive his joint peace initiative with Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, by claiming the offer of a 'total cessation of violence' was on the table as a result of their dialogue. Speaking after a meeting with Mr John Major, the prime minister, Mr Hume said there would be 'peace within a week' if the initiative was embraced. 'My conclusion is that that is now a real possibility - a total cessation of violence, not a ceasefire,' Mr Hume said. But in a move likely to infuriate Unionists, whom London and Dublin are trying to lure back to the negotiating table, Mr Hume said he intended to brief Mr Adams on his hour-long meeting at Downing Street last night. The session was also attended by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary. Mr Hume indicated afterwards it would no longer be possible for Sir Patrick to say he did not know details of the Hume-Adams initiative. Mr Major is seeing leaders of the province's four constitutional political parties over the next few days. Yesterday's meeting with Mr Hume was followed by a similar session with Mr John Alderdice of the Alliance party. It emerged yesterday that the Irish government believes it will become clear by early December if there is to be a breakthrough on the London-Dublin peace initiative for Northern Ireland announced by Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, in Brussels last week. Mr Reynolds told the Irish parliament he intended to meet Mr Major again on December 3, before the next meeting of the European Council, to discuss the peace process. Dublin also acted yesterday to clear up ambiguity over the six-point plan set out last week by Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister. One of Mr Spring's points was that Unionist consent would be required for any constitutional change in the north. But Mr Reynolds made it clear yesterday this was not intended as an additional concession. 'I would like to make it very clear that what we are talking about here is the consent of a majority to constitutional change, as precisely defined in Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish agreement,' he told the Irish parliament. 'The government have in no way departed from that position.' In the Commons, Mr John Smith, Labour leader, urged Mr Major to 'take the lead' in efforts to persuade the province's political leaders to return to talks, saying there was an 'inescapable moral obligation' on them to 'co-operate in a new dialogue'. Mr Major, who held cabinet discussions on Northern Ireland yesterday morning, said he intended to take 'a very direct interest' in efforts to bring about a lasting peace, while hinting that an early return to round-table talks was unlikely. 'I don't want to see an artificially staged event where the talks are called together with no probability of them making progress,' he said.</p>

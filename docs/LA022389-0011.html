			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHANGING TIMES: MOSCOW YESHIVA OPENS  </P> <P> When Shimon Yusim began studying Hebrew clandestinely a year ago with a group  of friends in a Moscow apartment, he knew he was taking a chance.  </P> <P> Helin Lipskerov knew that she, too, was treading on dangerous ground when she  bought a Torah five years ago on the black market.  </P> <P> Those days of risk seemed to fade into the distance Wednesday as Yusim and  Lipskerov attended an event they would once have thought miraculous -- a  ceremony marking the opening of the Soviet Union's first legal yeshiva, or  Jewish religious school, since the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917.  </P> <P> "Praise the Lord, for He is good; this is a great moment for us," Rabbi Joel  Poupko said in Hebrew to about 200 assembled Jews.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Few Understood Words  </P> <P> Many did not understand a word he said, but the sound of the ancient language  being spoken openly in Moscow brought a round of applause.  </P> <P> It was an emotional moment for Poupko, whose grandfather was jailed in 1926 for  conducting Jewish studies and trying to open a yeshiva. Poupko, his voice  breaking, said, "We are fulfilling the duty of our forefathers."  </P> <P> He read a message from Israeli President Chaim Herzog, who praised the  inauguration of the yeshiva as "an opening of a small window."  </P> <P> Times are changing quickly for Jews in this officially atheistic state. In  recent weeks, B'nai B'rith, the international Jewish organization, opened a  chapter here, a Jewish cultural center was permitted to open -- the first in  more than 50 years -- and the Soviet Union gave visiting Israeli diplomats  permission to use their embassy building, which was closed when Moscow and  Jerusalem severed diplomatic relations 21 years ago.  </P> <P> "We are at a critical turning point," said Yusim, 24, who wore a yarmulke, the  traditional head covering, and carried a book entitled "Beginning Hebrew."  </P> <P> "I am optimistic about the future," he said. "But I also think that while we  can, we Jews must gather closer together so we can stand strong against  reactionary forces."  </P> <P> Until very recently, religious studies were illegal in the Soviet Union. Hebrew  teachers gave lessons so secretly that many Jews did not even know it was  possible to learn the language here. When caught, teachers were often jailed on  charges of espousing anti-Soviet propaganda.  </P> <P> But under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Communist Party has eased  religious restrictions in an apparent effort to eliminate an issue that has  sparked angry exchanges with the United States and other Western countries.  </P> <P> Gorbachev may see this as a way to improve international relations, but for  Soviet Jews it has provided an opportunity to explore their Jewish history.  </P> <P> "When I finished at the university and was trying to get work, I was turned  down for several jobs and was allowed to know that it was because I was  Jewish," said Lipskerov, 35, who now works as a pharmaceutical researcher. "I  knew then that I did not belong with the Russian people, but I knew nothing  about being Jewish.  </P> <P> "I came to realize that I belonged nowhere. Now that things seem freer, I began  studying Hebrew three weeks ago. My hope is to have a chance to explore my  Jewish roots."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Years of Secret Effort  </P> <P> Hanoch Teller, an Israeli who grew up in Stamford, Conn., and now lives in  Jerusalem, said the founding of the yeshiva is the result of years of  clandestine work.  </P> <P> "Jews such as myself from abroad used to come in every several months to try to  help organize it," he said. "Finally it has paid off."  </P> <P> Eighty students have been accepted for the first classes, which will be taught  by five rabbis, three from Israel and two from the United States. The Soviet  government will provide stipends for the students, and other financial support  will come from a group of Israeli and American philanthropists.  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on  Havana radio and television in Spanish between 15 and 21 January.    Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 15 January reports that a  research biochemist at the institute for citrus and other fruit  crops recently won an award from the Ministry of Agriculture for  obtaining a set of reagents and a blend for the development of a  reaction, the purpose of which is to diagnose quickly and with  96-percent effectiveness the tree virus called "the virus of  sadness" [el virus de la tristeza] which causes great damage to  citrus crops worldwide. "The Cuban reagent is obtained from the  blood plasma of previously immunized laboratory animals. The  monoclonal antibody is capable of recognizing this tree virus  before symptoms are present. This allows one to determine, after  a sampling, the rate of incidence of the disease and fight it  effectively and more cheaply. A reagent for the same purpose  imported from Spain used to cost Cuba $2,000 per milligram. Our  product has a production cost of $45. The market is being  studied with a view to marketing the product for between $800  and $1,200 per milligram."    Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 17 January reports that in  1993  the Heroes of Playa Giron Contingent, part of the Union of  Caribbean Construction Enterprises in Varadero, produced 50  million pesos in tourist works despite a 35-percent drop in  available material resources and electricity. The contingent is  currently completing the Gaviota Cuatro Hotel.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 on 17 January reports that the Pinar  del Rio Provincial Assembly has approved its 1994 budget of 198  million pesos, to which Pinar del Rio Province contributes 82.7  million. The state must contribute the remaining 115.1 million,  which is approximately 30 percent less than its contribution in  1993.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 18 January reports that the  60th  Anniversary of the October Revolution Enterprise in Holguin has  completed the first ten Cubar-90 rice combines, part of the 60  promised for delivery by July. The report adds that it costs  $90,000 to build each of these machines and that they represent  a savings of $900,000 for Cuba. Plant workers also plan to  rebuild 120 KTP-2 sugarcane combines, according to a Radio  Rebelde report at 0000 GMT on 20 January.    Radio Reloj at 2046 GMT on 19 January reports that the  Mexican Government has donated 3 million notebooks to Cuban  school children.    Radio Reloj at 2054 GMT on 19 January reports that  Camaguey's  Venus Beauty Institute in Camaguey offers beauty services to  local and visiting women. The Venus Beauty Center also has a  cafeteria and a well-stocked store that sells imported goods,  which is "attended by competent workers who take in some $1,000  daily." Reloj adds: "Appointments for services can be made for  the same day or for six months later. Charges are based on  incentive; after paying the state tax of 30,000 pesos, the rest  is profit."    Cuba Vision Network at 2320 GMT on 19 January reports that  the Isle of Youth Citrus enterprise has developed a product  called (perquina), a chemical frequently used in the food  industry. The product, produced from citrus plant wastes, should  save the country considerable money.    Radio Reloj at 1500 GMT on 20 January reports that workers  of  the Victoria de Giron Citrus enterprise have harvested 1 million  quintals of citrus fruit in the campaign which began in August  1993.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 20 January reports the  following:    More than 10,000 people in rural areas of Granma Province  will benefit from a joint Cuba-UNICEF project to improve water  management systems in rural areas. The project is part of the  national action program approved by the Cuban Government in 1991  to fulfill the agreement signed at the World Summit for Children  held in 1990.    Unit No. 5 of the 10 October generating plant in Nuevitas,  Camaguey, will begin its maintenance program on 24 January. The  improvements should increase output to more than 400 megawatts  per hour by 1995.    Under a biodiversity protection agreement, the UN  Development  Program granted Cuba $2 million, of the $10 million contributed  by the United Nations, for the purchase of microcomputers and  advanced technology for use at the environmental protection  center in Ciego de Avila Province.    Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 21 January reports the members  of the 1,553 sugar Basic Cooperative Production Units,  independent farmers, sugar cooperatives, and the Youth Labor  Army will work together this year to plant more that 30,000  caballerias of sugarcane throughout the country. An effort will  be made between January and April to plant 5,000 caballerias of  sugarcane.    Radio Reloj at 2045 GMT on 21 January reports that Ecuadoran  physician Jose Galindo has sent Cuba a personal donation of over  $20,000 worth of medicines, hospital instruments, and similar  products. "The physician will be participating in the fourth  continental Latin American and Caribbean forum for solidarity  and sovereignty for our peoples, which begins on 25 January."    Radio Reloj at 2059 GMT on 21 January notes that a meeting  of  agricultural sector union leaders in Havana Province has  reported that cold-season tuber and vegetable planting is  virtually up to date, with close to 1,600 caballerias planted as  of 20 January.

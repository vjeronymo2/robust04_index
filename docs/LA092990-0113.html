			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VICTIM OF BERKELEY SIEGE IN GOOD SPIRITS;  </P> <P> RECUPERATION: SHOT SEVEN TIMES BY A DERANGED GUNMAN, KAREN GRUNDHOFER OF  NEWPORT BEACH IS IN STABLE CONDITION. 'IT'S A MIRACLE,' HER FATHER SAYS.  </P> <P> It was "the one call you never want to get as a father," John F. Grundhofer  recalled Friday. "Three-thirty in the morning: 'Your daughter's been shot.' "  </P> <P> Miraculously, Karen Grundhofer of Newport Beach survived seven bullet wounds  when a deranged gunman opened fire in a Berkeley hotel bar early Thursday  morning. The 22-year-old UC Berkeley senior was in stable condition and good  spirits Friday at Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center in San Francisco,  recuperating from wounds that ranged from her hip to her chest. The bullets  went through muscle and missed vital organs, said her father, a bank executive  who flew from Minneapolis to the Bay Area to be with his daughter.  </P> <P> "Seven bullets in her, but it's a miracle," Grundhofer said in an interview.  "Three inches either way, and she would have been dead. And that's not much  when you're pointing a gun from 40 feet away. . . .  </P> <P> "When you look at her wounds, you say 'How can she be alive?' "  </P> <P> One hostage was killed and six others, including Karen Grundhofer, were injured  during the seven-hour siege at Henry's Publick House &amp; Grille. The gunman,  Mehrdad Dashti, fired shots from three handguns, terrorized the hostages and  singled out blonde women for sexual abuse before police shot and killed him.  </P> <P> John Grundhofer said his daughter told him that she had been having drinks at  the bar -- a longtime establishment popular with UC Berkeley students -- when  the siege began.  </P> <P> She was lying on the floor, as ordered by the gunman, when the bullets hit, he  said.  </P> <P> "She was the first or second person hit," Grundhofer said. "The other one was  the young man who died."  </P> <P> Soon after Karen was hit, another young woman "rescued her and pulled her out  of the room," Grundhofer said. The two women hid behind a couch outside the  room where the hostages were held in the bar, located inside the Durant Hotel,  and Karen's rescuer applied pressure to the bullet wounds to slow the bleeding  until paramedics arrived, the father said.  </P> <P> "Karen was calm and alert the whole time, never unconscious," he said. "The  people at Highland (General Hospital in Oakland, where she was initially taken)  stated she was incredibly brave."  </P> <P> Karen Grundhofer was later transferred to Pacific Presbyterian, where she will  remain for a few days. "She's in no danger and receiving good care, but we're  not going to take any chances," her father said, adding that doctors want to  observe her for signs of infection. She also may need plastic surgery.  </P> <P> Apparently, the bullets damaged no internal organs because Karen was lying on  her side and the bullets passed solely through skin and muscle tissue, John  Grundhofer said.  </P> <P> "It's hard to explain, but whatever the angle, however it worked, she was  incredibly lucky. The good Lord was watching over her," he said.  </P> <P> Despite her good spirits, Karen Grundhofer is not up to interviews with the  press, her father said. He was flying back Friday afternoon to Minneapolis,  where he is chairman of First Bank System. Karen's mother, Lynda, and sister,  Kathryn, who live in Newport Beach, were staying with her, he said.  </P> <P> John Grundhofer was Wells Fargo &amp; Co.'s top banker in Southern California  until earlier this year, when he departed to head up the struggling First Bank  System. He has been chairman of the Southern California United States Olympic  Committee and a board member of South Coast Repertory and the Los Angeles Music  Center.  </P> <P> Karen Grundhofer, who was a debutante at the 1986 Children's Home Society Ball,  graduated from Newport Harbor High School that same year. Her father said she  currently is a fifth-year senior, majoring in sociology, and a member of Pi  Beta Phi at UC Berkeley. She works part time at the Durant Hotel, spent a  summer employed by the Four Seasons hotel in Washington and hopes to go into  hotel management, he said.  </P> <P> Her hospital room is full of flowers from well-wishers, he reported, noting  that "the spirit of the school is terrific. There's concern from across the  country." John Grundhofer added that several of his daughter's friends were  among the hostages forced to remain with the gunman for the duration of the  siege.  </P> <P> "In that sense, she's lucky: She didn't have to sit there for seven hours," he  said. "She's got seven bullet holes, but young kids heal fast, and she's in a  great frame of mind. . . . She's so lucky to be alive. It's incredible."  </P></p>

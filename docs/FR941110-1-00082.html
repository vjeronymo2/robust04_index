			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The importers granted permits for a year would be asked to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> furnish information upon the import of each shipment of used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substance. EPA is requesting comment on a list of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information requirements in paragraph B.1. to determine those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that best verify that an imported controlled substance is used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Such information would become the reporting requirements for each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular shipment for individuals holding a permit to import  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used controlled substances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The yearly permit system described may be easier to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement and comply with than a permit system for each imported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shipment of used controlled substance. A permit system for each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shipment, however, could provide more detailed information and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential control over each particular import of used substances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency seeks comments on the options discussed above and also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solicits suggestions on other approaches for permit requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are not burdensome but adequately ensure that imported used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substances are in fact ``used.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> C. Adjustments and Clarifications of the Allowance Program to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Become Effective January 1, 1995 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> This section describes proposed changes to the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation in an effort to address issues that have arisen since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the December 10, 1993 rule. The proposed clarifications in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section are made to increase the efficiency of the requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and reduce the administrative burden for affected individuals and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Agency. The following paragraphs propose changes to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current rule that would go into effect January 1, 1995, for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> last control period before the phaseout begins on January 1,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 1. Changes in Requirements for Export to Article 5 Countries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> In accordance with the Montreal Protocol, limited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production of controlled substances for export to Article 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> countries may continue after the phaseout. Specifically, Article  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2 of the Protocol allows Parties to produce beyond the January 1,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1996 phaseout to meet the basic domestic needs of Article 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> countries. Article 5 countries are defined by the Parties as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developing countries ``whose annual calculated level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption of class I, Group I controlled substances is less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 0.3 kilograms per capita.'' Article 5 countries are listed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Appendix E to Subpart A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the current Allowance Program, a company must have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production and consumption allowances before producing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substance for export to an Article 5 country.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Companies with a baseline allocation of consumption and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production allowances for specific controlled substances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently are given an allocation of potential production  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowances amounting to ten percent of their baseline production  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowances until January 1, 2000, and fifteen percent of baseline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production allowances from January 1, 2000, until January 1, 2011  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on phaseout dates required by the Clean Air Act (see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussion below regarding proposed changes in percentage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocations, based on accelerated phaseout dates). These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> companies may request the conversion of these potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production allowances to production allowances after exporting a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substance to an Article 5 country.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Effective January 1, 1995, EPA proposes changing the name  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of potential production allowances to Article 5 allowances. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> today's rule, EPA also proposes to eliminate the process for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> converting potential production allowances to production  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowances beginning January 1, 1995. This proposed change would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eliminate the current process where companies expend production  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and consumption allowances up-front to produce a controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substance for export to an Article 5 country and, after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> export, request the conversion of potential production allowances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to production allowances. The changes are proposed to anticipate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the elimination of production allowances for class I controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances (except methyl bromide) after January 1, 1996, and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ease the administrative burdens created by the current process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA proposes that beginning January 1, 1995, the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assign Article 5 allowances to companies that have an allocated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baseline of production allowances. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  Under the proposed system,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a company would notify the Agency at the end of the quarter in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which they exported to Article 5 countries. EPA would then  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deduct the amount of controlled substance exported to Article 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> countries from the balance of Article 5 allowances held by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> company, rather than require an application to convert potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production allowances to production allowances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> Under a separate Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  notice, EPA is allocating Article 5 allowances for production of methyl bromide (class I, Group VI) to persons with baseline production allowances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency is also proposing to correct the date from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which, and until which, companies may produce 15 percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baseline allowances for export to Article 5 countries. CAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 604(e)(2)(C) permits production for developing countries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to exceed baseline allowances by up to 15 percent beginning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 1, 2000, and to continue until January 1, 2010 (2012 in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the case of methyl chloroform). However, the Protocol permits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production for export to Article 5 countries at 15 percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baseline allowances beginning with the phaseout date (January 1,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994, for halons, and January 1, 1996, for CFCs, methyl  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chloroform and carbon tetrachloride) and continuing for ten years  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after the Protocol phaseout (until 2003 for halons and until 2006  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for CFCs, methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride). Since the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terms of the Protocol are more stringent than those of the CAA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA proposes to permit production of class I substances for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> export to Article 5 countries to continue until 2006 (2003 for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> halons).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

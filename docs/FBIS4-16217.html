			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address to nation by Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev; </F> place not given--live, broadcast in progress]    [Text] Vladimir Kazimirov [Russian envoy to the Karabakh  talks] visited Baku and held talks with us and presented a new  draft agreement to us. After discussing this draft, we gave our  own proposals and views and indicated that in principle we are  inclined to sign such an agreement, provided that our proposals  and conditions are accepted. After that Kazimirov was to visit  Yerevan and hold talks there. We are still waiting for the  result of these talks.    Despite all this, Armenia's armed forces have resumed  attacks  on our positions and on Azerbaijani territory in recent days. A  large Armenian force heavily attacked Geranboyskiy  [Shaumyanovskiy] Rayon early on the morning of 10 April, and  attempted to take Gulistan and Talish. Bloody battles took  place. Azerbaijani Army units gave them a deserving reply. In  this clash both the Armenian side and our armed forces suffered  casualties. Though the Armenian Armed Forces managed to occupy  a few heights there, they failed to achieve their objective.  Battles have been continuing in that sector since yesterday.    Armenia's armed forces launched powerful attacks in two  directions early yesterday morning -- one in Agdere  [Mardakertskiy] Rayon and the other in Agdamskiy Rayon. They  tried to occupy Matagis and Hakobgamari in Agdere. They also  launched three powerful successive attacks in Agdamskiy Rayon  yesterday. As is known, the city of Agdam is under Armenian  occupation, but our armed forces control a part of the rayon,  and our citizens are living in the towns there. These cities  were also subjected to shelling and the military headquarters  there came under fire. Despite all this, our armed forces gave  a deserving reply to the Armenian Armed Forces on this front  too. The fighting is continuing, and will probably continue all  day. In fact, having reinforced its forces, the Armenians  resumed their attacks in these directions and in Geranboyskiy  Rayon.    This marks a new stage in Armenia's aggression. It appears  that having taken advantage of the recent cease-fire, the  Armenian Armed Forces have regrouped and have brought in forces  from every corner of Armenia -- and I can state this with utmost  certainty -- to this region and are launching attacks. This  shows they have not ceased their aggressive actions, but  continue striving to seize additional Azerbaijani territory in  pursuit of their occupationist aims.    I am pleased to inform the Azerbaijani citizens that  Azerbaijani Army units are waging bloody battles on all these  fronts, strongly resisting the enemy, dealing powerful blows to  the Armenian Armed Forces, and reliably defending their own  positions. For example, the powerful three-pronged attacks in  Agdamskiy Rayon yesterday were checked. Our fighters were  martyred there; 21 were martyred, and 46 were wounded. Twelve  of the martyrs were from the battalion formed in Sumgait. The  battalion commander Elmar Edilov, a resident of Agdam who has  been fighting there for the last two years, died heroically, and  the deputy commander was gravely wounded. Undaunted by this our  Army units, were continuing to counter the Armenian attacks, and  defend their positions.    About 23 or 24 were killed or wounded in Agdere region, and  there are also casualties in Geranboyskiy Rayon.    As I address all Azerbaijani citizens today, I bow my head  to  honor the heroism of our sons and fellow citizens who heroically  died in recent days while defending their homeland, and giving a  deserving reply to the enemy. I express my condolences to the  families of all the Azerbaijani sons martyred for the homeland.  The martyrs' heroism will forever live in our hearts. May God  bless their souls.    During the bloody battles over the past three days,  Azerbaijan's heroic fighters and armed groups have inflicted  major blows to the Armenian armed formations that have launched  a new offensive against the Azerbaijani territory. Now, I do  not want to cite detailed figures, and there is no need to do  so. However, the Azerbaijani citizens should know that in those  regions -- and I already gave our side's losses -- the Armenian  Armed Forces' losses are much greater than ours, both in terms  of men and material. For example, during the fighting in  Agdamskiy Rayon yesterday, four Armenian tanks and a number of  infantry fighting vehicles were destroyed, and they lost many  military vehicles in other regions as well. Their casualties  were particularly high, including officers. We know this for a  fact.    I want to emphasize that while dying for the homeland, our  soldiers, officers, and fighters are also inflicting powerful  blows to the enemy. Before I came to the television studio  today, I contacted the fronts, and our soldiers and commanders  informed me that they are firmly defending our positions, and  are repulsing the enemy, and assured me that they will not  surrender any territory to them. However, the fighting  continues, and I expect the Armenian Armed Forces to make a  major redeployment of forces from all over Armenia to our  fronts, after which they will resume their attacks.    We are experiencing a serious situation. However, these  grave days have become normal under the present conditions.  Azerbaijani territory has been the victim of Armenian  aggression for the last six years, and we have no other  alternative. As I said at the beginning of my statement, our  real aim is to put an end to the war through peaceful means.  Regrettably the Armenian Armed Forces, the Armenian aggressors,  and the aggressive circles in Armenia are not willing to follow  this path. When they are participating in peace talks they  ostensibly claim to favor peace; but, when it comes to action,  they again reveal their true faces, as in these past three days.    By television and radio, I now convey my sincere greetings  to our fighters, soldiers, officers, and the all citizens at the  front who are defending our lands. I congratulate them for  standing firm in the defense of our land and express my  gratitude to them. I want to say that I am sure that they will  continue to reliably defend our lands and will give the Armenian  Armed Forces the response they deserve, hit them hard, and  prevent them from (?regrouping).    At the same time, an analysis of the present developments  once again shows that we must further strengthen our defense  against Armenian aggression. More attention must be paid to  forming Army units.    As you know, during 9 to 11 April I visited all along the  front, saw various units, and met with our soldiers, officers,  and commanders. All of them are defending our territory with  high morale. However, I also feel that there are shortcomings  in our Army, which must be further strengthened and even better  organized. Therefore, the entire population, all the citizens of  Azerbaijan, and each person should work to further strengthen  the Army. The events of the last three days once again show  that we have no other alternative.    Therefore, today I am calling on all the Azerbaijani people:  I want you all realize that our republic is in danger. Each  person should do his part in strengthening the Army and of our  defenses. From this point of view, the recent slackened Army  call up seriously disturbs me, and I believe it will disturb  every patriotic Azerbaijani. Of late there has been an increase  in desertions. Desertion is treason against the people and  homeland. Evading the mobilization is treason against the  people and homeland. Therefore, I once again call on the  deserters and draft dodgers to return to the true path. I want  to tell them what they are doing will not benefit them. I want  to tell the families and friends of the young deserters and  draft dodgers: You too bear responsibility for the desertion of  your sons and relatives. Azerbaijan is the homeland of all of  us. Everybody, each citizen, must guard the homeland. When the  soldiers and officers are standing guard at the fronts, bleeding  and dying, those citizens who cannot go to the fronts must  contribute at their own work places and should send their  eligible sons, grandsons, and brothers to the fronts. They must  send them to serve in the Army; there is no other alternative,  there can be no other way.    Therefore, I once again call on the Azerbaijani citizens and  people: Come, let us all join forces and rise in defense of the  motherland. Let no one think that if the Armenian Armed Forces  again achieve victory and advance in some region it will benefit  anyone. It will bring no benefits to anyone. It will only be a  new blow to the Azerbaijani people; it will be another blow to  the Azerbaijan Republic and its independence. Let no one think  that he is absolved of this responsibility, or that he will  attain his personal goals with such a defeat. No. God will  (?punish) them. I trust in our people's common sense and I  appeal to them in the hope that each Azerbaijani, each citizen,  will arise and follow our just path and refrain from taking the  path of treason against the people, the path of worsening  Azerbaijan's present grave situation.    I hope that the majority of our citizens, the Azerbaijani  people, stand and will continue to stand fast in defense of the  homeland. I want to assure our people that our army, our  soldiers, officers, and fighters at the front are reliably  defending our lands and that the current Armenian attacks will  be repulsed.    In this regard I want to address recent rumors. As you  know, rumors as such are not worthy of my attention. However,  sometimes a rumor spread by one person creates confusion in  society and harms our work. In connection with recent  developments, there are rumors that the Armenian Armed Forces  are going to capture this or that place and that people should  flee from such places, from Terter, for instance; or that  incidents will take place in Ganja. These rumors only serve the  enemy, and those responsible for them are the enemies of the  Azerbaijani people and traitors.    Let them know that their efforts are in vain. Our people are  now aware. Regrettably, there are even some officials  circulating such rumors. They disgust me, and I hope that our  people feel the same. I want to assure the people that no one  should worry, for our land is being reliably defended, and the  Armenian attacks are being repulsed. Let no one worry, let no  one leave his post.    In connection with recent developments, I also call on the  Azerbaijani citizens of Armenian origin living in Daghlyk  [Nagorno]-Karabakh. They are citizens of the Azerbaijani  Republic; they cannot be citizens of another republic or state,  because they are living on Azerbaijani territory. I believe  that most of them are now experiencing great hardships.    The Armenian soldiers taken prisoner during recent fighting,  and even during their previous blitz, have revealed during  interrogation that they are being brought to the front by force  -- they push them under duress, they force them to fight. We  even found out that when they try to retreat, they are punished  and shot in the back; they are forced to fight at gun point.  What these prisoners say shows that the soldiers from  Daghlyk-Karabakh, and most of the Armenian ones too, are brought  here by force. For example, an Armenian soldier taken prisoner  in Geranboyskiy Rayon yesterday said that most of their troops  had been released from prison. These convicts were released and  told if they obeyed orders they would be pardoned. Even the  people coming from Yerevan, Leninakan [Gyumri], and Edzhmiatsin,  and other regions of Armenia indicate that they were forced to  come here. This is learned from POW statements.    However, I am specifically addressing the Armenians living  in Daghlyk-Karabakh who are citizens of Azerbaijan. You should  realize that you too have been in a bad situation for the last  six years. You too are tormented, and have suffered many  losses. Your houses and cities have been destroyed and your  living conditions have deteriorated beyond belief. What is it  that you want? You too are being killed in this fighting and  are sustaining losses. Yet, what have you achieved by this?  For the last six years, the aggressive and nationalist circles  have dragged you, Azerbaijani citizens, you residents of  Daghlyk-Karabakh, into a futureless war. You and the  Azerbaijanis who used to live in Daghlyk-Karabakh, as well as  the Azerbaijanis who are still living around you in Azerbaijan,  lived in friendship and happiness for scores of years. You  Armenians who have settled in Daghlyk-Karabakh have been there  for the past 150 years. Leaving aside a few conflicts during  that period, you have always lived with the Azerbaijanis under  friendly and happy conditions. Why was such an existence not  good enough for you? Why this? Why this bloodshed? Why do you  prefer these losses and destruction? Why? Wake up. Realize  that there is no end to this war. The aggressive circles will  not be able to achieve their objectives, or attain their goals.  The Azerbaijani Republic will never give up its own territory.  It is not yet too late to cut the losses in half. There is  still a chance. It is not too late; renounce this path; pull  out of this fight; pull out of this war; and I assure you we  will continue to protect you as Azerbaijani citizens, as our own  citizens. Your rights will be protected. We will create all  the necessary conditions for you to live in safety.    I also call on the citizens of the Armenian Republic, the  Armenian people, their leaders, on Armenian President Levon Ter-  Petrosyan, the Armenian political parties and their leaders. I  want to inform them that this aggressive policy can lead to no  end. You should renounce it. There is no need for us to prove  that this war was started by Armenia's aggressive and  nationalistic circles and will bring no benefits to the people  of Armenia. The Armenian people have also been suffering for  the last six years. What do we need this for?    I tried to telephone Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan  yesterday and today, but it was not possible; therefore, I am  addressing him on television: I call on him to act responsibly,  I am calling on all the Armenian leaders to act responsibly for  the sake of their own people. In recent fighting, several  hundred Armenian troops died or were wounded. Armenia's  aggressive circles, the circles continuing this war, are  responsible for the deaths of their own citizens. They are  shedding this blood, and there is no end to it. I want to state  sincerely that we want to put an end to this war. We want to  make use of all the opportunities to conduct talks. However, on  one condition: The Armenian aggressors, the Armed Forces must  leave the Azerbaijani lands, the Azerbaijan Republic's  territorial integrity must be guaranteed, and the inviolability  of the Azerbaijan Republic must be ensured.    Therefore, having analyzed the results of the past three  days, I reiterate that we are for peace, not because such  aggression and attacks frighten us, but because we do not want  bloodshed.    It is known to the world that the Azerbaijani Republic is  suffering from Armenian aggression, that more than 20 percent of  our territory is occupied by Armenian Armed Forces. Therefore,  we are not the occupiers, we are merely waging a just war and  are defending our own territory, citizens and homeland.    In calling upon the world community, international  organizations, the UN, its Security Council and the leaders of  the United States, England, France, Russia, China -- who are  permanent members of the Security Council -- I call on them to  take effective measures to stop the Armenian aggression.    We have accepted the Russian mediation initiative and tried  to benefit from this initiative, but regrettably, despite months  of talks, no results have been achieved. I hope that a great  country like Russia -- which has close friendly relations with  both Azerbaijan and Armenia, a state with great worldwide  influence, a member of the UN Security Council -- will play its  role in this region.    I also call on the CSCE and members of the Minsk Group to  be more active. I call upon Azerbaijan's neighboring states,  namely Turkey, Iran, and Georgia: I believe that being  neighbors with both Azerbaijan and Armenia, they should not  remain on the sidelines of this conflict and should make more  effective use of their own possibilities to put an end to this  war.    I also want to point out that the timing of the Armenian  Armed Forces' attacks against Azerbaijani territory and our  military positions for the past three days is not a mere  coincidence. Some time ago--perhaps a month ago--the CSCE Minsk  Group's new chairman, Ian Eliason, came to Azerbaijan and  Armenia with a large delegation and held talks on the need to  further strengthen the Minsk Group.    Minsk Group's debates on Daghlyk-Karabakh resumed in Prague  on 11 April--that is, yesterday. And at this very time, when  the representatives of Azerbaijan and Armenia are taking part in  that session, the Armenian Armed Forces have launched this  strong attack. As you know, the press reported that the CIS  leaders will meet in Moscow from 14 to 15 April. Important  issues will be discussed there. The Armenian attacks on  Azerbaijan on the eve of this meeting have certain aims. It  may be that with these attacks they want to pressure the  Azerbaijani Republic and its leadership. This in vain; no one  can pressure us. We have defended and will continue to defend  Azerbaijan's independence. We have fought for our independence  at all costs. We have also become a member of the CIS. We were  greatly saddened when the Armenian attack began, even though we  are a member of the CIS and were getting ready to go to Moscow.    Taking all these things into consideration, I also appeal to  the CIS and its leaders, declaring once again that there should  be no more war between CIS member countries, for such a thing is  abnormal and it must cease. I particularly address Russia,  which has a special and influential place in the CIS, and  Russia's leaders: An end must be put these events. Russia has  the means to peacefully resolve these problems. I hope that they  will make use of these means, as they should.    I hope that my calls will not go unnoticed, and will be duly  received by the international community. With trust and  confidence in the international community, international  organizations and international norms, I am conveying my views  to them through television and radio.    To once again refer to the domestic life of our own republic  I once again call on all Azerbaijani citizens, political groups  and forces: I want to state that everyone should serve one  objective during these grave days for our republic: to ensure  the security of the Azerbaijani Republic, help it to survive the  present grave war situation, and guarantee its territorial  integrity. We must all unite on this path, and walk together  along this path. If anyone tries to take advantage of this  grave situation for their own loathsome purposes they should  realize that they are bound to fail. There are such forces in  Azerbaijan; and such intentions are also fostered by forces  outside Azerbaijan, which are now active. They all should  realize that they will not be able to attain their loathsome  objectives.    I trust in the Azerbaijani people's (?maturity),  (?alertness), and bravery; and I am sure that we will  successfully overcome these trials and will defend our land and  give a fitting response to all the aggressive forces.    I again call on our soldiers, officers, and fighters at the  front: You are defending your homeland and native soil. You  are serving sacred goals. Your service will always be  appreciated by the people, society, and state.    Because a part of my statement was addressed to neighboring  countries, I will now repeat the gist of my statement in  Russian. This is because I want the leaders of these states to  hear this from me in person today.</p>

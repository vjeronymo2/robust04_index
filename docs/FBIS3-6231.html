Foreign Minister Hata said: The coalition parties are  working hard to steer the government. But, we just cannot  continue indefinitely to keep the current process, in which the  parties take every single issue to their own party for consensus  before the coalition makes a decision as a while.    He then said: Rather than insisting on keeping our own  party, I would like to form a strong and stable political force  which can compete with the Liberal Democratic Party. I do not  mind calling it a new new-party [shin shinto].    In this way he renewed his willingness to form a two-party  system, in which change of power can be realized.</p>

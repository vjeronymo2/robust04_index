			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Benedicte Vaes: "Return of Heart: Watch Out </F> for a Cardiac Arrest"]    [Text] Pushed by Happart and its trade union rank and file,  will the PS [French-speaking Socialist Party] enter the budget  negotiations with the intention of converting them into a social  crusade? [Belgian Prime Minister] Jean-Luc Dehaene, encouraged  by his still fresh popularity and international credibility, has  warned the PS against trying to turn the government to the left.  Dehaene does not have the least intention of deviating from the  line he established for himself or from the white paper.    "There is no question of making the same mistake as in 1988  and reducing our efforts," he said. "Any `return of heart'  [reference to PS election slogan] which is not based on a good  diet leads straight to a cardiac arrest. Having a healthy  economy and public finances is good for the heart."    The CVP [Christian People's Party] Budget Minister Herman  Van  Rompuy had already made an initial warning to the PS. The prime  minister, who is planning to stay, "I intend to go through to  the end of my term of office and to ask for a mandate to  continue," confirms this.    Dehaene had the following message for those who, following  Jose Happart, want to break up the Austerity Plan and review  privatization: "The electorate wants us to stick to our guns.  It is the best strategy to counter the extreme right: People  need to cling to something. There is no question of changing  direction every time, otherwise we will have a boomerang effect."    The 1995 budget, which must be elaborated in July, will not  be an easy job, Dehaene confirmed after Van Rompuy. "Wage  moderation is making companies more competitive but reducing  state revenue and social security payments," he said. Where  will the difference be found? In the pocket of the people?  While not brandishing a tax veto, Dehaene wants to be  reassuring. "We have already asked people to make very  considerable sacrifices," he said. "Additional taxes or charges  are not the first option. That is the easy solution."    Will the social sector be excluded from the negotiations? "I  do not rule out new measures for employment, even if the  budgetary margin is tight," he said.    On the "Clarification" news show, Dehaene went out of his  way  to explain that the measures of the Austerity Plan would give  the hoped-for results, as long as "time is allowed to take its  course and the government is stable." Dehaene is planning to  strengthen the initial measures so that the burgeoning recovery  can translate into jobs. Dehaene also has singled out the  results of the youth employment plan (40,000 jobs).    However, there is no reason to hope that wage moderation  will  automatically lead to jobs. The 1995-1996 interprofessional  negotiations will start under unfavorable auspices. The  employers do not intend to let themselves be tied by any  employment constraints, and they seem to consider that the  agreement is still-born.    But in Philippe Busquin's circles it was confirmed yesterday  that the PS only demanded to adapt social measures regarding  employment. It judges that all the social problems causing the  rise of the extreme right are linked to unemployment and is  demanding additional measures to help people return to work: A  local employment plan, increased security contracts,  multiservice checks and lower working times. Can these paths be  taken without compromizing the convergence? The negotiations  will give the answer.</p>

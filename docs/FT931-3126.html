			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Nafta test for Clinton's team - The conflicting demands of trade pact partners and dissident Democrats AS President Bill Clinton's trade officials today begin their first important negotiation - over side deals for the North American Free Trade Agreement - they will be walking a fine line between their trading partners' sensitivities and the stiff demands from some members of their own party. In meetings in Washington with the Mexican and Canadian chief negotiators - Mr Herminio Blanco Mendoz and Mr John Weekes - deputy trade representative Rufus Yerxa will search for a formula to persuade the US Congress that Nafta will not lure US companies south of the border with the promise of cheap labour and weak enforcement of environmental rules. The negotiators must, at the same time, devise an enforcement mechanism that does not infringe on Mexican sovereignty or, even worse in US eyes, cede to Mexico a part of US sovereignty. Many labour activists believe the US wants no complaints filed in its courts about treatment of migrant Mexican workers by companies or growers north of the border. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, hopes to send Nafta to Congress this summer in time to have it implemented as scheduled next January 1. The deal is widely supported by Republicans, but to win over enough Democrats for passage, the president will have to persuade them that it will raise living standards and clean up pollution on the whole continent. Still, there will be many Democrats such as Mr Craig Merrilees, director of the California Fair Trade Campaign, who supported President Clinton in the election but opposes the Nafta. He believes it is impossible to 'fix' the pact because the administration is unwilling to confront two central dilemmas of the negotiations. These are the wage differential and the environment. The wage difference between Mexico and its northern neighbours is what Mr Merrilees calls 'the main reason that Nafta exists in the first place'. If the administration attempts to close that wage gap through, for example, strong enforcement of labour right rules, support for the agreement will erode among corporations. The Mexican government will also oppose raising wages because it wants to be as attractive as possible to foreign investors. 'Mexican citizens don't have the right to petition their government,' said Mr Merrilees. 'They don't have due process. Their constitution is regularly violated by a regime that has been in power for 65 years.' In his view, the question is how such a government can be trusted to uphold enforcement promises. The support of Mr Richard Gephardt, House majority leader, is the most crucial to the Nafta's passage. Just back from a trip to Mexico with Mr Merrilees and other congressmen, he related several environmental horror stories to the House Ways and Means committee last week, including one involving cows, whose milk is sold in Tijuana, dying from lead poisoning. 'The current Nafta will do nothing to stem the tide of pollution that endangers the health, safety and welfare of citizens on both sides of our borders,' he said. 'Nor will it stem the haemorrhage of jobs to Mexico or help recreate the link between productivity and wages by empowering the workers through their unions and their political system.' The Clinton solution, as defined last week by Mr Kantor would be two trilateral councils on environment and labour, which may have the power to investigate environmental and labour violations. Last week Mr Kantor was suggesting that public pressure serve in place of a formal enforcement mechanism. But, by yesterday, testifying before a Senate committee, he was promising that the side pacts would have 'teeth at the end of this process'. Pushed to describe how environmental clean-up would be paid for, he talked vaguely in terms of a fund, perhaps capitalised by government and business, or paid for through 'fees'. If that does not convince sceptics, he has another idea, borrowed from the intellectual property rights section of the current Nafta text. It would require Mexico to change its law, so that citizens could appeal in Mexican courts against decisions from administrative agencies. The Clinton administration is also considering the possibility of using trade sanctions as an enforcement tool. The use of sanctions - even if Mexico and Canada agree - will not satisfy Mr Merrilees and his colleagues in the labour and environmental movements. However, it may help bring Mr Gephardt on board if Nafta is presented with a strong job retraining programme and a funding mechanism, such as cross-border tax on imports, dedicated to environmental clean-up.</p>

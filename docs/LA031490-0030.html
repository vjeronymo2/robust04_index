			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BERNSON ANNEXATION PROPOSAL ADVANCES  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson's proposal to annex 13,000 acres in the  Santa Susana Mountains was given a boost Tuesday.  </P> <P> Without debate, the city's Planning and Land Use Management Committee voted 3  to 0 to recommend that the full council order city officials to begin studying  the annexation proposal.  </P> <P> Bernson, who chairs the committee, has said annexation may take two years to  complete.  </P> <P> The city should annex the area to gain control over how the Santa Susana  Mountains are developed, Bernson contends. The area, largely undeveloped, is  primarily held by a few large property owners.  </P> <P> County sanitation officials are also looking at the area as the potential site  for a regional landfill and have sought to buy land options in the area as a  step toward securing a toehold.  </P></p>

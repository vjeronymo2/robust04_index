Since then the  Postal Service has established 75 field divisions and eliminated 42 district  offices and cut the number of management sectional centers from 212 to 131.  </P> <P> After the newest round, there will be 73 field divisions and 94 sectional  centers. Facilities that house the management centers and field divisions will  continue their mail-handling operations, the service said.  </P> <P> Under the consolidation, the Brooklyn field division in New York will become  part of the Queens division, and the St. Paul division will become part of the  Minneapolis division.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Centers That Will Go  </P> <P> The management sectional centers to be eliminated are:  </P> <P> Western Region: Pasadena, Redding and Marysville, Calif.; Pocatello, Ida.;  Salem, Ore.; Fairbanks, Alaska, and Flagstaff, Ariz.  </P> <P> Central Region: Carbondale and Champaign, Ill.; Sioux City, Iowa; Lafayette and  South Bend, Ind.; Eau Claire and Oshkosh, Wis.; Lincoln, Neb., and Saginaw,  Flint and Kalamazoo, Mich.  </P> <P> Southern Region: Alexandria, La.; Huntsville, Ala.; Jonesboro, Ark.; Tupelo,  Miss.; Waco, Tex., and Chattanooga, Tenn.  </P> <P> Eastern Region: Ashland, Corbin and Bowling Green, Ky.; Charlottesville, Va.;  Bluefield, W.Va., and Zanesville, Ohio.  </P> <P> Northeast Region: Binghamton and Utica, N.Y.; Red Bank and Summit, N.J.;  Portsmouth, N.H.; Burlington, Vt., and Bangor, Me.  </P></p>

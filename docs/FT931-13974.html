			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Eurotherm second half boost PROFITS at Eurotherm, the temperature control and drives company, more than doubled last year helped by cost cutting and improved margins. Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 7.15m to Pounds 14.6m in the year to October 31 last. At the interim stage, profits were 46 per cent ahead at Pounds 6.7m. Mr Jack Leonard, chairman, said it was a 'year of reconstruction' after the company misjudged the depth of recession and had to attack its cost base. Rationalisation costs of Pounds 2.4m were taken in the previous year, with a further Pounds 500,000 charged as an administrative expense this time. In the last two years employees have fallen by nearly one-third to just over 2,000. Turnover fell from Pounds 157.7m to Pounds 154.6m following the disposal half way through the year of two unprofitable subsidiaries which had annual sales of about Pounds 8m. Mr Leonard said Eurotherm's maintained levels of sales in shrinking international markets suggested the company had improved market share. Eurotherm continued to generate cash, despite an increase in capital expenditure from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 6.3m. Net borrowings fell from Pounds 15.6m to Pounds 7.4m while gearing dropped from 30 per cent to 12.9 per cent. Earnings increased from 10.6p to 22.3p. The directors proposed a final dividend of 5p (4.7p) to make a total of 8p (7.2p), an increase of 11 per cent. COMMENT These results were well received, even through the scale of recovery is flattered by comparison with a poor 1991. With the benefits of restructuring largely on board, Eurotherm appears close to recovering historical levels of profitability. Gross margins have improved by 3 percentage points to 48 per cent, and should rise beyond 50 per cent in the medium term. Meanwhile, this year's profits are partly underwritten by currency factors since, with 70 per cent of sales overseas, average sterling exchange rates are likely to be beneficial. However, all this good news is already in the price, especially after yesterday's 24p rise to 495p. The shares have now risen more than 20 per cent since the start of December. Forecast profits this year of Pounds 18m put them on a prospective p/e of more than 18. Amid a sector long on recovery plays, Eurotherm is starting to look expensive.</p>

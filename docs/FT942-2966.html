			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / R&amp;D spending in UK rises faster than competitors UK companies' spending on research and development is growing faster than that of their main international competitors and, for the first time in at least four years, faster than dividend payments to shareholders. UK R&amp;D spending rose 9 per cent to Pounds 7.1bn, according to the Department of Trade and Industry's R&amp;D scoreboard, published today. However, it also shows that the UK has a long way to go before it catches other countries in terms of R&amp;D spending as a proportion of sales, profits or dividends. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said the figures were 'very encouraging' although 'there is still some way to go to catch up with the world's best standards'. The scorecard measures R&amp;D spending anywhere in the world by companies based in the UK. The international top 200 companies devoted an average 4.85 per cent of 1993 sales to R&amp;D, compared with 2.29 per cent for the 13 British companies in the group. But the rise in the total R&amp;D spend last year of the top 200 international companies was just 2 per cent, less than one quarter of the increase of the top 100 in the UK. General Motors of the US was the world's biggest R&amp;D spender with a budget of more than Dollars 4bn. (Pounds 2.60bn) It is followed by German engineering group Daimler-Benz, Ford Motor of the US and Japan's Hitachi. Those three nations dominate the world's top 20, which contains just one representative each from France and the Netherlands, as well as the Swiss-Swedish Asea Brown Boveri. The biggest UK spender, drug company Glaxo, is ranked 42nd. However, the UK's pharmaceuticals industry stands out as central to the country's R&amp;D effort. Four of the top six UK spenders on R&amp;D are drugs companies - Glaxo, SmithKline Beecham, Zeneca and Wellcome. The pharmaceutical sector carries out 31.8 per cent of all industrial R&amp;D in Britain. Among the top 200 international companies, the sector accounts for only 8.8 per cent of all R&amp;D spending. The UK performance in other areas is mixed. Engineering companies spent 10 per cent more than in 1992, led by Rolls-Royce and British Aerospace. But electronic and electrical companies' spending on R&amp;D fell by 1 per cent. Cuts by the sector's two biggest companies, GEC (down 5 per cent) and Racal (down 8 per cent), outweighed increases elsewhere. And spending by oil companies fell by 5 per cent. BP cut its budget by one quarter. Mr Heseltine refused to criticise particular companies for spending too little. 'I would not seek to put my judgment as a politician into the minds of individual boards of directors.' Spending up as drugs dominate Page 14 Making a killing through contracts Page 15</p>

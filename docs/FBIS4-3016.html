			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 15 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Serb leader  Radovan Karadzic and UN special envoy in former Yugoslavia  Yasushi Akashi today held talks on hastening the peace process  in Bosnia, the first since NATO air strikes against Serb  positions.    Akashi, the UN secretary-general's special envoy and  director  of civil affairs of the peacekeeping forces in former  Yugoslavia, told reporters that they discussed how to push the  peace process in Bosnia and that the talks were "fruitful".    Although "regrettable", the UN peacekeeping forces' demand  for NATO air strikes against Serb positions was "necessary," as  the safety of UN military observers and residents in the Muslim  enclave of Gorazde was being threatened, he said.    He restated that the UN peacekeeping forces would strictly  remain neutral and not be partial to any side.    After NATO air strikes against the Bosnian Serb positions  near the UN-designated "safe area" of Gorazde on April 10 and  11, the Serbs suspended all contacts with the UN peacekeeping  forces, especially the commander of the UN forces in Bosnia  Michael Rose, who ordered the air strikes.    As a result, the relations between the Serbs and the UN  forces have reached an impasse.    The Serbs accused the United Nations of siding with the  Muslims and being directly involved in the Bosnian civil war.    During his talks with Akashi, Karadzic said that the UN  peacekeeping forces had not made Gorazde a de-militarized zone  in accordance with an agreement in 1993.    He said that the Muslims owned powerful military forces in  Gorazde and constantly launched attacks on the Serb positions.    He also said that it was necessary for the Serbs to keep  political contacts with the UN civil leaders as they could not  cooperate with the military leaders of the UN peacekeeping  forces for a certain period of time.    Karadzic described today's meeting, approved by the supreme  headquarters of the Serb forces, as "a good thing."    The supreme headquarters of the Serb forces met this  afternoon on the military and political situation in Bosnia  after the NATO air strikes.    The Serb military leaders said that conditions for  normalizing their ties with the UN forces' military leaders were  not ripe at present, but agreed that the Serb leader could keep  contacts with the UN forces' civil leaders when necessary.    Russian special envoy Vitaliy Churkin and co-chairmen of the  international conference on former Yugoslavia David Owen and  Thorvald Stoltenburg have been working to bring the Serbs back  to the negotiating table.    As a result of the efforts by the three mediators, Bosnian  Serbs had made some compromise to ease the rising tension in the  area.    Stoltenburg termed the talks between Karadzic and Akashi,  which were held when relations between Serbs and the UN  peacekeeping forces worsened, as "very important."    Churkin said that make some progress was made at the talks  in  solving the Bosnia conflict.</p>

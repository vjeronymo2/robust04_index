			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Arts: Imperial threads - Radio STARTING this week, the World Service is to run, over the next two months, a Spotlight on South Asia, about the Indian sub-continent and its neighbours. In four programmes on successive Mondays, John Renner will examine affairs in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. This week's, Division and Identity, begins with a recording of Nehru's promise that the Indians will 'redeem our pledge' - a promise at once torpedoed by the Hindu-Moslem division that gave birth to Pakistan, and subsequently Bangladesh. Situations in these three nations are sharply scrutinised, with telling interventions from local voices. Next week Renner will consider social matters, and the week after, the 'huddled masses' in the regions of great poverty, with a view of the causes and the conceivable cures. There will be features and plays from the same countries too, including  - on St. Valentine's Day] - a Sanskrit tragi-comedy, Hayavadana, where rivals for the same woman each cut their own heads off. The goddess Kali puts them back, but unhappily she gets the heads on the wrong shoulders . . . The Imperial thread was tugged again on Friday in Radio 3's A Future for Their Past. Christopher Hope, a native South African, presented other South African writers, black and white, on the future of South African writing after the end of apartheid. What shall we have to write about seemed to be the principal question, and the main answer was the past. Lately, stories of repression and resistance, said JM Coetzee, had seemed more important than inventive fiction. Free from censorship, the South Africans had to learn about themselves - especially the blacks, whose history was mainly recalled from their conflicts with the invaders. Next week Radio 3 will give five South African Snapshots, to include work by some of the contributors to this programme. Radio 3's Sunday play this week was a subtle piece by David Pownall, Dreams and Censorship, that contrived to include in its dramatis personae St. John the Divine, King James I and William Shakespeare. The King (Hugh Ross) is anxious that the new English Bible shall not include the Book of Revelation lest it encourage revolt. Shakespeare (Edward Petherbridge), whom the King calls Willy, is directing a company in the events that took place on Patmos, where St. John (Robert Stephens) has retired, and where the Romans are to crucify two vestal virgins, one of them played by randy young Prince Charles (Gary King). The arguments that connect these events are as entertaining as they are interesting, even if sometimes as historically dodgy as (say) Henry V; they lead properly to the inclusion of Revelation in the King James Bible that we know. The playing throughout is first-class under Eoin O'Callaghan's direction. Good Wives (Radio 4 FM, Thursday) is the sequel to Alcott's Little Women, which has been dramatised in six parts by Marcie Kahan. We begin with Meg's wedding to John Brooke, and go on to Amy's disappointing day out with the young ladies of her drawing class, that only one of the invited dozen attends. If you enjoyed Little Women you will enjoy this, for the girls seem hardly to have grown up at all. Marilyn Imrie directs, and Marmee is no less than Gayle Hunnicutt. The Saturday play on Radio 4 was David Halliwell's Crossed Lines, that began with a chap being offered Pounds 88,000 by a strange woman on the telephone, and went on as improbably for 90 minutes. The lucky guy was Ian Hogg and the director Philip Martin. Richard Imison, one of the best influences on radio drama, died from cancer last week. He had been the BBC's script editor for almost 30 years, later its deputy director of drama.</p>

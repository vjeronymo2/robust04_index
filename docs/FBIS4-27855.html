			<p>BFN     [Text] The Japanese Government has worked out concrete  steps to be taken as means of sanctions against North Korea, and  decided to actively cooperate with the United States even if it  independently takes steps for sanctions in the event the UN  Security Council fails to adopt a resolution on sanctions  against North Korea.    Correspondent Yi Il-hwa reports from Tokyo:    [Begin Yi recording] The Japanese Government decided on  steps  it could take if sanctions are imposed on North Korea regarding  the nuclear problem.    The steps for sanctions worked out by the Japanese  Government  essentially include 10 points. These points include  restrictions on the exchange of people, such as banning  diplomats' contacts, and restriction on money and materials.    The restrictions on the exchange of people stipulate that  Japanese diplomats would be prohibited from contacting North  Korean diplomats in a third country, the visit of Japanese  Government officials to North Korea would be in principle  banned, and government officials would not be permitted to use a  special airplane flying between Tokyo and North Korea.    The restrictions on money and materials stipulate the  banning  of intermediate export-import trade, suspension of transactions  in capitals, including investment and loans, and the  discontinuation of remittance of money to North Korea through  the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan  [Chongnyon], a demand of the United States.    These restrictions also contain the banning of exchanges of  culture, art, and science, including music, sports, and  technology.    In addition to these steps finalized by the Japanese  Government, Japan decided to actively cooperate the United  States in collaboration with the ROK, even if the United States  independently takes steps on sanctions in the event the UN  Security Council fails to adopt a resolution.    In the event that U.S. forces launch naval blockade  activities, Japan will see to it that the Japanese Self-Defense  Forces can participate in the logistic support, including the  supply of materials and fuel.

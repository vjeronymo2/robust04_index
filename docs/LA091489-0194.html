			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MURDER SUSPECT BEATEN BY INMATES  </P> <P> One of two brothers charged with ordering the murders of their elderly parents  in Brentwood has been beaten in jail in an attack his lawyer says may have been  ordered by someone who feared the man's future testimony.  </P> <P> Stewart Woodman, 39, was punched and kicked by two fellow inmates who called  him a "rat" -- a jailhouse term for one who testifies against another  defendant, according to Woodman's attorney, Jay Jaffe.  </P> <P> Stewart Woodman, his 45-year-old brother, Neil, and three alleged hit men have  been charged in the 1985 slayings of Gerald Woodman, 67, and Vera Woodman, 63,  who were shot to death after returning to their Brentwood home from dinner.  </P> <P> Jaffe has proclaimed Stewart Woodman's innocence in the case. Jaffe said the  person who ordered the attack may have implied from his remarks that Stewart  Woodman was going to testify against him.  </P> <P> Prosecutors say they are not certain who was behind the Aug. 24 attack on  Stewart Woodman.  </P> <P> Meanwhile Wednesday, Los Angeles Municipal Judge David Horowitz ruled that one  of the alleged triggerman in the murders, former Los Angeles policeman Steven  Homick, 49, had been legally extradited in the case from Nevada's Death Row,  where he was awaiting execution after conviction in an unrelated triple murder.  </P></p>

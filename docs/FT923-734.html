			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Godfather's dishonour: Japan's latest political scandal For the past month, the Japanese people have been treated to the unfolding drama of The Strange Case of Shin Kanemaru. The country's most powerful politician has publicly admitted that he violated a funding law, ignored prosecutors' requests to come in for questioning, and finally dispatched a written confession, confident that he could resume his political career. Mr Kanemaru's case is indeed bizarre, but it highlights many aspects of Japanese political life that are in need of reform. Fellow members of the ruling Liberal Democratic party seem to think that the godfather, as Mr Kanemaru is known, has done no wrong - one of his faction members even suggested that he had been 'manly and honourable'. The Japanese public, however, appears disgusted by the affair, which reached a climax yesterday when Mr Kanemaru formally admitted his guilt in a statement to the prosecutors. The statement was prepared in the comfort of his own home, and it remains unclear when he will finally emerge to answer, in his Marlon Brando-like mumble, questions from the several dozen journalists camped outside his front door. One reason for the public's anger is the meagre fine that Mr Kanemaru will receive for having accepted Y500m (Pounds 2.4m) in political donations from a scandal-tainted parcel delivery company called Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin. Under Japanese law, Mr Kanemaru should receive no more than Y1.5m annually from one company, and the maximum penalty for exceeding that amount is only Y200,000. This figure, as the ordinary Japanese well know, is exactly the same amount as the congested country's most serious parking fine, imposed for leaving a car overnight in a no-parking area. And it is clear to all - except, it seems, to LDP members - that Mr Kanemaru has done more than leave his car in a loading zone. Before submitting his confession, Mr Kanemaru apparently received an assurance from the prosecutors that his case would be dealt with summarily, meaning that he would neither have to face the ignominy of a court appearance nor even have to appear in the prosecutors' office. He will simply be sent the political equivalent of a parking ticket. At the same time, two former executives of the parcel delivery company are on trial for breach of corporate trust, and a provincial governor who has just resigned faces a public hearing for having received Y100m in political donations. It is no wonder that a television commentator reached for his copy of Japan's constitution, and read aloud, with appropriate irony, the section that states 'all are equal before the law'. Will this gnashing of teeth on television make any difference to a political system that produces a scandal a year and a powerless prime minister every two years? In the past, prime ministers and ministers have resigned in disgrace but have retained control over their factions. Mr Kanemaru is likely to return. The son of a sake brewer, he holds no official title but claims to have selected the present prime minister, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, and to have been grooming the successors. It must be noted that Mr Miyazawa has offered no comment on The Strange Case. The prime minister's consistent weakness in the face of more influential faction heads has disappointed most Japanese, who had perceived him as intelligent and thoughtful, and perhaps able to push the political system towards badly needed reform. On taking office late last year, Mr Miyazawa promised that his first priority was to end the system of 'money politics', by redrawing electoral boundaries and by making the life of a politician less expensive. But nothing has changed, and it is not in the interests of faction heads such as Mr Miyazawa and Mr Kanemaru to alter things in a way that would undermine their own prestige as patrons and 'godfathers'. Meanwhile, Mr Kanemaru's fate has distracted the government from important international business. Mr Ichiro Ozawa, widely accepted as a likely prime minister, cancelled a trip to the US and Europe because of his duties as a 'loyal lieutenant' to the godfather. Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister, in New York this week for a United Nations meeting, has been concerned by events in Tokyo and by the desire to ensure that his turn at the top is not disrupted by the Tokyo Sagawa scandal. Japanese politics is vulnerable to such episodes simply because careers are founded, cultivated and crowned by cash. Mr Kanemaru's standing was not built on ideological leadership or oratorical skills, but on a remarkable ability to raise funds. These funds are distributed to other faction members, who are then in debt to the godfather and ready to do his bidding when the time comes to select a new prime minister or to shuffle cabinet posts around the party. If Mr Kanemaru's prestige is dented by this scandal, it will not be from the shame of getting caught, but through the reluctance of traditional corporate donors to do business with someone who has been publicly tarnished. At 78, he has talked of retiring. The events of the past month may speed that decision and create another diverting factional struggle. In the meantime, the strongest politician in a powerful country will remain at home, keeping fit by walking up and down stairs, amusing himself with mah-jong, the Chinese game of chance.</p>

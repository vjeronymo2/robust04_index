			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Istanbul -- The tripartite meeting of the foreign  ministers of Syria, Iran, and Turkey ended in Istanbul  yesterday. Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' responded to  reporters' questions at a joint news conference held at the end  of this meeting.    Asked for his assessment of the results of the tripartite  meeting and whether the three countries share common stands,  al-Shar' said: The Kurdish leaders, through our contacts with  them, have asserted that they do not seek to divide Iraq, but  they do want their situation to be taken into consideration.  They want a united, democratic Iraq in which the Iraqi people  decide Iraq's future. In fact, this is also Syria's position.  The foreign minister said that the Iraqi regime should comply  with the UN Security Council resolutions and cooperate with the  United Nations.    Answering a question on Syria's stand regarding the acts of  terrorism against Turkey and on the difference between such acts  and Palestinian resistance of Israeli occupation, al-Shar' said:  Syria does not support any kind of terrorism. Turkish  officials know full well that Syria does not render any support  to the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] and that Syria is very  concerned about the unity, safety, and security of friendly  Turkey. Al-Shar' added: Since we are talking about our concern  for Iraq's security and territorial integrity, it is obvious  that we stand against any element that threatens the security  and territorial integrity of any of our three countries. He  said: There are many allegations that Syria supports terrorism,  whether with regard to the PKK or other terrorist acts. I can  explain why such accusations are leveled against Syria. Such  accusations are leveled against Syria because it differentiates  between the terrorist act, which it considers a crime against  law and justice and which must be denounced, and the struggle of  people under the yoke of foreign occupation. In light of this,  the intifadah in the occupied Arab territory cannot be  considered terrorism. Also, Lebanese resistance in southern  Lebanon against the Israeli military occupation cannot be  considered terrorism. Such a Syrian stand is in harmony with the  international law and the UN Charter and resolutions.  Regrettably, some newspapers do not differentiate between these  two things. They mislead and distort public opinion either  intentionally or unintentionally. It is time to stop such  deceptive media campaigns in Turkey in particular and in the  West in general.    Asked whether Syria is concerned about the amount of water  Turkey allows to flow into Syria, Faruq al-Shar' said: Yes, we  are concerned about this issue, because it is a vital issue.  What really concerns us is not the quantity of water flowing  into Syria and Iraq, but the failure to reach a firm agreement  on water-sharing between Turkey, Syria, and Iraq. Al-Shar'  added: It is true that the Turkish Government abides by a  protocol that was signed in 1987. An agreement was reached  during Demirel's visit to Damascus at the beginning of last  year, to the effect that the foreign ministers of both countries  will reach a final agreement on water-sharing before the end of  1993. This, however, did not happen.    Al-Shar' asserted that the sharing of international river  waters is very important to any country facing such a problem.  What Syria wants is a very legitimate demand which is in  harmony with international laws and norms. Furthermore, this  helps achieve stability and cooperation in the region.  Meanwhile, the failure to reach an agreement will remain a  cause of continuous tension. He said that Syria does not demand  private privileges, but demands what is granted by international  law and norms regarding the distribution of water among Turkey,  Syria, and Iraq. Al-Shar' noted that he held talks on this  issue with Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and Turkish  Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and described these talks as  serious. He added that this issue will be followed up so as to  reach an agreement on water sharing in accordance with the  international law and norms.    Answering another question on Syria's differentiation  between  resistance against occupation and terrorism, al-Shar' said:  There is a difference between what is taking place in Palestine  and southern Turkey. He added: Turkey is an independent  sovereign state. We are committed to Turkey's unity,  independence, and security. We do not support any action that  would undermine Turkey's future and territorial integrity. The  Turkish people are the ones who decide their country's future.    Al-Shar' added: The Palestine question is completely  different. The Palestinian people were not only exposed to  coercion at the hands of the Israeli occupation forces, but  their lands and rights were also usurped. Furthermore, settlers  came from outside the region to replace them. Therefore, there  is a big difference between the two issues. The United Nations  is fully aware of this and it issued resolutions demanding  Israel's withdrawal from all occupied Arab territory. These  resolutions constitute the basis of the ongoing peace talks in  Washington, which we hope will achieve the expected objectives.</p>

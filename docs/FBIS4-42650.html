			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Vittorio Feltri: "Searching for the Left"] </F>   [Text] I do not know about you, dear readers, but I find  this never-ending controversy over the fascists in the  government, on their presumed return to the scene, on the danger  that the black boots will trample upon the values of democracy  and even human rights, a mediocre soap opera that one would do  well not to contribute to, not even in a "guest appearance."  However, it offers an opportunity to delve into another topic,  that we could say is a parallel one. Why is the Left obliged to  clutch to worn-out and frayed pretexts such as the rebirth of  fascism in Italy to demonstrate its vitality, or rather, its  very existence? Is it because every time a person of some  importance emerges, such as [Northern League Secretary] Bossi or  a [Prime Minister] Berlusconi, it feels the need to bring back  to mind that balcony on Piazza Venezia where the "square  jawbone" [Mussolini] exhibited himself? Do these seem to be the  proper reasons for blocking the rise of new political forces?    For half a century now the Left has dug up the corpse of  Mussolini and thrown it in our faces when it finds itself in  difficulty. Those who have a good memory will not have  forgotten what the Christian Democrats were called in the  1920's: "clerical fascists." Nor will they have forgotten the  slogans of 1968 against anybody who did not support 1968:  "fascist, bourgeois, only a few months more." Slogans from  which one deduced that, in the language used by the barbarians  of the era, fascist and bourgeois were synonymous.    The decades have passed, walls have fallen, religious  ideologies have faded, empires that seemed unassailable behind  iron curtains have dissolved, but our left-wing parties, even  those that have given themselves a new coat of paint, continue  to act in the same way, almost as if time has stopped in the era  of Giolitti. Fossil-like parties, conservatives wearing the  label of progressives illicitly, stiffened with an anti-fascist  manner that prevents them from seeing no other enemy except the  duce [Mussolini] and his grandchildren. And the fact that the  duce's grandchildren do not count at all, do not have a role in  the government, does not matter to the Left. It undauntedly  continues to see in all of them the adversaries, and to waste  energy in fighting them, energy that could be much better used  for its reconstruction in order to finally become a valid,  reliable, and modern alternative to the hated Right. A Right  that may even be a shuffler -- as [LA VOCE editor] Indro  Montanelli maintains one day yes and the other day also yes --  it may be a hotchpotch, it may be a Brancaleone army, it may  even have a naive and extemporaneous leader, however, whatever  it may be, it has found room for growth in a few months. It has  found this room because it has looked for it, it has had the  courage to challenge even the ridiculous, it has resorted to  flamboyant gestures: repeated opinion polls, marketing, mass  communications, few concepts but clear ones, no concession being  made to abstract ideas, the utmost attention being placed on the  daily problems that afflict the people, a low profile but an  extremely high regard for the voter, no disdain for things that  are popular.    Yes, popular. An adjective that horrifies the Left instead.  And it would be sufficient to analyze this horror to understand  where the would-be progressives failed. They do not like the  people because they make the air unbreathable in the subways,  because they watch Wheel of Fortune on television, live in  dejected and opaque apartment buildings in the suburbs, or --  those that are the more fortunate live in townhouses with  statues of dwarves in their gardens -- go to Rimini instead of  Capalbio, read little and the little that they do read is from  IL MANIFESTO, love the consumer world because it is better than  famine. The progressives do not like the people because they  vote, and vote for the League, Forza Italia, and National  Alliance. Excuse me, but why should they vote for somebody that  they do not respect.    The real problem of this country is not the presence of a  disjointed right-wing majority, but the absence of a Left that  is not repressive, reactionary, conceited, antiquated, a snob,  closed from the western world, in love with bureaucracy,  utopias, beautiful laws (like Law No. 180 for the mentally ill)  that cannot be applied and have not been applied, of public  schools and all the public services that the progressives do not  use. Yes, the danger is precisely this, an anachronistic,  archaic Left, that has remained with Luciano Lama and his  orchestra in the square, nostalgic of Marxist dogmas, unable to  free itself of the old communist attire and give itself a  modern, European, free trade, and social identity. Of course  Occhetto did try to renew things. He did renew things. However,  he did not go right through to the end, nor could he, with his  past and his background. The Left needs more in order to avoid  being confused over what it was, a daughter of the Soviet Union.  It will take one generation, or rather two. Provided these are  enough. But as long as we do not have a Left made of men of the  Left, and have instead false intellectual snobs, or masked PPI  [Italian Popular Party] men, the Right will have no rivals.</p>

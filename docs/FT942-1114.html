			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Markets: Steel's surge makes City beam - The Bottom Line A sign over the door of the Plaisterers Hall in the City of London, where British Steel announces its results twice a year, reads: 'Let brotherly love prevail.' 'Abandon hope all ye who enter here' might have been more appropriate until recently. Not on Monday, though. After cumulative pre-tax losses of Pounds 204m in the previous two years, the company announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 80m for the year ended April 2. That in itself was no surprise, falling more or less in the middle of the Pounds 60m to Pounds 95m range expected by the City. But the company caught analysts on the hop by raising its final dividend from 1p a share to 1.5p, making a total payout for the year of 2p, compared with 1p for 1992/93. It was just what the City needed on a day when words like 'meltdown' or even that hardy perennial, 'billions wiped off shares', were in the air. A 5 3/4 p rise in British Steel's shares to 139p was one of the few bright spots among the predominantly red numbers on the dealing screens. The shares have since slipped to close at 131p yesterday in a falling market. Even so, they have recovered healthily from the depths of autumn 1992 when a price of 46.5p made dismal reading for investors who had paid 125p in the 1988 privatisation. The recovery began when investors realised that the shares represented good value at that price compared with other steel companies, and also as an industrial recovery stock. US investors saw a discount in the share price to the book value, and bought heavily. In spite of the enthusiastic reception for the latest results, though, it is hard to make a case for the shares to go much higher - even though some were recommending them as a 'buy' at 150p. The 1994 peak is 156 1/2 p. Admittedly, pre-tax profits are likely to be much higher this year. Edward Hadas, analyst at Swiss Bank Corporation, has raised his forecast from Pounds 265m to Pounds 290m and says British Steel could make Pounds 430m in fiscal 1996. The dividend for the present year could be 3p a share or even 4p, and 5.5p for the following year. Achieving that big rise in profits will be down mostly to getting better prices rather than increasing volumes. Hadas believes British Steel's average prices could rise by 5 per cent this year. With an improved sales mix, that would be enough to achieve the predicted rise. He points out that, in the second half of fiscal 1994, the company's operating profits were already running at two-thirds of the required rate, excluding the Pounds 24m provision for the fine imposed by the European Commission for the company's part in an alleged steel beams cartel. For its part, British Steel says it has a reasonably good order book and demand in the UK is rising steadily, although the construction market is lagging behind the automotive sector. Importantly, the downturn in the continental European market appears to have halted. But all these developments seem to be reflected already in the share price and Hadas says that, on a prospective price/earnings ratio of about 8 for fiscal 1996, the present price is 'pretty fair'. Most analysts now view British Steel as a 'hold' and there are few 'buy' recommendations. Perhaps the time to do that has passed long since. Looking beyond the immediate outlook in the steel market, there are both good and bad signs for investors. On the debit side, it is probably wise not to expect much from the European Union's heavily-criticised rescue plan for the steel industry. Capacity cuts will not in themselves bring financial salvation to the industry and pledges, in any case, have yet to be implemented. More positively, the possibility of a Dollars 150m investment in a steel plate mini-mill in the US will be an important step for British Steel and show that it is ready and able to look beyond Europe to exploit opportunities elsewhere. It remains, too, Europe's low-cost producer par excellence.</p>

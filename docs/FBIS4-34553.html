			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 13 Jun (EFE) -- On 13 June,  Chilean President Eduardo Frei said he had come to the Fourth  Ibero-American Summit to "reassert Chile's Latin American  spirit," a basic issue in its foreign policy.    Frei recalled that during his presidential electoral  campaign, he stated that Latin America would be the main issue  in his foreign policy with prospects for political and economic  integration. He added that he has continued to uphold and put  this into practice since he came to power on 11 March.    Frei told EFE: "It is true that Chile is a country open to  the world, that it is going to join the South Pacific Economic  Cooperation Conference (APEC), and that the EU is our main  commercial partner, but, regardless of this, Chile has a Latin  American spirit and we have come to reassert this."    Frei added that sound evidence of this are the recent  proposals for a partnership with the Common Market of the South  (Mercosur) and the proposals Chile made during the recent OAS  General Assembly in Brazil.    Upon joining the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, which will  last two days in Cartagena de Indias, he said Chile will  participate with the hope -- "and will make every effort  possible in this direction" -- that it will mark the starting  point, "in practice rather than in theory," of a real  integration of the hemisphere.    The summit "must be the forum that will ensure Latin  America's transformation into a true community of nations in  which support for democracy, human rights, the struggle to  overcome poverty, and economic integration prevail."    In Frei's opinion, the main thing to attaining these goals  is  commercial opening through negotiated agreements "with a spirit  of open regionalism" that will cast aside protectionism and  grant the continent access to the major markets, "free of  exclusions and closed blocs."    The Chilean chief of state stressed: "This is what we have  come to propose at this Fourth Ibero-American Summit, and we  will do so with determination and an American spirit."    Upon his arrival in Cartagena de Indias, Frei offered  Chile's  cooperation in rebuilding the towns of Caucas and Huilas, which  were devastated last week by the landslide caused by a tremor.  Frei reconfirmed this offer to EFE.    Chile has already shipped 200 metric tons of aid for the  tragedy's victims, but Frei said: "We have talked to the  Colombian authorities about cooperating in the most difficult  aspects, that is, to rebuild the towns." Frei added:  "Unfortunately, Chile has great experience in natural disasters  and will place this experience at the service of our Colombian  brothers."    Shortly after his arrival, the Chilean president held a  bilateral meeting with King Juan Carlos of Spain, whom he  invited to visit Chile again, specifically the Antarctic, which  is one of the king's "great desires."    The respective foreign ministries will immediately start  working on the initiative to set a date, according to Frei, who  said he had asked for an audience with the king "for the  affection and support he always has granted Chile."    Eduardo Frei is scheduled to hold two more bilateral  meetings  in Cartagena de Indias: one with Bolivian President Gonzalo  Sanchez de Lozada on 15 June and one with Cuban President Fidel  Castro on 16 June.    Frei said the two meetings will have an open agenda to  assess  the state of bilateral relations and cooperation prospects, but  dismissed the possibilities that an agreement to resume  diplomatic relations will be reached during either of the two  meetings.</p>

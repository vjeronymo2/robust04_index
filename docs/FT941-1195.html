			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / US turns its back on Somali troubles US troops completed their withdrawal from Somalia yesterday, leaving an emasculated UN force in charge of a country blighted by cholera, hunger and banditry. Virtually all that remains of Operation Restore Hope, launched 15 months ago and aimed at feeding starving Somalis, is an orphanage in north Mogadishu which bears its name. 'We are pleased with what we have done,' said Gen Thomas Montgomery, the US force commander, shortly before boarding a helicopter that would take him to a flotilla of warships waiting offshore. 'We know there are hundreds of thousands of Somalis alive because of what we did.' Ironically, the marine officer organising the departure was Colonel Matthew Broderick, whose company was the last to evacuate the US embassy in Saigon towards the end of the Vietnam war in 1975. 'This is an orderly withdrawal ordered by the State Department. Saigon was anything but an orderly withdrawal,' he said. US officials have been recalling the humanitarian success of the early days in Somalia, when US foreign policy had been elevated to philanthropy, to justify their disengagement from a troublesome country where no strategic interests are at stake. A veil has been drawn over the failure of the US-led multinational peacekeeping force to disarm Somalia's warring clans. The remaining UN peacekeepers, from African, Arab and Asian countries, have a limited mandate to protect food convoys and guard key installations, such as the port, airport and the heavily-fortified UN compound in Mogadishu. But the UN soldiers have not intervened to halt the growing number of skirmishes around these installations and looting is increasing.</p>

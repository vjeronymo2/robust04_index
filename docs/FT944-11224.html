			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (14): Moving into sharper focus - Conglomerate profile, Citic As China International Trust and Investment Corporation, (Citic), approaches its 15th anniversary, it has decided the time has come to get back to basics, writes Simon Holberton. 'We are trying to narrow the spectrum of our investments,' says Mr Wei Mingyi, Citic's chairman. 'We have a guideline for our subsidiaries - never open a restaurant again.' That is a reference is to a prohibition on unrelated investments, no matter how attractive they may appear to be. For Citic the management theme now is 'focus' and the agenda is crowded with large developments on the China mainland, including port development, power generation, real estate and telecommunications. In addition to sharpening its focus, Citic's Beijing management is also tightening controls, especially those applying to investment - 'we have more than 30 subsidiaries and we can't control each and everyone,' says Mr Wei. 'But we can control each project. When any of (the subsidiaries) want to invest more than Yn3m they have to be referred to Beijing. We co-ordinate all the large projects.' Taking pride of place among these developments is the transformation of Daxie Island, situated to the south of Ningbo port and offering access to China's industrial heartland in the Yangtze river delta. Citic plans to invest Dollars 500m seed capital in the project. China's premier conglomerate is looking, however, for Dollars 3bn to Dollars 6bn from foreign investors to turn the dream of a 31 sq km industrial park, supporting a container port the size of that in Hong Kong, into a reality. Citic recently entered into a joint venture with Bechtel, the US construction company, to provide marketing, operations and services for the island development. This month, Mr Wei expects a floating bridge connecting Daxie with the mainland to be finished - 'we will also begin construction of a temporary dock - with the capacity to handle 20,000 tonnes vessels - so that transport of equipment and cargo can be handled much more easily,' he says. Already, overseas businessmen from Singapore and Hong Kong have indicated a willingness to invest in the island. In August, a large mission from Japan, consisting of banking and industrial executives, visited the island. Mr Wei says Citic has signed its first business contract with an industrial company in the chemicals industry. Telecommunications is also a sector where Citic sees growth. AsiaSat 2, a telecommunications and entertainment satellite, is due for launch in 1995. Citic has a third of the project. 'We are trying to get Chinese television networks to make use of the satellite,' he says. He hopes that Central TV, the main government-owned national broadcaster, will rent a transponder. AsiaSat 2 will employ 'Ku band' transponders which are more powerful than the previous generation of transmitters. This means that households need only own a small receiving dish - which Citic has the capacity to manufacture in Beijing, Xian, and elsewhere. 'There are so many isolated and mountainous regions in China,' he explains. 'The peasants have the money (to buy a dish); the economy in many rural areas is catching up. They need a communication channel that is clear and stable.' Citic may have been mainland China's first experiment with capitalism but its pursuit of profit has been tempered recently by the government's request that it take over and manage two ailing state companies - a civilian truck and auto parts complex in Shaanxi, and a heavy machinery manufacturer in Luoyang. The re-organisation of the Shaanxi factories - 10 in all - is still not complete. Citic has pumped about Yn50m into the complex over the past four years; seven factories have returned to health - 'the other three need money,' says Mr Wei. 'But Citic is not going to put any more money in, the other seven can.' Although he is not best pleased with the Shaanxi complex, he recognises that there was a social need for Citic to help. 'They have more than 10,000 workers and their families, so 40-50,000 depend on the factory,' he says. The rehabilitation of most of the Shaanxi factories has enabled the creation of Citic Automobile, a subsidiary which brings together Citic auto assets under one umbrella. The requirements of the Luoyang acquisition were managerial not monetary. The factory, now known as Citic Heavy Machinery Company, is China's biggest producer of heavy cranes, diggers, and dock loading equipment. The factory was basically profitable, but the plant was under-utilised and the company focused too much on domestic sales to the exclusion of export possibilities. 'The company was owned previously by the mining industry, but it did not order very much equipment,' he says. 'It was a big factory with a small sales staff and no one to look after the overseas market. We have helped them to export.' Still, one gets the impression that Mr Wei does not see Citic's involvement in 'pastoral care' for ailing state industries as central to the conglomerate's mission. In answer to another question about finance for state companies, he says: 'We do lend to state enterprise - carefully, very carefully.'</p>

			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BALDWIN PARK POLICE SEEK PUBLIC SUPPORT OVER PACT  </P> <P> The Baldwin Park Police Assn. will ask for community support in its effort to  reach a contract agreement with the city, the association's attorney said.  </P> <P> "The city proposed a 7.5% raise in the first year of a two-year contract, but  only if we give up overtime benefits, which every other department has," said  attorney Stephen Silver. "That's the major obstacle to reaching an agreement."  The city has offered a 5% raise the second year.  </P> <P> Mayor Leo King and Acting City Manager Michael Yelton could not be reached last  week for comment.  </P> <P> Members of the 70-member union, which includes sergeants and officers,  dispatchers and records clerks, have been working without a contract since June  30, when their two-year contract expired.  </P> <P> Silver said the union proposed that the two sides use mediators or arbitrators  but that was rejected by the city.  </P> <P> Although union members would like community support, Silver didn't rule out a  strike. "That's a possibility," he said. "We have no plans to do it at this  time. We hope it doesn't come to that."  </P></p>

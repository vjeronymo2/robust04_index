All of the saboteurs were  taken prisoner.    It says the attack followed a 30-minute mortar fire on  Abkhazian positions close to the village of Tagiloni. There  were casualties among Georgian civilians.    The ministry says the Abkhazian army has continued  operations  to wipe out Georgian sabotage groups infiltrating the Gal region.</p>

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / A framework, but no fine print: The gloom over Yugoslavia has lifted slightly There was a widespread feeling among participants and observers that this week's London conference on the former Yugoslavia would not achieve much. The negotiations opened against a background of increased fighting in the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo. Refugees continued to pour out of Bosnia, and Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic - the main protagonist in the conflict - threatened to boycott the conference jointly organised by the United Nations and the European Community. There were misgivings about whether the UN and the EC could persuade all sides to agree a framework for negotiating a constitutional settlement for Bosnia, and deciding the status of the ethnic minorities in the former Yugoslav federation. After all, countless ceasefires and promises had been broken in the past. Yet after two days of intense negotiations, Mr John Major, the British prime minister, acting as President of the EC, and Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN's special envoy to Yugoslavia, produced agreement on four documents which, in the long term, provide a basis for bringing peace to the Balkans. This is an important achievement but, as Mr Major himself acknowledges, it is just a small step in the process towards a lasting settlement. The most important question is whether the aims stated in the documents can be implemented; and whether the fighting, which has already claimed the lives of at least 25,000 people, and has made more than 2m people homeless, will now end. To achieve this goal the UN and the EC have, through the documents, established a system of inter-locking mechanisms. For instance, the document on Bosnia states that the international community will not tolerate the division of Bosnia and that land seized, particularly by the Bosnian Serbs, led Mr Radovan Karadzic, will never be recognised. On its own this means little. But it will be backed up by initiatives outlined in the document on humanitarian issues. Over the next few days, the UN Security Council will amend its mandate so as to allow UN personnel to use force to protect towns and cities under siege in Bosnia. The UN forces will also be strengthened by armoured personnel carriers and about 6,000 extra troops. The conference received agreement from Mr Karadzic that he will open all detention camps, and allow detainees to return to their homes. Neither Mr Vance nor Mr Major doubt the enormity of this problem. Thousands of villages have been destroyed. To overcome some of these problems, the International Red Cross and the United Nations High Commission on Refugees will attempt to provide shelter for the homeless in the short term. But Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the acting US secretary of state, said Bosnia would require a large economic reconstruction and aid programme. 'We do not want these people to be living in camps for the next 20 years. They have a right to go back to their homes,' he said. But there is a big obstacle. How can people return while the fighting continues?. And how can the fighting stop while the Serb forces possess the heavy weapons and artillery which they have used to besiege the cities of Sarajevo, Gorazde, and Bihac? A third document called Confidence, Security Building and Verification, attempts to address this issue. It states that once these weapons have been located, they must be placed under international supervision within 96 hours. Yesterday, diplomats said that the timing of this process would be discussed at the Geneva talks, a follow-up to the London conference, which opens next Thursday. This document, however, is flawed. It does not take into account the unreliability of Mr Karadzic, or General Ratko Mladic, his military commander in Bosnia. Nor does it resolve the problem that the fighting in Bosnia is being waged by irregular, and often undisciplined units. 'I agree that we have to deal with all sorts of paramilitary groups' a UK official said. 'But we will introduce short-notice on-site inspection, and will do this until we have placed these weapons under international control.' The monitors will be backed by international observers who will be posted on Bosnia's borders with Serbia, Montenegro and Croatia and will attempt to stem the flow of weapons into Bosnia. Military use of aircraft or helicopters by the Serbs will be banned. Again, a degree of scepticism is warranted. Why should the international community believe that Mr Karadzic, Mr Milosevic, or Mr Milan Panic, the prime minister of the unrecognised Yugoslav state (of Serbia and Montenegro) will co-operate? The Serbs may rally behind Mr Milosevic and Mr Karadzic and defy the weight of international pressure. The west may therefore pin their hopes on Mr Panic. Mr Major stated the options in the form of a stark choice. 'You sign up, and eventually you will be welcomed back into the international community. If not, you face isolation.' Already, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general is recommending that the scope of the sanctions currently imposed on Serbia be increased. Monitors will be placed along Serbia's borders with Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria. 'We are serious this time,' said Mr Eagleburger. As a means of maintaining the momentum of the London Conference, six committees, co-chaired by Mr Vance and Lord Owen, a former British foreign secretary, will go into permanent session in Geneva. They will discuss the future constitutional status of Bosnia as well as the status of all the ethnic minorities in the region. The Geneva conference, as Mr Major warned, will be a long process. 'It will not be easy. It will not stop the fighting immediately.' Belatedly, a framework has been established, the first substantial achievement in bringing peace to the Balkans. The task now facing the diplomats is to dilute the fear, revenge and hatred which have scarred the people of Bosnia - but which finally galvanised the international community into action.</p>

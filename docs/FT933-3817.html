			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): LME throws out copper lifeline THE LONDON Metal Exchange threw out a lifeline this week to investors struggling against the tide of support buying that has distorted copper market prices throughout the summer. Taking the view that a lacklustre world economy and excessively high stocks of the metal pointed to a substantial slide in copper prices, these investors made forward sales of copper they did not have in the hope of being able to make covering purchases at lower prices before their short positions fell due for delivery. But they reckoned without the technical 'squeeze' that has propped up the market since mid-June. While LME warehouse stocks were climbing to a 15-year high tonnes, supplies available for immediate deliver dried up. This was reflected in the normal cash discount (the 'contango' in trade jargon), which reflects the costs of holding physical metal, being replaced by a premium (or 'backwardation'). The culprit, LME traders alleged, was the Japanese Sumitomo metals group, which they suggested might be preparing for a large-scale physical copper deal. Sumitomo, however, has denied manipulating the market. The LME first made known its uneasiness about the situation on July 14 when it warned that it was monitoring the copper market. Two weeks later it went a step further. Mr David King, the chief executive, strode on to the trading floor to remind members that exchange rules gave the board draconian powers to ensure that there was an orderly market. 'We wanted to make clear what powers we have and that we won't hesitate to use them,' he said later. But hesitate they did, much to the annoyance of many of the shorts. It was not until Wednesday of this week, by which time the cash/three months backwardation had grown from nil to Dollars 80, that the exchange decided to act. Mr King strode once more on to the floor to announce that the cash/one day backwardation would until further notice be limited to Dollars 5 a tonne. If shorts were unable to roll over due positions by 'borrowing' (simultaneously buying cash and selling forward) in the market at a premium of less than that level they could keep their positions open for another day by paying a Dollars 5-a-tonne fee to the exchange. Subsequently the cash/three months spread narrowed to Dollars 42 a tonne, still Dollars 2.25 higher than at the end of last week, but, more importantly, the September/October backwardation, which includes the most critical delivery dates, came in from Dollars 55 to Dollars 35 a tonne. Traders noted that trading in the copper options market market since Mr King's declaration had concentrated on calls (selling options) for the near months and puts (buying options) for January, indicating that traders expected relatively tight conditions to remain for most of this year but to ease in 1994. With the squeeze perceived to be on the way out the market has begun to reflect the fundamental supply/demand situation that led the speculators to go short in the first place. The three months position closed yesterday at Dollars 1,890.50 a tonne, down Dollars 64 on the week. In early trading yesterday it twice bounced of the Dollars 1,880 mark, a breach of which level, London broker GNI suggested in its daily Commodity Report, would 'indicate a sell-off to around Dollars 1,700'. 'There are bound to be some nervous moments in copper as tight September and October dates unwind, but I only see three months headed one way,' one LME trader told the Reuter news agency. LME aluminium values also lost ground, partly because of spill-over bearishness from copper. Traders said the contract's chart picture had broken down as selling pressure from US investment funds and commission houses triggered stop-loss selling orders. The three months price steadied by Dollars 3.75 yesterday to close at Dollars 1,140.50 a tonne, but that was still Dollars 21.75 down on the week. At the London bullion market the gold price suffered another significant setback as the computer programmes used by some New York funds sent out fresh 'sell' signals on Tuesday. The London price plunged Dollars 10.10 a troy ounce that day and Dollars 2.50 the next. Thursday saw a Dollars 2.40 rally in response to the Bundesbank's interest rate cuts, but the New York bears were in control again yesterday and the price ended the week Dollars 14.40 down at Dollars 349.85 an ounce, the first close below Dollars 350 since late April. The London Commodity Exchange's robusta coffee futures moved to fresh 2 1/2  year highs as the commencement of the export retention scheme on October 1 drew closer and producers talked of lifting the scheme's guide prices to ensure that the planned 20 per cent would be held off the market. The recent price rise has made it likely that under the agreed arrangements retention will be scaled down to 10 per cent, or even suspended altogether, by the time the scheme comes into force. The November position closed yesterday at Dollars 1,296 a tonne, up Dollars 68 on the week, after peaking at Dollars 1,320. Supply worries maintained the upward pressure in the LCE cocoa market, where the December futures position touched Pounds 875 yesterday, before closing at Pounds 856 a tonne, up Pounds 30 on the week. In contrast oil prices, depressed by continuing Opec oversupply, slumped to three-year lows. At London's International Petroleum Exchange the November Brent crude futures position was trading late yesterday at Dollars 15.90 a barrel, down 86 cents on the week.  ----------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ----------------------------------- Aluminium   +15,850  to  2,132,900 Copper       +4,450  to  526,150 Lead           +275  to  282,275 Nickel        1,500  to  110,328 Zinc         +3,750  to  774,600 Tin            +325  to  21,575  -----------------------------------</p>

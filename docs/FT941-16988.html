			<p>940106 FT  06 JAN 94 / Venezuela jail toll at 122 The death toll in Venezuela's worst prison riot yesterday climbed to 122 with the discovery of the charred remains of at least 15 inmates in a tunnel prisoners had dug to escape, Reuter reports from Caracas. Authorities said the corpses were burned so badly it was difficult to determine the exact number, but they believe there were between 15 and 17. The tally was expected to rise.</p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Ireland to launch gilt contract to lift market liquidity The Irish Futures and Options Exchange plans to launch a futures contract based on the 10-year Irish government bond by the end of the year as part of a series of changes to improve the liquidity of the Irish bond market. The contract, which will complement an existing 20-year gilt contract, will be underpinned by a new securities repurchase system which is likely to be in place by the end of the year. The reforms are designed to attract more foreign investment, which should in turn reduce the cost of borrowing to the Irish exchequer. The Treasury believes the progress towards peace in Ireland will have a positive impact. 'The IRA ceasefire will have a beneficial impact on the economy and on the bond market, supporting domestic confidence and attracting foreign investors,' said Mr John Corrigan, a director of the Irish National Treasury Management Agency. Other reforms have included the replacement of the Irish bond market's order-driven system with a marketmaking operation which is to start next year. This will involve five to six marketmakers, including two offshore marketmakers, likely to be two of the pan-European investment houses based in London. In early 1995, an independent Irish stock exchange will be created when the Dublin stock exchange is separated from the International Stock Exchange of the United Kingdom. Ireland is hoping to revive its planned eurobond issue denominated in Irish punts which was cancelled at the end of 1993 because of turbulent bond market conditions. At the time, the issue was believed to carry a 30-year maturity.</p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF PGA SENIORS;  </P> <P> NICKLAUS SHOOTS 68 FOR A THREE-SHOT LEAD  </P> <P> Jack Nicklaus says there's no such thing as a "home-court" advantage in playing  golf courses he designs.  </P> <P> He might have had a hard time convincing anyone of that Thursday, after  shooting a 68, four under par, for the first-round lead in the 51st PGA Seniors  Championship.  </P> <P> Playing the 6,630-yard Champion course at PGA National Golf Club, which he  redesigned within the past year, Nicklaus took a three-shot lead.  </P> <P> Just two weeks ago, on a course he built in Scottsdale, Ariz., Nicklaus won his  first start on the Senior PGA Tour, the Tradition at Desert Mountain.  </P> <P> "I had to play two practice rounds here to see what I had done, and today  (Thursday), the wind had completely turned from what it was earlier in the  week," said Nicklaus, who lives 10 minutes from the course.  </P> <P> Nicklaus made five birdies and a bogey.  </P> <P> Tied for second at 71 are Mike Hill, the first-round leader a year ago with 67;  Dale Douglass, the runner-up to Chi Chi Rodriguez in 1987; Al Kelley, an  alternate who replaced Dave Hill earlier in the week; and Jim Ferree, who had  four birdies on the back nine, the best effort among the leaders coming in.  </P> <P> Defending champion Larry Mowry was eight strokes behind with 76, familiar  territory for him. He trailed Hill by seven after an opening round of 74 in  1989.  </P> <P> Others of the new "Big Four" on the senior tour did not fare as well as  Nicklaus. Lee Trevino, like Nicklaus a rookie senior, had two double bogeys on  the way to a 77. Gary Player shot 74 and Arnold Palmer had an 80.  </P> <P> "(Nicklaus) is not just another 50-year-old out here, is he?" Douglass said.  </P> <P> Said Nicklaus: "I played reasonably well today. As a matter of fact, I played  very well. My putting was medium . . . not bad and not good. I only made four  putts, including a 10-footer to save par at the 12th hole. That isn't very  many, but I've had a lot of rounds lately where I didn't make any. So I guess  it's not too bad."  </P> <P> Nicklaus birdied the second, third, 10th, 14th and 17th holes Thursday and  bogeyed No. 8.  </P> <P> He turned in his most spectacular effort on the 540-yard 10th, the longest hole  on the course. What he called "a rather large tee shot" hit an asphalt cart  path on the fly and bounced another 50 yards, he estimated. He was left with a  seven-iron, 142 yards to the front and another 15 yards back to the cup. His  second shot was 13 feet short and he was two feet short on his uphill putt for  an eagle.  </P> <P> "The (Champion) course will be harder to win on than the one in Arizona because  more guys will play well here," Nicklaus said. "My goal here was to make it  easier for the average player, but not easier from the back tees."  </P></p>

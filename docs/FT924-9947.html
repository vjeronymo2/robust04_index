			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Drive for accounts to be made clearer THE ACCOUNTING Standards Board, the UK standard-setter for financial reporting, is to consider ways to make accounts more understandable to private investors. Mr David Tweedie, the board's chairman, said he was considering ways to introduce more narrative statements, explanations of terms and discussions of corporate performance that those without financial skills could use. 'We are going to have to do something for the layman,' he said. 'Most do not understand accounts or the basic terms such as assets or reserves.' Any formal standard or set of guidelines is likely to be several years away because the board is heavily committed to a lengthy programme of revising other standards, many of which will prove highly controversial. A start has been made, though, with proposals for an operating and financial review text to accompany every set of accounts, along the lines of the management discussion and analysis contained in US corporate reports. Future guidance may take the form of advice for companies compiling employee reports or information for private shareholders, but Mr Tweedie said 'it is not on the agenda yet'. Academic research  - including some conducted by Mr Tweedie while he was a professor of accounting  - has consistently shown that few users of accounts understand them or read beyond the basic profit-and-loss account. Even analysts and other more financially sophisticated users often say the annual report is much less important than other sources of information on a company, such as personal briefings with senior executives. Mr Tweedie is highly critical of the government's regulations on summary accounts, the abbreviated financial information that shareholders can opt to receive in place of full annual accounts. He called them 'hopeless'. Many shareholders in privatisation issues have opted for the summary statements, which include the basic financial statements but exclude most detail such as the notes to the accounts. Last week the board announced FRS 3, its latest standard, which fundamentally changes the structure of the profit-and-loss account.</p>

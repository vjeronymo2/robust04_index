			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Services seen as main job creators Employment growth will become more firmly established in 1994 and 1995, with private-sector services leading the way, a report predicts today. Cambridge Econometrics says in its latest Industry and the British Economy report, that 206,000 jobs will be created in private-sector services in the period. Much of the growth will come in business and miscellaneous services  -including estate agents, recruitment, security, recreation, media, dry-cleaning and hairdressing - which will produce an expected 141,000 jobs. Professional services, among them accountancy, legal, architecture and advertising, should contribute another 40,000, and hotels and catering 37,000. In spite of these new jobs, the report warns that structural unemployment will persist. It expects unemployment to still be 2.4m by the turn of the century, and 2.2m by 2005. The report expects the jobs growth in many service activities to be offset by losses in transport, communications and the public sector. Many of the new jobs will be in sectors characterised by a high ratio of part-time, self-employed and female workers, while full-time, predominantly male jobs will continue to disappear in manufacturing. Cambridge Econometrics expects that another 68,000 manufacturing jobs will be lost by 1995. GDP growth will, the report expects, strengthen from 2.1 per cent in 1993 to 2.6 per cent this year and 2.4 per cent in 1995. Growth this year will be led by an upturn in investment spending, slightly stronger growth in consumer expenditure and a continued positive contribution from net trade.</p>

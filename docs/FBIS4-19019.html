			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Mafia May Try To Infiltrate Forza </F> Italia, Parenti Says"]    [Text] (ANSA) Fiuggi, April 12 -- The boom of Forza Italia  Clubs, the local branches of the brand new party led by Silvio  Berlusconi, has increased the danger of infiltration by the  Mafia, according to former Clean Hands magistrate Tiziana  Parenti, who ran successfully under the Forza Italia ticket in  the March 27 elections.    "There is a danger of infiltration, even by the Mafia," she  said, adding: "I am worried.... Some names ring warning bells,"  referring to names of people who have recently joined the Forza  Italia Clubs.    Parenti, who worked as a junior investigator in the Milan  corruption scandals before entering politics, declined to say  which names caused her to fear that the Mafia may be trying to  infiltrate the party, which has displaced the Christian  Democrats and the Socialists as the new top gun of Italian  politics.    She recommended doing background checks on all those who  join  the Clubs, stressing that the so-called anti-Mafia  Certification, a bureaucratic statement indicating that an  individual has no criminal record, "may not be enough."    Aside from organized crime, some discredited politicians who  were ousted from power by corruption scandals and by the recent  elections may try to reenter politics through the back door of  the Forza Italia Clubs, Parenti also warned.    "The Clubs," she said, "must be checked and rechecked to  make  sure they are formed by people who want to do clean politics.  The clubs have been used as a way of coalescing people but  thorough controls have not been possible until now because of  the speed with which they were organzied throughout the country.  But now is the time to watch carefully."    Parenti admitted she knew of no specific cases of Mafia  members joining the Clubs, but she said Berlusconi, too was  "concerned."    Berlusconi however denied categorically that organized crime  could be connected in any way to his support Clubs. "I rule  out, for all I know, infiltrations by the Mafia in our  movement," Berlusconi claimed. "I don't see any convenience by  anyone linked to these organizations in having members inside  Forza Italia Clubs," which "for the time being" have no  political influence, he added.    Berlusconi reiterated his campaign promise that Forza Italia  will fight organized crime and will do "more effectively than  has been done so far."</p>

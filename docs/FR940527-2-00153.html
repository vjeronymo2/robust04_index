Principal Mutual reserves the right to deduct from each Division of Separate Account B each valuation period an administrative expense charge equivalent to a nominal annual rate not greater than .15% of the average daily net assets of the Division. The annual fee and the administrative expense charge are designed to help cover administrative costs relating to the Contracts, such as those incurred in issuing Contracts, establishing and maintaining Contract records, making regulatory filings, furnishing notices, voting materials and other communications, providing computer, actuarial and accounting services, and processing Contract transactions. The annual fee and administrative expense charge are designed only to reimburse Principal Mutual for administrative expenses on a cumulative basis. With respect to any issued Contract, the annual fee is guaranteed never to be increased and the administrative expense charge, if imposed, is guaranteed never to be increased above .15% on an annualized basis. Applicants will rely on Rule 26a&hyph;1 under the Act for the necessary exemptive relief to impose the annual fee and the administrative expense charge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Principal Mutual will deduct amounts necessary to cover any premium taxes required by state or local law. Such deductions may be made from purchase payments when received or from the Contract's accumulated value when surrendered (in whole or in part) or applied to provide annuity payments. Applicants will rely on Rule 26a&hyph;2(d) under the Act to permit the deduction of such taxes from the assets of Separate Account B. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. No sales charge will be deducted from purchase payments as they are made. Instead, Principal Mutual will deduct a surrender charge (contingent deferred sales charge) on certain total and partial surrenders of the Contract on or prior to the commencement of annuity payments. The surrender charge is intended to partially reimburse Principal Mutual for expenses incurred in the sale of the Contracts, including commissions and other promotional or distribution expenses associated with the marketing of the Contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. The surrender charge is a percentage of the purchase payments withdrawn or surrendered which were received by Principal Mutual during the seven-year period prior to the withdrawal or surrender. The applicable percentage is based on the number of completed Contract years between the Contract year in which the purchase payment was paid and the Contract year of surrender. For purchase payments received less than three completed Contract years at the time of surrender, the surrender charge is six percent of the purchase payment. For purchase payments received three or more completed Contract years at the time of surrender, the surrender charge is reduced one percent each Contract year, so that purchase payments held for three completed Contract years are subject to a five percent charge, purchase payments held for four completed Contract years are subject to a four percent charge, and so forth. Purchase payments held for seven or more completed Contract years are not subject to any surrender charge. For purposes of calculating the surrender charge, amounts surrendered are deemed to be, first, purchase payments made in Contract years no longer subject to a surrender charge, then, amounts entitled to a free surrender privilege and, then, purchase payments made on a first-in, first-out basis. The amount of the surrender charge may be reduced in circumstances permitted by the Act and the rules thereunder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Pursuant to a free surrender privilege, no surrender charge will apply to surrenders made during a Contract year in an amount not exceeding the greater of (i) the Contract's accumulated value minus purchase payments not surrendered and (ii) an amount equal to (a) ten percent of purchase payments still subject to a surrender charge as of the last Contract anniversary plus (b) 10 percent of any purchase payments made since the last Contract anniversary reduced by (c) any partial surrenders made since the last Contract anniversary. In addition, no surrender charge applies to amounts used to provide annuity payments or a death benefit payment or amounts distributed to satisfy the minimum distribution requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code. Finally, if permitted by state law, the surrender charged will be waived, pursuant to a rider to the Contracts and subject to the conditions set forth therein, as to the payment of any amounts after the first Contract anniversary as a result of the owner's or annuitant's being confined to a health care facility (as defined in the rider), having been diagnosed as having a terminal illness (as defined in the rider) or being totally and permanently disabled (as defined in the rider). Applicants will rely on Rule 6c&hyph;8 under the Act for the necessary exemptive relief to permit imposition of the surrender charge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. Principal Mutual will also deduct a $30 transaction charge for each unscheduled partial surrender made after the first such surrender during a Contract year. Such charge, designed to cover the administrative expenses associated with the surrender, will be deducted from the owner's interest in the Fixed Account or each Division of Separate Account B from which the surrender is made in the same proportion that the amount surrendered from the Fixed Account or such Division bears to the total amount surrendered. Applicants will rely on Rule 26a&hyph;1 under the Act for the necessary exemptive relief to charge such fee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Principal Mutual assumes mortality and expense risks under the Contracts. The mortality risk is the risk that annuitants may live for a longer period of time than estimated. Principal Mutual assumes this mortality risk by virtue of annuity rates incorporated into the Contract which cannot be changed. This assures each annuitant that neither his longevity nor an improvement in life expectancy generally will have an adverse effect on the amount of annuity payments. Also, Principal Mutual guarantees that if the annuitant dies before the commencement of annuity payments it will pay a minimum death benefit. The expense risk assumed by Principal Mutual is the risk that actual administration expenses incurred in connection with issuing and administering the Contracts will exceed the limits on administrative charges set in the Contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Dutch rate cut provides some support INTEREST rate cuts by the Dutch and Belgium central banks gave some support to late closing markets, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT showed midsession strength on firmer bond prices, the DAX index registering an intraday high of 1,717.02, closed 3.45 lower at 1,709.68, but regained some of its vigour in the post-bourse. Turnover eased from DM8.2bn to DM7.8bn. For a good part of the day, the market was dominated by chemicals where Bayer dropped DM4.50 to DM277 ahead of today's dividend decision, and after this week's dividend cuts from BASF and Hoechst. BASF is paying DM1 more than expected, at DM10, and Hoechst DM1 less than some analysts hoped at DM9. This suggested that investors had been taking a simplistic view of dividend prospects for the sector, where dividend decisions are taken by reference to earnings of the German parent company. Bayer clawed back DM2 of its fall in the London afternoon, but Deutsche Bank did better with a post-bourse close of DM728 against a session rise of DM1.50 to DM723. Ms Barbara Schumacher, of Merck Fink in Dusseldorf, noted that Deutsche was the laggard bank with a rise of just 20 per cent from its low of last September, compared with a gain of 34 per cent for Commerzbank over the same period. AMSTERDAM was also interested in chemicals with DSM continuing to surprise. The shares closed at a year's high, up Fl 4.90 or some 6 per cent at Fl 83.40, having gained 14 per cent since the group announced disappointing 1992 results last week. Some analysts commented that that the momentum in the price may have begun with short covering while investors may be more optimistic about long-term prospects. Akzo rose Fl 2.10 to Fl 154.50. The CBS Tendency index put on 1.70 to finish at 105.40. The rate cuts had been anticipated but financial stocks were nonetheless given a late lift, with Aegon rising Fl 1.90 to Fl 89.30 and ABN Amro Fl 1.40 to Fl 55.40. Hunter Douglas, Fl 2.60 stronger at Fl 42.50, was helped partly by relief that the dividend was cut less than forecasts. PARIS had been riding the 2,000 level until just before the close when technical trading saw the CAC-40 index dip 17.20 to 1,992.42. Turnover was some FFr3.4bn. Lafarge pleased the market following better than expected 1992 results and the shares moved FFr7.50 higher to FFr357.50, but off a day's high of FFr364.90. Chargeurs gained FFr26 to FFr1,281 after announcing that it will consolidate BSkyB in next year's results which may help it reduce its tax charge. BRUSSELS rose strongly anticipating the cut in interest rates which came after the close and the Bel-20 index gained 11.59 to 1,247.71 in turnover of some BFr2.1bn. MILAN allowed the dust to settle on political events and shares picked up as the market concentrated on today's options expiry and the end of the monthly account next week. The Comit index rose 5.63 to 516.65. Montedison, spurred by a newspaper report that the sale of its Erbamont subsidiary to Sweden's Kabi Pharmacia was imminent, gained L32 to fix at L1,297 before rising to L1,312 after hours - 3.7 per cent higher on the day. Montedison's parent Ferruzzi denied that final terms were about to be announced but confirmed that negotiations were at an advanced stage. Blue chips picked up from some early declines after the Christian Democrats promised to support Prime Minister Giuliano Amato. Fiat dipped L38 to fix at L5,651 before bouncing back to L5,715 after hours. ZURICH turned firmer after bargain hunters entered the market, lifting cyclical stocks which had earlier suffered from profit-taking. The SMI index rose 5.9 to 2,157.2. Banks, however, were mostly easier after Swiss Bank announced results that were below expectations and were unfavourably compared with the two other leading banks which posted higher profits for 1992. SBC and UBS were each SFr4 lower at SFr356 and SFr1,170 respectively but CS Holding managed a SFr10 advance to SFr2,240. STOCKHOLM saw a short-lived pre-lunch rally before prices settled back as investors awaited a crop of company results, some expected to be gloomy, today. The Affarsvarlden general index shed 5.2 to 1,033.7. Hennes and Mauritz proved an exception, climbing SKr28 or 16 per cent to SKr202 in brisk trade after Tuesday's 62 per cent profits growth.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                   FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- March 10                                            THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               Open      10.30       11.00      12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1164.68    1164.67     1165.53    1166.44 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1233.33    1233.07     1231.91    1232.45  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes              13.00      14.00       15.00      Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1165.76    1166.84     1166.79    1167.52 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1232.13    1232.87     1232.38    1231.98  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Mar 9     Mar 8     Mar 5     Mar 4     Mar 3  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1164.26   1165.04   1159.70   1156.15   1158.99 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1230.72   1229.32   1225.29   1216.30   1221.03  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1167.96; 200 - 1234.83 Low/day: 100 - 1164.10 200 - 1231.29.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

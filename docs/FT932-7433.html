			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / BCCI victims gather to stage the big one: Costly preparations at Wembley for the world's largest creditors' meeting THE WORLD'S biggest creditors' meeting is expected to attract an audience from as far afield as Egypt, Zimbabwe and China this week as aggrieved victims of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International gather in London. About 1,000 people are expected to attend to elect a creditors' committee on Thursday afternoon at Wembley Arena in London, at the culmination of a process costing Pounds 1m. The arena, better known for ice-skating shows and pop concerts, was chosen for its location and size. It is the second-largest indoor stadium in the UK. In theory several hundred thousand individuals are eligible to attend the meeting. Observers expect to see some drama as Mr Christopher Morris, a liquidator for the bank, delivers a speech about the handling of BCCI since it was closed in July 1991. The formal part of the meeting should be over relatively quickly. All the law requires is a vote to choose the five-strong creditors' committee, which in turn approves the liquidators' fees and sanctions their legal actions and decisions. Then comes the unknown. Mr Morris's speech - which is being finalised - will include answers to some of the 300 questions already received. Others will be submitted in writing as creditors arrive at the meeting. A lawyer will be on hand to urge caution in the replies. Mr Fred Goodwin, a Touche Ross partner, said: 'We believe there will be a lot of questions and a lot of emotion. We want to be as open as we can, and we will answer every single question in writing afterwards.' There were about 730,000 BCCI bank accounts worldwide, and several thousand other creditors. The liquidators advertised in 50 countries and sent out 50,000 letters. More than 3,600 responded, of whom just fewer than 3,000 turned out to be creditors. They were sent nomination packs with the manifestos of 25 candidates. One has since withdrawn and a further six were excluded because they were not creditors. Those remaining include an Egyptian diplomat, the liquidator of Rhodesia Railways, and a representative of the Isle of Man, residents of which have lost Dollars 99m. So far 533 creditors have said they will come. Another 528 have given their proxies to 177 others. Many may bring family and friends. A further 716 proxies have been allocated to the chairman. The High Court called for the election of a creditors' committee in January. Until this stage of the liquidation the court had argued that it would be too complex and costly to arrange an election. Preparations are almost complete for the 100 staff to be involved on the day at Wembley, and on the fifth floor of BCCI's former principal office in Leadenhall Street in the City of London. Three staff are taking about 100 calls a day from creditors - down from 1,100 on the day the bank was closed in July 1991. They have answered more than 2,500 questions on the creditors' meeting since February. Around the corner a dozen more are sifting records to ensure that those attending or sending proxies are creditors. Several employees of the Electoral Reform Society are also in place, overseeing preparations for the ballot.</p>

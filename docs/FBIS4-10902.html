			<p>BFN     [Text] On 18 April, within the scope of the parliamentary  plan that has already received the support of the United States  and the United Nations, Frantz Robert Monde, president of the  Chamber of Deputies, began his consultations with employers in  order to resolve the crisis. Both Monde and Max Villard, vice  president of the Haitian Chamber of Commerce and Industry,  deemed those talks very positive.    According to the president of the chamber, the two officials  tackled the core of the problem: the executive vacuum and how to  fill it. Villard renewed the employers' support for the  parliamentary plan for the resolution of the crisis. This plan,  which provides for the installation of a new prime minister  after the retirement of General Raoul Cedras, but does not set a  date for the return of Jean-Bertrand Aristide, has been rejected  by the president-in-exile.    On 13 April, Monde criticized President Aristide for his  stubborn refusal to appoint a new prime minister and announced  that he wanted to initiate consultations on fill the executive  vacuum. Deputy Monde labeled this meeting as fruitful, but  refused to reveal the points discussed.</p>

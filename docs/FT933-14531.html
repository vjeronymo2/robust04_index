			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Mirror holds its own in tabloid war THE DAILY Mirror seems to have held on to and even increased its circulation yesterday in spite of being 7p more expensive than The Sun, its main rival. Industry sources suggested that the Mirror increased sales by about 2 per cent. Daily Mirror sales in June were more than 2.6m a day. Early estimates suggested that The Sun's price cut of 5p to 20p for the summer was having a modest effect so far, with sales up by about 220,000 yesterday.</p>

He considers this shooting  incident a violation of the spirit of peace that we are working  to realize in the region.    In a statement to MENA today, the Palestinian official asked  the Israeli Government to stop these acts the Israeli settlers  are committing.    He affirmed that these acts compel the international  community to shoulder its responsibility in the march to peace  by providing the Palestinian people inside the occupied  territories with international protection until Israel withdraws  from the Palestinian territories.</p>

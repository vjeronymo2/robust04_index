			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cambodian government and Khmer Rouge forces have  agreed to a two-day ceasefire at the request of the Thai  military in order to allow Thai farmers to harvest their rice  crops and remove rice stocks to safety.    Informed sources said the ceasefire request was made by the  Thai-Cambodian Border Coordinating Office to the two warring  factions.    The ceasefire, which took effect yesterday, was observed by  the two rival factions permitting farmers of Tambon Tha Kham and  Tambon Klong Namsai to harvest rice crops and move out rice  stocks from Nong Ian, a small piece of Thai territory which juts  into Cambodia. Several artillery and mortar shells as well as  rockets fired by both the Cambodian Government and Khmer Rouge  have smashed into Nong Ian, which is uninhabitated [as  published] since fighting broke out a week ago.    One Thai villager was recently killed by shrapnel from a  stray shell.    A Border Patrol unit yesterday went into Nong Ian where they  found two unexploded shells which were eventually detonated.    Quoting Thai traders who travelled into Cambodia, informed  sources said the two warring factions had taken advantage of the  ceasefire to regroup and beef up their forces.    Trucks carrying supplies and troops were seen rumbling on  highways in Ban Nimit and Battambang.</p>

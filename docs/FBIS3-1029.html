			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lome, March 17 (AFP) -- Togo's opposition parties  which fell out over power-sharing after winning a majority in  the first free general election in 30 years have patched up  their quarrel, they said here Thursday [17 March]. The Action  Committee for Renewal (CAR), 36 seats, and the Union for  Democracy (UTD), seven seats, said in a joint statement that  they expected to form a new government, given that they held an  absolute majority of parliament's 81 seats.    Under the Constitution, military ruler General Gnassingbe  Eyadema, in power since 1967, has to pick a prime minister from  the parliamentary majority. He began consultations with all  party chiefs Tuesday. The Togolese People's Rally, Eyadema's  mainstay for a quarter of a century as the only legal party, won  35 seats in last month's two-round poll.    UTD leader Edem Kodjo, once a close associate of Eyadema  until they fell out in the 1980s, caused consternation in  opposition ranks when the Supreme Court issued the official  results Monday. He repudiated a mid-election pact with the CAR,  suspicious that the bigger movement intended turning his group  into a mere appendage. Nobody could claim the 41-seat majority  in Parliament without his party, which had a "pivotal" role and  intended exercising it, Kodjo insisted.    CAR chief Yao Agboyibor had hailed the election results as a  victory for the people and said he was sure Eyadema's  consultations on the appointment of new government leaders "will  lead to choices in line with the voting. Any other outcome  would be a scandal." Agboyibor, 51, a lawyer, is widely expected  to be named as new premier.</p>

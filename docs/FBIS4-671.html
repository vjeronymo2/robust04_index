			<p>BFN     [Text] Kinshasa, 12 Apr (AFP) -- The future prime minister  to be designated by the radical opposition must first sign the  protocol agreement reached in January between the presidential  group and the opposition and the special arrangement concerning  the number of portfolios to be assigned to each political  family, a statement issued by the bureau of the High Council of  the Republic-Transitional Parliament (HCR-PT) indicated. These  agreements between the presidential group and the opposition  were reached after four months of negotiations at the Palais du  Peuple in Kinshasa.    The HCR-PT bureau also underlined that the application for  the post of prime minister should include among others the  minutes and general report on consultations with the Sacred  Union and its allies, and a report on consultations with the  presidential group duly signed by all the parties concerned.    It may be recalled that Etienne Tshisekedi's party, the  Union  for Democracy and Social Progress, which participated in the  Palais du Peuple negotiations, did not sign the protocol  agreement due to differences over the appointment of the head of  government. Under the transitional constitutional law  promulgated on 9 April, a prime minister should be appointed  between 9 and 20 April.</p>

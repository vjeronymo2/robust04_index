			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A flight attendant and a passenger of ill-fated United Airlines Flight 811 have  filed lawsuits in Honolulu over the Feb. 24 disaster that killed nine  passengers who were sucked out of a gaping hole in a jumbo jet. Flight  attendant May Sapolu sued Boeing Co., the plane's manufacturer, in state court  and passenger Edwin Tudor of Australia filed suit against United Airlines in  federal court. Tudor was sitting in row 27 and "could see the hole" but was not  close to it, said his attorney, John Carroll. Tudor has complained of  pulmonary, hearing and post-trauma disorders. Sapolu, the flight attendant, was  smashed to the floor and hung onto the leg of a chair to keep from being swept  out of the plane, said her lawyer, Rick Fried Jr.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> "Trump Card," a new syndicated bingo-like TV game show backed by real estate  tycoon Donald Trump, has been tripped up by some last-minute contractual  problems. Trump was set to make the official announcement Thursday morning at  Trump Tower in New York City, but that press conference was canceled late  Wednesday. However, a Lorimar executive said "Trump Card" is almost sure to be  on the market in January at the annual National Assn. of Television Program  Executives convention for a debut next fall. Trump will own a third of the  program, as will both Lorimar Television and Warner Bros. Domestic Television  Distribution. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

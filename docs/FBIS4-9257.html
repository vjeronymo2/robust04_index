			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by C.R.: "M. Setinc Resigned"] </F>   [Text] Ljubljana -- Mile Setinc, director of the Government  Information Office, resigned yesterday. He denied that  disagreement in the LDS [Liberal Democracy of Slovenia] over the  adoption of the Law on Radio and Television was the reason for  his departure. It is known that Setinc favored more  representatives of civic groups and professional organizations  without party affiliations in the state Radio-Television  Council. The Assembly adopted an alternative, a compromise  between his proposal and the proposal backed by the LDS, which  would allow representatives of political parties to dominate the  Council. Setinc said that he has "personal" reasons for his  resignation.</p>

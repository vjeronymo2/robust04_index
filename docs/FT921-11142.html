			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Sharp brings HDTV equipment within reach of the mass market A MASS market for high definition television was brought years closer yesterday when Sharp, the Japanese electronics company, surprised the industry by introducing an HDTV receiver for about a quarter of the price of the nearest competing product. The equipment will put HDTV within the reach of a large number of Japanese households. It could also be a key to rekindling growth in the consumer electronics industry, which has been suffering from a lack of new products. 'It is just the type of stimulus that the industry needs,' said Mr Chuck Goto, electronics analyst at SG Warburg Securities in Tokyo. 'Sony and everybody else will be scrambling to match the product.' Sharp unveiled a 36-inch HDTV decoder which it will sell for Y1m (Pounds 4,475) beginning in April. The launch is timed to capitalise on the increased interest in HDTV expected to be generated by the summer Olympics, which will be broadcast in Japan in HDTV format. An HDTV product at Y1m had not been expected for at least several years. The price had been cited by a wide range of analysts and electronics companies as a threshold. Once reached, they expect HDTV quickly to become a mass market product in Japan, allowing for greater economies of scale in manufacturing which will encourage further price reductions. NHK, Japan's national broadcast company, began broadcasting in HDTV for eight hours a day in November, but a price of between Y3.6m and Y4m for receiving equipment has been too high for most. European broadcasts are expected to begin by the middle of the decade. Sharp, based in Osaka, said its surveys indicated that up to 16 per cent of Japanese households may be prepared to buy the product at that price. Some of its competitors expressed astonishment at the price, and reserved judgment over its quality until comparison tests could be made. Mr Masao Tomioka, chief of Sharp's high vision project, said the cost was brought down in part by reducing the number of integrated circuits used in the signal decoder to just six semiconductor chips. An HDTV set announced last week by a consortium consisting of Fujitsu, Hitachi, Sony and Texas Instruments, still contained 30 chips.</p>

			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / UK Company News: OMI incurs Pounds 2.7m loss and shares fall SHARES of OMI International fell 5p to 12p yesterday after the design, instrumentation, and electro-optics group announced heavy losses and the sale of businesses. OMI, formerly called Optical and Medical International, made pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.68m in the year to March 31, compared with profits of Pounds 2.45m last time. Turnover was Pounds 51.21m (Pounds 53.48m). The group has agreed to sell its aerospace and general design businesses and the staff placement agency business, OTS Services, to Hebron &amp; Medlock (Holdings), a private company. The deal will bring OMI a net Pounds 2m in cash, but the group made an extraordinary provision of Pounds 12.82m, principally to cover the disposals. Also included in the extraordinary provision were the costs of closing parts of Peters &amp; Zabranbsky, a German subsidiary. Mr Gil Williams, chairman and chief executive, said this exit from the depressed aerospace and general design businesses was part of the group's strategy of focusing on specialised products and added-value services - such as industrial logistics, diagnostics and optronics. Losses per share of 6.4p compared with a profit of 3.4p last time. At the year-end, OMI had net cash of Pounds 478,000, which will be boosted by the proceeds of the disposals. In view of the strength of the balance sheet, the board recommended a final dividend of 1p, giving a total for the year of 1.75p (5.21p).</p>

			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OFFICER SAYS 'CHEERS' STAR ADMITTED DISCARDING COCAINE  </P> <P> A Los Angeles police officer testified Wednesday that "Cheers" star Kelsey  Grammer confessed to dropping a small packet of cocaine in his patrol car after  the actor was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving in 1988.  </P> <P> "That cocaine was in my pocket. I felt stupid. I should have just told you I  had it," Officer Michael Akana quoted Grammer as saying. "You deserve better  than that. I would like to apologize to you," Grammer allegedly added.  </P> <P> Wearing a blue jail uniform and sporting a stubbly beard, Grammer -- who plays  the pompous psychiatrist Dr. Frasier Crane on the popular television program --  appeared cheerful as he entered Van Nuys Municipal Court for the brief hearing.  </P> <P> Grammer is serving a 30-day sentence for a probation violation stemming from an  unrelated drunk driving conviction. Jail officials said that due to jail  overcrowding, Grammer will be released Saturday after serving only 10 days of  the sentence.  </P> <P> Akana was the sole witness at the preliminary hearing on the cocaine possession  charge stemming from Grammer's April 14, 1988, arrest in North Hollywood after  a routine traffic stop. Judge Aviva K. Bobb said the evidence was sufficient to  hold Grammer for trial and scheduled a Van Nuys Superior Court arraignment for  June 13.  </P> <P> Akana testified that he stopped Grammer's red sports car because it had expired  license plates. Grammer's eyes at the time were bloodshot and he appeared pale,  flushed and fatigued and smelled of alcohol, Akana said.  </P> <P> Grammer was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving and driving without a  license and taken by patrol car to the North Hollywood police station for a  breath test. Because the blood-alcohol measuring machine was broken, Grammer  was taken to the Van Nuys police station, where the one-quarter gram packet of  cocaine was found in the police car, Akana said.  </P> <P> Grammer's blood-alcohol content was measured at 0.03% -- well below the legal  standard for driving under the influence of alcohol.  </P> <P> Outside court, Robert L. Diamond, Grammer's attorney, said his client was  wearing a borrowed jacket on the night of his arrest and that the cocaine did  not belong to him.  </P></p>

"We insist on the earliest possible opening of the Hungarian  trade and cultural office in Taipei," CDPP Vice President and  Member of Parliament mIKLOS hASZNOS said after returning from a  weeklong visit to Taiwan.    Hasznos and Bela Csepe, leader of the parliamentary faction  of the CDPP recently traveled to Taipei to boost bilateral ties  between Budapest and Taipei.    Hasznos told CNA Budapest that they wanted to discuss how to  speed up the opening of the office with Minister of Foreign  Affairs Geza Jeszenszky. He said it was in Hungary's best  interests to have the office open sometime this year.    Hasznos pointed out that development of economic and  cultural  cooperation with Taiwan should be a natural process and could  not be seen by Beijing as an unfriendly step.    However, he added, office rent was very high in Taipei, and  those costs have not been included in Hungary's state budget  this year. Hasznos and Csepe explained to their hosts in Taipei  that the Hungarian representative office would be open sooner if  the Taipei Government understood the financial difficulties and  put government owned real estate at Hungary's disposal or made a  cheaper rent possible for the first year.    The politicians recalled their visit to Kuomintang  headquarters where they had emphasized the similarities between  the Taiwan ruling party and the Hungarian Christian Democrats.  These similarities would facilitate mutual understanding.    "We are both conservatives, nationalists, and  anti-Communists," he said.    Economic relations should be expanded, he explained. "More  exchange of information is needed," stressed Hasznos. In his  view cooperations could also explore barter trade because both  sides have products necessary to the other one.    He thinks that Taiwan tourism to Hungary should also be  developed. He will encourage travel agencies to send  information to and make bids in Taipei. A good tourism  relationship would help boost Taiwan tourists to Expo 96, to be  held in Budapest, he noted.</p>

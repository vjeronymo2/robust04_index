			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The 1994-95 Budget, the Sixth Development </F> Program, and the Second Long-Term Development Plan"]    [Text] There are certain matters that should be noted in  the Sixth Development Program (6th Repelita) and the Second  25-Year Long-Term Development Plan (PJP II). These matters were  included in the budget speech delivered by President Suharto on  Thursday [6 January] in Parliament.    First, Indonesia's population should reach 258.1 million by  the end of the year 2019, and by then the country's work force  should total 147.9 million. This total is based on the  assumption that the country's population growth rate can be  reduced to 0.88 percent from the current 1.6 percent by the end  of the PJP II.    Second, Indonesia's annual average economic growth for the  next 25 years was projected at 7 percent due to the  ever-increasing population. As an early measure, the target for  the country's economic growth was projected to stand at an  annual average of 6.2 percent during the Sixth Five-Year  Development Program.    Third, with the ever-increasing population, it was hoped  that  Indonesia's per capita income would reach U.S.$2,631 by the end  of the Second 25-Year Long-Term Development Plan. This figure  is calculated on the basis of price consistency during the  1989-90 period. Nominal prices will definitely be higher.    By looking at the three factors, we would like to say that  it  was truly a difficult undertaking to draft the 25-year plan.  Moreover, the plan had to be based on the achievements of the  First Twenty-Five Year Development Program -- from 1969 to 1994  and by taking into account the people's capability in ensuring  continuity in development, the ever-changing and rapid global  economic situation and the numerous domestic or external  difficulties that could possibly arise.    The government performed an extraordinary service by  simultaneously presenting all three programs to the parliament  on Thursday -- the 1994-95 Budget, the Sixth Development  Program, and the Second 25-Year Long-Term Development Plan. It  is obvious that the three programs are interlinked. The 1994-95  budget should be a part of the Sixth Development Program while  the latter should be a part of the Second 25-Year Long-Term  Development Plan or PJP II.    In drawing up the Sixth Development Program and the PJP II,  the government definitely focused on growth in the economic  sectors (agriculture, production industries, non-gas production  industries, trade, and so on). It may be observed that the  agriculture sector's role will decline while the role of the  industries, trade, and services will rise dramatically.    However, what we wish to emphasize concerns a  69-million-person population increase from the current 189.1  million to 258.1 million by the end of PJP II and the demanding  responsibility of making preparations toward providing the basic  needs -- food, basic amenities, and accomodation. The most  difficult task will be in ensuring adequate food supply.    With the present population of 189.1 million, the annual  rice  production, which stands at 36 million tons -- including an  insignificant amount imported as a "security" measure -- food  sufficiency, particularly rice, is adequate to meet general  requirements. However, a more precise calculation will be  needed in trying to meet the requirements of a population of  258.1 million people by the end of the Second 25-Year Long-Term  Development Plan. It will be difficult to ensure an adequate  and consistent rice supply if we take into consideration our  resources and capabilities. On the other hand, greater  attention should be given to food sufficiency (which not only  means rice but also some other kinds of food).    We need to consider the importance of importing a greater  volume of our basic food requirements, including rice. This  would mean that Indonesia should increase its exports so that  more than adequate foreign exchange will be available for  importing food. Indonesia's textile production industries  should make relative preparations to clothe a population of  258.1 million people. The industries should have appropriate  manpower to satisfy the people's ever-changing demands.  Therefore, there will definitely be an increase in the import  of raw materials such as cotton.    Meanwhile, there will also be an increase in the need for  construction materials to build houses. Relevant services and  precise estimates will be needed to eliminate every obstacle in  the effort to provide housing facilities to people -- regardless  of which group they belong to. It was felt that, apart from the  market economy mechanism, other sectors should also participate  in the construction of houses if we wish to see the lower groups  possess their own houses. To sum up, the task of ensuring the  adequacy of food, clothing, and accomodation for the total  population is a mammoth one even though such efforts were to be  carried out in stages.    The average economic growth for the oncoming 25 years has  been targeted at an annual rate of 7 percent. This is only a  slight increase of 0.2 percent if compared to that of the First  25-Year Long-Term Development Plan.    It may be asked why the economic growth rate should not be  at  8 or 9 percent. Why shouldn't the growth rate be similar to  that of Malaysia, Thailand, or South Korea? Probably the  problem can be traced to the issue of Indonesia's population,  which now registers at 189.1 million and which could possibly  rise to 258.1 million by the year 2019. But an opportunity and  possibility exist for Indonesia's economic growth to attain a  higher rate after the Sixth Development Program -- an annual  average growth rate of more than 7 percent during the 25-Year  Long-Term Development Plan.    There is one more issue we would like to raise. An economics  expert, Dr. Irwan Jaya Azis, stated that the government's  investment contributions in the 1994-95 budget only represents  26.8 percent of overall national investments. As such, its  impact on economic growth is less than that of the 1970's. In  other words, the attaintment of better economic growth lies in  the hands of the business sector through their various economic  and business activities. These activities have no connection  whatsoever with government funds.    During the upcoming 25-year period, the role of the business  sector will be heavier regarding the development of economic  growth. That was why the government, in its clarification at  the Information Department last Wednesday, stressed the need for  the business sector to conduct its business and economic  activities smoothly. As such, the government emphasized its  commitment to more deregulation and debureaucratization,  continuously eliminating protectionism, and upgrading  Indonesia's efficiency and competitiveness in the economic field.    We truly acknowledge that it will be a very demanding task  to  try to achieve all these objectives. The government, as an  institution, will definitely and undoubtedly face obstacles from  the business circle and the community. However, we are  confident of one thing. Only one way remains in trying to  achieve an annual overall 7 percent economic growth and the per  capita income of U.S.$2,631 during the upcoming 25-year period  by the year 2019. Our aspiration to achieve these goals will  definitely disappear if obstacles that remain in our paths are  not removed.</p>

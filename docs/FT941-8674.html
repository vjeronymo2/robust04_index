			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Observer: Correlational correctness Some interest rate-watchers swear by the money supply figures; others watch the exchange rate. But Midland Bank's Alison Cottrell, 29, who has lived far too long in Roger Bootle's shadow, prefers to check the calendar of international events. Yesterday's cut in the Bundesbank discount rate suggests she may be on to something. Cottrell has been counting the number of times that the Bundesbank fiddles with its interest rates just before a big economic happening. 'It's like sun spots. You know they don't mean anything but they sometimes work,' says Cottrell. When she heard that the next G7 finance ministers' meeting was to be in Frankfurt on February 26, she let everyone know she smelt an interest rate cut. What next? Cottrell has put red rings round the Bundesbank meetings on April 28, a few days after the IMF's spring bash in Washington, and May 26, a few days before the OECD's annual jamboree. 'Correlation is not causation, but who cares?' says Cottrell. Sound thinking.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paul Mba Abessole, the Gabonese opposition leader,  broke his long silence this morning. He has been in Paris since  9 March and it is in Paris that he has given a news conference.  As you know, Gabonese Prime Minister Casimir Oye-Mba is  currently trying to form a national unity government. Monique  Mas asked Father Paul Mba Abessole if he or his friends are  ready to participate. His answer was clear, to say the least:    [Begin recording] [Abessole] No, no, and no. Mr. Bongo is  holding out a hand but he has no hand. Mr. Bongo is the head of  state by force. We don't expect anything from the government  that will be formed. We mobilize people to explain to them what  democracy means. We explain to them respect for human rights.  We are no longer bothered by what Mr. Bongo and his armed gang  are doing with the government. We are no longer interested.  All this is in the past, as far as we are concerned; we will  continue our work and take the risk. We will not back off.    [Mas] What are your next political steps?    [Abessole] The steps will be determined by the people. I  have said that the people will soon feel hungry. How do you  think hungry people can be restrained? They cannot. [end  recording]    During his news conference, Father Mba Abessole said he is  basically turning toward France. Monique Mas asked why he made  such a statement.    [Begin Abessole recording] I had to say it this time because  when the French mercenaries attacked my home, I started to doubt  the idea that France was my friend; some people said look what  your friends are doing to you. I said these people are  individuals, they are not my friends. This does not mean that I  would do anything to harm France or that I would accept that  France does anything to harm me. We are just, correct, and  fair. I am not asking France to help the opposition. France  can help Gabon, particularly during its current impasse. The  future of Gabon -- France should understand and I think it has  already understood this -- resides with those who are fighting  to attain power. [end recording]    Father Mba Abessole stressed that he has not taken refuge in  France and that he will return to Gabon when he wishes to do so,  despite the arrest warrant issued against him by the Libreville  authorities.</p>

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Man in the News: Champion of the black stuff - Richard Budge I'm as fit as a flea' is the response people usually get when they ask Richard Budge how he is. It is supposed to make them smile. The image could hardly be less appropriate for this burly man, with the big voice and the hard hat. But Budge could have taught fleas a thing or two about leaping this week. Selected by the government as the preferred bidder for the bulk of British Coal's assets, he is about to become Britain's biggest coalminer once privatisation goes through. His company, RJB Mining, is front-runner to buy almost all the remaining coalmines in England and north Wales and contracts to supply 29m tonnes of coal to the electricity generators. The decision by Michael Heseltine, trade secretary, to award such a large chunk of the business to one company was both surprising and controversial. He ignored advice that he might be creating a new coal monopoly, and he left worthy bidders such as the Union of Democratic Mineworkers muttering bitterly about ingratitude. But Budge finds it neither surprising nor controversial. For nearly two years, since British Coal was hacked into shape for privatisation, he has been planning in his Nottinghamshire headquarters to buy as much of the state-owned company as he could. He bid for more of it than anyone else, and he bid a much higher price. Unlike coal's many doubters, he saw a future for the black stuff. Budge, 47, has always made a point of thinking independently, and thinking big. He is also a man for risks: at an earlier stage in his life he was an amateur racing driver, a pastime which he says 'is good for your mental attitude', though he admits that these days he prefers fly fishing for relaxation. He cut his business teeth in his brother Tony's construction company, AF Budge, which he led into opencast mining as an extension of its earth-moving operations 20 years ago. The early years were as a contractor for British Coal. In 1982, when the rules on coalmining were relaxed, AF Budge went into the business direct as a licensed operator, and in 1990 bought its first underground mine. By then AF Budge was suffering from the recession and some ill-advised diversification ventures into armoured cars and horses. But the company's pressing need for cash opened the way for Richard to mount a management buy-out of the profitable coal operations and set up on his own in 1992. A year later, he floated RJB Mining on the stock exchange with a value of Pounds 100m. His 10 per cent share transformed him overnight into a multimillionaire on a salary of Pounds 225,000. At flotation, RJB Mining was already one of the largest private mining operations in the UK, with 11 opencast mines and a turnover of some Pounds 60m. It had got there through Budge's policy of running a highly efficient, cost-controlled business which undercut the hugely overmanned operations of British Coal. ('I've worked with them for 20 years. I know them inside out.') He imported giant 170 ton Caterpillar dump trucks - the largest operating in the UK - and made full use of new technology and mining practices developed in countries with larger mining sectors than the UK. Budge could not compete head on with British Coal, because its monopoly was protected by a law that limited private operators to 150 miners per pit. But this sharpened the incentive to drive up the productivity of the workforce and take advantage of the artificially high price at which coal was traded in the UK to subsidise British Coal. As an example, Budge cites the Blenkinsopp colliery in Cumbria which he bought in 1990. At the time, the colliery was producing 50,000 tonnes a year. Within a year, Budge had raised this to 85,000 tonnes, and this year expects it to produce 300,000 tonnes. Over the same period the workforce increased from 75 to just under 100. One reason for this growth is that Budge has never allowed the trade unions to fix their iron grip on his business. He recognises both the National Union of Mineworkers and the breakaway UDM, but also the right not to belong to a union. There is no collective bargaining or productivity bonuses, and all miners are on individual contracts. However, the impressive productivity performance has earned Budge a reputation as a tough, even ruthless operator along the lines of the Victorian industrial barons. 'If they say that, I'm honoured,' he said yesterday. 'But I hope that they add that I'm fair. You have to have leadership, but I'm also a team player. This is a teamwork business.' All his 2,000 employees will be sent a letter from him thanking them for helping the company achieve this week's success. The question now is whether he can make it all work. His bid of Pounds 900m is many times the value of his company, even after the 40 per cent rise in its shares since flotation. He will be able to raise more money from shareholders, but he will also have to turn to the banks for a large chunk of the money, leaving him highly geared. Unsuccessful bidders say that Budge overbid for British Coal, implying that his financial judgment may be flawed. But he has one of the top City investment banks, BZW, part of the Barclays group, advising him. His plans survived vetting for the government by merchant bankers at NM Rothschild. He will also have to find a market for his output at a time when coal seems to be going out of fashion in power generation. The growth of gas-fired plant and environmental pressures on coal all contributed to the decline of British Coal, which in its last year of existence will produce about 50m tonnes, a quarter of the level in its heyday. If the acquisition goes through, Budge will be producing between 42m and 45m tonnes a year with a workforce of about 9,000 people. Budge believes the decline has been overdone. British Coal has cut back too much and pushed its production below the likely level of demand for the rest of the decade, opening a gap for new suppliers and imports. 'They got the business into an undersupply,' he says. 'The electricity generators are going to need at least 45m a year up to the end of this century, possibly 52m. There's a lot to go for.'</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Tatarstan's Supreme Soviet Chairman Farid </F> Mukhametshin, by INTERFAX correspondent Guzel Fazullina,  especially for IZVESTIYA TATARSTANA; place and date not given:  "We Have a Responsibility to the People"]    [Text] The more time passes since the signing of the  treaty between the Russian Federation and the Republic of  Tatarstan, the more obvious it becomes that our republic has  entered a principally new period in its sociopolitical and  socioeconomic development, and that from now on many issues on  which there had been no clarity will have to be decided not by  someone else but by Tatarstan authorities.    Overall, the problems of implementation of the treaty  between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan  constituted the bulk of the discussions at the latest, the 19th,  session of the Republic of Tatarstan's Supreme Soviet, where the  1994 budget was discussed. Today in an interview to an INTERFAX  correspondent, Tatarstan's Supreme Soviet Chairman Farid  Mukhametshin gives his appraisal of the session's results and  his vision of the ways of leading the republic economy out of  the crisis.    This interview continues a series of IZVESTIYA  TATARSTANA materials on the subject that is extremely important  for Tatarstan's future.    [Fazullina] In your opinion, has the Tatarstan Government  been able to make use of the situation in the republic--which  over the past two years had been more favorable than in Russia  as a whole--to implement economic reforms?    [Mukhametshin] It has been able to provide social protection  for the population, which is important. Nevertheless, since it  was not burdened with large payments into the Russian budget  last year and had more favorable terms with respect to oil  exports, it could and it should have used this situation to  begin transformations at the same time in the economy, to create  a favorable environment for the development of small- and  medium-size business. Unfortunately, the government has been  concerned not so much with new sources of budget revenue as with  the optimum distribution of existing income, which in the  current conditions quite logically kept shrinking.    At the latest session, the budget was subjected to just  criticism. The analysis of parts of its revenues and  expenditures shows that the government has a conservative  approach to the economy.    [Fazullina] In this case, will Tatarstan be able--without  its  own economic program and still traditionally increasing the tax  pressure on insolvent enterprises and citizens who are certainly  not getting richer--to collect the expected budget revenue,  especially considering that the Republic of Tatarstan's Supreme  Soviet decreased the revenue part at the 19th session?    [Mukhametshin] The parliament approved the budget on  condition that the government will develop within a month a  program of anticrisis measures. Considering that at this point  only R400 million rubles had been received into the budget, can  we really expect that R3 trillion will be collected by the end  of the year? Hardly. Therefore, today the main task for the  government is to identify priority sectors and enterprises,  which will be given tax preferences; develop an effective credit  policy and a program of reduction of mutual nonpayments--today  they have reached R2 trillion--coordinated with the federation  government.    [Fazullina] If these tasks have not been resolved in two  years, where is the guarantee that the Cabinet of Ministers will  find a way out of the crisis situation in one month?    [Mukhametshin] We believe that a month is enough. A program  of anticrisis measures will be designed to utilize both the  republic's internal reserves--which undoubtedly exist--and the  external ones. Many enterprises today have programs ready, and  some of them already are being implemented. They only need  support, and by the end of the year they will be able to  stabilize their financial situation. It is necessary to put into  effect the law "On Bankruptcy," and get the antitrust committee  to work.    Being in the same economic space as Russia, we are also  looking at the second part of this program--conducting a  coordinated policy with the federal authorities, opening  centralized credit lines for the agro-industrial complex,  financing federal programs, and so on. The treaty we signed with  the Russian Government allows the National Bank of Tatarstan to  keep flexible interest rates, and we will use this ability as  well.    We have to keep in mind, however, that Russia has the same  problem as we do. We intend to participate most actively in  joint actions, in the development of federal programs. It is  possible that the government will bring in outside economists to  work on the economic development of Tatarstan; we are already in  the process of negotiations. It is too early, however, to  mention any names.    [Fazullina] There were no hints at the session at having  your  own regional policy. Moreover, the prime minister said that  Tatarstan will follow the line of Russian policy...    [Mukhametshin] A completely independent economic policy is  hardly possible today. We cannot say, however, that Tatarstan  will simply go with the flow of the Russian reforms. Specific  features will definitely be taken into account, and relevant  adjustments made.    [Fazullina] In your opinion, is Tatarstan in a state of  government crisis? Do you not believe that the Cabinet of  Ministers should resign, making room for reformers?    [Mukhametshin] It is too early to speak of the government's  resignation. Everything will depend on the program they propose  take the republic out of economic crisis.    [Fazullina] Have the arguments or debates on the subject of  the budget at the latest session been natural, or is it a  manifestation of disagreements between the parliament and the  government?    [Mukhametshin] The budget is always lobbied by certain  groups--industry, agriculture, the budget-financed sphere.  Adopting it is working out a compromise. In the course of budget  discussions, I did not detect a desire on the part of deputies  to raise the issue of replacing some members of the government  or the entire cabinet. Although in some remarks its ability to  implement radical transformation was indeed questioned.    [Fazullina] Do you not believe that over the past two years  Tatarstan's leadership has been more concerned with resolving  political issues--both external and internal--than the problems  of working out economic strategy? Both targeted social  protection and support for the agro-industrial complex represent  to a great extent programs of survival, softening the shock. Do  they have a future or will it be necessary to fold them?    [Mukhametshin] Yes, a lot of money has gone into preserving  stability in the republic. We believed that this was necessary;  otherwise the population would have rejected reforms. Now a new  stage has began, and we have to protect the rights we have been  granted and prove the vitality of sovereignty. After the signing  of a treaty between the Russian Federation and the Republic of  Tatarstan, the responsibility for reforms rests solely with  local the leadership.</p>

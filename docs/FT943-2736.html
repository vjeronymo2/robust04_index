			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / UK Company News: US advance helps Keller to Pounds 3.01m Keller, the international ground engineering company, reported a 40 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 after strong sales in North America. Profits rose from Pounds 2.15m to Pounds 3.01m in its first results since flotation in April, when shares were priced at 130p giving a market capitalisation of Pounds 72.8m. Yesterday the shares closed up 3p at 129p. Turnover was Pounds 89.1m (Pounds 69.5m), including Pounds 10.5m from acquisitions, and operating profit rose 28 per cent to Pounds 3.64m (Pounds 2.83m) after a Pounds 400,000 contribution from Case International, the Chicago-based foundation engineer acquired in January. Mr Michael West, chief executive, said: 'Our order books at the half-year were well ahead of the same time last year, and that stronger order book was still in place at the end of August.' In North America sales increased from Pounds 13.3m to Pounds 28m, helped by the Case purchase, for profits of Pounds 1.33m, compared with Pounds 789,000. In Germany trading volumes remained high although the group, a former engineering offshoot of GKN, warned of tightening margins in western Germany where market conditions were increasingly competitive. Continental Europe contributed profits of Pounds 1.75m (Pounds 1.79m) on turnover of Pounds 47.2m (Pounds 43.5m). UK turnover was Pounds 13.9m (Pounds 12.7m) and profits more than trebled to Pounds 345,000 (Pounds 101,000), reflecting improved trading conditions and the start of infrastructure projects on the Jubilee underground line and Heathrow Airport rail link. Group net interest costs fell to Pounds 631,000 (Pounds 689,000). Net borrowings at the period end were Pounds 4.4m for gearing which would reduced to 14 per cent. An interim foreign income dividend of 0.5p is being paid from earnings per share up at 4.5p (2.4p).</p>

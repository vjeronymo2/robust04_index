			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Nigeria's debt arrears pass Dollars 5bn Arrears on Nigeria's Dollars 30bn (Pounds 20.4bn) external debt exceed Dollars 5bn, presenting the country with its most serious economic crisis since independence, say local economists and western creditors. Without a rescheduling agreement, arrears will rise, external support from donors such as the World Bank will be suspended, industry will continue to function well below capacity, and the country's economic decline will continue. Prospects for an economic policy agreement with the International Monetary Fund receded following last week's removal from office of Chief Ernest Shonekan, and the assumption of power by General Sani Abacha. An IMF deal is an essential condition to debt rescheduling. Agreement is now unlikely much within a year, say creditors. In 1992 Nigeria serviced only Dollars 167m of its bilateral debt obligations, having averaged around Dollars 1.3bn a year in 1990 and 1991. But by the end of 1992 its arrears in bilateral interest alone were Dollars 1bn, with interest and principal arrears reaching around Dollars 3bn. In March 1993 the former finance minister, Mr Oladele Olashore, was summoned to Paris for an explanation. The position has continued to decline. In 1993, Nigeria's bilateral creditors were owed Dollars 2.4bn in loan principal and interest payments, nearly all of it to the Paris Club of official creditors. But by the end of August less than Dollars 100m had been paid, say western officials. They calculate that total external debt arrears have now reached Dollars 5bn. Priority for external debt service goes to the World Bank, but Nigeria narrowly avoided Bank suspension in early November when it paid Dollars 140m, or three months' debt service, almost two months in arrears. If a member country is 60 days late in paying, the World Bank automatically suspends all its loan operations. The Bank's loan portfolio is worth a total of Dollars 5.8bn, of which nearly Dollars 2.3bn is yet to be disbursed. Nigeria's net capital flows with the World Bank have been negative for the last three years, averaging Dollars 247m a year. According to the World Bank, its disbursements to Nigeria are slow because of bureaucratic and legal bottlenecks, lack of counterpart funds, inefficient procurement and design flaws in some projects. Economists say Nigeria has run up arrears in debt service to the other main multilateral creditor, the African Development Bank. The other priorities for debt service are its par bonds and promissory notes, which are being honoured, and supplier credits. The dollar value of Nigeria's debt has grown by about 50 per cent since the launch in 1986 of a structural adjustment programme, since lapsed. At the end of last year it stood at nearly Dollars 30bn, equivalent to 113 per cent of GDP. Nigeria's new military rulers named a Provisional Ruling Council. Gen Abacha is chairman and defence minister. Baba Gana Kingibe, running mate of thwarted presidential candidate Moshood Abiola, is foreign minister. Apart from justice and foreign ministers, the only civilian council member will be Mr Alex Ibru, publisher of the Lagos Guardian newspaper, who is named interior minister.

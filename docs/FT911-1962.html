			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (21): Return of the landed aristocracy - Profile: Count Jan Zamoyski COUNT JAN ZAMOYSKI, nearing 80, is the very model of a Polish gentleman. He slips easily into English and French and feels just a little satisfaction at having managed to outlive the communists to see the promise of better times. His father, Maurycy, was Poland's largest landowner in 1918 when the country regained its independence and he helped pay the largest part of the bills for Poland's delegation at the Versailles Peace Conference which established a shortlived post-war European order. When the count inherited the family estate in 1937 it amounted to 61,000 hectares and 10 industrial plants including a brewery and a furniture factory. Now he is a leading light of the Polish Society of Industrialists which, along with its fraternal Landowners' Association, is seeking to have property confiscated by the communists restored or compensation paid at the very least.' I'm not too interested in the farming part,' he admits, tacitly recognising that any move to return the land given to the peasants by the communists in 1944 and 1945 would be enormously unpopular. 'However, when I go into the forests we once had I still think of the trees as being my own,' he says, his kind smile free of any rancour. As to the prospect of having his family's businesses returned, he's a 'restrained optimist'. And societies like his continue to attract support, including that of President Lech Walesa, on the grounds that past wrongs should be righted. Indeed, the government recently decided after much soul-searching that the budget really could not afford any full-scale restoration of property and what compensation there would be, would be in the form of vouchers exchangeable for shares in soon-to-be-privatised state sector companies. 'I don't want the children to say that I didn't try,' Count Zamoyski says of his efforts, which if successful would turn him once more into a wealthy man. It would be a far cry from the two rooms the seven members of his family occupied in 1958 when he was released from prison after serving almost eight years on a trumped up spying charge. During the war, the Germans had allowed him to administer his estate and all the while he had been an active member of the underground. Before his arrest by the communists he worked for a western shipping line and after his release for Swissair in Warsaw. He decided against emigration, making a conscious decision to live at home rather than abroad. 'I'm tied to this land,' he says. It's a stance which is in line with the family's political tradition which this century favoured the National Democrats (ND), a pre-war nationalist right-wing party. Indeed, Count Zamoyski is now actively trying to unite various disparate small political groups in the ND tradition and recently became the chairman of a renascent National Democrat party which he hopes will act as a nucleus for a larger movement. He also always took an active interest in and sought funds for the restoration of Zamosc founded in 1580 by his namesake, who laid the foundations of family's fortune in the 16th century. Zamosc, in eastern Poland, is a rare example of renaissance town planning and its present mayor, Marcin Zamoyski, is the successor to the family title. He is there because after the local elections in the spring of last year the citizens asked the count to be their mayor. He suggested his son and they accepted. 'I don't know how long he will be able to hold on to the job as the honeymoon between the council and the mayor lasted two weeks,' he says. Indeed, Marcin Zamoyski's trials in Zamosc are typical of Poland's first encounter with local democracy. A fractious council is at odds with the official it appointed in the first place, while a local clique with its roots in the communist past is seeking to corrupt the new establishment. For the moment, though, Count Zamoyski argues that the return of plant such as the Zamosc furniture factory would be the simplest way of restoring it to sound management. He has been in touch with IKEA, the Swedish furniture group, on possible joint projects and he has plans for 'his' local brewery, too. But in the materialistic era that Poland has now embraced the count points out that the aristocracy which he represents does have another role to play. 'We can show that there are cultural values, beside the mere material ones,' he says.</p>

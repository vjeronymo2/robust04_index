			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JURUPA VALLEY BECOMES CENTURY'S FIRST VICTIM  </P> <P> The Century High School football team got its first varsity victory by  defeating Jurupa Valley, 23-6, here Thursday night.  </P> <P> The victory was only fitting because Jurupa Valley, like Century, is another  school in its first season of varsity football.  </P> <P> Karlo Balderrama gave Century a first-quarter lead when he scored on a  five-yard run. Stacy de la Motte caught a pass from Henry Ruvalcava to give  Century (1-3) an 8-0 lead that it never relinquished.  </P></p>

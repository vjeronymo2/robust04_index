			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GROWING FIRM SEEKS CAPITAL FOR MARKETING;  </P> <P> EXPANSION: CHILDREN'S TOILETRIES MAKER WILLIAM &amp; CLARISSA INC. OF LAGUNA  HILLS HAS HIRED AN INVESTMENT BANKER TO HELP FIND MONEY TO EXPAND ITS PROMOTION  AND SALES EFFORT.  </P> <P> William &amp; Clarissa Inc., a fledgling maker of children's toiletries, said  Thursday that it has hired an investment banker to raise additional capital to  support its growing marketing efforts.  </P> <P> The company, which sells a full line of children's products -- from tear-free  shampoo to cologne -- under the Kids William &amp; Clarissa label, said it had  hired The First Boston Corp. to explore ways to raise the needed cash. The  alternatives include "seeking a corporate partner or private placement to  institutional investors," the company said.  </P> <P> Within the past year, the company has grown rapidly and its products are now  being sold in more than 16,000 supermarkets, drugstores and other retail  outlets. With the bulk of the distribution effort finished, President Mary  George said the company now needs to promote the line more.  </P> <P> The company has advertised in parenting magazines, she said, but wants to  expand with more full ad campaigns in some areas. She said the company hopes to  raise $5 million to $10 million within the next four months to support a  campaign that would include television advertising.  </P> <P> "We are doing an advertising test in a few markets," she said. "We need  additional capital to build on the momentum."  </P> <P> The company said that First Boston will act as financial adviser in an effort  to maximize shareholder value. William &amp; Clarissa's stock closed Thursday  at 75 cents, down 25 cents in trading on the over-the-counter market.  </P> <P> A San Francisco area businessman founded the company several years ago, naming  it after his own two children. The firm sold its products to department stores.  When George and her management team moved to the company last year, they  decided to move into the mass market as well.  </P> <P> The company raised $5.7 million and developed a line that appealed to parents  as well as children. The products are hypoallergenic, contain no animal  ingredients and are not tested on animals. Research showed that many parents  wanted higher quality for their children, and that children want their own  distinct products.  </P> <P> The Kids William &amp; Clarissa line consists of 16 personal care products,  including shampoo, liquid soap, cornstarch powder, bubble bath, sun block, lip  balm and cologne. George said that the tear-free shampoo has been the biggest  seller.  </P></p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: CIS copper smelters come to aid of western miners THE SEVERE shortage of copper-smelting capacity, which has helped to bolster the copper price in spite of the world recession, is being relieved by smelters in Russia and Kazakhstan. The Commodities Research Unit consultancy group estimates that at least 75,000 tonnes of fully-refined cathode copper and semi-refined blister copper will be delivered back to the west this year from the Commonwealth of Independent States. For a fee, smelters in the CIS have been treating copper concentrates (intermediate material) supplied by mines in the west, where the lack of smelter capacity has pushed treatment charges to record levels for those miners that have no long-term contracts with smelting companies. Two trading houses - Marc Rich, based in Zug, Switzerland, and Euromin, which has offices in Stockholm and Moscow - have been having concentrates toll-smelted in the CIS, where smelters in the Urals and Kazakhstan not only have excess capacity but are also eager to earn foreign currency. Mr Christopher Stobart, the CRU's CIS expert, suggests that only companies that know the region well can organise the process. Concentrates must travel huge distances at a time when much of the CIS transport system is in chaos; metal recovery from the concentrates is not as high as in western smelters; and getting the copper back to the west without having some stolen can be difficult. Nevertheless, western smelter charges for treating concentrates, which once ranged between 10 cents and 20 cents a lb, have jumped to 35 cents and this justifies the risk of the CIS option. The CRU suggests that toll-smelting in the CIS has effectively relieved the acute smelter bottleneck in western countries and should keep the price of refined copper below Dollars 1.20 a lb. It suggests that concentrate treatment charges in the west are likely to range between 15 cents and 32 cents a lb from now on but that is not high enough to encourage new smelter projects. Therefore the smelter tightness, in a less acute form, is likely to continue for some years.</p>

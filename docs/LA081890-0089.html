			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> U.S., SOVIET UNION AGREE TO EXPAND LEGAL COOPERATION  </P> <P> The United States and the Soviet Union agreed Friday to expand their  cooperation on legal affairs issues ranging from consumer protection to civil  rights.  </P> <P> After a week of talks on the legal systems of the two superpowers, Atty. Gen.  Dick Thornburgh and Soviet Justice Minister Veniamin F. Yakovlev broadened the  cooperation agreement reached in Moscow last October.  </P> <P> "This is a historic event," said Yakovlev. "This has started a process of  cooperation that will continue."  </P> <P> The two officials agreed to continue regular exchanges of information, which  will be expanded to include consumer protection, civil cases, civil rights and  federalism -- the system under which power is divided by a constitution between  central and local governments.  </P> <P> The two also agreed to study a possible mutual legal assistance treaty and to  consult on judicial and prison issues.  </P> <P> Thornburgh said the meetings achieved a major step forward.  </P> <P> "It is extremely important (that we) stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our Soviet  counterparts on the rule of law and human rights," he said.  </P></p>

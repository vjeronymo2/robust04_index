Wisconsin won the race in 5 minutes, 52.5 seconds, defending  national champion Harvard was second in 5:56.84 and UCLA third in 5:56.87.  </P> <P> Kelly Salonites, the UCLA women's crew coach, was named Pacific 10 Conference  coach of the year for the second consecutive year. Her varsity eight, which won  the Pacific Coast Championship this year, finished fourth at the women's  nationals on June 4 in Madison, Wis.  </P> <P> Zenon Babraj, the UCLA men's crew coach for the past four years and a  three-time Pac-10 coach of the year after winning three consecutive Pacific  Coast titles, said that finishing third at Cincinnati was significant. In three  previous nationals under Babraj, the Bruins were fourth once and sixth twice.  </P> <P> "We broke through the wall at nationals this year and it was a great experience  for this team," he said.  </P> <P> "We are a young team and have everyone back from this year's boat except for  one rower (senior Stefanos Volianitis of Greece). Next year we could be one of  the favorites to win the national title."  </P> <P> UCLA women named to the All-Pac-10 team were Leilani Johnson, Kim Cromer,  Leslie Lewis and Cathie Heacox. Bruin men on the all-conference squad were Greg  LeSage, Brad Marquardt and Volianitis.  </P> <P> UCLA gymnasts Chris Waller, Chainey Umphrey and Scott Keswick have been named  to the U.S. national team for the second consecutive year as a result of their  performances at the U.S. Gymnastic Federation Championships in Denver.  </P> <P> Waller, who finished second in all-around competition to John Roethlisberger of  the University of Minnesota at the federation meet, also was named to the U.S  team for the Goodwill Games, which will be held July 2-Aug. 5 in Seattle. Yefim  Furman, the UCLA assistant men's coach, will be an assistant at the Goodwill  Games.  </P> <P> Waller is a senior.

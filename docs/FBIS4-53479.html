			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 18, (YONHAP) -- Argentine Economic  Minister Domingo Cavallo, saying that the business climate in  his country is favorable, urged South Korean businessmen to  invest in Argentina.    "Now is a good time for Korean business enterprises to  invest  in Argentina," Cavallo told a press conference held Tuesday at  Hyatt Hotel in Seoul.    Argentina's economy is opening up speedily with 90 percent  of  state-run companies having been privatized, he said, adding: "In  particular, we welcome Korean investment in automobile and  electronics sectors."    Earlier in the day, Cavallo and Korean Vice Foreign Minister  Hong Sun-yong signed an investment guarantee agreement. He also  met with leaders of Korean business groups including Hyundai,  Samsung, Daewoo and Lucky-Goldstar and asked them to invest more  in the South American country.</p>

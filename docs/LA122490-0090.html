			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> PLANNERS APPROVE SIGN ORDINANCE  </P> <P> The city's first comprehensive sign ordinance was approved by the Planning  Commission and will be sent to the City Council for final approval next month.  </P> <P> Previously, merchants and city planners had been working from guidelines set by  the county and planned community documents, according to Community Development  Director Clint Sherrod.  </P> <P> "A merchant can now just come to the counter (at City Hall) and see what the  requirements are," all in one document, Sherrod said.  </P> <P> Commissioners approved the ordinance 4 to 0. Commissioner Joseph Lowe was  absent.  </P> <P> The sign law establishes architectural standards, including height and overall  size.  </P> <P> The ordinance was ready to be sent to the council last June but was delayed by  the passage of a state law preventing municipalities from banning real estate  signs, such as those on private property giving directions to an open house.  </P> <P> City planners revised the Mission Viejo ordinance to reflect the state law that  takes effect Jan. 1.

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: A tax cold-shoulder PERSONAL pensions holders face a less friendly tax environment from April 6. But just how much less friendly depends on how old you are, how much you earn, and whether you are male or female. From April, the rebate on National Insurance contributions for those who contract out of the state earnings related pension scheme (SERPS) is to be 4.8 per cent of earnings between the lower and upper earnings limits, down from 5.8 per cent currently available. Moreover, the two per cent additional rebate is to be eliminated and replaced by a one per cent tax rebate only for personal pension holders aged 30 and over. The government has now decided that members of so-called contracted out money purchase schemes, some of which are organised by employers, shall not be eligible for the one per cent additional rebate. The effect of the changes means that those who have contracted out of personal pensions will now find it advantageous to opt back in even earlier than had been planned. And for some young people on low salaries, contracting out is also much less attractive. The difficulty is that there are wide differences of view over when it it is worthwhile to opt back into SERPS. For instance, Legal and General says that those who already have personal pensions can still obtain tax advantages up to the ages of 45 and 40 respectively because they have already paid the up-front costs associated with them. However, Clay and Partners, consulting actuaries, puts the ages at 50 for men and 42 for women. The Department of Social Security became concerned that individuals making personal pension provision should be properly informed about the tax changes. It asked the self-regulatory bodies which oversee those who sell personal pensions to make sure clients were advised properly. Last week, Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life industry, became the first SRO to issue guidance for agents.</p>

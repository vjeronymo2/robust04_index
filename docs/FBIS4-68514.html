			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Zamyatin and Sergey Tsekhmistrenko: </F> "Sarajevo Asks Moscow To Reach Out to Muslims"]    [Text] In any interethnic conflict, it is hard to  find out who is right and who is wrong. Sometimes one even gets  the impression that everybody is right, and the arguments of one  side are just as convincing and well-substantiated as those of  the opposing side. This is not accidental: As a rule, such  conflicts have their root in disputes over possession of  territories, which the conflicting sides may consider their  traditional domain with equal justification (including from the  standpoint of historic rights). A KOMMERSANT-DAILY  correspondents' conversation with Ibrahim Dzikic,  Bosnia-Herzegovina representative in Moscow, is indicative in  this respect.    In Mr. Dzikic's opinion, the war in Bosnia is not of  religious or ethnic nature. What is happening there is a fight  for territories, and a predatory one on the part of Serbs--they  have dismantled and taken out to Serbia the entire industrial  potential from the lands seized from the Muslims. Overall, in  Mr. Dzikic's opinion, Serbia has been the initiator of both  Yugoslavia's disintegration and all the wars on its territory.  Belgrade is set to build a "Great Serbia," which would include  most of former federative lands. Unfortunately, these actions  had the blessing of the Orthodox churches--Russian and Serb.    Today the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia interferes directly  in the Bosnian conflict, sending there tanks, equipment, and  troops from its army's Uzice and Novi Sad corps. Heavy armaments  taken by Serbs from Sarajevo environs was used in the latest  battles near Gorazde. Describing the situation around this city,  Mr. Dzikic emphasized that it shows that Bosnian Serbs do not  want the war to end. The situation in Gorazde got exacerbated  due to Serb aggression. The diplomat characterized all talk of  "Muslim provocations" as Belgrade's conjectures, since the  population of besieged Gorazde consisted mainly of women and  children, who for two years have not had contacts with other  parts of Bosnia. To accuse them now of provocations is madness  that would be tantamount to accusing Leningrad inhabitants of  similar things during the blockade. As to Bosnia's Serb  leaders--Radovan Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic--they should  be regarded as nothing more than war criminals, with whom it is  no longer possible to conduct a constructive dialog. Especially  considering that, in Mr. Dzikic's opinion, they do not represent  the interests of all Bosnian Serbs: Only about 40 percent of  Serbs live in the Serb Republic controlled by them. Most Bosnian  Serbs, however, consider themselves its citizens and cooperate  with the government.    As to Russian role in settling the conflict, in Mr. Dzikic's  words, its position should be "more balanced" with respect to  all republics of former Yugoslavia, including Bosnia. Today  Moscow essentially defends great-power claims on the part of  Serbs (although far from all Serbs share such ideas). Russia  also is against lifting the embargo on arms shipments to the  Bosnian army, but without it, in Mr. Dzikic's opinion, it is  impossible to defend the state against aggression. At the same  time, Sarajevo supports Moscow in that Bosnian borders cannot be  changed through violence. Looking at the overall level of  inter-state relations, however, much remains to be done. A good  beginning, in the opinion of Bosnia's representative, would be  to establish diplomatic relations. So far Russia is in no hurry  to proceed with this, although it has recognized Bosnia a year  ago.</p>

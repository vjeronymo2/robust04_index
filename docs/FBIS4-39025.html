			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Zamyatin article: "North Korea Nuclear Weapons </F> Problem. Washington Ready To Impose Sanctions, Pyongyang Ready  To Start War"]    [Excerpts] Although Boris Yeltsin did state at the meeting  with his South Korean counterpart Kim Yong-sam that it is still  early to speak of sanctions against the DPRK, yesterday's  developments indicate otherwise. It is believed in Washington,  Tokyo, and Seoul, as well as in the IAEA that sanctions are  already a must -- so far has Pyongyang gone in its stubbornness.  [passage omitted]    The IAEA proposes to the UN Security Council that political  pressure be brought to bear on Pyongyang, and if those do not  work, sanctions should be applied. The need for raising the  question of sanctions against the DPRK in the UN Security  Council was also discussed by Bill Clinton, who is in Italy,  should the conclusions drawn by IAEA chief Blix be confirmed.  In his words, the United States would press for sanctions even  if Pyongyang regards this an "act of a declaration of war."  [passage omitted]    Not all UN Security Council permanent members, however,  agree  with Washington's arguments. Expressing their concern over the  North Korea nuclear weapons problem, Moscow and Beijing prefer a  more cautious position. Today Russia explains it by possible  economic losses, pointing to the Iraq, Libya, and Yugoslavia  precedents. Nevertheless it is still unclear how the Russian  representative is going to act in a possible vote in the  Security Council. More likely than not, China would as always  abstain. According to a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement,  Beijing would not like the use of measures that could worsen the  situation.    Pyongyang, meanwhile, is absolutely obviously preparing for  war -- according to the statement of a North Korean politician,  "sanctions, without a doubt, would lead to destructive  consequences in Asia and the rest of the world, let alone the  Korean Peninsula." According to CNN information, the DPRK  flight-tested two rockets that can carry nuclear warheads.  Shilly-shallying by the international community may entail  unpredictable consequences.</p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / People: Richard Farrant to head SFA The Securities and Futures Authority, the self-regulatory organisation for the professional securities business, is replacing John Young, who has moved on to become chief executive of the Securities &amp; Investments Board, with Bank of England veteran Richard Farrant. Farrant, 49, who has been at the Bank since 1967, is currently one of the four deputy heads of banking supervision, with specific responsibility for supervisory policy. He has therefore had no recent line-management responsibilities for the likes of BCCI, and is not named in the Bingham report which criticised the Bank of England's supervisory role in the collapse of the corrupt international bank. Christopher Sharples, chairman of the SFA, points out that Farrant is 'very knowledgeable' on the international aspects of the SFA's business. In addition to his familiarity with Brussels and the formulation of EC directives, he is one of the two UK members of the Basle Supervisors Committee, and has chaired its off balance sheet group since 1991. He has also had spells abroad, notably with the IMF in Washington and in Hong Kong. Between 1984 and 1986, he served as adviser to the Hong Kong Banking Commissioner, handling a succession of crises in local banks as well as working on the revision of the centre's bank supervision law. A keen cyclist, pedalling from Paddington to the Bank every morning, Farrant is already familiar with the SFA's style having worked with its capital committee. He claims to be impressed by the 'close practitioner involvement' in the SFA's approach to regulation. Young, a former deputy senior partner of Simon &amp; Coates before he moved to the Stock Exchange, was there when TSA, the securities regulator which later merged with the futures regulatory body, was set up, and is credited with helping to set the tone for an informal and practical approach to regulation. 'The SFA has been good and diligent, and possibly lucky, in not having an accident on its doorstep,' comments one well-placed source. While there are few Bank of England alumni in senior positions at the SROs, the SFA's head of enforcement, Andrew Jennings, spent ten years at the Old Lady.</p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: BANKING / FINANCE;  </P> <P> ANAHEIM BANKER ASSAILS PROPOSED LAW ON MONEY LAUNDERING  </P> <P> Anaheim banker L. Don Sargent joined other bankers at a U.S. Senate hearing  Wednesday in denouncing pending legislation that would force bankers in certain  areas, including Southern California, to adhere to stricter guidelines for  reporting suspected money laundering.  </P> <P> Sargent, president and chief executive of American Commerce National Bank, told  a subcommittee of the Senate Banking Committee that current money-laundering  rules strike a "crushing blow to a small bank attempting to serve its customers  in an efficient manner while maintaining an acceptable level of profit."  </P> <P> The Bank Secrecy Act's money-laundering provisions, aimed at ferreting out  suspected drug and organized crime figures, require banks to report to the U.S.  Treasury any daily cash deposits or withdrawals of $10,000 or more by  individuals.  </P> <P> The pending bill would require bankers in certain areas -- those where federal  investigators say organized crime groups concentrate operations -- to report  transactions of $5,000 or more and to report "suspicious" transactions of any  amount.  </P> <P> Each report takes 18 to 26 minutes to fill out and review, Sargent said in  prepared remarks. He said his bank expects to file 1,500 such reports by the  end of the year, requiring a minimum of 450 hours of work, and many small banks  file two or three times more reports.  </P> <P> Of 5,300 reports filed over the past two years by Sargent's former employer,  Mechanics Bank in Paramount, only two cases appeared particularly suspicious,  he said, and federal agents "took little action," failing even to ask for  information.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, our experience in the Los Angeles Basin tends to suggest that  even though banks have steadily increased their efforts to comply with the Bank  Secrecy Act, both their regulatory burden and the drug epidemic continue to  spread at an alarming rate."  </P> <P> Back in Orange County, La Habra banker Craig Collette complained that Congress  is trying to make banks responsible for money-laundering activities of others.  "We don't want to be the police force," said Collette, president of Landmark  Bank.  </P> <P> Acquisition OKd: The old Pacific Savings Bank in Costa Mesa came a step closer  Wednesday to becoming part of a super-regional consumer banking firm as  shareholders of a Seattle savings and loan firm agreed to be acquired by  Pacific Savings' new owner, Royal Trustco Ltd. in Toronto.  </P> <P> The $212-million purchase of Pacific First Financial Corp. now needs only  regulatory approval, which Royal Trust executives said they expect to receive  by mid-November.  </P> <P> Pacific Savings, called Pacific First Bank since Royal Trust bought it on Oct.  13 from federal regulators, will then be merged into Pacific First Financial.  But that's mainly a legal procedure.  </P> <P> Employees and customers of the Costa Mesa institution may never know exactly  when that merger will occur, said Jerry E. Pohlman, Pacific First Financial's  president and chief executive, because the Seattle firm already is managing the  S&amp;L and is beginning to offer Southern California customers the same  products that its savings associations offer in Washington and Oregon.  </P> <P> Royal Trust is concentrating on expanding Pacific First operations in  California through internal growth and through acquisitions of other  institutions and branches of other institutions, said Michael A. Cornelissen,  Royal Trust's president and chief executive.  </P> <P> That's good news for regulators, who are strapped with ailing and failing  institutions. Regulators have been looking past U.S. borders to find cash-rich  companies interested in owning a thrift here.  </P> <P> "Our plans to grow to a super-regional consumer bank are there because of the  fragmented nature of the (U.S.) industry today because of the crying need for  capital and because we know there are a large number of smaller franchises that  are for sale," Cornelissen said.  </P> <P> Royal Trust, which tripled its size in about five years without acquiring other  companies, wants to turn the three-state Pacific First operation into a  $20-billion asset bank from its current $7-billion size in the next three or  four years.  </P> <P> "Pacific Savings is not big enough to give us the economies of scale we need,  so we're looking for expansion in Southern California," Pohlman said. But if a  good deal comes along to complement its lone branch office in Walnut Creek, the  company will expand first in Northern California.  </P> <P> "Our greatest opportunity is through acquisition."  </P></p>

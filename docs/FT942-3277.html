			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: Finmeccanica rights issue gets green light Shareholders of Finmeccanica, the Italian state-controlled engineering and defence group, yesterday approved a L1,700bn (Dollars 1.05bn) rights issue, which will reduce the stake owned by Iri, the state holding company, to less than 60 per cent from 85 per cent. Iri is to pay nearly L500bn for its new shares and a further L1,000bn should be subscribed by the creditor banks of Efim, the now defunct state holding company which is transferring its defence interests to Finmeccanica. The banks said their underwriting of the issue was conditional on the completion of the transfer of the seven Efim companies, which include Agusta, the helicopter manufacturer. Finmeccanica said yesterday that the exercise of its option to buy the companies was 'a formality' and should take place on June 20. The deal was agreed by the government three months ago, and means that Finmeccanica will not have to assume the Efim companies' L7,000bn of debts. Although the issue is a form of privatisation, the plan prevents the government losing control of strategic defence manufacturers. Finmeccanica's shares fell L34 to close at L1,942 in Milan yesterday, compared with the issue price of L2,100.</p>

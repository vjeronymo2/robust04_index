The forces  imposed a security cordon around the three areas while other  forces carried out sweeps to arrest fugitive terrorist and  criminal elements.    A police unit manning a highway roadblock arrested one  terrorist and wounded another. Two more escaped. The four  terrorists were riding in a pickup truck. Police fired on the  truck after the four refused to stop at the roadblock.    The sweeps resulted in the arrest of 60 fugitive criminals.  Two criminals were caught redhanded with a load of stolen iron  in their car.</p>

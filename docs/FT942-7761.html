			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Fox builds base in US TV via Dollars 500m New World deal Mr Rupert Murdoch's plan to challenge the supremacy of the big three US television networks took a big step forward yesterday. His Fox television unit announced an alliance with the entertainment group New World Communications that will provide Fox with up to 12 new local television stations across the US. Mr Murdoch trumpeted the deal as the 'greatest realignment of television station affiliations in the 60-year history of American broadcasting'. Fox is investing Dollars 500m (Pounds 333m) in New World in return for a 20-25 per cent stake and an agreement that 12 New World stations will change their affiliations to Fox from ABC, CBS and NBC. Although Fox already has relationships with television stations in the cities where the New World affiliates operate, it said the 12 New World stations all had larger shares of their local markets. Once the deal is completed, Fox will have 184 affiliate stations in the US. ABC, CBS and NBC have more than 200 each. The other networks reacted stoically to the news that Fox had lured 12 of their affiliates into its camp. Mr Robert Wright, president of NBC, admitted that the Fox-New World alliance would 'change the landscape', but Mr Robert Iger, president of ABC Television, said that it was too soon the gauge the implications of the 'significant change' wrought by the deal. The New World deal is the latest move in Mr Rupert Murdoch's battle to build Fox into a nationwide network. When he set up Fox in 1987 with only a handful of affiliate stations, observers doubted whether Fox would seriously challenge established networks. But Fox has expanded rapidly and now claims coverage of 95 per cent of the national television market. Although Fox's ratings share of the national market began to decline in 1992, the network has continued to pursue growth. Last December it outbid two of the three networks to win the rights to broadcast the National Football Conference of American football, the country's most popular televised sport.</p>

			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / International Company News: Renault, Volvo to disband joint purchasing body Renault and Volvo have agreed to dismantle their joint purchasing and quality control organisations in the wake of the collapse of their merger plans, Renault said yesterday. The decision was taken during the past week following discussions with Volvo's new board. It represents one of the most important steps taken by the companies in determining the future of their relationship since the merger agreement collapsed last December in the face of strong opposition from Volvo shareholders. The two bodies, and in particular the joint purchasing organisation, were designed to achieve substantial cost-savings and were central elements of the merger project. Renault said the strategic importance of the purchasing and quality control operations meant they could not be continued without a full merger. Following the failure of the merger, Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault chairman, said co-operation between the two groups could continue, but certain sensitive and strategic activities would need to be reviewed. The companies have suspended work on the P4 project, which was aimed at developing a common platform to replace the Volvo 900 series and the Renault Safrane. Other areas of co-operation, including joint distribution agreements are under review. Co-operation continues in several important areas. Renault will, for example, receive Volvo engines for its Laguna model, due to be introduced shortly, and will supply the Swedish group with engines and gearboxes for its 400 series. The cross-shareholdings between the two groups, which include a 20 per cent holding in Renault SA by AB Volvo and holdings of 25 per cent in Volvo Car and 45 per cent in Volvo Truck by the French group, remain in place. But a decision on whether to maintain the joint investments must be made before Renault's privatisation, which is scheduled for later this year. The purchasing body was established in January last year. The aim was to increase joint procurement from 20 per cent of the estimated FFr85bn (Dollars 14.4bn) of combined total purchases to 80 per cent. The organisation, like the quality control unit, was based jointly in Paris and Gothenburg.</p>

			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN SUES OVER UNITED'S FLIGHT CHANGES  </P> <P> The battle for control of the skies over Chicago's O'Hare International Airport  shifted to federal court Monday, as American Airlines sued archrival United  Airlines over changes in United's October flight schedule.  </P> <P> In its suit, American contends that United has assigned new departure times to  about 140 flights from Chicago, in violation of federal rules. American said  many of the rescheduled United flights would depart several minutes before  American flights, giving United what American considers to be an unfair  competitive advantage.  </P> <P> For example, a United flight to Boston from O'Hare has been rescheduled to  leave at 7:45 p.m., 25 minutes before an American flight at 8:10 p.m.  Currently, the United flight leaves at the same time as the American flight,  American spokesman Tom Stack said.  </P> <P> United said American's suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Ft. Worth, is  without basis.  </P> <P> United said that it has asked the Federal Aviation Administration to approve  its new departure schedule and that the FAA is expected to make a decision  Friday. United changed its schedule in anticipation of the FAA's decision, said  Lawrence M. Nagin, senior vice president and general counsel.  </P> <P> The FAA controls departures at O'Hare, the nation's busiest airport, and three  other heavily used airports in an effort to reduce delays.  </P> <P> "We believe that the FAA is the appropriate forum to address airspace  management issues at O'Hare, not federal court in Ft. Worth," said Nagin.  American is based at Dallas/Ft. Worth Airport.  </P> <P> Nagin said United was forced to shift many flight times in response to changes  that American made in its upcoming flight schedule. American's changes "put all  flights for all carriers together at the same time, causing congestion and  delays," Nagin said.  </P> <P> Any delay would likely hurt United more than American, because Chicago-based  United is the largest airline at O'Hare, with more than 400 departures daily.  </P></p>

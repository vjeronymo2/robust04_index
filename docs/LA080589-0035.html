			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS: 'QUIET STORM' HAS SOME GENUINE THUNDER  </P> <P> The "Quiet Storm" radio format might be better termed "Lingering Morning Haze"  for its presentation of overly synthetic, emotion-bleached music. The "Quiet  Storm" tour that brought singers Phyllis Hyman and Cherrelle and the  fusion-based Pieces of a Dream band to Anaheim's Celebrity Theatre on Thursday  certainly had some of those qualities, but it also featured some genuine  thunder.  </P> <P> Pieces of a Dream opened with its predictably bland fusion-funk. They then  backed Cherrelle through a four-song set, highlighted by "Crazy (For Loving  You)" and the hit "Everything I Miss at Home," which displayed both a nimble,  octave-swooping voice, and an absence of the emotional weathering necessary to  make her notes felt.  </P> <P> Even when singing barefoot, as she did Thursday, the 6-foot-1 headliner Hyman  is a statuesque presence on stage. Her voice is easily the match of her image,  steering a smooth but never slick course between R&amp;B burner and jazz  stylist. Though sometimes a bit too reserved, Hyman pulled out the stops on the  hit "Living All Alone" (which included a whistling solo), "Meet Me on the Moon"  and the Philly soul ballad "What Ever Happened to Our Love."  </P> <P> The same bill, with the addition of Bill Withers, appears at the Universal  Amphitheatre on Sunday.

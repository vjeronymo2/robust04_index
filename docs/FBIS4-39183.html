			<p>BFN     [Text] Sergey Tereshchenko chaired a regular sitting of the  Cabinet of Ministers today. The topic of discussion was the  1994 state budget. Most discussions centered on the apparently  insufficient proposals by departmental ministries with regard to  cutting budget expenditures.    If these proposals are taken as a basis, not only will the  expenditures not be cut; rather, the earlier envisaged deficit  will increase threefold. The participants of the sitting  expressed fair doubts that the income part of the budget, which  had been confirmed earlier, was feasible. Many enterprises and  even branches of industry are currently loss-generating, while  credit turnover is extremely low.    A decision was made to petition for review by the Supreme  Kenges the possibility of a gradual stage-by-stage increase of  prices for bread and bakery products that currently are  subsidized. The need for measures to protect the poorest  segments of the population was also raised.</p>

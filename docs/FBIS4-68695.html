Over the many years of UN  operations in support of peace, a fairly stable concept of their  principles and tasks has taken shape: disengagement of the  warring sides, complete neutrality, avoidance of political  assessments of the actions of one side or another, the use of  force in exceptional instances, on a limited scale, and only in  self-defense. The rules are fairly rigid but dictated by a need  for the United Nations to observe a genuine role as peacemaker.    In recent times this noble role has undergone an especially  acute and in no way harmless distortion. In the name of the  United Nations, squadrons of bombers and armadas of ships are  massed. In the name of the United Nations, one party to a  conflict is loudly accused while the other is indulged. In the  name of the United Nations, plans for a settlement are drawn up  which often do not even manage to ask the consent of those who  would be bound by these plans.    The results are plain to see, as they say. How disgraceful  the result of the UN peacemaking effort in Somalia has been! The  people are starving just as they starved in the past. General  Aidid--whom the "peacemakers" hunted so zealously--is  prospering. While the "peacemakers" themselves, having spent  tremendous amounts of money--that could have been used to feed  half of Africa--have vanished. No less incredible are their  actions in Rwanda, from which they managed to extricate  Europeans and Americans with difficulty and are now swiftly  retreating, while suffering significant casualties.    A direct example of distortion of the peacemaking role of  the  United Nations can be seen in Bosnia. In developing the  anti-Serbian resolution of the Security Council, clearly aimed  at strangling Yugoslavia with an embargo (this resolution has  never yielded anything positive), the creators of UN policy in  Bosnia applied the theory of "Serbian aggression" to carry out a  policy openly hostile to one of the sides in conflict. For a  long time ignoring reports on atrocities by Muslims or Croats,  they did everything they could to blow up testimony on Serbian  atrocities. Ignoring the deep historical roots and causes of the  conflict, thereby ignoring its exceptional complexity, they kept  reiterating that everything could be resolved in one fell swoop.  As a result, a distorted picture of the conflict was established  in the minds of many people along with unjustified confidence in  the possibility of settling it. It was alleged that the entire  affair revolved around "Serbian greed," that the Serbs must be  stopped, and that the best way to do this was by inflicting  massive combat strikes against their positions.    So now when this very simple thesis was foisted on the  Western public, the NATO bloc came upon the scene--out of work  and lacking any goal following the Cold War. From all  appearances the NATO Council and its secretary general saw  Bosnia as a chance to save the bloc and an opportunity to fill  the military-strategic vacuum that had formed between Italy and  Greece. Yugoslavia was suddenly, and entirely arbitrarily,  proclaimed a "zone of responsibility" of NATO. The bloc itself  is becoming the "tool of the United Nations" and is prepared to  offer the organization its services.    Russia, initially voting in favor of the anti-Serbian  resolution of the Security Council (the first major mistake of  its foreign policy in the Yugoslavia crisis), is becoming a  coparticipant, against its will, in this game which is fraught  with tragedy. We can now attempt to clarify who issued the order  to begin the bombing in Bosnia and why. We can deplore the  disgraceful result of the "Churkin mission" that began with such  success. We can take offense at the fact that--you see, "they  did not consult Russia." We can and must accuse the Serbs of  obstinacy and stubbornness, and of causing the latest collapse  in the negotiations process.    But we cannot close our eyes here to the nature of the  political actions of the West in Bosnia. These actions,  culminating in the recent NATO bombings, do not facilitate a  peaceful settlement, but rather impede it. And the United  Nations, which must of course be given its due for the  organization of humanitarian assistance to Bosnia, bears its  share of responsibility for the breakdown of the negotiations.    It would be useful for the UN leadership to remember the  original objectives of its organization. These do not consist of  encouraging NATO attempts to resolve all the problems with bomb  strikes. That is clearly a dead end. On the contrary, the United  Nations must return to its mission of peace, not turn into a  warring party in the Bosnian conflict. Otherwise the United  Nations risks getting entangled in its own Vietnam.</p>

			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> TIME TRIP TO '50S STEAKHOUSE IS THE PAST WITH NO BLAST  </P> <P> Want to travel through time without calling on Michael J. Fox? Drive to  Chadney's steak and seafood house in Burbank. Inside, when your eyes become  accustomed to the red-tinged gloom, you will think you've landed sometime in  the steakhouse era of the late '50s and early '60s.  </P> <P> The dim lighting, the hefty, carved dark wood, the burgundy banquettes, the  menu (except for a couple of modern anachronisms) bespeak a time when ambience  and alcohol, beef and lobster plus bar-maid-attentive service meant luxury.  </P> <P> These days, mostly studio personnel relax in the past over good, stiff drinks  at lunch and dinner.  </P> <P> But if you think that joining the regulars in this trip back in time will also  bring back some fabled era of good, old-fashioned cooking, you will most likely  be disappointed. Except for a first-rate T-bone steak, my experiences at  Chadney's served mainly to increase my appreciation of the New American cooking  that is all too easy to take for granted.  </P> <P> An appropriately thematic preamble to a meal here would be a Manhattan or  better still an Old Fashioned. But it's hard to stick to pure surf and turf  when it comes to appetizers. Everything is in the right era, but, it would  seem, the wrong restaurant. Egg flower soup -- the usual beaten egg in chicken  broth stuff -- takes you to the chop suey houses of the '50s. Then suddenly,  you're whisked to Little Italy with a traditional Italian-American mozzarella  marinara that comes with an OK onion-based sauce.  </P> <P> Split pea soup, the very smooth, slightly thickened sort, brings you safely  back to steakhouse comfort. But the real blast from the steakhouse past comes  with the asparagus appetizer: several large, white, soggy spears -- fresh from  the can -- on some lettuce leaves. "Oh," replied the cheery waitress to my  astonishment, "you thought the asparagus would be fresh?" I did.  </P> <P> Of the entrees, only a superb, large T-bone steak (21 oz., $18.95) would lure  me back to Chadney's for more than just nostalgia. It's loose-textured, fully  flavored and tender -- but not fall-apart buttery. Unfortunately, other entrees  aren't as good. Most of the steak cuts are fine but not wonderful.  </P> <P> Fish dishes can be slightly dry and painfully plain. Vegetables also. The odd  token modern dish -- angel hair pasta with tomato, basil and olive oil -- isn't  bad but not really worth a second go-round.  </P> <P> Naturally, desserts are of the sweet, sweet variety.  </P> <P> My advice is to reprogram your time traveler to, let's say, December, 1989. The  present is a very good time for cooking here in Southern California.  </P> <P>  Chadney's, 3000 W. Olive Ave., Burbank. (818) 985-5622. Open 11:30 a.m. to  9:30 p.m. Mondays, 11:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. Tuesdays through Fridays, 5 to  10:30 p.m. Saturdays, 4:30 to 9:30 p.m. Sundays. Valet parking. Full bar. Major  credit cards accepted.

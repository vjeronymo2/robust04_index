			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- A high court ruling that  government screening of some history school textbooks describing  Japan's wartime atrocities has become irrevocable following the  state's failure to appeal to the Supreme Court by the Tuesday  [10 May] deadline, plaintiffs in the case said Thursday.    The Tokyo High Court on Oct. 20, 1993, ordered the  government  to pay 300,000 yen in compensation to Saburo Ienaga, 80, a noted  historian and professor emeritus of Tokyo University of  Education, the predecessor of Tsukuba University. Ienaga  claimed the Education Ministry had illegally ordered him to  change eight descriptions in a high school textbook on Japanese  history he had written, and the high court accepted his  complaint on three of the eight points.    One point was an account of the 1937 Nanjing massacre, which  the judge said reviewers were wrong to change and that the  account was "the prevailing view in the academic community" at  the time the book was screened.    Another point, which had been accepted by a lower court, was  the deletion of a passage saying the Imperial Government of the  1860's broke a promise to halve a tax on rice farmers.    Ienaga and his lawyers met reporters and said the illegality  of textbook screenings has been fixed for the first time. The  lawsuit was the third filed by Ienaga in his nearly 30-year  legal battle against textbook screening.    According to precedents, the government is thought to have  been able to appeal until Tuesday in a legal procedure called an  incidental appeal, the lawyers said. The Education Ministry,  however, said it had interpreted this differently and it is  still able to appeal.    Ienaga has appealed to the Supreme Court, saying the  ministry's screening system violates a ban on censorship  contained in the Constitution.</p>

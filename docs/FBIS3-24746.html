			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lieutenant General Coelho "Nzuma," deputy commander  for the Northeast Military Front, has said that the National  Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] continues to  talk the language of the guns.    [Begin "Nzuma" recording] We are aware that UNITA is  assembling forces in the north, in the (Giata) area, across the  Lombe River. They have also been gathering forces in the south,  slightly north of Cagandala. We believe those units will be  carrying out attacks within the next 24 to 48 hours. We are  waiting for them. We are vigilant, and we are following these  developments closely. We are taking measures so that the  fighting will occur well away from Malange, so that the people  are left alone. The only reason the enemy has not attacked yet  is because it has suffered many losses. Nonetheless, [UNITA]  General Chimuco has issued specific orders. Only yesterday,  three UNITA soldiers turned themselves over. They were wearing  their uniforms and had guns. They came from the area of  Quissolo, and they confirmed that Gen. Chimuco ordered a new  attack by the same military unit that was repelled on 23  January. [end recording]</p>

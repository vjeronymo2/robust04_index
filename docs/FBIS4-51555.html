			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "NHK News 7" </F> program]    [Text] Calling his new government an administration which  will succeed the previous administration's effort to realize  reforms, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, in his policy speech to be  delivered at both the House of Representatives and the House of  Councilors on 10 May, plans to disclose his idea that he will  deal with the pending tasks, including tax system reform, in  line with the platform agreed when the Social Democratic Party  of Japan [SDPJ] was still in the coalition.    Calling his government an administration to succeed reform  effort, the Prime Minister in his policy speech plans to  emphasize the stance that his administration will continue to  promote political, economic, and administrative reforms, which  the Hosokawa administration tried to realize.    Regarding the tax system reform, which is a focal point of  the reforms, he plans to explain that he will make a drastic  change, centered around reduction of indirect taxes, on the  basis of the coalition platform which the SDPJ and the ruling  coalition parties agreed.    Moreover, on ways to deal with North Korea's suspected  nuclear arms development, Hata will announce that his government  will act in line with the platform. He will explain a plan that  in addition to cooperation with the United States and the ROK,  his government will act in concert with China if necessary.    On the issue of becoming a permanent member of the UN  Security Council, Hata will indirectly express his desire by  using expressions similar to the ones the Japanese Government  used last July. The Japanese Government said last July that  Japan was ready to fulfill all responsibilities it could  possibly fulfill in the Security Council.    It seems that Prime Minister Hata decided to explain the  stance of not reflecting Shinseito's [Japan Renewal Party's]  individuality in his policy speech because he aims to  continuously ask the SDPJ to come back to the minority coalition  government.</p>

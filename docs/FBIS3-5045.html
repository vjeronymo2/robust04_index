			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Foreign Ministry spokesman's press statement (tamhwa) on </F> the massacre of Palestinians by an Israeli]    [Text] The DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a press  statement on 2 March on the recent heretofore rarely seen [yure  tumun] massacre of Palestinians in an Israeli-occupied area:    A heretofore rarely seen massacre was recently committed  against Palestinians in an area occupied by Israel. A Jewish  immigrant arbitrarily fired at Palestinians who were saying  morning prayers in Hebron, on the west bank of the Jordan River.  Some 50 persons were killed and some 300 persons were injured  in the crime committed by the Jewish person.    This awful massacre is an act of violent terrorism against  Palestinians and deliberate provocation to create an artificial  obstacle to the ongoing Middle East peace process. We severely  denounce the massacre by Israeli extremists [kuktan punja] as a  grave crime.    This tragic incident at a mosque on the Jordan River's west  bank is a direct consequence [chikchopchok hugwa] of Israel's  occupation policy. It shows that Palestinian's cannot remove  the element of danger from their lives nor free themselves from  their miserable lot, unless Middle East issues, including the  Palestinian problem, are resolved.    In order to guarantee durable peace in the Middle East,  Israel must withdraw from the occupied Arab lands, and Middle  East issues must be resolved in a fair and comprehensive way  [kongjonghago pogwalchoguro] in the interests of the people in  the region. Israeli authorities must punish those responsible  for murdering and wounding innocent Palestinians and must take  steps to help the victims. At the same time, they must ensure  that no act contrary to the Middle East peace process is  conducted.    We will continue to send our active support and firm  solidarity to the just struggle of the Palestinian people and  the entire Arab people to restore their legitimate national  rights and to accelerate the peace process in the Middle East.</p>

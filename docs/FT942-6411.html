			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / European Elections: Dutch crusader determined to open decision-making Mr Piet Dankert, the Dutch minister for European affairs, plans to wage from the European parliament his crusade for more openness in EU decision-making. He insists that one of the main reasons behind the erosion of public support for the European Union is its secretive decision-making. He believes this so strongly that in February he got the Dutch government to take the Council of Ministers of the 12 to the European Court of Justice, in an effort to overturn the decision by a majority of 10 member states to limit public access to EU information. Since then, Holland has picked up support from Denmark, and from the European Parliament - to which Mr Dankert, its Socialist president in 1982-84, is virt-ually certain to return after next month's Euro-elections. 'The idea that we are run by our bureaucrats, not only at European but at national level, is deadly for the Union, and we have to tackle that,' Mr Dankert says. Before joining the last Christian Democrat-Socialist coalition in the Hague, Mr Dankert was an influential figure in the European Parliament from 1979 - when it was first directly elected - to 1989. He was instrumental in Strasbourg's rejection of the Community budget in 1979, and exposed a butter fraud in the Dutch dairy industry. In the mid-1980s, it was his written questions to the Commission which uncovered the cartel in the Dutch construction industry. 'In the European Parliament you can do that sort of thing,' he says, and much more so now with the increased powers (of veto over much new EU law) Strasbourg got out of the Maastricht treaty. Under the 1991 Dutch presidency of the 12 just before the Maastricht summit, Mr Dankert's blueprint for the Union treaty - which would have made parliament almost equal to the council - was famously torpedoed by 10 of the Netherlands' partners. But now, as then, the Dutchman is undeterred by 10-2 odds, and is going for the long haul. After the backlash against Europe and amid the struggle to ratify Maastricht, five successive EU summits had 'decided that urgent action was needed and that that action was openness,' Mr Dankert recalls. 'Everybody agreed on that analysis, but in the Community, when you come to concrete action, very different powers prevail.' The openness policy originally proclaimed full right of public access to all EU information except where national security, monetary stability, commercial confidentiality, privacy or relations with non-EU countries could be endangered. But last December, a majority in the Council slipped in a catch-all discretionary clause for refusing access to documents 'in order to protect the confidentiality of the Council's proceedings'. This is now being used to turn down requests for even relatively banal information. Mr Dankert blames national justice, interior and home affairs ministries in general, and the UK, France and Germany in particular for this evisceration of the new information policy. He cautions that 'how far it is the civil services and how far it is the ministers (who are responsible) is very difficult to judge'. He notes with irritation the growing power of Coreper - the committee of permanent representatives or ambassadors of the 12 to the EU - in Euro decision-making, and argues that judgments on issues such as access to information should be taken through political discussion, and not by Coreper or the council bureaucracy. He reckons the Dutch court case has a reasonable chance on procedural grounds, but acknowledges that getting an acceptable information policy could take a long time. 'But if you keep hammering away at the subject, in the end, people give way, or at least find a possible modus vivendi for everybody.' Reinforcements should arrive if Sweden, Finland and Norway join the EU next year as planned, bringing with them their fierce attachment to open government, affixed as political declarations to their accession treaties. 'The Scandinavians will reinforce our side of the debate,' Mr Dankert states confidently, 'and that debate will not stop.'</p>

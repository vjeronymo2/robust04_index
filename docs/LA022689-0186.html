			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TITANS GO OUT AT HOME WITH A ROAR  </P> <P> There are certain privileges reserved for gloating fans in the final minutes of  a blowout, and one of the most honored is calling for the subs.  </P> <P> A chant went up from the Cal State Fullerton crowd in the waning minutes of the  Titans' 71-56 dismissal of Fresno State Saturday. With 37 seconds left, it was  at its loudest.  </P> <P> But this one wasn't for the subs. The last player off the bench, Joe Neeley, a  former manager now in uniform as a walk-on, was already in the game.  </P> <P> They were calling for the coach, John Sneed, who has had the job only on an  acting basis since George McQuarn resigned before the season.  </P> <P> "We want Sneed, We want Sneed," chanted a good part of the crowd of 2,225 in  Titan Gym.  </P> <P> Fullerton, sticking fast to a decision made before the season to hold an open  search, accepted applications until Friday -- Sneed's among them. The school  plans to name a coach within a few weeks.  </P> <P> On the sideline, Sneed kept his reaction invisible.  </P> <P> Later, in the presence of Athletic Director Ed Carroll, he responded to  questions with a subtle touch.  </P> <P> "Everyone has their opinion," Sneed said. "I guess two or three voiced theirs."  </P> <P> The celebratory mood in Titan Gym was the result of a thorough reversal of  Fullerton's first game against Fresno State this season, a 21-point loss that  Sneed called "a total embarrassment."  </P> <P> This time, on a night that marked the final home game of the season, the Titans  did themselves proud, and had their fun along the way. They jumped to a 25-11  lead early, let the Bulldogs back in it late in the half, and then pulled away  finally with six minutes left in the game when Ceballos knocked down a  three-pointer to give the Titans a 57-47 lead. It was never less than double  digits again, and once was as large as 17.  </P> <P> With the victory, led by Ceballos' 28 points, Fullerton (14-11 overall, 9-7 in  conference play) assured itself of a .500 season and at least a seventh-place  finish in the Big West. With two more victories and the right breaks, the  Titans could finish as high as tied for second.  </P> <P> The evening began with the traditional senior recognition, punctuated by Derek  Jones' emotional introduction. As the crowd gave him a standing ovation, Jones  hugged not only most of his teammates and his own mother, but also each of the  parents of the other seniors gathered at halfcourt.  </P> <P> "I'm a pretty affectionate guy," said Jones, who came back to play his senior  season more than a year after being critically injured in a drive-by shooting.  "These are the people who supported me in my time of sorrow."  </P> <P> Fullerton won with a pressing defense that forced two 10-second violations and  numerous turnovers, and an interior defense that helped contain Fresno's  leading scorer, Jervis Cole, who scored 22 points but made only eight of 26  shots.  </P> <P> "We weren't ready for their quickness," Fresno State Coach Ron Adams said. His  Bulldogs are 12-13, 7-9.  </P> <P> The Fullerton fun was at its height with 4 minutes left, when John Sykes, the  Titans' 6-foot-8 center, came up with the ball and decided to lead the fast  break himself, despite having point guard Wayne Williams on his left and  Ceballos on his right.  </P> <P> This was much to the delight of the crowd -- especially when Sykes finished the  break with a between the legs bounce pass to Williams, who layed it in for a  63-49 lead.  </P> <P> The crowd roared. On the sidelines, Sneed wiped his brow and shook his head.  </P> <P> "It topped the night off," said Sykes, long known for spirited but headstrong  play.  </P> <P> Asked if he feared Sneed's reaction, Sykes said, "Unh, uh. I'm a free spirit. I  go with the motion."  </P> <P> Sneed conceded that the play was a crowd pleaser.  </P> <P> "I don't enjoy that," he said. "You tend to get a little out of control with a  lead like that."  </P> <P> All told, it was a night for the seniors -- Jones, Brent Calvin and Randal Moos  -- all of whom started the game. And, it was a night for Sneed.  </P> <P> "I wasn't exactly sure what the public wanted, or what they thought," Jones  said. "He's done a spectacular job with us. It was nice to hear that they  wanted him back next year."  </P> <P> They wanted Jones back too. But for Jones, no cheers could do it.  </P></p>

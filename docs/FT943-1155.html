			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / FT Guide to Britain's Nuclear Review This week is the last for submissions to Britain's review of nuclear power. What is the background? Britain's nuclear power industry consists of 13 power stations (11 in England, two in Scotland), accounting for about 25 per cent of all UK-generated electricity. (Another two are being decommissioned and a further one, Sizewell B, is due to come on stream shortly.) Originally the intention was to privatise them along with the rest of the electricity industry in 1989. But resistance by investors to the risks of nuclear power made this impossible. Instead, nuclear power was put into two state-owned companies, Nuclear Electric, covering England and Wales, and Scottish Nuclear. The government pledged to review nuclear policy in five years' time, to determine its future. What will the review achieve? The aim is to focus on prospects for nuclear power, examining economic and commercial viability of new nuclear stations against the background of the government's energy policy. The review will also examine options for private-sector finance, and ponder privatisation. A separate review will examine problems of nuclear waste. What are the issues? Capacity: Only one nuclear power station, Sizewell B, is under construction, so a key question is whether any more should be built. By the end of the 1990s many first-generation Magnox reactors will be reaching their end. Unless replacements are planned soon, the industry will start to shrink. Nuclear Electric wants to start building Sizewell C and other stations soon. Scottish Nuclear will need a new station around 2010. Economics: Since it was placed on a commercial footing, the industry has boosted performance. The cost of generating nuclear electricity has fallen sharply, but is still higher on average than electricity from conventional power stations. Both Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear predict that nuclear power can become fully commercial later this decade. Provisions: One of the biggest financial drags is the cost of providing for the disposal of nuclear waste and of de-commissioning power stations when they are retired from service. When the two state companies were created, the government placed all these liabilities with them, but did not provide money. In Nuclear Electric's case, it set up the nuclear levy which will add about 10 per cent to electricity bills until 1998; by then, provisions should be adequate, according to the company. It also provided guarantees for Scottish Nuclear's provisions, and arranged for it to receive an above-market price for its electricity for five years. Privatisation cannot occur until this aspect is dealt with in a way that satisfies investors. One possibility: the government might assume responsibility for some of the past liabilities, particularly those created by Magnox stations. Generation: Because nuclear power stations cannot be started and shut down as easily as coal and gas-fired, they qualify for base-load running: meeting the country's basic day-to-day needs. But owing to their huge cost (about Pounds 3bn for building Sizewell C), they would also need guaranteed supply contracts, running for as much as 30 years, to satisfy potential backers. This timescale is far beyond the present capacity of the electricity market, so the government might have to guarantee such contracts beyond normal commercial terms (say 15 years) as a condition for privatisation. Does Britain need more nuclear power? In capacity terms: no. The UK has a large surplus of power generation, mainly because of the rapid growth of gas-fired stations. Coal-fired power stations are also being shut. But the nuclear power industry warns that gas prices could jump, and that gas could run out early next century. It also claims a strong environmental case for nuclear. What are the environmental issues? With the UK committed by international treaty to cut harmful emissions, there is a premium on 'clean' power sources. Nuclear stations emit virtually no gases. The industry also points out that, once its provisions are made, it will be the only power source paying the full cost of its environmental impact. The real difficulty with nuclear power lies in waste disposal. Britain has no lasting solution to this problem, though the government favours deep burial. For now, waste is either stored in vaults on-site or sent to Sellafield, in Cumbria, for reprocessing. Can the nuclear power industry be privatised? The two nuclear companies want to be privatised in order to escape political manipulation and to diversify their activities. They also claim they will be able to operate commercially. However, the City has doubts about viability and risks. Prospects will depend on whether the government is prepared to underwrite the industry in order to make it attractive to investors.</p>

			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Management: Be direct, but don't preach or complain - Tips from the top / Christopher Haskins, chairman of Northern Foods, offers advice on how to handle the press to present information accurately and to challenge the people in power who naturally favour authoritarianism. The efficient exercise of power frequently jeopardises the democratic process and a free press must ensure this does not happen. One of the first actions of an aspiring dictator is to muzzle the press. Businessmen share government ministers' views on the press. In an ideal world they would prefer that journalists did not exist. But, in reality, we find ourselves dependent on them. The press remains the most effective way for politicians to communicate to the voters and company chairmen to influence their shareholders. Being both vain and insecure, we rejoice when the notices are favourable and are enraged when they are critical. Businessmen, in common with most British institutions, are paranoiac and secretive. It is a peculiar British weakness and stems from the culture of patronage and elitism which remains endemic in our society. It does not, however, promote good relations with the media. A good journalist must treat secrecy with suspicion, assuming that it is being used to distort the truth. Mostly, his suspicions are correct, and he must strive to expose the secret. A sensible business person knows that there are few reputable secrets in life and should be accessible to journalists. Where possible, the chairman should not hide behind a press office, but speak directly to the press. This disarms the latter, as well as making them self-important. They, too, are not without vanity. However, there are occasions when confidential 'off-the-record' discussions can help both sides. I have never been betrayed by a journalist in these circumstances, although there is always a risk of an accident or a misunderstanding as John Major discovered recently. Or, perhaps he actually wanted his 'off-the-record' comments to reach the public domain. Businesspeople constantly complain that they are inaccurately reported. A good reporter respects accuracy and will be glad to ensure that quotations and attributable comments are checked. The trick is to identify the bad journalist, and handle him with care. Businessmen themselves should take care with their comments, and ensure that they are accurate. On occasion, probing journalists need to be handled like policemen and lawyers - answer the questions precisely, but offer no more than is being requested. Never try to over-influence journalists, preach at them, or complain about them to their editor. More often than not your case will be a bad one, and even if it is not, journalists, like all professional people, are protective of each other when they are under fire. A good relationship with the press can transform a problem into a success, just as the proper handling of a complaint can result in increased customer satisfaction. Two examples spring to mind. A few years ago the press was convinced that most chilled food manufacturers were a danger to society. We chose to invite our most vigorous critics to our factories to explain our position. We ended up with an enhanced reputation. On another occasion, a speculative discussion with a reputable journalist almost certainly saved the company from a hostile and damaging predatory bid. Lushing up journalists is an expensive, wearisome and ineffective pastime. The good ones either do not participate, or else take the goodies but do not return the favours. Those who are seduced tend to be corrupt themselves and, therefore, in the long term of no use to you. Journalists who are 'pliable', such as those who are prepared to produce newspapers which reflect the prejudices of their owners, should be treated with great suspicion. Finally, recognise that journalists are strange characters: loners, anarchic, insecure and suspicious. But they are also gossipy, anti-establishment and entertaining, and usually wise enough not to take themselves too seriously. They are on the whole good company, and add colour to the drudgery of our daily life. Next Monday: Eric Nicoli, chief executive of United Biscuits, on how to produce an annual report.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Greta Steyn] </F>   [Excerpt] Only about R200m [million rand] would be  allocated specifically to the new provincial governments in the  Budget this month to finance their administrations, state  expenditure director-general Hannes Smit said yesterday. Since  the old administrations would continue running regional  government functions in the short term, the usual allocations to  the four provinces, the TBVC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda,  Ciskei] and the self-governing territories would be made, he  said.    "The Budget will have exactly the same format as in previous  years, except for a supplementary spending proposal to finance  the provincial cabinets," he said. The amount -- less than  R200m -- would not add to overall spending totals.    The total allocation to each region would be linked to  functions, such as education, at present performed by those  governments in the TBVC. As functions were formally handed to  the new provinces, they would use the finance allocated to the  old administrations -- as well as central government allocations.    One exception was housing, where central government's  allocation went to the national housing fund, which would  distribute it to the regions, Smit said.    At present, there is a national housing board and four  regional housing boards with access to central government funds.  The relationship between the regional boards and the provincial  governments has not yet been defined. Sources said the boards  were operating in terms of National Housing Forum policies, but  that could change if regional housing ministers disagreed with  the policies.    Smit said a law would be passed soon to establish the  reconstruction fund, which would kick off with R2.5bn [billion]  from government.    Sources said the first direct allocations to the new  regional  governments were likely to come from the reconstruction fund.  These allocations might be made before the fiscal and financial  commission -- to be appointed before the end of the month -- had  decided on formulas for sharing revenue. [passage omitted]</p>

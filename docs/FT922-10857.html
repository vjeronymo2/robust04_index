			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: TSW declines to Pounds 1.95m after heavy reorganisation costs TSW-TELEVISION South West Holdings, the ITV company which has lost its franchise, yesterday announced a sharp drop in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.95m for the 17 months to December 31. The figure compared with Pounds 4.7m profit in the 12 months to July 31 1990. The outcome was struck after Exchequer levy of Pounds 2.55m and exceptional items of Pounds 2.54m mainly resulting from a reorganisation of the company. TSW also had an extraordinary charge of Pounds 4.15m - being the expense of the original franchise bid, the cost of the judicial review of the Independent Television Commission's decision not to give TSW a licence and the associated closure costs. As well as planning the phased reduction of staff TSW said yesterday it was considering all the options open to it following the loss of its broadcasting licence. One option is to realise its assets and distribute the cash to shareholders. 'Others are being explored in considerable depth with the objective of enhancing shareholder value,' TSW said. Sir Brian Bailey, chairman, said he thought the results were 'very creditable' against the background of economic recession and poor advertising revenue. The company would continue to provide viewers with the standard of service to which they are entitled until the end of the franchise period at the end of this year. Turnover was Pounds 59.5m compared with Pounds 44m for the previous 12 months. Earnings per share were 5p (12.6p) and following the payment of two interim dividends amounting to 4p a final dividend of 3p is recommended making a total of 7p (5p). TSW also said that it saw no need to make provision against the overall net book value of the assets at the balance sheet date when the company had net cash of Pounds 3.44m. The shares closed unchanged at 52p.</p>

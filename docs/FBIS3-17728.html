Yeltsin left Sochi, all the  newspapers here noted with one voice: The president's vacation  was chiefly beneficial to...Krasnodar Kray. Kuban Governor N.  Yegorov and Sochi Mayor N. Karpov had more intensive contact  with him this time than ever before. Yegorov acknowledged that  in two weeks they had five meetings with the president, and  quite long ones at that -- from 1.5 to 14 hours. The local  leaders were able to obtain from these contacts the maximum  benefit for their region, and to resolve questions which usually  take a very long time to resolve (or, more often, not to  resolve).    Thus, the president's consent was obtained for the  introduction of a visa system in Krasnodar Kray. This means  that people living in the nearby foreign countries will now be  able to visit the Kuban only on special invitations, with entry  visas, and by virtue of paying to register with the local organs  (this will not apply to citizens of Russia). The question of  stationing additional military formations in the kray's  territory was also decided -- specifically, one army division  and one division of internal troops -- in order to strengthen  security in the region as well as preventing possible  interethnic conflicts. B. Yeltsin gave the "go-ahead" for the  allocation of 434 billion rubles to the kray to provide  amenities for servicemen's families, something that the military  men themselves and the kray's organs of power have long been  asking for. In short, O. Lobov was instructed to prepare a  whole list of questions relating to strengthening the security  of the kray -- which is now a border region -- for examination  in the Security Council.    And that is not all. The president promised to sign an edict  on the development of the resort of Anapa as an all-Russian  children's health resort. Anapa was an all-Union children's  health resort before, but in the years of reform it fell, like  all of us, into a total decline, so now we will recreate what we  ourselves destroyed. B. Yeltsin and V. Chernomyrdin, who  visited him in Sochi, also backed the kray's initiative on  building new cargo ports on the Black Sea at Sochi and Anapa,  and special government decrees will probably be adopted on this  matter in the near future.    They even succeeded in obtaining a written petition from the  president of Russia to the International Olympic Committee on  holding the Winter Olympics in Sochi in the year 2002.    Last, and most important: During the presidential vacation a  decision was adopted on drawing up a special treaty (agreement)  between Krasnodar Kray and the federal organs of power on the  demarcation of rights and powers (similar to the one that it is  planned to conclude with Kaliningrad Oblast), which  substantially boosts the kray's status as a component of the  Federation.    I cannot help being pleased for my native land. If the  state's top men continue to take regular vacations on our coast,  the Kuban will soon become the most prosperous region in Russia.  But I cannot help sympathizing with those oblasts, especially  in remote parts of Russia, where the president and the premier  never stop by.</p>

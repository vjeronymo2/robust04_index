			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Technocrats wait in North Korea's wings: New leader faces a test of his ability to give a bigger role to reformers The postponement of the funeral of North Korean leader Kim Il-sung from yesterday to tomorrow has prompted speculation whether his son and designated successor, Mr Kim Jong-il, is facing unexpected opposition to his assumption of complete power. Some analysts looking for clues to possible shifts in power in North Korea have interpreted the postponement as a political setback for Mr Kim Jong-il, who is expected to take formal control of the country after the funeral. However, a more important indication of Mr Kim's political strength will be his ability to promote a new generation of technocrats soon. North Korea has been ruled since the 1950s by members of the late president's extended family and a small group of ex-guerrillas who fought with Mr Kim against the Japanese in the 1930s. But since the late 1980s, a new generation of reform-minded officials, many related to the conservative ruling elite, have achieved prominence under the patronage of the younger Kim, according to analysts. 'North Korea has seen a generational struggle among the ruling elite in the past few years over the direction of the country's economic and diplomatic policy,' says Mr Michael Breen, editor of Korea Countdown, a Seoul-based newsletter on North Korean affairs. The reformers first came to the fore in 1988 under former prime minister Yon Hyong-muk. North Korea began a tentative opening to the outside world by joining the UN. Mr Yon held meetings with his South Korean counterparts that produced non-nuclear and non-aggression pacts between the two Koreas in late 1991. But a conservative backlash became apparent in late 1992, reflecting frustration that North Korea's actions had not gained diplomatic recognition or economic aid from the west. Mr Yon was dismissed and several key technocrats were subsequently demoted. The shake-up occurred shortly after disputes with the US and South Korea over inspections of the North's nuclear programmes first emerged. North Korea's threat to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) in March 1993 may have been an attempt by the younger Kim to appease the conservative faction while achieving the goals of the reformers by forcing the US to grant concessions. 'If Kim Jong-il secures full power, he is likely to bring back those favouring changes in economic and foreign policy,' says Mr Breen. Analysts are closely watching the fate of two prominent technocrats, Mr Kim Yong-sun and Mr Kim Dal-hyon, to determine the future direction of North Korea. Both fell out of favour in the past year to appease conservative critics, but appear to be making strong comebacks following the death of President Kim. Mr Kim Yong-sun was formerly the ruling party's secretary for international affairs and travelled widely, even attending a congress of the Welsh nationalist party, Plaid Cymru. In December 1992, he became party secretary for South Korean affairs in what was regarded as a slight demotion. He also lost his position as alternate Politburo member in December 1993. He favours ties with the US, Japan and South Korea, and expressed opposition to the North's threatened withdrawal from the NPT. Mr Kim Yong-sun is believed a close confidant of the North's new leader. He was seen comforting Mr Kim Jong-il's sister during mourning ceremonies last week and is playing a prominent role in arranging the president's funeral. He also received a delegation from the pro-Pyongyang federation of Korean residents in Japan and was responsible for notifying South Korea that the planned inter-Korean summit would have to be postponed, but not cancelled. His recent activities indicate that he will assume an important post in the new leadership. Mr Kim Dal-hyon, the late president's nephew by marriage, was in charge of promoting foreign trade and visited South Korea in 1992 to tour industrial plants. He impressed South Korean officials with frank discussions about North Korea's economic problems. He was appointed economic planning chief in December 1992, but was dismissed a year later and demoted to managing a synthetic fibre factory. Although he may have been a scapegoat for the country's economic failings, there have been reports in Seoul that one reason for his fall was that he allegedly accepted bribes from South Korean companies seeking factories sites in North Korea. But he has reappeared in the past week. In spite of his low ranking of 140th in the party hierarchy, he was among 100 selected to attend mourning ceremonies last week. Mr Kang Song-san, the prime minister, is also regarded as in the reformist camp since he pushed for inter-Korean contacts in his first term as premier in 1984-86 and later promoted cross-border trade with the Soviet Union when he was governor of the north-eastern province of North Hamyong, now the site of the country's first free trade and investment zone.</p>

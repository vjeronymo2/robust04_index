			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): House in Canada SOME YEARS ago, I inherited a house in Canada which I am now selling. Since I am a resident taxpayer in the UK but domiciled in Canada, I understand I will be liable for capital gains tax there on the sale. Will there also be tax to pay if I remit the money from the sale to Britain? First, perhaps we should point out that the Canadian courts decided some years ago, in Trottier v Rajotte, that it is not possible to be domiciled in Canada as a unit: each of the provinces is a separate country for the purposes of the law of domicile in England (and Scotland) as well. Assuming that you are, in fact, domiciled in one of the provinces of Canada under English law, then the answer to your question is yes. Ask your tax office for the free pamphlets CGT14 (capital gains tax - an introduction) and IR6 (double taxation relief). You might also like to write to the Inland Revenue Public Enquiry Room, Somerset House, Strand, London WC2R 1LB, for a copy of SP6/88 (double taxation relief - capital gains tax). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

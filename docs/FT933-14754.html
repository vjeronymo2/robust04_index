			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Insurance firms set for tax change CHANGES in the tax treatment of insurance companies are to be outlined in a consultation document, Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, told MPs last night. Earlier Miss Betty Boothroyd, the speaker, had rejected Labour demands that 44 Tory MPs who are Lloyd's Names - individuals whose capital backs the insurance market - should be barred from voting on provisions in the Finance Bill which would affect the tax treatment of Lloyd's. Mr Dorrell emphasised that the effect of the move was tax-neutral. The proposals open the possibility of limiting charges on insurance companies' premium income to facilitate the build-up of a reserve fund to meet future catastrophes. Mr Dorrell explained that the consultation document, to be published during the summer, would deal with whether insurance companies should continue to be taxed on the basis of annually declared profit. Mr Dorrell said it could be argued that it was not sensible to levy tax on the profit from annual premiums when the claims they were intended to cover could materialise during a later period. He emphasised that in the case of Lloyd's there would be a limit of 50 per cent on the amount of premium income which was not subject to tax. Miss Boothroyd ruled that the rule requiring MPs not to vote on matters in which they had a personal pecuniary interest did not apply to a public bill so long as other similarly situated persons would benefit in the same way. She stressed that the provisions in the bill were not confined to members of Lloyd's who were also MPs. MPs will be asked to give the Finance Bill a third reading today.</p>

In our editorial room, we received several telephone calls  reporting the military movements.    Meanwhile, upon being asked, the Army Information and Press  Department reported that normally early in every month, members  of the Zavala Marshal Brigade, the Honor Guard, or La Aurora  Guard, a former tactical detachment, conduct routine military  training. Following the referendum on 30 January, the rumors of  a possible social outbreak or, worse yet, a coup d'etat remain  in the air.    Political leaders who were asked but who chose to remain  anonymous said that, in reality, they were also alerted by  friends or relatives of a potential military movement by the  government's military leadership. One of the interviewees  recalled that after the visit by U.S. Ambassador Marilyn McAfee  to Foreign Minister Gladys Marithza Vielman Ruiz last Friday,  rumors regarding destabilizing movements against the government  have been going around, and even though they have not been  confirmed, they have not been denied either.    In diplomatic circles, no opinions were given on the current  situation. The ambassadors who were asked, said only that there  currently is an effort under way by Guatemalans to demand  respect for order and legality.</p>

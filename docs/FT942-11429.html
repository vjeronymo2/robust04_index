			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Manila powers 4.3% ahead after agreement with IMF Much of the region was lower in the absence of demand from Japan which remained closed for the Golden Week holiday. A sharply higher Manila market was among the exceptions. MANILA powered 4.3 per cent ahead as Tuesday's agreement on a new economic programme between the Philippines and IMF provided the catalyst for a wave of foreign buying. The composite index moved forward 126.12 to 3,064.05 in volume of 3.6bn shares, compared with the previous total of 2.5bn. A sharp overnight rise by PLDT on Wall Street fuelled the rally and the stock jumped 145 pesos, or 7.8 per cent, to 1,995 pesos in the local market. Philippine National Bank also attracted foreign interest, which pushed the price up 70 pesos, or 14 per cent, to 570 pesos. TAIWAN climbed 1.9 per cent in heavy trade, led by textiles, electronics and financials as investors focused on improved first-quarter profits. The weighted index rose 107.19 to 5,907.54 in turnover that surged to TDollars 89.8bn from Tuesday's TDollars 58.29bn. Textiles featured strongly in response to rises in the prices of cotton and polyester. Far Eastern Textile traded the day's limit up to TDollars 39.10 and Formosa Chemical Fibres added TDollars 1.60 at TDollars 36.50. Financials moved ahead after several business banks reported good profits for the January to April period. Taitung Bank rose TDollars 5 to TDollars 83. Some late buying was also seen in electronics, with Acer, Taiwan Liton and Great Electronics going limit up to TDollars 57.50, TDollars 43.80 and TDollars 20.70 respectively. HONG KONG finished near its low for the year after tumbling sharply in the afternoon. The Hang Seng index dropped 309.69, or 3.6 per cent, to 8,369.44. The weak trend was attributed to rumours that the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping was mortally ill, a weakening property market, the postponement of India's VSNL global offering and a pessimistic report by an investment bank. The Japanese holiday has also contributed to a lack of demand, with the result that a few sell orders can have a disproportionate impact on the market. SINGAPORE took its lead from Hong Kong, the Straits Times Industrial index receding 9.48 to 2,301.08. Speculation that DBS Land, the property group, planned a 10 per cent share placement also dampened sentiment. DBS fell 22 cents to SDollars 4.70. AUSTRALIA was weaker for the fourth consecutive day as uncertainty surrounding next Tuesday's federal budget kept potential buyers at bay. The All Ordinaries index closed 25.8 lower at 2,018.4 in thin trading, with institutions reluctant to take fresh positions. National turnover totalled ADollars 332.41m. Shares were marked down from the opening, when they fell in tandem with the overnight drop in the Australian dollar and local bonds, ignoring Wall Street's rise. Fosters Brewing, 1 cent easier at ADollars 1.26, topped the actives list, a hefty 17.69m shares changing hands. BHP retreated 28 cents to ADollars 16.60. The company is expected to face a ADollars 4bn law suit over alleged environmental damage to the Ok Tedi river. News Corp was the only stock among the 20 leaders to end firmer, gaining 2 cents at ADollars 9.51 ahead of its nine-month figures due today. NEW ZEALAND continued to lose ground during another day of thin dealing, the NZSE-40 capital index ending 12.54 lower at 2,073.05 in turnover of just NZDollars 29m. The weakness spread to second line stocks, among them Trust Bank, which closed 4 cents cheaper at NZDollars 2.00, its lowest point since listing on March 30. SEOUL saw late institutional selling in primary blue chips bring a halt to an earlier rally and the composite stock index finished a net 4.78 up at 922.33 after a day's high of 935.42. Samsung Electronics lost Won2,000 at Won83,500 but Daewoo Securities rose Won400 to Won31,300. KUALA LUMPUR was marked down in very low volume, with foreign selling of blue chip stocks dragging the market to its lowest level for three weeks. The composite index closed 13.77, or 1.3 per cent, down at 1,028.25. BANGKOK encountered heavy selling of finance stocks amid worries that finance and securities companies' operating costs will be higher after the Bank of Thailand limited their foreign currency debt holdings. The SET index shed 6.14 to 1,252.37 in thin trade. BOMBAY fell 1.7 per cent, the BSE index losing 60.75 to 3,611.39, with selling pressure increasing after the index fell below the 3,646 level which some technical analysts see as the trigger for a bear phase.</p>

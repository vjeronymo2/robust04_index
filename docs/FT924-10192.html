			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Race for the White House: US-Japan relations suffer sharp deterioration Japan's relations with the US have suffered a sharp deterioration, with mounting distrust on both sides, according to a poll published yesterday by a leading Japanese newspaper, Charles Leadbeater writes. The poll, conducted with more than 4,000 interviewees in the US and Japan, found the number of Japanese and Americans who believe relations between the two countries are good has fallen to a 15-year low. The proportion of those who think relations are poor has risen sharply over the past year. The annual poll conducted by the Yomirui newspaper group in Japan and Gallup, the polling organisation in the US, found that only 8 per cent of US respondents thought Japan was a trustworthy nation. About 60 per cent of US interviewees believed its policy would be shaped by the idea that Japan is a threat to US interests. Yomirui said the deterioration in attitudes probably marked the rise in the Japanese trade surplus with the US as well as the increasing domestic orientation of US policies. Japan's standing in US esteem has fallen consistently over the past six years according to the poll. In 1987 it found that Japan was ranked as the ninth most trustworthy nation by US respondents. This year it fell to 14th. The survey found that President George Bush is still popular among the Japanese despite the controversy over his illness-plagued visited to the country in January, at the outset of the presidential election campaign.</p>

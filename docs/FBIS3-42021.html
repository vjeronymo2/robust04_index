Serhiy Kolesnyk, a member of the Commission for  Defense Issues, and Andriy Pecherov, a member of the Supreme  Council presidium, have refused to comment on the fact of the  signing of the document.    Volodymyr Shcherbyna, leader of the ``New Ukraine'' faction,  assessed the fact of the signing of the treaty positively, on  the whole. Giving the reasons for his stance, he asked his  opponents to reply to the question of whether they could re-aim  the Ukrainian missiles from facilities in the United States to  similar facilities in Russia?    People's deputy Vladyslav Nosov, secretary to the  Constitutional Commission, said that by signing the agreement in  Moscow today the president of Ukraine had exceeded his  authority, because in accordance with the current Constitution  he does not have the right to dispose of Ukraine's state  property (in accordance with the Vienna Convention, the 176  missiles and nuclear warheads on Ukrainian territory are  Ukraine's property). According to Nosov, Kravchuk's actions can  be assessed as an act of ``brutal arbitrariness.'' As regards  impeachment, noted Nosov, the Constitutional Court, if there was  one in Ukraine, would have to institute proceedings against the  president of Ukraine. Nosov mentioned the vagueness of  Ukrainian legislation as one of the reasons for Kravchuk  violating the Constitution.    Mykhaylo Shvayko, deputy chairman of the Commission for  Economic Reform, noted that the discussion of this treaty in  parliament would be very stormy. It is not ruled out,  emphasized Shvayko, that Kravchuk will provoke ``impeachment''  in the Supreme Council.    Volodymyr Kryuchkov, a member of the Commission for Issues  of  Defense and State Security, believes that implementation of this  treaty is unrealistic both for Russia and for Ukraine.    It has been learned from informed sources that America is  proposing compensation to Ukraine for the dismantlement of the  missiles, which comes to approximately $1 billion. But the  dismantlement of one complex of SS-24 missiles costs not less  than $10 billion according to approximate calculations, and  there are 46 such complexes in Ukraine. In addition, Ukraine  currently has 136 (?SS-18) missiles.</p>

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Likely Pounds 40m tag on Appld Distribution Applied Distribution Group, formed five years ago as the result of a Pounds 16.5m management buy-out of Geest's contract distribution business, yesterday published the pathfinder for its proposed flotation next month. The company, which is planning to come to market via a placing likely to value the group at about Pounds 40m, also reported a 27 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.23m on turnover which grew to Pounds 26.5m (Pounds 21.4m) in 1993. Operating profits increased to Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 3.4m). Since 1991 the group, which provides third-party warehousing and distribution services mainly to retailers and food manufacturers, has increased its turnover and operating profits by 44 per cent and 15 per cent respectively. The group, which has invested a further Pounds 4.5m since the MBO and repaid Pounds 6.25m of debt, has benefited from the growing outsourcing trend among UK retailers and manufacturers to contract out their warehousing and transport needs. Applied Distribution's main customers include J Sainsbury, Somerfield/Gateway, Nestle, Esso, Whitworth's Produce and the Co-operative Wholesale Society. It operates nationally from five depots. The group is planning to use the net proceeds of the placing to repay Pounds 11m of debt. The placing is being organised by Baring Brothers with NatWest Wood Mackenzie as brokers to the issue. Pricing is on March 10 and trading is expected to begin on March 17.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe: "Intervening in </F> Rwanda"]    [Text] The terrible tragedy which has struck Rwanda is one  of the most murderous conflicts of the end of the present  century. The horror of the massacres and the distress of those  who have escaped overwhelm even the most indifferent. It would  be too simple to explain the succession of dramatic events by  some "fatal African penchant" for violence.  <H5>  1. Crisis Has Both Political and Ethnic Origins </H5>   Let us remind ourselves of what Rwanda was before President  Habyarimana's assassination. After years of ethnic tension and  of struggle for political power, there was some hope: The  president, the moderate Hutus and the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic  Front] had accepted talks and envisioned a sharing of power,  thereby renouncing the temptation of military confrontation.  The Arusha accords of 4 August 1993, to which France had  contributed by persuading the Rwandan head of state to open up  the political system and by organizing the initial contacts  between the authorities and the RPF, are proof of this. Those  who, in both camps, did not want these accords, precisely  because they left a chance for peace and ruled out a military  solution, did everything possible to delay their implementation.  Everything, including the irreparable act: The assassination  of the president who had accepted the voice of moderation.    Today Rwanda is confronted with a conflict which is both  ethnic and political. We have to use the word genocide, as the  active militia in the government zones are indeed intent on  killing Tutsis -- men, women, children, the injured, and  religious -- by the sole virtue of their ethnic origin. But at  the same time, a merciless fight for power is being waged, in  which the moderates have been the first victims of the Hutu  extremists and in which the RPF's military wing has opted for  total victory without concessions.  <H5>  2. International Community Has Demonstrated Culpable </H5> Passivity    None of this is tolerable. And everybody involved in this  chaos carries his share of responsibility. France, people are  quick to say, but not France alone. The policy which our  governments have carried out for a number of years in Rwanda is  certainly not infallible. The hundreds of thousands of victims  in Rwanda for whom we weep today demonstrate the tragic limits  of this. But one cannot tolerate any suspicion of the spirit in  which French diplomacy worked in Rwanda.    France has never supported one Rwandan tribe against  another.  It has not ceased to hammer home one self-evident fact: There  can be no military solution in Rwanda, nor can there be a  political solution which consists of one single party  confiscating power from all the others. This was true for  President Habyarimana's party and still applies just us much to  the RPF. There will be no durable settlement outside a sharing  of power. This position of principle runs counter to those who,  in both camps, dream of governing alone and without dialogue.  If we did indeed manage to convince President Habyarimana to  accept this compromise, the extremists in his clan did not  intend things to be this way and acted to prevent the president  from seriously implementing the Arusha accords.    But had the international community sought sufficient  assurances that these accords would be implemented? I do not  believe so. A year ago, France diplomacy led an intense  campaign to enhance awareness, calling for the sending in of a  UN force as provided for in what were to become the Arusha  accords. Let us say it: International indifference toward  Rwanda was at that time total. It took months for the United  Nations to take up position on the Ugandan border, and then to  set up the first UN Assistance Mission to Rwanda (UNAMIR) and  have it leave for Kigali. Where are we today? Have the states  involved (Security Council members, countries of the region)  really learned the lessons of the drama which is being played  out in Rwanda? I would like to believe so. The strengthened  UNAMIR is not yet in the field. Let us not accuse the United  Nations: This requires soldiers, and if African countries have  answered courageously to the call, they have to be equipped.  The French Government has released 20 million francs [Fr] for  this purpose. I hope that other countries will follow suite and  will act quickly. Nothing should be allowed to hold up the  deployment of blue helmets, which is the one thing which will  make it possible to save lives.    3. French Diplomacy Favors Political Settlement    It is not enough to call for the presence of one's United  Nations in order to give oneself a good conscience. One must  act. France was the first country to mobilize substantial aid,  which has today exceeded Fr30 million, and to get it to those to  whom it is destined: air lifts, support to the Red Cross, the  UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees], to NGO's  [non-government organizations], sending infrastructures to  refugee camps, setting up an antenna of the world SAMU [Medical  Emergency Ambulance Service]. No means, no channel has been  neglected in order to come to the assistance of the civilian  populations.    But humanitarian aid without a political program is quickly  limited. We have successfully presented our views on a solution  to the Rwandan crisis to the Security Council. We have also  spelled it out to the countries close to Rwanda, by sending  Jean-Michel Marlaud, our ambassador to Rwanda, whom I had  personally mandated for this essential mission, to meet with  their authorities. At the OAU meeting in Tunis, France urged a  meeting of the heads of those African states which are the most  concerned, which finally happened.    If France declared itself in favor of a rapid meeting of the  heads of states neighboring on Rwanda, it is because interaction  between the countries of the region and the permeability of  borders are a reality which cannot be ignored and which can  either play a pacifying role or which, on the contrary, can  contribute to a general conflagration. Right now Tanzania and  Burundi are being subjected to flows of refugees, and for these  countries, the risks of destabilization are high. It would be  particularly unjust if the sense of responsibility which has  been demonstrated by Burundi's leaders since the outset of the  crisis were to breached by contagion from extremists. With  regard to Uganda and Zaire, it is essential that their leaders  demonstrate the same constructive spirit and take every  necessary measure to avoid the conflict being fueled from their  territories. A mandatory arms embargo has been voted by the  Security Council with our full support. It should be respected  by everyone.  <H5>  4. Rwanda's Future Requires Us To Support Moderates in All </H5> Parties    What will be the future for Rwanda? A cease-fire and an end  to the massacres must come before anything else. It will also  be necessary to create the conditions for a return of the  refugees. The United Nations will be able to make a major  contribution here. Then there will be the need to pick up the  political dialogue again, whatever the military situation on the  ground. I hope that the desire for peace will win the day, and  with it the concern for national reconciliation between Rwandans  of goodwill. This naturally excludes those who have committed,  encouraged, or provided cover for massacres. Above everything  else, they must be identified in order to exclude them from any  negotiations on the future of a country which they have  contributed to destroying. France will show no good will toward  the murderers or those who gave them their orders. France,  which is the only Western country represented at ministerial  level at the extraordinary session of the Commission for Human  Rights at Geneva, demands that those responsible for these  genocides be tried.    France will support those moderates who, despite the  persecution which they have been subjected to, have survived --  and, France is proud to say, in many cases with our help -- and  are ready to play their part once the conditions have once again  been created. They will not be able to achieve this on their  own. It is the duty of the international community to protect  them, to support them, and to make sure that their voice is  heard, and that the voice of every extremist is silenced.    Ours is a genuine duty to intervene in Rwanda. It is no  longer enough to deplore the massacres with our arms folded, but  it is time to take initiatives. The urgent need for  international intervention should lead us to demonstrate  imagination and courage. If the UNAMIR is slow in arriving in  Rwanda, why not use a part of the 18,000 blue helmets which are  still in Somalia, and which could reach Kigali quickly? I have  proposed this plan to the UN secretary general, who is in favor  in principle. We are working actively on getting it implemented  via our permanent representative in New York.    If all this proves insufficient, France is ready, along with  its main European and African partners, to prepare an  intervention on the ground in order to put an end to the  massacres and to protect the populations threatened with  extermination.    No solution should be ruled out in order to bring the  Rwandan  tragedy to an end. France should play its full part in this  effort.</p>

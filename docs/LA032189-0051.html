			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORK ON I-5 IS DELAYED BY SHORTAGE OF FUNDS  </P> <P> Construction on portions of the massive Interstate 5 widening project in Orange  County will be delayed at least three months because of a shortage in state  highway funds, California Department of Transportation officials said Monday.  </P> <P> By accelerating construction and administrative procedures, officials said they  may still be able to finish the project on time, although the initial delay  will exhaust what little leeway had been built into the schedule.  </P> <P> "Of all our projects this is the one we're most concerned about," said Keith  McKean, director of Caltrans District 12 in Orange County.  </P> <P> The project is one of many throughout the state that has been identified by  department officials as being subject to delay because of a projected  $3.2-billion shortage in state transportation funds. Officials disclosed last  week that the shortages would force them to begin cutting back projects in  July, but at that time they did not specify which projects were to be affected.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Possible Postponement  </P> <P> In Los Angeles County, meanwhile, officials said there were no projects that  would immediately be affected by the new policy. In San Diego County, officials  said, the final stages of construction on two freeway interchanges face  possible postponement.  </P> <P> "The projects we have identified really cover the whole length and breadth of  the state -- rural and urban, north and south," Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago  said.  </P> <P> McKean said his concern in Orange County is that the delays could affect the  sequencing of construction along Interstate 5 so that some stages of the  project may be completed ahead of others, thus creating traffic bottlenecks.  </P> <P> The project will widen Interstate 5 -- one of the county's two major  north-south arteries -- from six to 10 lanes except in areas where auxiliary  lanes will be constructed to make it 12 lanes across. The freeway is one of the  most congested in Southern California.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Revised Schedule  </P> <P> The widening from Interstate 405 to California Highway 55 was divided into four  projects. Originally, the first contract was to be advertised for bidding in  April, with the remaining to follow at two-week intervals. Contracts on all  four projects were to have been awarded by the end of May.  </P> <P> Under a revised schedule, McKean said the first project, from Interstate 405 to  California Highway 133, will not be advertised until May. The second stage,  from Highway 133 north to Jeffrey Road, will be advertised in June and the  final two stages, from Jeffrey Road to Jamboree Boulevard and Jamboree to  Highway 55, in August or September.  </P> <P> McKean said highway officials also fear that there may be delays in two other  Orange County projects -- the extension of the Costa Mesa Freeway (California  Highway 55) from Wilson Street to 19th Street and the second stage of the  reconstruction of the Interstate 5-Costa Mesa Freeway interchange from  Interstate 5 north to 17th Street.  </P> <P> In San Diego County, officials said the final stage of construction of an  interchange at Interstate 5 and California Highway 54 and an interchange at  Interstate 8 and California Highway 125 may be delayed because of the money  shortages.  </P> <P> Drago said the delays in Northern California, where weather affects  construction, may be more serious than the delays in Southern California.  </P> <P> For example, he said, a project that may be postponed from April until August  may be nearing the end of the construction season. When temperatures drop to a  certain point, he said, concrete cannot be poured, and when the ground becomes  frozen earthwork cannot be completed.  </P> <P> All the projects, he said, are still subject to final approval by the  California Transportation Commission, which ultimately decides which ones will  be advertised for bidding on schedule and which ones will not. He said those  that are delayed in one bidding period will probably be given first priority in  the next period.  </P></p>

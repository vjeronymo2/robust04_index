			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 4 KYODO -- The ruling coalition said  Tuesday [4 January] it will try to complete debate on political  reform at a House of Councillors special committee January 14  even if the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)  boycotts the session.    Senior officials of the seven-party coalition reached the  consensus at a meeting in a Diet building after Shoji Motooka,  chairman of the upper house panel on political reform, decided  to resume discussion on the government's reform package  Wednesday.    Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social Democratic  Party  who moderated the meeting, told a news conference he hopes the  LDP will participate in the committee debate but said the  coalition would go ahead with reform discussion without the LDP.    At a meeting of governing and opposition directors of the  upper house panel, the LDP objected to the coalition's call for  Wednesday's resumption of deliberations on the reform bills but  Motooka decided to reopen panel business to speed up the  long-delayed debate, Diet officials said.    The government reform package cleared the House of  Representatives in mid-November but deliberations in the upper  house stalled for over a month through late December due partly  to the LDP's refusal to attend the reform panel session. Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has staked his political future on  enactment of the reform package in the current extraordinary  Diet session, which ends January 29.</p>

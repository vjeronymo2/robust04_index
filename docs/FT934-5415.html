			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: A restriction on exercise of choice Sir, It is heartening that Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of the Office of Fair Trading, has decided that the OFT should investigate the net book agreement ('Book pricing scheme faces review', November 24). The timing of his announcement is impeccable. While the industry is purporting to defend the public interest with its 'don't tax reading' campaign, he has highlighted the degree of self-interest that the campaign is also serving. Based on experience elsewhere, the freeing of book prices from the grip of the publishers would do at least as much to promote literature as the tax break. Regardless of the direct costs and benefits, however, the current situation is both economically and politically unacceptable. It has a negative impact upon competition from other modes of communication and reflects a view that taxpayers should be restricted in their ability to exercise their own choices. Even if the publishing industry does manage to survive this latest attempt on its empire, at least the inquiry will raise public awareness of ways in which we are subsidising it, not only through taxation but through prices.

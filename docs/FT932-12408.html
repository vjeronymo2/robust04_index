			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Convertible Pounds 90m issue from Forte FORTE, the UK hotels and restaurants group, yesterday announced a Pounds 90m convertible bond issue due 2008 and paying 6.75 per cent interest. It said this would help to lengthen the maturity of its debt, which stood at a net Pounds 1.28bn - gearing of 48 per cent - in January. It also eased the average interest rate paid to less than 9 per cent. Last year's interest bill of Pounds 128m was less than twice covered by Pounds 200m trading profits. The new bond is unsecured and subordinate to other debt. The conversion price is 223p, a premium of 15.5 per cent over the market level at the time of pricing. Yesterday, the stock shed 2p to close at 194 1/2 p. At the year-end, Forte had Pounds 534m of borrowings due within one year. This issue, plus February's 25-year Pounds 200m debenture issue, more than halves that figure.</p>

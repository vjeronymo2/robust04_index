Addressing attendees, the brother chairman said: We should  transcend trivialities and be as great as the homeland is.  [words indistinct]. He said that the command of the general  People's Congress has welcomed and supported the document that  has been drafted by the National Dialogue Committee, and that it  has blessed it in its entirety. He said: What is left to be  done is to translate the document into action. Our brothers in  the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], led by brother 'Ali Salim  al-Bid, cabinet members, and all YSP leaders should return to  Sanaa, the political capital of unified Yemen to exercise their  executive and constitutional tasks until the crisis ends  forever. This is in response to the aspirations of our Yemeni  people and to the national interest.    He urged the political forces and sons of the homeland to  transcend trivialities [words indistinct] for the sake of the  Yemen of 22 May 1990 and to help the dialogue committee  implement its missions to enable the homeland to reach the  shores of safety. He urged political forces to respond to the  demands of the masses and to adopt their concerns and represent  their aspirations and respect their will. He said that this is  only possible when everyone renounces selfish interests and  advocates the supreme interests of the Yemeni masses and  homeland.    The brother president urged the executive authority and all  workers in all governorates [words indistinct] and government  institutions and facilities to give up passiveness and laxity,  to work harder, and to stop attributing their passiveness to the  political crisis. He also urged political forces and all sons  of the homeland to support and advise their people to maintain  security, stability, tranquility, and national unity. He  blessed all the decisions and recommendations contained in the  statements issued by the expanded popular gatherings in the  capital and in the governorates of al-Bayda', Dhimar, Sa'dah and  all governorates of the republic. He said: We bless those  decisions which reflect a great national sense and strong  eagerness to adhere to the national constants and to preserve  the country's achievements, at the head of which are unity and  democracy. He indicated that through unity, our people have  turned over the leaf of agonies and tragedies, and that through  unity, the status of the Yemeni people and Yemen has become  greater in the eyes of the world. He said: Today, we should be  stronger. We should not bend our heads before the wicked plots  against unity, security, stability, and peace in our country.    The brother president praised the move undertaken by the  sons  of al-Bayda' Governorate to hold a general reconciliation among  the sons of the governorate to end acts of revenge. He also  praised their work to achieve security, stability, and the  supremacy of the law. He called for such a reconciliation at  the national level throughout Yemen to end acts of revenge and  spare Yemeni blood.    A number of brothers also spoke on behalf of the expanded  popular gatherings of the population of the capital and the  governorates of al-Bayda', Dhimar, and Sa'dah. They expressed  the people's happiness with and support for the document of  pledge and accord that has been drafted by the National Dialogue  Committee. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / India mines Kashmir ceasefire line to stop Moslem militants INDIAN troops have mined the ceasefire line in Kashmir and the Pakistani army yesterday blocked roads on its side of the disputed border in an attempt to prevent Moslem militants crossing into Indian-held Kashmir, K K Sharma reports from New Delhi and Reuter reports from Muzaffarabad, Pakistan. The Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) said thousands of its unarmed supporters would cross the United Nations-monitored ceasefire line from Pakistan today to express solidarity with Kashmiris fighting to secede from India. Pakistani paramilitary troops have set off landslides, erected barricades and dismantled bridges to try to stop the militants reaching the Indian side. At least eight people were injured and 40 arrested yesterday in scuffles with police who stopped caravans of buses. The JKLF leader, Mr Amanullah Khan - whose group is unpopular in Pakistan because it also advocates independence for the one-third of Kashmir ruled by Islamabad - told a rally of 3,000 supporters that he would die rather than abandon the march. Kashmir has been divided by the ceasefire line since the 1971 India-Pakistan war. Both countries claim the whole state over which they have twice gone to war. In India, the government placed border troops on high alert and warned that marchers who violate the ceasefire line would be shot. Land mines were planted on Saturday along a 280km strip of border land and Mr BS Bedi, director-general of police, said a curfew was in force in three districts of the Kashmir Valley. Indian ministers have warned that any crossing would 'invite decisive retaliation.' The Indian government appears unconvinced by Pakistan's pledge to stop the crossing.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Up to Date" newscast] </F>   [Text] President Alfredo Cristiani today assured people  that the charges made by opposition political parties regarding  possible technical fraud during the 20 March elections only seek  to mar the electoral process.    The ghost of possible fraud continues to hover in the  atmosphere a few days before the elections take place.  Nevertheless, this was ruled out today by President Cristiani  who assured us there is no basis for fraud charges, rather these  charges are generated by groups that foresee a negative result  in the elections.    [Begin Cristiani recording] In my opinion, this is a totally  wrong strategy that seeks to mar an electoral process that has  been open and has complied with everything. With regard to the  UN remarks, I believe these are simple excuses given what the  results could be. [end recording]    As far as the problem reported by the FMLN [Farabundo Marti  National Liberation Front] on the transfer of voting places in  several hamlets in the Chalatenango Department, President  Cristiani said that the highest electoral institution was clear  that this action is not intended to adversely harm or [word  indistinct] any particular political party.    [Begin Cristiani recording] As has been explained, in four  Chalatenango municipalities the population resides in the  department's capital city -- at the seat in Chalatenango. More  people would have to travel if the voting takes place in the  municipalities than would have to travel from the municipalities  to Chalatenango given that the voting document indicates the  voting place. [end recording]    Cristiani told the media that the people should feel assured  because there will be 900 Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador]  observers and approximately 3,000 independent observers, who in  his opinion will be the witnesses to the election's transparency.</p>

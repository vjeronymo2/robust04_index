			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Stabilising Europe TODAY IN Helsinki, President Boris Yeltsin, with six of the seven world leaders who confronted him in Munich, will be joined by those of 44 other member states of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). From the dispiriting contemplation of the world economy they will turn to the even more alarming spectacle of conflict spreading rapidly across the former communist world. The 'new era of democracy, peace and unity', proclaimed at the last CSCE summit in Paris less than two years ago (when there were only 34 members), can hardly yet be said to have fulfilled its promise. The deliberately light institutional structure set up at that time has been powerless to prevent the outbreak and gradual extension of war in the former Yugoslavia. In fact, it assigned responsibility for attempting that task to a supposedly more solid entity, the European Community, which has done much but achieved all too little. But the CSCE did make one decision yesterday which should help to define its future role: by refusing for the time being to admit the new 'Yugoslavia', it affirmed its character as an organisation based not on universality (like the UN) but on a community of values. A state that fails to respect those values cannot expect to participate as of right. But the biggest test of the CSCE's effectiveness will be the multiple conflicts now erupting in the former Soviet Union, described in detail in an article on this page. The most dangerous of these involve Russian minorities in non-Russian republics; and indeed practically all the violent conflicts now visible or predictable in central and eastern Europe concern national minorities - people who feel threatened by their inclusion in a state which does not respect their national identity, and yet are often denied their rights by that state precisely because it regards them as a threat to its integrity. By far the best way to defuse such conflicts is by convincing both sides, before they come to blows, that their security can be better ensured by negotiation and agreement than by secession or the use of force. The new CSCE Commissioner on National Minorities should be able to achieve that, in some cases, by ensuring that minority problems are taken seriously before they erupt into outright war. The Helsinki document also makes important and detailed provisions for peacekeeping forces, and formally proclaims the CSCE a 'regional organisation' under Chapter VIII of the UN Charter. But none of this is likely to achieve stability in the volatile conditions which now prevail. The organisation needs to acquire some of the clout which has lately been given to the UN by the leadership of the Security Council, with its five permanent members. In 1989-90, some leaders of newly free central European countries proposed something like this, but were firmly rebuffed by Nato. In the light of present conditions, the idea should be looked at again.</p>

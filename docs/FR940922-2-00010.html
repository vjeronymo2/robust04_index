Respondent argues that the Department's decision to use the best information available (BIA) for these orchards set-up costs grossly exaggerates their value. Respondent maintains that a purchaser of an established orchard does not bear directly any set-up costs, since those costs were borne by the original establisher of the orchard. Respondent asserts that a purchaser's total cost for an orchard is the price the purchaser paid to the seller of the property and that a portion of that purchase price attributable to capital improvements is effectively the purchaser's set-up cost. That is, respondent contends, the difference in value between the raw land and the land with an established orchard represents the value to the purchaser of the set-up costs incurred by the original owner. Moreover, respondent points out that for most growers the Department has valued the set-up cost of the orchard at more than the price paid for the entire farm. Respondent notes that growers reported the actual amortized value of the orchard based on their purchase prices for the land and the orchard. Respondent contends that this reporting methodology was obtained from land valuation reports prepared by private appraisers and was not challenged by the Department in its supplemental questionnaire. Furthermore, respondent maintains that it is not clear what facts or information the Department believes were withheld by those growers who, in the Department's view, failed to provide actual set-up costs as those growers could not report ``actual'' set-up costs given that they did not incur any such costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners contest respondent's assertion that the Department ought to adopt a ``purchase price'' methodology for deriving the orchard set-up costs for growers who purchased already established orchards. Petitioners argue that the fact that a reasonable imputed set-up cost for some of these farms meets or exceeds their recent purchase price simply demonstrates that kiwifruit properties in New Zealand are depressed. Furthermore, petitioners maintain that the purchase price of these farms does not represent the costs of developing the kiwifruit operation. According to petitioners, respondent ignores the fact that set-up costs are allocated over the useful life of the orchard and that allocation of a purchase price established after the set-up period would understate actual set-up costs for a kiwifruit orchard by allowing allocation of a mere ``remnant value'' to be substituted for the actual set-up costs. Petitioners agree with the Department's decision to apply BIA to reflect the set-up costs associated with kiwifruit production.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

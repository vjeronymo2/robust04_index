			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Yeltsin takes power from local councils RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin subordinated all councils to regional administrators at the weekend, in a further effort to clear the political landscape of institutions and movements presenting a challenge to his presidential rule. He also decreed that a special commission would work out a sweeping reform of local government by this Friday. The head of the commission and its members have not yet been announced. At the same time, he extended the state of emergency and the Moscow curfew until next Sunday. The curfew will now begin an hour later, at midnight, but will continue to run until 5am. No demonstrations had been reported in Moscow by yesterday evening, following a statement by Gen Alexander Kulikov, Moscow City commandant, on Saturday, saying that any attempts to organise demonstrations would be rigorously suppressed. Meanwhile, the fate of the thousands of councils, ranging from the parliaments of territories larger than many countries to small town councils, remains unclear. But it seems likely they will be swept away, to be re-elected at the same time as, or soon after, the new federal parliament. Leaders of the democratic movements are now engaged in intensive negotiations with each other ahead of the Federal Assembly elections, due in December. The main movement, Russia's Choice, led by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, is trying to construct 'dream tickets' of prominent radicals to stand on allied lists. Mr Sergei Yuzhenkov, a close ally of Mr Gaidar's and deputy head of the Federal Information Service, said at the weekend he was holding talks with Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, the economist and presidential candidate, and Mr Sergei Shakhrai, the deputy prime minister, with the aim of persuading them to join Mr Gaidar as leaders of Russia's Choice for the election campaign. Mr Yuzhenkov said: 'Mr Yavlinsky knows the centre (on which he had previously counted for support) is now too compromised after its support of the White House and will not provide a base for him.' Mr Shakhrai, who also has presidential ambitions, has recently threatened to resign because of Mr Yeltsin's moves against the regions and his refusal to hold a meeting of the Federation Council, the body which groups together the regional administrators and council leaders. He has tried to build up his own party, based on the regions. However, democrat leaders believe he will seek a pact with Mr Gaidar. Mr Sergei Vassiliev, head of the government's Economic Reform Centre, said: 'Mr Shakhrai's decision to go alone would hurt Gaidar, but not as much as it would hurt Shakhrai'. Mr Yuzhenkov, the main strategist for the Russia's Choice bloc, said he hoped other pro-democratic blocs would put up similar leading candidates to head their lists, so that a number of blocs with similar views could be elected and produce a parliament with a pro-reform majority. One list would be provided by the Democratic Russia movement, which has yet to choose its leaders, and a third could be headed by Mr Anatoly Sobchak, mayor of St Petersburg and Mr Gavril Popov, former mayor of Moscow. Can Yeltsin be a democrat and a reformer? Page 4</p>

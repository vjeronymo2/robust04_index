			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Steamrolling corporate Names plan is not justified Sir, Richard Lapper ('Lure of profits tempts corporate Names', September 8) is quite right to sound a note of caution about existing Names' approval of Lloyd's rules for corporate Names. The action groups, which are well organised and command more than half the voting membership of Lloyd's, do not believe that the need for corporate capital in 1994 is sufficiently acute to justify steamrolling the new proposals in advance of evidence that Lloyd's will be producing an acceptable settlement of Names' present claims for negligence and breach of contract. Although the admission of corporate capital must be regarded as a sensible long-term measure, it must be at the right time and in the right way. Unless assurances are forthcoming, the membership may well decide to vote down the council's proposals at the EGM on October 20. Alan Porter, chairman, the Cuthbert Heath Names Association, chairman, the Devonshire Names Action Group, 2 Magenta House, 85 Whitechapel Road, London E1 1DU</p>

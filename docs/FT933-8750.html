			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / International Company News: Ferfin investors see shares plummet SHARES in Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), Italy's second-biggest private sector company, collapsed on the Milan bourse yesterday as investors tried to put a value on the debt-laden group's equity. Trading closed at L299. Ferfin's shares last traded at L417.80 on Monday before being suspended in advance of plans to slash the nominal share price to L5 from L1,000. Yesterday's official price, based on the day's average, was L224.40, after the shares opened at L101. Separately, bank creditors to the group, which had total borrowings of L28,838bn (Dollars 17.83bn) at the end of May, were told a rescue package, expected later this month, would not be unveiled until mid-September. Ferfin's share price has perplexed even hardened professionals on the volatile Milan bourse. Although large write-downs in the nominal value of shares are not unknown - it has happened twice in the past 20 years to the Montedison industrial group, now controlled by Ferfin - there has never been a write-down on this scale. The country's leading shareholders' association told members to hold their stock, in spite of the selling wave. The gap between supply and demand meant it took 90 minutes to set an opening price. The crisis began in late May, when the company revealed that total borrowings had risen to about L31,000bn at the end of 1992. A five-member committee of bank creditors, called in by the Ferruzzi family and Ferfin's former managers, uncovered a range of financial irregularities, leading to a sharp upwards revision of Ferfin's and Montedison's losses. Separately, arrests by magistrates investigating the 18-month political corruption scandal found Montedison had allegedly paid kickbacks of about L135bn to politicians during the former Enimont chemicals joint venture with the state-owned Eni group. The small savers' association called for an investigation into why Ferfin, which allegedly ran a separate set of books, was not more strictly supervised. The association wants to know why the three independent representatives at the company, required under Italian law, were unaware of the alleged irregularities. Shareholders have also criticised Price Waterhouse, Ferfin's auditors, which certified its 1992 accounts. In June, Price Waterhouse withdrew its certification when signs of alleged fraud emerged. Consob, the companies and stock market watchdog, has also been attacked for not acting sooner. Lex, Page 14</p>

			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average weakens in lowest volume of the year TRADING volume was the lowest of the year yesterday as investors remained absent on uncertainty regarding both the future course of the strong yen and the government's policy in reviving the economy, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average slipped 193.12 to 20,414.14, its fifth consecutive decline, having opened at the day's high of 20,595.26 before easing steadily during the session to hit the day's low of 20,384.44 just before the close. Volume was 139.3m shares, below the previous year's low of 140.7m shares registered on July 5. Declines led advances by 742 to 217, with 194 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 15.01 to 1,644.18 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index softened 1.52 to 1,254.44. Foreign investors were small-lot buyers, but some banks were seen taking profits on their long-term portfolios ahead of the September mid-term book closing. Dealers were also seen selling as this is the final week for August delivery. Investors, hoping that the first policy speech in the afternoon by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, would present measures to boost the economy, were disappointed. Mr Hosokawa expressed concern but failed to map out specific measures. Meanwhile, the yen once again strengthened on buying by exporters in spite of active intervention by the Bank of Japan. The dollar yesterday closed Y1.10 down at Y103.35. Fading prospects of a cut in the official discount rate hurt financial issues. Bank of Yokohama, the day's most active issue, lost Y10 to Y1,110, Bank of Tokyo fell Y70 to Y1,640 and Fuji Bank shed Y60 to Y2,370. Telecommunication shares were lower: Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone dropped Y7,000 to Y936,000 on reports that it might delay the commercialisation of its next-generation communications network. KDD, the international telecom company, fell Y500 to Y11,800 on plans for a rate cut in international calls this October. Ricoh, which was supported last week on its technology for turning copied paper into blank pages, receded Y7 to Y808 on profit-taking. In Osaka, the OSE average declined 157.29 to 22,377.34 in volume of 35.8m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, went against the trend, rising Y310 to Y9,710 on reports that it is developing a new generation of video game hardware. Roundup THE WEEK began with a mixture of profit-taking and record highs in New Zealand and Manila. Bombay was closed for a public holiday. HONG KONG shed 2 per cent as the banking sector continued to fall back following last week's disappointing results from Hang Seng Bank, down HKDollars 2 at HKDollars 55.50. HSBC Holdings, the parent group, also lost HKDollars 2, to HKDollars 81.50. The Hang Seng index slipped 156.94 to 7,388.4, just above the day's low. Swire Pacific, which reports this week, declined HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 39 on forecasts of poor results. SINGAPORE retreated from all-time highs at the close as investors took profits. The Straits Times Industrial index gave up a net 7.78 at 1,964.49, having seen an intra-day record high of 1,982.39. Brokers pointed out that Malaysian shares traded over the counter were sold on news that the country's finance minister would make a challenge for the deputy president's post in November. In KUALA LUMPUR the reports of the challenge also gave investors an incentive to take profits and the composite index eased 0.25 to 805.26 in volume of 365.4m shares. NEW ZEALAND continued its rally, the NZSE-40 capital index finishing at its highest level since January 1990. Among the actives, Carter Holt Harvey advanced 7 cents to NZDollars 3.49 and Brierley Investments 3 cents to NZDollars 1.18. The index gained 8.85 at 2,027.37 in turnover of NZDollars 60.1m. Fletcher Challenge met renewed profit-taking, easing 4 cents to NZDollars 3.66, but the shares still remain 22 per cent up following the good results last week. AUSTRALIA was moderately firmer as many investors consolidated positions after last week's strong gains. The All Ordinaries index closed 5.7 higher at 1,932.8 in turnover of ADollars 391.4m. Strong buy orders from Hong Kong lifted BHP 14 cents to ADollars 15.50. News Corp, which reports tomorrow, added 10 cents at ADollars 9.30. MANILA rose to record levels again, led by Philippine Long Distance Telephone, which climbed 25 pesos to 1,190 pesos. The composite index put on 20.29 at 1,783.30 in turnover of 429m pesos. SEOUL was easier as profit-taking was seen among large-capitalisation issues. The composite index finished 7.33 down at 727.06 in turnover of Won309.9bn.</p>

			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Braves and Beef: Hank Aaron thinks about roast beef as well as baseball. The  home run king, who is now an executive with the Atlanta Braves, is buying  Arby's franchises and plans to have nine of the fast-food restaurants by the  end of the year, according to Success magazine. Aaron gets former teammates to  come out to the openings of the restaurants and each one features Aaron  memorabilia. "Being my own boss has been a wonderful experience for me," Aaron  says.  </P> <P> Revealing Work: In a capital city full of advocates, the new year has unveiled  a new lobbyist who promotes only the bare facts. Kevin Kearney is the first  paid and registered lobbyist in Washington representing nudists. Kearney, 38,  is the spokesman for the 35,000-member American Sunbathing Assn. "No, I'm not a  nudist," he says, "but I guess I'm becoming one. I got nude at their convention  last year -- for business purposes." Kearney says his group lobbies only for  "non-sexual" fun such as "hot tubbing and skinny-dipping." A major part of his  lobbying job is to persuade officials in charge of public parks and forests  officials to permit "clothing-optional" areas. "Finding a champion in Congress  is a problem," Kearney said. "But we'll find one."  </P> <P> There Goes the Neighborhood: Putting together a defense for Manuel Noriega  hasn't been the only problem facing Miami lawyer Frank Rubino lately. The city  has been trying to boot Rubino out of his Coconut Grove law office because it's  in a residential area. Rubino's request for a change in the zoning laws was  scheduled to go before city officials Monday night. Long before Noriega was  sent to Miami to stand trial on cocaine trafficking charges, Coconut Grove  residents complained that they didn't want Rubino's criminal clientele coming  to their neighborhood. Rubino told board members that if his rezoning request  is defeated, he might have to convert the office into a home. "Their worst  fears could come true," Rubino said. "I could move in."

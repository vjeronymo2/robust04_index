			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LAGUNA HILLS CASHES IN CHANCES FOR 41-7 VICTORY  </P> <P> Laguna Hills High School got the maximum number of points from a minimum amount  of effort Thursday night.  </P> <P> The Hawks were handed opportunity after opportunity by Costa Mesa and the  result was a 41-7 Pacific Coast League victory in front of 1,000 at Mission  Viejo High School.  </P> <P> "I'm not sure we really played that well," Laguna Hills Coach Steve Bresnahan  said.  </P> <P> The Hawks (4-3 overall, 2-0 in league play) scored six touchdowns, four on  drives of fewer than 32 yards. In fact, three of them were fewer than 14 yards  and two of those began inside the Costa Mesa 10-yard line.  </P> <P> Costa Mesa (0-7, 0-2) fumbled seven times, losing two. Mustang quarterback Mike  Cutler also threw four interceptions.  </P> <P> Darrin Chapman touched the ball only seven times, but scored four touchdowns in  various ways. He gave the Hawks an early lead with a 29-yard touchdown  reception that capped a 77-yard drive, the only sustained effort Laguna Hills  had to make.  </P> <P> Chapman scored on runs of 18 and five yards. He also returned a kickoff 75  yards for a touchdown.  </P></p>

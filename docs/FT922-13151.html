			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / FT Law Report: Fayed disciplinary decision stands REGINA v PANEL ON TAKEOVERS AND MERGERS, EX PARTE FAYED AND OTHERS Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Neill, Lord Justice Scott and Lord Justice Steyn): April 3 1992 A PERSON who is subject to disciplinary proceedings by the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers has no legitimate expectation that the Panel will await the outcome of pending litigation against him before conducting those proceedings; and the court will not intervene to halt the proceedings if there is no arguable case that they would be likely to prejudice the conduct or trial of the litigation. The Court of Appeal so held when refusing an application by Mr Mohammed Al Fayed and his two brothers for leave to apply for judicial review of a decision of the Take-Over Panel not to adjourn disciplinary proceedings brought against the Fayed's by the Panel executive. LORD JUSTICE NEILL said that in November 1984 the Fayed brothers acquired a 29.9 per cent stake in House of Fraser Ltd, through a subsidiary of their Liechtenstein company. The subsidiary, which changed its name to House of Fraser (Holdings), bought the shares from Lonrho plc. Lonrho had for some time been attempting to acquire control of House of Fraser but had not been able to complete the purchase because of an undertaking given to the secretary of state for industry not to acquire more than 30 per cent pending determination of a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. On March 4 1985, Holdings announced a cash offer for the balance of the House of Fraser share capital. Under the rules in the City Code on Take-Overs and Mergers, an offeror who already held 29.9 per cent of the shares in a company was not permitted to acquire shares in the market until seven days after announcement of the bid. On March 11, Holdings bought sufficient shares in the market to bring its holding to more than 50 per cent. On March 14, the secretary of state announced that the merger would not be referred to the MMC. As a result, Holdings was able to acquire House of Fraser by the end of March. On March 10 1987, Lonrho issued a writ against the Fayeds, Holdings and some of their advisers. It alleged that Holdings and the Fayeds induced the secretary of state to refrain from referring the proposed acquisition to the MMC by means of false and fraudulent representations about themselves and their background and their source of finance. It claimed for the lost opportunity to acquire House of Fraser by bidding for the shares without competition, and sought damages for interference with business by unlawful means. On April 9 1987, DTI inspectors were appointed to investigate the affairs of Holdings, and to look at the circumstances surrounding acquisition of the shares. On July 23 1988, the inspectors reported to the secretary of state. On March 7 1990, the report was published. It was severely critical of the Fayeds, and attracted publicity. In January 1991, the director-general of the Panel wrote to Mr Fayed stating that the report contained evidence which suggested there might have been breaches of General Principle 12 of the City Code. He said the Panel was focusing on the content of three press releases, and the offer document of March 23 1985. General principle 12 was that 'any document . . . addressed to shareholders containing information . . . shall . . . be treated with the highest standards of care and accuracy'. On November 1, the date for the disciplinary hearing was agreed for December 6. On November 11, Mr Fayed's solicitors raised the possibility that they would seek an adjournment on the ground that the Panel's finding might prejudice their clients' position in the 1987 litigation. They said they understood the Panel's practice was to defer action until litigation was resolved. On November 15 the Panel's secretary replied. In paragraph two, his letter said there was no established practice which automatically required the executive to defer action on potential breaches of the Code until litigation was resolved, and that each case was determined on its facts. He said in the light of publication of the inspectors' findings, the executive did not consider that a ruling by the Panel would prejudice the Fayeds' position in the litigation. The application for an adjournment was heard by the Panel on December 6 and was refused. An appeal was dismissed by the appeal committee on December 18. The Fayeds issued High Court proceedings seeking leave to apply for judicial review. The application was dismissed. On the present application for leave, the Fayeds' primary argument was that the disciplinary proceedings should be adjourned until after the hearing of the 1987 action. The action would probably be heard early in 1994. Mr Oliver for the Fayeds submitted that conduct and trial of the 1987 action would be prejudiced if the disciplinary proceedings were not adjourned. He argued inter alia that the Fayeds would be denied a legitimate expectation based on an extract from the Panel's 1977 annual report, which said: 'The Panel would normally consider it inappropriate to pursue an investigation into the conduct of parties to a takeover or merger at a time when that conduct is the subject of legal proceedings . . .' It was said the Fayeds had a legitimate expectation that that policy would be followed unless good reasons showed the case was exceptional, and that there was no such reason. The argument was flawed for a number of reasons: (a) A general statement of the kind made in the extract from the 1977 report could not by itself give rise to a legitimate expectation of anything. The statement was at large and not directed to any particular group. (b) The Panel was free to change its practice at any time without notice. The legitimate expectation doctrine could not be used to restrict its right to adopt what it considered the proper practice in the individual case. (c) 'Legitimate expectation' was a particular manifestation of the duty to act fairly. In the present case, where there were no binding rules to be observed, a legitimate expectation could amount to no more than a right to be treated fairly. (d) The Panel's executive had, in fact, given a reason for not following the 'usual practice' in paragraph two of the secretary's letter of November 15 1991. The court could intervene to prevent injustice where continuation of one set of proceedings might prejudice the fair trial of another. But it was a power which had to be exercised with great care, and only where there was a real risk of serious prejudice which might lead to injustice. There was no arguable case that there was any real risk to the conduct of the 1987 action or to the fairness of the trial. There were no arguable grounds for judicial review. The application for leave for dismissed. LORD JUSTICE SCOTT concurring, accepted that generally a tribunal carrying out a quasi-judicial function ought not to depart in an individual case from its general rules of procedure without good reason. That proposition was based not on 'legitimate expectation' but on the principle that a tribunal ought in general apply the same procedural rules to similar cases unless justified by some good reason. The Fayeds and their advisers had known all along the reasons relied on, namely the absence of any real risk of prejudice to the outcome of the 1987 action. There had been no failure of due process and the Panel's departure from normal practice did not constitute an arguable case for judicial review. LORD JUSTICE STEYN also concurring, said the 1977 policy statement amounted to no more than a general policy guideline. The decision whether disciplinary proceedings should await the outcome of civil proceedings or precede it was a matter for the unfettered discretion of the Panel. For the Fayeds: David Oliver QC and Paul Goulding (Herbert Smith). For the Panel: Timothy Wormington (Freshfields).</p>

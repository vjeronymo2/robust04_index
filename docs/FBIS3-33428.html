Notable activities during the visit will be meetings with French  President Francois Mitterand and Foreign Affairs Minister Alain  Juppe. This is what the Haitian Embassy in Paris said on the  evening of 22 February. President Aristide will participate in  an international colloquium for the fight [as heard] of Abbot  Pierre, the founder the (Emaus) Charity Association organized  under UNESCO.    Mr. Aristide, who was overthrown by a military coup d'etat  in September 1991, rejected last week a plan, presented by  Haitian parliamentarians, to unravel the current crisis. This  plan, which is implicitly supported by UN Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali and which enjoys the support of Washington,  provides notably for the appointment of a new prime minister,  the early retirement of Army Commander in Chief General Raoul  Cedras, and the installation of a new government of concord.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali has said  that a solution to the Middle East problem must be  comprehensive, prevail throughout in the entire region, and  include all parties. He added that this solution must not be a  divided or a phased one. He stressed that the main topic on the  Jordanian track is represented by restoring the occupied  Jordanian territory, whose area is more than 350 km square, in  addition to restoring Jordan's share of water, which was seized  by Israel in the late fifties and in the early sixties, as well  as the major part of the al-Yarmuk River water which it seized.    Addressing a delegation of the Foreign Policy Association in  Denmark, the prime minister added that when it addresses the  issue of peace, Jordan is not thinking of war, and that Jordan  has joined the peace process out of its awareness of the  importance of peace, which should provide gains for all parties,  whether these gains are material or moral, immediate or deferred  ones.    Dr. al-Majali reviewed the history of the Arab-Israeli  conflict and the changes in the region and the world after the  end of the Cold War, as well as the spread of new concepts in  the world, which have introduced changes in the strategies of  the United States and the Arabs. However, Israel took some time  to adapt to the new situation away from the concepts of war, he  added.    He said: The process of change and the time required for  this has been exhausted by Israel. The prime minister also  reviewed Jordan's efforts to guarantee the Palestinians'  participation in the peace talks, and to provide them with an  umbrella through the joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation. He  also touched on the obstacles Jordan has faced, beginning with  the Jordanian-Israeli talks, and ending with the signing of the  joint agenda, which included basic elements defining the  objective of the negotiations; namely, the realization of a  lasting and comprehensive peace, as well as the pillars of  building mutual confidence in the future.    Answering a question, the prime minister said: We cannot  talk about the establishment of regional cooperative  institutions before achieving peace. This is in order to avert  the occurrence of problems in the future, taking into  consideration that the original problem of the Middle East  situation lies in the fact that Israelis have the land, while  the Palestinians do not have it.    Answering another question, he said: The refugees issue  constitutes the biggest price Jordan has had to pay for peace  since 1950 when the Palestinians decided to unite with Jordan to  establish one state, something which was exploited by the  Israelis. Jordan's stand toward this can be summed up by the  fact that everyone who lives here is a Jordanian citizen whose  political rights in his mother homeland are safeguarded as  agreed upon in the 1950 unity agreement. This is one of the  reasons that most of the refugees are still living in camps.</p>

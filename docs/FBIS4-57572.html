			<p>BFN     [Text] Sandinists consulted by EL NUEVO DIARIO have  criticized Commander Tomas Borge's statements to a local radio  station yesterday, for what they called "a one-sided  interpretation" in the sense that Borge is trying to get the  results of the so-called departmental assemblies to serve as a  mandate for representatives to the FSLN [Sandinist National  Liberation Front] Congress.    It is no secret that the immense majority of the  departmental  assemblies, which are being held prior to the special session of  the Sandinist Congress, have been ad hoc assemblies without any  type of statutory legitimacy, except in two or three departments  where congresses were really held.    Anyway, according to the congress representatives who were  consulted, if any document can be taken as a reference point for  voting in the special session, it would be the documents that  resulted from consultations with the rank and file, not the ones  from these assemblies because most of the latter were so  outrageous that they resolved exactly the contrary of what the  rank and file had decided.    According to Tomas Borge, former President Daniel Ortega won  a majority of votes at all those "legitimate party assemblies"  to continue being the secretary general of the Sandinist Front.  In this respect and according to his figures, Daniel obtained  1,198 votes; followed by Borge himself with 1,180; and in third  place, Monica Baltodano with 1,112; and Commander Henry Ruiz  with 1,092 votes.    The Sandinists consulted have asserted that Borge's  statements are "an attack against the secret vote of the  national congressmen." They warned against "shallow, one-sided  interpretations" of their followers' votes and noted that the  true accounting will follow when the national representatives to  the FSLN Congress cast their personal and secret votes.    Borge thinks the results and decisions of the assemblies  have  to be transferred to the Congress. "Each one has to be faithful  to the mandate of the rank and file. If not, it would be a  betrayal, a felony," the former interior minister said in  reference to the issue.    But the Sandinists, who reacted shortly after Borge's  statements, asserted that Tomas is trying to suspend the  Congress and is implying that the results of the voting at the  assemblies take the place of the special session. They added  that this is nothing more than "another sign of the desperation  created by Commander Ruiz's candidacy for secretary general."  This is all as untrue as the idea that someone in the rank and  file has asked him to be secretary general, they added.    Their desperation has gone so far that Borge, joining the  chorus of slurs, has indicated that Ruiz is the candidate of the  rightists and reactionaries. "I would not like to be a  candidate backed by the spokesmen of right-wing sectors," Borge  said, implying that such spokesmen supported Ruiz in an effort  to divide the FSLN or because they felt Commander Ruiz  represented them.</p>

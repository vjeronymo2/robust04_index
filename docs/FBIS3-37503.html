Commenting on this situation in a telephone interview with  the news service, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov  expressed the opinion that there will not be any bombardment of  Sarajevo. He believes that, after the decision made by the  Bosnian Serbs, the problem of an ultimatum has been completely  removed and that after Sarajevo is unblocked it will be  necessary to take prompt measures to secure positive results.  To accomplish this, the Security Council should establish a UN  administrative authority in Sarajevo, take measures to  strengthen safety in other areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and  resume talks in Geneva.    Touching on the reason Russia has been accused of holding a  clearly-expressed pro-Serbian position, the Russian deputy  foreign minister noted that, given many countries' unambiguous  anti-Serbian position, Russia's position helped preserve the  balance and provide equal rights to the participants in the  conflict.</p>

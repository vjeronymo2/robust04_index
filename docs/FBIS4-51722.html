			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Medan Riots A Warning"] </F>   [Text] If the social tension that led to the recent riots  in Medan is not confined to North Sumatera alone, then it should  set alarm bells ringing in Jakarta. Since the growing incidence  of unrest is occuring at a time of rising political  consciousness among Indonesians, the authorities need to manage  the underlying problems quickly and effectively in order to  safeguard stability. As the rioting in Medan has shown, large  public demonstrations can degenerate easily into violence that  can cause instability, as has happened in the past. It also  shows that much needs to be done to improve and stabilise  labour-management relations. One issue is the degree of  compliance by employers with the new minimum wage rate set by  the government. Cooperation by management has not been  forthcoming. Why else would the Supreme Court urge judges to  punish errant employers with prison sentences? Indeed,  President Suharto had asked employers to go beyond implementing  the minimum rate in improving the working conditions of  employees. Then there are questions about the effectiveness of  the state-sponsored All-Indonesian Workers Union (SPSI) in  representing the interest of workers. For example, a few months  ago, the Indonesian armed forces chief, General Feisal Tanjung,  drew attention to their plight, saying that SPSI had failed to  function as a labour union because many of its senior officials  were serving the interests of management instead of workers.    But, it must be said, the Indonesian Labour Welfare Union  (SBSI), the country's largest independent trade union which is  not officially recognized was pushing too hard on workers'  right. The government had already begun to focus its attention  on that issue. It raised the minimum wage by 26 percent for  workers in and around Jakarta and promised to review the  situation at a later date. It also revoked the decree  introduced some years ago, that allowed employers to ask the  military to intervene to end strikes. Similarly, last September,  the government undertook to restructure SPSI in order to make it  less centralised and, thus, more responsive to the views of its  constituent sectoral unions.    Indonesia cannot afford irresponsible behaviour by labour or  management. The SBSI's demand for almost doubling the minimum  wage is excessive. Acceding to it would endanger economic  growth and, thus, the country's ability to generate enough jobs  to stem rising unemployment. According to Manpower Minister  Abdul Latief, 38 percent of Indonesia's workforce of 81 million  are without work or are under-employed. Even if the current  growth rate of around 6 percent is sustained, joblessness would  grow by 2 percent annually. Particularly troubling is high  unemployment among university graduates. Only 30 to 40 percent  of them are expected to be absorbed in the coming years.    Raising wages to an unrealistic level, especially when  labour  productivity is low, will lead to more unemployment because it  will make the country less attractive to overseas investors, who  can put in their money in other countries such as China, Vietnam  and India, where labour is plentiful and cheap. This has  already begun to happen. Foreign investment in Indonesia  dropped by 22 percent last year. Investments are also needed to  contain growth of its external debt that has reached U.S.$90  million. The issue of workers' rights has surfaced at a  delicate time, when the country is in the throes of social  change, while it faces new economic challenges.    A firm hand is needed to stamp out trouble-makers, and to  deter those looking for trouble. A more sophisticated and  responsive machinery is needed to manage the delicate  labour-management relations. However the authorities respond to  these challenges, the Medan riots should be an eye-opener to all  sides.</p>

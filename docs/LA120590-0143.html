			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Local judges -- An article Sunday incorrectly reported that all of the 11 local  judges appointed by Gov. George Deukmejian are white and that nine of them are  former prosecutors. In fact, Municipal Judge Herbert Curtis III is black, and  the number of ex-prosecutors is eight. Superior Court Judge Kenneth R. Yegan, a  former deputy public defender, was incorrectly identified as an ex-deputy  district attorney.  </P></p>

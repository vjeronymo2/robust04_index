			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- The United Nations atomic  watchdog has asked the Japanese Government to reconfirm the  amount of plutonium held up in processing equipment of a  Japanese nuclear fuel fabrication plant after learning the  amount was unexpectedly high, sources said Monday [9 May].    The sources said a massive 70 kilograms of plutonium was  held  up at the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp.  facility in Tokai, Ibaraki Prefecture, over the past five and a  half years since the plant started operations.    The fact has alerted the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) since such a large amount of plutonium held up in the  plant could hamper effective application of safeguards against  unauthorized diversions of plutonium, the sources said.    A corporation spokesman stressed, however, that employees at  the facility have confirmed the existence of the plutonium  through measurements done with special equipment and denied the  plutonium in question is unaccounted for.    But the sources said the IAEA is concerned that any  discrepancy in calculations could compromise its purpose as a  body established to regulate the use of nuclear fuel and prevent  the spread of nuclear weapons.    The facility, which began operations in October, 1988,  supplies fuel to the fast breeder reactor Monju on the Sea of  Japan coast in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture.    Sources within the nuclear power industry said that in  April,  the IAEA requested that the government confirm whether the  amount of plutonium held up in the plant actually matched the  corporation's own measurement.    Equipment to monitor plutonium amounts in the facility was  jointly developed by the corporation and the Los Alamos National  Laboratory in the U.S. State of New Mexico.    A measurement by the equipment is believed to have a margin  of error of 5-10 percent, which means that if the amount of  held-up plutonium is as much as 70 kilograms, enough plutonium  to make an atomic bomb could easily escape detection.    Paul Leventhal, president of the nongovernmental  Washington-based Nuclear Control Institute said 70 kilograms is  more than the amount of plutonium North Korea is alleged to have  secretly diverted from its own nuclear facilities.    Leventhal said there is no proof Japan is diverting  plutonium  for a weapons program, but called on the IAEA to closely  regulate the Japanese facility to ensure fair treatment for all  countries using nuclear power.    In a letter dated May 4 to U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher, Leventhal calls for the shutting down of the  facility.    Leventhal told Christopher the 70 kilograms, about 10  percent  of the annual plutonium output at the plant, is "an astounding  figure."    "Under the circumstances, Japan should be prepared  voluntarily to suspend operation of the plant in the interest of  its often-stated commitment to the complete transparency of the  peaceful nature of its plutonium program," Leventhal wrote.    A spokesman for the Science and Technology Agency's  safeguards division said the IAEA and the government gauge the  amount of plutonium held up in the plant once every month, and  added it is impossible to divert the plutonium from the facility.</p>

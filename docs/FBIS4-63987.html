			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Valeriy Golovin report under the "Talks" rubric: "The </F> Foreign Ministry Is Authorized To State..."]    [Text] Khabarovsk -- "The misgivings of people in the Far  East about the possible transfer to the PRC of two large islands  in the Amur River near Khabarovsk are absolutely groundless.  According to all the realities of history, they belong to  Russia. I am sure that in time the Chinese side will come to  accept our logic and our arguments," Genrikh Kireyev, Russian  Foreign Ministry special envoy and chairman of the Russian  delegation at the border talks in China, stated at a press  conference in Khabarovsk.    The Russian diplomat was meeting with journalists from  central and local newspapers after the latest working meeting of  the members of the Russian-Chinese joint demarcation commission  had ended in this city. G. Kireyev also refuted rumors that  2,000 islands will be transferred to the neighboring country  during the demarcation process. In all there are 1,845 islands  in the border rivers -- the Ussuri, the Amur, and the Argun.  Legally speaking, they have never belonged to anyone. The  demarcation will make it possible to remove that contradiction  for the first time. Bearing in mind that the border line runs  along the fairway of the navigable rivers, it may be presumed  that one-half of the islands will be deemed Russian, the other  half Chinese.    The Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman did not agree that  there is no single approach at government level to the  assessment of the border problem in the east of the country.  The members of the Russian delegation at the talks have a  single directive -- to uphold Russia's interests above all, he  stressed.    However, the participants in the press conference still had  some uncertainty over the unhindered passage of Chinese ships,  including naval ones, along the fairway of the Amur River near  Khabarovsk. This is indeed envisaged by the border settlement  agreement between Russia and the PRC of 18 May 1991, which  finally enabled the demarcation work to begin. That agreement  says that special rules for such traffic must be devised. But  this has not been done yet. Meanwhile, ships from the PRC sail  here freely, often without even notifying the Russian side.  This is causing a negative reaction from the local authorities.</p>

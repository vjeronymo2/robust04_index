			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-PAKISTAN PREMIER BHUTTO'S HUSBAND ARRESTED; SHE SEES 'WITCH HUNT'  </P> <P> Police Wednesday arrested the husband of ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto,  who denounced the move as a "pure witch hunt" to intimidate her during the  current election campaign.  </P> <P> Businessman Asif Ali Zardari was arrested in Karachi for alleged involvement in  an extortion case and two cases of illegal bank loans, state television said.  </P> <P> Zardari has been a major target of investigations since Bhutto's dismissal by  President Ghulam Ishaq Khan in August for allegedly heading an administration  riddled with corruption, nepotism and abuse of power.  </P> <P> He was charged in the kidnaping last April of businessman Murtaza Hussain  Bukhari, a Pakistani-born British citizen, and the extortion of $800,000 from  him.  </P> <P> "His arrest is pure witch hunt. His arrest is to intimidate and blackmail me,"  Bhutto told a hurriedly convened news conference at her fortress-like seaside  home. Paramilitary rangers were deployed outside, checking cars.  </P> <P> Thumping on the table with her fists, she said: "Asif has been arrested because  of a criminal conspiracy against my family hatched by the caretakers  (government). I demand his immediate release."  </P> <P> Bhutto said she feared for her husband's life and that she would apply for  bail.  </P> <P> She later drove to a police interrogation center and spent 20 minutes with  Zardari. Police sources said officials stayed with the couple throughout the  visit.  </P> <P> About 100 people outside the center chanted, "Release Zardari!"  </P> <P> Bhutto returned late Tuesday to Karachi, about 600 miles south of Islamabad,  after appearing before a special court in the Punjab provincial capital,  Lahore. She faces charges there of wrongdoing during her 20 months in office.  </P> <P> Both Bhutto and Zardari, who married Bhutto in 1987, are running in the Oct. 24  National Assembly elections, but she could be barred if convicted. Zardari and  Bhutto have two children.  </P></p>

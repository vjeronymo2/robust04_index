			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: Akzo cautious in spite of 5% first-quarter advance AKZO, the Dutch chemicals company, saw a 5 per cent rise in net profit in the 1992 first quarter. All four of its core businesses reported higher results after a difficult year in 1991. Net profit increased to Fl 205.8m (Dollars 111.2m) from Fl 192.2m in the weak first quarter of 1991. Operating profit showed an even bigger rise, climbing 17.5 per cent to Fl 348.6m. Sales were up 5 per cent at Fl 4.43bn. The company's shares responded strongly to the recovery, rising more than 3 per cent to close up Fl 4.90 at Fl 161.00 on the Amsterdam bourse. Akzo, the first big Dutch company to release 1992 figures, posted a 13 per cent decline in net profit in 1991. In spite of the first-quarter improvement, Akzo said it was unable to make a forecast for the full year because of continuing economic uncertainty in Europe and the US. As in 1991, Akzo's health care product group made the single biggest contribution to operating profit, accounting for slightly more than one third of the total. Unlike the previous year, however, the other product groups also recorded higher operating results.</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Deal sets up trade in pollution permits THE first US deal to trade pollution rights was announced yesterday when the federally-owned Tennessee Valley Authority said it had agreed to purchase allowances to emit 10,000 tons of sulphur dioxide, a key cause of acid rain, from privately owned Wisconsin Power &amp; Light. The terms of the sale were not disclosed, but the estimated cost is Dollars 2.5m to Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.4m to Pounds 1.7m). To help ease the high costs of converting to cleaner technologies, the US government has created a system under which 'dirtier' utility companies can buy allowances for emissions from 'cleaner' companies that have exceeded the federal standards. The deal is, in essence, a forward contract on the allowances that will be issued next year by the Environmental Protection Agency under the terms of the 1990 Clean Air Act. The act requires that utility companies cut their sulphur dioxide emissions in half by 2000, or from a national total of 19m tons to 9m tons. The first deadline for partial compliance is 1995. The allowances have been allocated, but will not be in the hands of utilities until an auction in March 1993. Mr Erroll Davis, president of Wisconsin Power &amp; Light, said the transaction 'clearly demonstrates that a market-based approach can be an effective way to address environmental problems'. There has, however, been scepticism over how well such a market can work, as state and locally-controlled utilities have been slow to set any clear policies for trading allowances. There are also doubts over whether a given community would want to be 'dirty' even at a lower cost, and over how to price the allowances. The Chicago Board of Trade, the world's largest futures market, plans to begin trading futures contracts on the allowances, dubbed pollution futures.</p>

			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Stagecoach makes Pounds 4m acquisition Stagecoach Holdings, the bus company, announced yesterday its ninth acquisition since it was floated last year. It is paying Pounds 4.25m for Ayrshire Bus Owners, which operates as A1 Service. The company is paying Pounds 1.7m cash with the balance to be satisfied in new shares. Mr Keith Cochrane, company secretary, said the company did not expect a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. 'We do not operate in direct competition with A1 Service,' he said. A1 Service operates 75 vehicles in the Ayrshire towns of Irvine, Ardrossan and Saltcoats. Stagecoach is currently the subject of three MMC inquiries concerning its 20 per cent stakes in SB Holdings, the Strathclyde bus operator, and in Mainline Partnership, Sheffield, and a general investigation into bus services in north-east England. Stagecoach has spent Pounds 91.3m on acquisitions since it was floated in April 1993.</p>

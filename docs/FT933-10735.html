			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / The ERM - Picking Up The Pieces: ERM bands produce sort of harmony - How ministers agreed to march to common tune IT WAS Mr Karlheinz von den Driesch, the amiable, grey-bearded spokesman for the German finance ministry, who first broke the news. Stepping into the foyer of the Borschette building in the centre of Brussels, he pushed his way through a wall of television cameras and frantic reporters, to whisper five words to a familiar German journalist: 'Wide fluctuation bands for everyone.' At 1.45am - just 15 minutes before the Tokyo financial markets opened - the world learned that European Community finance ministers had, after a fashion, saved the European exchange rate mechanism. The ministerial meeting was a tense, at times brutal power-struggle involving almost 60 officials from 12 member states, including central bank governors and members of the European Commission. It led to a solution which, in the words of Mr Wim Kok, Dutch finance minister, is 'the worst but one solution'. Each state had its own 'bottom line'; each had a de facto veto on the outcome of the crisis talks which began on Saturday afternoon with a seven-hour session of the secretive EC monetary committee. That meeting produced only the barest agreement on principles: that the ERM and its central parity grid had to be preserved. There was no agreement on how this goal was to be achieved, according to an official. The main difficulty centred on France's absolute refusal to countenance a devaluation of the franc, and Germany's absolute insistence that the Bundesbank could not be expected to offer unlimited intervention - not least because of the risk of bloating its money supply and triggering a new spiral of inflation. In the early afternoon session on Sunday, Franco-German divisions appeared momentarily to have abated when Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, and Mr Edmond Alphandery, French economy minister, put forward a joint initiative suggesting the D-Mark leave the ERM. A European monetary official said Germany's preferred solution was to widen the margins of fluctuation for all ERM currencies in order to limit intervention; but the exit of the D-Mark suggested an apparent willingness to patch up differences with the French. It led to Mr von den Driesch's confident prediction - 'There is a solution' - followed by a report from Paris that Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, was due to hold a news conference at 7pm. Suddenly the talks stumbled. The Netherlands, which has traditionally maintained a currency parity with the D-Mark, signalled that it intended to follow the Germans out of the ERM. It would not endanger the monetary stability which flowed from the guilder's close link with the D-Mark. The Dutch protest led to a stampede among the rich northern European countries, with Luxembourg, Belgium and then Denmark indicating that they, too, wanted to leave. 'Suddenly we were looking at France sitting all alone in the ERM with Spain and Portugal,' said one source. At this point, news came that Mr Balladur had cancelled his press conference. The talks shifted to a widening of the fluctuation bands, with Germany calling for France to shift from its narrow 2.25 per cent margin to 6 per cent. According to a European monetary official, the Germans sweetened their 6 per cent offer with an implicit cut in short-term interest rates - a promise which had added credibility since Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, and Mr Hans Tietmeyer, his deputy and successor-designate, were present in the talks. However, French officials turned down the offer on the grounds that it would have amounted to a devaluation which again would have put France in a 'second tier' with Spain and Portugal. France also turned down an offer of a 10 per cent fluctuation band. 'They did not want the margin to be tested,' said one official present at the talks. Then the French counter-attacked. In one tense quadrilateral meeting between Germany, France, and the Netherlands chaired by Belgium in its role as president of the EC, the Dutch came under 'tremendous' pressure to break their link with the Germans; but Mr Kok and Mr Wim Duisenberg, Dutch central bank governor and front-runner to head the putative European central bank, refused to buckle. Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, also weighed in on behalf of the Germans leaving the ERM and declaring that he was opposed to a general flotation of currencies. The statement was not cleared with the rest of the Commission, a senior EC official said. The British, forced out of the ERM last September along with the Italians, remained low-key throughout, despite earlier talks of an 'honest-broker' role being played by Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer. He appears to have accepted advice that it could encourage a backlash from Europeans frustrated that the British, after all, might have had a point about 'fault-lines' within the ERM. Finally, after numerous variations of wider bands involving various member states, the solution was found: a fluctuation band of 15 per cent for all currencies barring the D-Mark and guilder. The aim was two-fold: to disguise a de facto French devaluation as well as the de facto suspension of the system. Grim ministerial faces early yesterday revealed the tensions of the previous 12 hours. They also pointed to the lack of unity within the Community, summed up by the fact that the German-Dutch agreement to maintain parity was not even included in the official communique. The ERM had survived, but at a substantial price.</p>

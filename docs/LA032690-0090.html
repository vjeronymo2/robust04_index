"It makes considerably greater sense in terms of economics and the  interests of defense to retain Camp Parks as an important training facility,"  said Maj. Gen. William F. Ward. Rep. Pete Stark (D-Hayward) asked Defense  Secretary Dick Cheney to keep open several San Francisco Bay-area military  installations targeted for closure but to shut Camp Parks.  </P></p>

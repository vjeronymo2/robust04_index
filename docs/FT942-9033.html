			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Fed acts decisively to lift confidence: Bond surge reflects hopes of end to 'water torture' Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, yesterday gave financial markets most of what they have been demanding for weeks. Under his leadership, the Fed raised the federal funds rate by a half point to 4.25 per cent - a more decisive move than the three previous quarter-point increases announced since February. And, equally important, it put the increase in context by saying that yesterday's action 'substantially removes the degree of monetary accomodation which prevailed throughout 1993.' This was interpreted by some analysts as meaning that the Fed had all but achieved its immediate goal of raising rates to a 'neutral' level - in other words, a level consistent with non-inflationary growth in the medium term. Part of yesterday's surge in bond prices probably reflected hopes that the policy of repeated incremental increases in short rates - known disparagingly as 'water torture' - has been put on hold, at least for the time being. Given an underlying inflation rate of about 3 per cent, short-term interest rates of 4.25 per cent imply real or inflation-adjusted rates of about 1.25 per cent. This is within the 1-2 per cent range that most economists would argue represents a neutral level of real rates in the longer term. However, it does not imply that the Fed's work is anywhere near complete. If the economy continues to grow faster than its long-run potential - which is probably 2.5-3.0 per cent a year - the Fed will want to move beyond neutrality to an overtly contractionary stance. This would require further substantial increases in rates, perhaps to well above 5 per cent. Recent better than expected inflation data - such as April figures for consumer and producer prices - have led some analysts to conclude that a further tightening of monetary policy will not be required for several months. This may be so, but other factors are less encouraging. The Fed may well conclude more aggressive efforts are needed to prevent the economy hitting capacity constraints, threatening higher inflation in 1995 and beyond. The annualised rate of growth admittedly dipped in the first quarter to an estimated 2.6 per cent against 7 per cent in the fourth quarter. A few recent indicators have been slightly weaker than expected: retail sales fell in April after strong upward revisions in February and March; housing starts also dropped last month, prompting speculation that residential construction has peaked. But the preponderance of data still suggest the expansion is uncomfortably strong. The first quarter figures were distorted by severe winter weather and an erratically large decline in government spending. The monthly payroll employment figures give a better indication of underlying trends. In the first four months, average monthly gains averaged more than 250,000 against about 200,000 in the fourth quarter of last year and about 160,000 in the first three quarters of last year. These figures suggest the economy is still rapidly using up spare industrial capacity. Last month capacity utilisation in manufacturing industry was 83.0 per cent against 80.6 per cent a year ago and a long-term average of 81.9 per cent. The jobless rate for adults is now 5.6 per cent, close to the level at which upward pressure on wages has emerged in the past. Signs that leading European economies are beginning to emerge from recession will only increase the Fed's fear about a possible overheating of the domestic economy. Until now a widening trade account has acted as a brake on US growth. But a concerted global economic revival could lead to stronger upward pressure on prices and strengthen the case for prudent US monetary policies. A second concern for the Fed is the apparent lack of confidence in US economic policies in financial markets. This is reflected, for example, in the comparative weakness of the dollar even though interest rates are rising in the US and falling elsewhere. A portfolio shift out of a currency when interest differentials are moving in its favour is usually a tell-tale sign of lack of confidence in economic fundamentals. Yesterday there was no rush to buy dollars following the Fed's announcement of higher interest rates. The recent very sharp rise in US long bond yields is also disturbing. A steepening of the yield curve typically reflects fears of higher inflation in the future - in other words, a fear that monetary policy is too loose. With the benefit of hindsight many economists now argue that the Fed should have begun tightening soooner in this economic cycle - before long bond yields started rising last autumn. The Fed doubtless hopes that yesterday's half-point increase in rates will bolster confidence and lead to a sustained reduction in long yields. But winning back confidence once it has been eroded is never easy.</p>

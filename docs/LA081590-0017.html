			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> TREND WATCH  </P> <P> A roundup of business developments spotted by other publications. Items were  compiled and edited by Grassroots Research, a unit of the San Francisco money  management firm of RCM Capital Management.  </P> <P> Classic Expands: Coca-Cola is shifting its focus to Europe and the Pacific,  where profit margins are five times higher than in the United States. For the  concentrate that makes a case of eight-ounce servings, the company earns 11% in  the United States, 58% in West Germany and 44% in Japan. Consumption overseas,  however, is relatively low. Americans drink 283 servings per capita per year,  Japanese 53 and Indonesians just four. Atlanta Constitution  </P> <P> Office Discounter: Staples, an office supply discounter with 48 stores in the  Northeast, is considering a move into Southern California. Los Angeles seems  the logical choice because the company specializes in markets characterized by  high costs for rent, labor and advertising. It keeps labor costs down with  sophisticated use of a warehouse to supply branch outlets and shuns traditional  advertising in favor of direct marketing to office managers. Nation's Business  </P> <P> Growth Industry: According to an annual market study by Richard K. Miller &amp;  Associates, the environmental industry is growing 7% a year on average, but the  growth of segments within that industry varies widely. The air pollution  control market, valued last year at $36 billion, is expected to grow 5% next  year. Hazardous waste cleanup, at $10 billion, is projected to grow 24%. Other  high-growth areas include recycling, medical waste disposal and waste-to-energy  plants. Waste Tech News  </P> <P> Newsprint Goal: Florida's goal of using recycled newsprint in 50% of newspaper  production by 1992 is in jeopardy. The United States has only eight mills  producing recycled newsprint, and all are operating at capacity. Other mills  are converting to recycled paper, but their products won't reach market for 18  months. Tampa Tribune  </P></p>

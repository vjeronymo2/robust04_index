			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nick Nuttall, environment correspondent] </F>   [Text] Tough restrictions on farmers were announced  yesterday by the Government to cut down on pollution from  nitrates which threatens rivers and wildlife.    The environment and agriculture departments unveiled 72  Vulnerable Zones, covering 1.6 million acres, in which farmers  will have to modify their use of manure, fertilisers and sludge  to curb nitrates leaking into rivers and the sea. Many of the  areas are in East Anglia, where drinking water samples sometimes  fail European standards.    Thirty three areas were also announced where water companies  will have to fit sewage treatment works with anti-phosphate  pollution equipment. They cover Windermere and the rivers Avon,  Test, Blackwater and Nene.</p>

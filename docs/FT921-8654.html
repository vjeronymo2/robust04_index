			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A CLUTCH of UK and US economic indicators failed to revive dull and directionless trading in stock index futures, writes Chris Price and Joel Kibazo. After opening at 2,526, the March contract had retreated to 2,518 by mid-morning as independent traders unwound overnight positions. The release of UK inflation figures helped steady March, although the revival was tempered by the publication of poor UK output statistics. But a disappointing opening on Wall Street following a weak performance in the bond market dragged the contract lower, while the release of better than expected US factory gate prices failed to impress. However, March followed Wall Street's mid-afternoon bounce, and a brief rally was seen before the official close. March closed at 2,530, down 5 on the previous session and around 6 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 10. Turnover reached 8,416. In LTOM, good two-way business gave rise to improved volume of 27,949 contracts. The FTSE-100 option traded 10,912. BP was the busiest stock option, as traders continued to reflect on Thursday's poor results. It traded 3,514 lots.</p>

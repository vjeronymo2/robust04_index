			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (23): Modernising Poland's road network Modernising the Polish road network is one of the most important tasks if the vision of Europe from the Atlantic to the Ural mountains is ever to become a reality, writes Anthony Robinson. But billions of dollars of foreign financing will be needed to build new toll roads and expressways now on the drawing board. Poland is perfect for motorways. Most of the country is flat or gently undulating; land is currently cheap; skilled and unskilled labour is both cheap and plentiful. Modern highways linking Scandinavia with central Europe, or western Europe to Moscow or the Ukraine, would provide much needed employment in Poland. Furthermore, they would tie the Baltic states, European Russia, Belorussia and Ukraine into the existing European motorway system. In 1992 the Polish ministry of transport developed a Dollars 3bn highway programme for the construction of 1,960km of new highways. The aim is to complete them by the year 2010. Financing for the project is to be provided by a combination of tolls, franchise fees from foreign carriers, loans from the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and private investors. Top priority goes to completing three cross country motorway projects:: the 579km long A1 North-South highway connecting Scandinavia through the port of Gdansk past Lodz and on to Katowice and the Czech border; the 626km long A2 East-West axis, which extends the existing autobahn from Berlin past Poznan, Lodz and Warsaw to the Belorussian frontier and then on to Moscow; and the 738km long southern route from Dresden which runs through Silesia past Wroclaw, Katowice and Krakov and on to Lvov in western Ukraine. Such a network would transform the Polish communications system. It would have a dramatic effect on the prosperity of towns such as Lodz, now a depressed textile town, but likely to take on a new lease of life at the intersection of the main east-west andnorth-south highways.</p>

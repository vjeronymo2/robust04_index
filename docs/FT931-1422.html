			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / International Company News: Six colleagues follow Lopez to VW SIX EUROPEAN colleagues of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the Spanish purchasing chief who quit General Motors last week to join Volkswagen, have also resigned from GM to join him at the German car manufacturer. Three of them were among 20 GM purchasing executives in charge of buying parts and materials around the world, while the three others were more junior buyers. The German company refused to confirm that the men would join the company. Mr Lopez was appointed last week as head of production and purchasing at VW. He was estimated to have cut Dollars 1bn or more of purchasing costs from GM's lossmaking North American operations since his appointment as head of the worldwide purchasing in May of last year. Analysts regarded his departure as a considerable blow to GM's North American cost-cutting programme, since he brought a idiosyncratic flair to the job, but they did not think the loss of his six colleagues would have much additional impact on GM. GM itself said the resignations of the six would have 'little consequence' for its programme. Four of the six worked for GM in Detroit and followed Mr Lopez there from Europe. They are Mr Jose Gutierrez, who was in charge of buying machinery and equipment; Mr Hugo Van der Auwera, in charge of buying metals, who only moved to the US in January; Mr Francisco Garcia, the executive responsible for purchasing bought electrical parts; and Mr Andre Versteeg, a more junior buyer. The two other buyers worked for GM in Europe and were named as R. Piazza and J. Alvarez.</p>

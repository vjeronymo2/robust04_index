			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Platkovskiy: "Pyongyang Ready for War, </F> But Moscow Hopes That Kim Il-song Is Bluffing"]    [Excerpts] The conflict concerning the DPRK's nuclear  program has again entered an unpredictable, volatile stage after  the North Koreans threatened to quit the nuclear weapons  nonproliferation treaty and "commit Seoul to the flames." But  all Moscow can do is observe events from the sidelines.    International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] experts who have  returned after verification work at suspect facilities in the  DPRK were unable to confirm that this secretive country is not  carrying out work to create its own nuclear weapons. They did  not manage to get into the radiochemical laboratory, where it is  suspected that plutonium is possibly being produced for military  needs. The IAEA Board of Governors will give the final verdict  and will possibly raise the question of economic sanctions  against the DPRK for discussion by the UN Security Council.  [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, in this situation Moscow prefers to refrain from  making any statements. At least until the IAEA's final position  becomes clear. As IZVESTIYA was informed by the Russian Foreign  Ministry, the situation is not as serious as reports might  indicate. At any rate, our diplomats still hope that the matter  will not get as far as a discussion of the sanctions question by  the Security Council.    So far Moscow has remained outside the circle of active  participants in the conflict because it lacks any opportunities  to influence the North Koreans' position. Despite the fact that  the Treaty on Friendship and Cooperation between the USSR and  the DPRK is still in force, just like the article providing for  military aid in the case of aggression against the DPRK, the  North Koreans regard this document merely as a scrap of paper.    But if the matter does get as far as a discussion of  sanctions by the Security Council, our experts believe that  Russian diplomats' main task will be not to back the North  Koreans into a corner.</p>

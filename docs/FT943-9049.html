			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / International Company News: Axa buys Suez offshoot in Canadian expansion Axa, one of France's largest insurance groups, plans to expand its North American interests by buying Boreal Assurances, the Canadian insurer, from Suez, the French financial and industrial holding company. The acquisition of Boreal, which made net profits of CDollars 12.2m (USDollars 8.8m) in 1993 on sales of CDollars 591m, will, according to Axa, turn it into the fourth largest insurer in Canada. The French group's existing Axa Canada subsidiary made net profits of CDollars 17.3m last year on turnover of CDollars 310m. The announcement of Boreal's sale comes only a few days after completion of a complex deal whereby Suez sold most of its Victoire insurance business to Commercial Union of the UK for FFr12.5bn (USDollars 2.33bn). Axa, the second largest insurer in France, which already has a sizeable subsidiary in Canada as well controlling The Equitable, the US insurer, was initially mooted as a potential purchaser for Victoire. However, it did not figure in the final stages of negotiations, having decided instead to concentrate on augmenting its international activities. Although Axa and Suez have agreed the terms of the transaction, for an undisclosed sum, it is still subject to authorisation from the French and Canadian regulatory authorities. The Boreal disposal forms part of an ongoing divestment programme at Suez, one of the largest and most varied of the classic French holdings which has for the past three years been attempting to streamline its assortment of industrial and financial interests. Mr Gerard Worms, chairman of Suez, said last week that the group, which has raised FFr35bn from disposals over the past three years, now plans to expand in specific sectors, notably within financial services in Asia. Axa, chaired by the flamboyant Mr Claude Bebear, has also made no secret of its Asian ambitions. It recently secured provisional authority to set up a life insurance business in Japan and announced plans to invest USDollars 200m in the venture over the next five to seven years.</p>

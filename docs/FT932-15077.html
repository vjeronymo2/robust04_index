			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Hong Kong Whitehall's spin doctors give the impression that only their sensitivity to Chinese feelings prevents them from crowing about a complete climbdown by Beijing. The truth is naturally a little more muddy, and the concessions by both sides show that everyone wants an agreement. There remains a risk that the talks on democracy in Hong Kong may get bogged down, but a common interest in success should at least give the discussions some momentum. Once round the negotiating table, however, it may become clear that the two sides want very different agreements and are prepared to hold out until they get them. The enthusiasm of the Hong Kong stock market has thus to be treated with a little caution. While the tug of war between a strong economy and poor politics has been temporarily resolved by one side dropping the rope, the struggle may be resumed. Hong Kong's stock market tends to peak at a price/earnings ratio of around 12.5. Currently it is trading at around 12 times expected 1993 earnings. Sentiment may pull shares somewhat higher, but then the rally will be fed by a heavy diet of new issues. The best of the current rise may thus have passed. Yet unless politics turns very ugly, the longer-term arguments for Hong Kong are hard to fault. The economy may grow by 6 per cent in 1993, and a similar amount next year. Fears that the Chinese economy might overheat are also subsiding. Steady and sustainable Chinese expansion provides the ideal fuel for Hong Kong's equities.</p>

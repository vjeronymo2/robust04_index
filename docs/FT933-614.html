			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / International Company News: Procordia steady in first six months PROCORDIA, the Swedish pharmaceuticals and consumer products group, said yesterday that profits before financial items for the first six months were virtually unchanged at SKr2.24bn (Dollars 283m). The group benefited from the weaker krona and a two-month contribution from Farmitalia Carlo Erba, the newly-acquired Italian pharmaceutical company. But its performance was hit by worse results from its consumer product companies, losses sustained by a hotel unit, and lower financial income. The group was presenting its last financial figures before formally splitting its drug and non-drug activities next month. Under an agreement between the company's two main owners, Volvo and the Swedish government, Volvo is to move towards full control of the group's consumer products activities, leaving the state with a 60 per cent holding in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology businesses, which it could privatise next spring. The weaker krona pushed sales up 9 per cent to SKr21.5bn, with income from ongoing operations up 17 per cent at SKr2.50bn. Kabi Pharmacia lifted sales by 42 per cent to SKr9.5bn. However, excluding Farmitalia, sales were up only 20 per cent, with volume growth a disappointing 2 per cent. Volumes fell 10 per cent in Germany - where pharmaceutical companies have been under pressure - and 8 per cent in Spain. The growth hormone segment was the worst affected, due to adverse developments in the Australia, Spain, Italy and the UK. Revenues for what will remain of Procordia after the split rose 39 per cent to SKr10.7bn, while income from ongoing operations climbed 45 per cent to SKr1.83bn. Consumer product sales dropped 10 per cent to SKr10.8bn and income from ongoing operations fell 23 per cent to SKr665m.</p>

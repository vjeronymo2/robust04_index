			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 29 Mar (INA)--The newspaper AL-'IRAQ has  described the UN Security Council's decision to invite Special  Commission Chairman Ekeus to make a monthly review of the  details of his commission's work and the progress that it makes  as an important step reflecting greater appreciation by the UN  Security Council states of Iraq's cooperation.    In an article today, the paper, which is issued here,  stresses the need for a specific mechanism for the commission's  work and activities. It says matters should not be left  undecided and unspecific, something that would exclude any  possible action to swiftly implement Paragraph 22 of Part C of  Resolution 687.    The paper says that throughout the past period, it was clear  from the way the commission conducted its business that the  commission was procrastinating despite Iraq's sincere  cooperation, and although its various subcommittees visited Iraq  dozens of times and submitted authenticated and detailed reports  testifying to Iraq's cooperation.    The paper explains that under U.S. pressures, the commission  was involved in gimmicks and sharp contradictions between what  has actually been achieved on the ground and Commission Chairman  Ekeus' unsubstantiated statements.    The paper adds: Iraq is aware of the causes of U.S.  pressures on the commission and the attempts to force it not to  acknowledge facts. Iraq is also aware of the way nations'  issues are run and discussed inside the halls of the UN Security  Council and how plots are concocted and facts falsified to  control other peoples' and their wealth, preventing them from  exercising their independent free will. The paper notes that  all this takes place under slogans of "international legitimacy  and international law."    The paper says experience has proved the practices of United  States and its satellites inside and outside the UN Security  Council are a very long way from true legitimacy, law, and  justice. These nations are ready to ignore all ethical and  human standards for the sake of their colonialist interests and  global policies.    The paper stresses that after the recent UN Security  Council's decision, the Special Commission should be freed of  U.S. influence and hostile polices against Iraq. The commission  should deal with facts impartially, objectively, and fairly, and  it should not be dragged to unjust stands that further increase  the suffering of the Iraqi people.    Concluding its article, AL-'IRAQ says fair people in this  world have become absolutely convinced that any delay in lifting  the blockade can be classified as a major crime whose  responsibility rests with the sides that obstruct the adoption  of the only resolution that reflects responsibility, justice,  and law--a resolution lifting the blockade.</p>

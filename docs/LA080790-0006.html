			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATISTICS ON SMOKING  </P> <P> More cities are just saying "no smoking." I am a smoker.  </P> <P> But how can you ban something that is not illegal. The anti-smokers have rights  I agree, but I have a right, too. It is called freedom of choice. I am very  considerate about smoking. If someone in the room doesn't smoke, I ask if it is  OK. But if they are rude, like most of the anti-smokers, so am I. Plus, I don't  see how secondhand smoke is so bad because there are a lot of other things such  as smog that are worse.  </P> <P> GREG NICHOLS  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P></p>

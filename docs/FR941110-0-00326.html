			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (5) Any other Federal, Tribal, State, or local housing program that is comparable, as to housing standards, eligibility and contribution to rent, to the programs referred to in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section, and provides a term of assistance of not less than five years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Funding commitments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although a HUD funding commitment is required if the replacement housing requirement is to be satisfied through any of the HUD programs listed in paragraph (a) of this section, HUD's approval of a Section 5(h) homeownership plan on the expectation that such a funding commitment will be forthcoming shall not constitute a binding obligation to make such a commitment. Where the requirement is to be satisfied under a Tribal, State or local program, or a Federal program not administered by HUD, a funding commitment shall be required from the proper authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Use of sale proceeds to fund replacement housing.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sale proceeds that are generated under the homeownership plan may be used under some of the replacement housing options under paragraph (a) of this section ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , rehabilitation of vacant public housing units, or an eligible local program). Where a homeownership plan provides for sale proceeds to be used for replacement housing, HUD approval of the plan and execution of the IHA&hyph;HUD implementing agreement shall satisfy the funding commitment requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, with regard to the amount of replacement housing to be funded out of sale proceeds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Consistency with current housing needs.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Replacement housing may differ from the dwellings sold under the homeownership plan, as to unit sizes or family or elderly occupancy, if the IHA determines that such change is consistent with current local housing needs for low-income families.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Inapplicability to prior plans.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section shall not apply to homeownership plans that were submitted to HUD under the Section 5(h) Homeownership Program prior to October 1, 1990.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;905.1017  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Records, reports, and audits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The IHA shall be responsible for the maintenance of records (including sale and financial records) for all activities incident to implementation of the homeownership plan. Until all planned sales of individual dwellings have been completed, the IHA shall submit to HUD annual sales reports, in a form prescribed by HUD. The receipt, retention, and expenditure of the sale proceeds shall be covered in the regular independent audits of the IHA's housing operations, and any supplementary audits that HUD may find necessary for monitoring. Where another entity is responsible for sale of individual units, pursuant to &sect;905.1007(b), the IHA must ensure that the entity's responsibilities include proper recordkeeping and accountability to the IHA, sufficient to enable the IHA to monitor compliance with the approved homeownership plan, to prepare its reports to HUD, and to meet its audit responsibilities. All books and records shall be subject to inspection and audit by HUD and the General Accounting Office (GAO).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2577&hyph;0201) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;905.1018  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Submission and review of homeownership plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Whether to develop and submit a proposed homeownership plan is a matter within the discretion of each IHA. An IHA may initiate a proposal at any time, according to the following procedures:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Preliminary consultation with HUD staff.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Before submission of a proposed plan, the IHA shall consult informally with the appropriate HUD Field Office to assess feasibility and the particulars to be addressed by the plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Submission to HUD.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The IHA shall submit the proposed plan, together with supporting documentation, in a format prescribed by HUD, to the appropriate HUD Field Office.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Conditional approval.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Conditional approval may be given, at HUD discretion, where HUD determines that to be justified. For example, conditional HUD approval might be a necessary precondition for the IHA to obtain the funding commitments required to satisfy the requirements for final HUD approval of a complete homeownership plan. Where conditional approval is granted, HUD will specify the conditions in writing. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2577&hyph;0201)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;905.1019  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> HUD approval and IHA&hyph;HUD implementing agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Upon HUD notification to the IHA that the homeownership plan is approvable (in final form that satisfies all applicable requirements of this part), the IHA and HUD will execute a written implementing agreement, in a form prescribed by HUD, to evidence HUD approval and authorization for implementation. The plan itself, as approved by HUD, shall be incorporated in the implementing agreement. Any of the items of supporting documentation may also be incorporated, if agreeable to the IHA and HUD.

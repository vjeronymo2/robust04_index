"Whatever happens at the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party]  Congress, the economic policy will continue," Minister of the  Economy and Finance Pedro Solbes, who does not belong to the  Socialist Party, assured them. In order to round off the  atmosphere of confidence which he was seeking to achieve, the  economy minister stated that he has decided to accelerate the  administration's outstanding payments to private enterprise, and  disclosed that in the last quarter of 1993 the economy improved  slightly compared with the same period in the previous year.    Solbes himself acknowledged afterward that he went too far  in  stating that he will continue the government's economic policy  irrespective of the Socialist Party congress' results. "My  assertion was overemphatic," the minister acknowledged at a  press conference after delivering an address at the sixth  roundtable organized by the British weekly THE ECONOMIST.    "What I meant is that I am convinced the congress will  support the government's economic policy," he explained.  However, the minister's intention in his address was to make it  quite clear that no sector of the Socialist Party -- referring  to Guerraism -- will curb the reform of the labor market,  according to ministry sources.    In this respect, Solbes was especially clear during his  exposition. "Demands for changes without any kind of  rationality" will not succeed in changing the government's  stance, the minister said, in order to make it clear that the  government will not allow itself to be influenced by the recent  general strike. "The labor reform is absolutely essential,"  Solbes concluded.    Solbes took advantage of his appearance before this select  group of international businessmen to try to create an  atmosphere of confidence by intimating that the Spanish economy  is emerging from the recession it is in. Hence the minister  revealed that, according to the figures at his ministry's  disposal, GDP in the last quarter remained "in balance or was  positive" compared with the same period in the previous year."    "I have decided to accelerate the administration's  outstanding payments to enterprises," the economy minister also  revealed. The decision, which will serve "to clarify the  situation" in state accounts, will cause an apparent increase in  the deficit in the first few months of 1994. This will come  after "a really spectacular increase in the deficit" in 1993.  "We will witness," he added, "an imminent controversy over the  deficit," forecast Solbes, who, however, kept the deficit target  for 1994 at 5.7 percent of GDP.    The minister also took the opportunity to propose again a  reconsideration of the current pensions system, which, he  asserted, "in the long term is leading us to a dead end." The  future law, which will seek to counterbalance state pensions  with private pension schemes, will not be enacted before 1995.  "It cannot be adopted rapidly," the minister said: "We are  talking about pensions in 20 years' time -- not current  pensions."    Just as Pedro Solbes had done in the morning, Grinan  asserted  in the afternoon that "the labor reform is fully supported and  in its entirety by the Socialist parliamentary group by the  party leadership" which will emerge from the next congress.  [sentence as published]    The labor minister gave some figures to show the merits of  the apprenticeship and part-time contracts, two of the most  controversial aspects of the labor reform which led to the  general strike. Grinan said that since the beginning of the  year there have been 1,500 part-time contracts per day, and  this, in his opinion, illustrates "the enormous popularity which  they are enjoying." Minister Solbes asserted this weekend that  apprenticeship contracts are being signed at an average rate of  500 per day. According to the Labor Ministry, over 50 percent  of the part-time contracts signed are for women, and around 50  percent entail less than half the working day.</p>

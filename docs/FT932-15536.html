			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / 700 Names spark new Lloyd's legal battle PROTECTIVE WRITS will be issued today by more than 700 Lloyd's Names on Wellington syndicates 406 and 448, launching fresh legal action at the insurance market. The Names, who include the Duchess of Argyll and the actress Ms Susan Hampshire, are among a group of more than 4,000 who face heavy losses, mainly from US asbestosis and pollution awards. The development comes as prospects for an out-of-court settlement to legal actions at Lloyd's are receding. Names, whose assets support underwriting at the market, are hoping that a settlement will form part of a business plan which the market's leaders expect to publish later this month. The new case centres on reinsurance contracts bought by the Wellington syndicates in 1981 and 1982. These were designed to provide unlimited protection against US liability business underwritten in the 1960s and 1970s. The Names allege, however, that the contracts were not properly negotiated, allowing reinsurers to buy them back. Wellington Names were therefore unprotected against claims that have subsequently emerged. The reinsurer of both contracts was Outhwaite syndicate 317, itself the target of successful legal action by another group of Names last year. Willis Faber, the syndicates' former managers, 46 members' agencies and Ernst &amp; Whinney, the syndicates' auditors, are named in the writs. The Wellington losses are not among the biggest at the market but Names are worried because claims are continuing to come in from insurance policies written as long ago as the 1950s and 1960s. In 1989, 3,698 members of 448 lost Pounds 48.3m (compared to stamp capacity or capital of Pounds 128.7m), but the syndicate's accounts for that year were left open because of the uncertainty. In the same year syndicate 406's 3,035 Names lost Pounds 30.4m (compared to stamp capacity of Pounds 109.6m). Yesterday Mr David Tiplady, solicitor with DJ Freeman, which is issuing the writs, said: 'It seems to me that the only way Names can be succoured is through successful legal action. 'Names should not expect to be rescued by Lloyd's,' he added, reflecting increasing scepticism about the prospects of an out-of-court settlement. Failure to reach an out-of-court settlement is likely to lead to renewed conflict at the market with loss-making Names. 'We do not believe the business plan will have any value if it does not involve settling the litigation,' said Mr Christopher Stockwell, the chairman of the Lloyd's Names Association Working Party, an umbrella group which links groups of aggrieved Names. Mr Stockwell said his group has examined possible legal action against the Corporation of Lloyd's for failing to regulate the market.</p>

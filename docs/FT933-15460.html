			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: HK removes transaction levy on share dealing THE HONG KONG govern-ment has moved to reduce the costs of dealing in exchange-traded securities by formally proposing that a special transaction levy be scrapped, AP-DJ reports from Hong Kong. Mr Michael Cartland, secretary for financial services, said removal of the 0.03 per cent tax on share trades, which was imposed following the collapse of the futures market in 1987, would be the final step in clearing up the last outstanding issue related to the stock market crash. According to the government, some HKDollars 256m remains outstanding from the original HKDollars 1.93bn lifeboat loan that bailed out the futures market. Last month, the Securities &amp; Futures Commission, Hong Kong's stock market regulator, said it would seek to have the levy removed because the loan had been almost completely repaid. It said it did not want to create a surplus. The government said that strong turnover in the stock market would have pushed the surplus to HKDollars 100m or HKDollars 200m by the end of this year if the special levy were not to be repealed.</p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / MPs to demand shake-up at CSA A powerful committee of MPs looks set to recommend sweeping changes to the controversial Child Support Agency in a move that would increase pressure on the government to implement new reforms. An early draft of the social security committee's latest report, circulated this week to committee members, is understood to argue for changes in many areas. These include the formula used when setting the level of maintenance payments to be made by absentee fathers and so-called 'clean break' settlements between divorced couples. The draft also makes radical proposals for involving the committee in the process of assessing any new CSA-related legislation put forward by ministers, whether primary or secondary, before it is enacted. If the suggestions in this area are adopted, they could set an important precedent for the way bills are scrutinised by MPs on their passage through parliament. Members of the committee, which has a Conservative majority, will meet to discuss the draft on October 19, after MPs return from the summer recess. The final report is expected to appear by November, just in time to influence government thinking about whether to include a CSA reform bill in the Queen's Speech. This is under active consideration by ministers, although the government will probably wish to avoid primary legislation on such a controversial topic if it can. Ministers are keen either to be in step with the committee's recommendations or to have convincing arguments ready to deal with the points where they are not. Most recommendations in the committee's first report on the CSA, published last year, were implemented. The draft is thought to advocate simplifying the maintenance-payment formula along the lines of current practice in Australia and New Zealand, and to suggest allowing assessment levels to be reduced in some cases of 'clean-break' settlements. The current principle is that these settlements cannot be offset against maintenance payments. In an article published last month, Mr Frank Field, the committee's Labour chairman, came out in favour of lower payments for parents who started second families 'on the basis that taxpayers will look after first families' than those who 'act knowing the CSA is in existence and here to stay'. The draft urges better co-ordination between the CSA and the Benefits Agency and suggests that consideration be given to the introduction of maintenance 'disregards'. It discusses the possible introduction some form of appeals system - a move Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, cautioned against in the Commons earlier this year. The draft proposes that the Commons committee be asked to hold public hearings on new CSA-related primary legislation after the bill's second reading but before it enters standing committee. It says the committee should be asked to hold similar hearings into any new statutory instruments soon after they are published.</p>

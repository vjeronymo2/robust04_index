			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Observer: A new boy speaks Sir James Goldsmith is on a mission. Should the most flamboyant new member of the European Parliament prove anywhere near as successful in politics as he has been in business his colleagues had better look for new jobs. Becoming an MEP was almost a spin-off for Goldsmith from his campaign against Gatt. However, once inside the temples of Strasbourg and Brussels, he has decided that the only rational response to a massive, wasteful 'Eurocracy' was to campaign fervently for its destruction. 'This place is a putrid pseudo-democracy, full of uprooted trash,' rages Brussels' most outspoken new boy, who has set up his command post in the drab office of the L'Autre Europe group he heads. Like a big cat abandoned in Belgravia he stalks the halls of the labyrinthine parliament building, bemused, appalled, but very far from intimidated. Members encountered in the corridors are right to jump, as if they might be eaten. It is his sole reason for being there. Despite his venture into politics he does not regard himself as another Silvio Berlusconi or Ross Perot. 'The only man ever to go into parliament with honest intent was Guy Fawkes. I feel the same way,' says Goldsmith.</p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Plenty of demand for good Old Masters: Saleroom The works of art that filled the Park Avenue apartment of the late Peter Jay Sharp, the real estate developer who owned the Carlyle Hotel in New York, were sold by Sotheby's in New York on Thursday for Dollars 19.3m. The auction was almost 95 per cent sold by value and 68 of the 77 lots offered found buyers. The top price was the Dollars 2.3m paid for two imaginary views of Venice by Canaletto, but a greater surprise was the Dollars 2.2m which secured a virtuoso painting of a boy drinking from a glass by the 16th century Italian artist Annibale Carracci. It was a record for Carracci, and the price more than doubled the pre-sale estimate. Among the other artist records achieved were the Dollars 1.65m for 'The Presentation in the Temple', a record for a sketch by Rubens; Dollars 1.54m for a portrait of a young man with a recorder by the early 16th century Italian artist Giovanni Savoldo; and the Dollars 1.15m for a portrait of a young man holding a book by Savoldo's contemporary, the Flemish artist Jan Gossaert, called Mabuse. All the paintings were of high quality but they had only recently been acquired by Sharp and works which reappear quickly for sale rarely do so well. There is obviously a pent-up demand for good Old Master paintings. Among the furniture the top price was the Dollars 739,500 paid for a set of three Louis XVI cabinets made around 1780 by Adam Weisweiler. They had sold at Sotheby's in 1985, presumably to Mr Sharp, for Dollars 264,000.</p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Helping Arafat It was always on the cards that the price of peace between Israelis and Palestinians might be a civil war among the latter, if not the former. Both nationalisms lay claim to the same sliver of land. Any territorial compromise represents, in the eyes of many on both sides, a betrayal of the cause. The legitimacy of the leadership which accepts such a compromise is bound to be questioned. Some fighters will believe they have a right and a duty to fight on. Generally they will protest that they have no desire to fight fellow countrymen. Their target remains the national enemy or occupying power. But this puts the leadership in an impossible position. It has to choose, as Israel's prime minister invited the Palestine Liberation Organisation to choose last month, between peace with Israel and peace with Hamas. That was the situation of the Irish provisional government in 1922. Having signed a treaty with Britain, it could not allow Irish dissidents to continue the war. It had to fight a civil war against them, or lose the treaty. Today Yassir Arafat has to crack down on Hamas, or lose his agreement with Israel. The precedent is not encouraging. The Irish treaty created a Free State comprising 26 counties out of the 32 in the island of Ireland, and was endorsed by 72 per cent of the voters. Even so the ensuing civil war was more terrible and destructive than the war against the British which preceded it. Mr Arafat is being asked to fight his civil war in much less favourable circumstances. He does not have a free state, only a limited 'self-governing authority',and he controls only two small fragments of the independent state he hopes for. As for the strength of his support, no one knows because no elections have been held. Probably he could have mustered a majority a few months back. Whether he could now is much more doubtful. The danger that he would lose a civil war in these conditions is such that there is an almost equal danger he will avoid it by reverting to war with Israel. Either outcome would be a disaster for Israel and more especially for Yitzhak Rabin, who has staked everything on the peace process. It is in Mr Rabin's own interest to give Mr Arafat a chance of success, by quickly ceding him real authority in the West Bank as a whole. That may bring closer the moment when Mr Rabin in his turn has to choose, between peace with the Palestinians and peace with those Israelis who would fight rather than withdraw. But that choice too is one that has to be faced.</p>

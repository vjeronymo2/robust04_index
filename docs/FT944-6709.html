			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Clarke defends Britain's policy over EU: Lamont calls for rethink as Brussels cash debate highlights Tory divisions Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, delivered an uncompromising defence of Britain's policy towards the European Union yesterday as the government faced down a threatened rebellion by Tory Eurosceptics over the Brussels budget. But the debate on legislation to allow higher British contributions to Brussels again exposed the deep divisions in the Tory party over Europe. Mr Norman Lamont, Mr Clarke's predecessor at the Treasury, called for Britain to redefine its relationship with Brussels, even if that meant considering withdrawal from the EU. Hardcore Eurosceptics were also still threatening to abstain or vote against the measure in spite of the threat that rebels would be suspended from the parliamentary party. Mr Clarke, in a combative performance, accused Labour and the Liberal Democrats of colluding with the rebels to wreck an agreement they had backed when it was signed at the Edinburgh summit two years ago. He said the government was 'certain' of victory in last night's vote. But a decision to suspend - or more formally remove the parliamentary whip from any rebels - might drastically reduce or wipe out the government's already slender theoretical Commons majority of 14. Right-wing opponents of Mr John Major were also still seeking support for a challenge to the prime minister before Wednesday's deadline for the the launch of any contest. But dissidents on the left of the party made clear that they were not prepared to add their names to the list of those seeking a challenge, leaving the right-wingers short of the required 34 names. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary, had earlier rejected any suggestion that he had any knowledge of suggestions from some in the anti-Major camp that a contest might pave the way for him to win the leadership. Mr Clarke defended the government's decision to make passage of the legislation an issue of confidence. If parliament could not support a deal in which a government had given 'its solemn international commitment', then 'that government has lost the confidence of the House and it must fall'. Insisting that the agreement would add only Pounds 75m to Britain's contributions next year - rising to about Pounds 250m extra by the end of the century - he said the accord represented a 'personal triumph' for Mr Major. Offering a robust defence of the political and economic advantages of Britain's membership, he added: 'That increase in the contribution is an increase in the price we pay for the undoubted benefits of membership of the EU.' Mr Clarke's only concession to the rebels was to promise tougher measures by national governments and by the Brussels Commission to clamp down on EU fraud.

			<p>SUMMARY:       According to Jakarta newspapers, Indonesia's largest  Islamic socio-religious organization Nahdlatul Ulama wants to return  to politics and to the fold of the United Development Party (PPP),  the country's official Muslim party.  However, the papers noted, the  organization will have to face many challenges before this can be  accomplished.      The 4 May SUARA PEMBARUAN reported that Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), the  largest Islamic socio-religious organization in Indonesia, has  decided to return to the fold of the official Muslim party, the  United Development Party.  In 1984, the organization left the party  and politics when it reaffirmed its commitment to "Kithah 1926,"  which stipulates that the organization would engage only in social  and religious activities.      However, according to SUARA PEMBARUAN, NU reemerged in the  political arena when it held a rally of some 500,000 supporters in  Jakarta a few months prior to the 1992 general election.  Politicians and observers were ""caught off guard"" when NU received  such a show of support, the paper said.  However, the paper quoted  NU Chairman Abdurahman Wahid as saying that the rally was only meant  to manifest NU's stand that its members will always be ""loyal to  the country'" and will always "respect" the state ideology of  Pancasila and the 1945 Constitution.      Both ANGKATAN BERSENJATA and KOMPAS on 6 May observed that NU's  attempts to represent itself as a ""political force"" in the country  comes at a time when Indonesia's Muslims have become ""more  aggressive"" in the political arena.  For instance, as a result of  Muslim protests, the government has abolished the state-sponsored  lottery.  More recently, the Muslims were able to get the movie  ""Schindler's List" banned in Indonesia because they objected to the  ""heavy Jewish propaganda"" conveyed in the picture.      According to SUARA PEMBARUAN, ANGKATAN BERSENJATA, and KOMPAS, in  mid-April, 40 NU politicians gathered at the Indonesian Miniature  Park to discuss political developments in the country, gearing up  for the PPP congress in August.  By the end of the meeting, the  participants concluded that NU had a ""good chance"" of gaining the  top PPP post and called for the creation of a special commission  whose mandate will be to invite NU members, who had left the PPP in  1984, to rejoin the party.  In addition, the commission will work  for the election of an NU member as PPP chairman at the upcoming  congress, the papers said.  NU has not officially named any  potential candidates, however, NU Chairman Abdurahman Wahid and NU  official Yusuf Hasjim will most likely be in the running, according  to the papers.      SUARA PEMBARUAN implied that chances for NU to play a leading  role in the PPP are good, since some political observers have noted  that the PPP must come up with a popular figure as its party  chairman in order to be competitive with Golkar's Harmoko, who is  the current information minister, and PDI's (the Indonesian  Democratic Party) Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of President  Sukarno.  The paper also quoted Moechtar Mas'oed of Gajahmada  University as saying that the PPP will become larger and more  respected if it is led by NU politicians, because the number of  ulamas (Islamic scholars; informal leaders in Islamic countries)  among its members will also increase.  At the same time, SUARA  PEMBARUAN pointed out that NU politicians should expect "'numerous  challenges" from within the PPP.  For example, the PPP is planning  to have several "'prominent" figures run for the party leadership,  including Ismail Hasan Metareum, the current PPP chairman.  In  addition, the paper noted that NU must deal with ""internal  conflicts" and "political ambitions,"' saying the organization has  ""a long way to go" before it can reunite with the PPP.

"Adults'  relations mean they don't fight," Miyazawa said, appearing on a  Fuji television program.    Asked about the failed Japan-U.S. framework trade talks, he  suggested Japan should deal with each issue positively.    Miyazawa said the Japanese trade surplus with the U.S. will  not drop sharply, but that Tokyo needs to make Washington  understand it is making efforts to correct the trade imbalance.    Meanwhile, Hosokawa invited former Labor Minister Toshio  Yamaguchi to his official residence Sunday for talks on ways to  promote Japan-U.S. dialogue. Formerly with the opposition  Liberal Democratic Party, Yamaguchi, now an independent, said he  recommended more frequent exchanges of Japanese and U.S.  legislators to help improve bilateral ties. Yamaguchi used to  maintain an office in Washington to keep abreast of developments  in U.S. politics.</p>

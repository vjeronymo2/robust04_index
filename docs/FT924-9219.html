			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Bellway's 40% rise beats expectations BELLWAY, the middle-market housebuilder, yesterday issued a plea to the government to 'keep faith with the industry' in advance of the public spending cuts likely to be announced in the Autumn Statement next week. Mr Alan Robson, finance director, said any cuts in the government's con- tinued support of grant-aided housing 'would stop our expansion'. A significant and growing part of Bellway's business is with housing associations and urban renewal programmes. The company announced pre-tax profits ahead of analysts' expectations, with a 40 per cent rise to Pounds 13m for the year to July 31, against Pounds 9.3m. The advance was struck on sales 20 per cent higher at Pounds 129.9m and was boosted by a Pounds 1.2m gain in interest receivable to Pounds 2.1m. Operating profits rose 29 per cent to Pounds 10.8m. At the moment the outlook for the current year was good, with sales running ahead of 1991-92. 'All the fundamentals are now right,' said Mr Robson. 'Interest rates are very reasonable, affordability is good. We are just waiting for confidence to pick up and unemployment to go down.' The final dividend is increased from 7p to 7.5p for a total of 11.5p (11p). Earnings per share advanced from 13.8p to 18.1p. The shares, which have risen strongly from 195p in September in anticipation of the results, closed 8p higher at 261p yesterday. Mr Robson said Bellway had sold 1,841 homes during the year, a 20 per cent rise on the previous 12 months. The average price increased by Pounds 1,000 to Pounds 68,000. He said the group's strength in the middle to lower-priced end of the market had protected the company. In the north of England and the Midlands, Bellway sold 1,017 houses at an average Pounds 73,000. Last year the group sold 777 at Pounds 72,000. A different mix in the homes offered helped the average price in the south of England jump from Pounds 65,000 to Pounds 73,000. Bellway sold 488 houses last year compared with just 366. Much of the improvement came from strong housing association business. The only area of decline was in the urban renewal division, where sales fell from 375 to 366. COMMENT This is a careful, but canny, company. Over the last two years, Bellway has been working quietly to build up its land bank with bargain priced property. It now boasts 7,000 sites with planning permission, against 5,500 last year. Cash balances of Pounds 20m mean it will continue to add to this. Benefits should really begin to feed through this year and next as the more expensive property purchased in the 1980s sells through. Nit-pickers might seize on the increasing competition in the housing association sector, but that will not have a serious effect on Bellway. Forecasts for the current year are about Pounds 15m and the multiple of less than 13 looks attractive in both the short and medium term - even with the recent share price rally.</p>

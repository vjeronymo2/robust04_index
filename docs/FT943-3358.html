			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions bolster Trinity International First profits from recent acquisitions and gradually rising advertising revenues helped Trinity International, the newspaper publishing group, to a pre-tax outcome of Pounds 10.9m for the six months to June 25. This represented an increase of 15.9 per cent on the Pounds 9.44m reported for the 1993 first half, although the company conceded that UK margins fell slightly as a result of the acquisitions in November of Huddersfield Newspapers and the Argus weekly titles in the south-east of England. Turnover grew by 24 per cent from Pounds 64.7m to Pounds 80.2m, bolstered by a Pounds 14.6m contribution from the acquisitions. Earnings per share were up 18.5 per cent to 10.9p (9.2p). Mr Philip Graf, Trinity's chief executive, said there had been a strong performance by the company's UK and Canadian businesses, but the US results had been adversely affected by the worst weather in the north-east for four years. The vast majority of Trinity's titles in the UK had been unaffected by the national newspaper price war, he said. The Daily Post in Liverpool had, however, lost about 5 per cent of its circulation, taking sales back to 75,000 for the January to June period - levels last reached in 1990. There were early signs, however, that the 5 per cent loss was a one-off, and that circulation on the Liverpool daily was beginning to rise again. 'Although we anticipate a continuation of the national newspapers' cover price war throughout the second half of the year, we believe the overall effect will be small,' Mr Graf said. Trinity has set an interim dividend of 3.3p, an increase of 10 per cent, and said yesterday gearing had dropped from 50 per cent at the end of December to 44.3 per cent. Mr Graf said that advertising volumes were growing, but there were clear differences by category and by area of the company, although job advertisements were strong. 'The second half of the year has begun satisfactorily. Our full-year performance should reflect further good progress in many areas,' Mr Graf added. Mr Derek Terrington, media analyst at stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson, said yesterday he expected full year pre-tax profits of Pounds 23.5m. The Trinity share price rose 1p to 415p.</p>

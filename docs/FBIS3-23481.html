			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Six incidents involving explosive devices have  been recorded this month and all, with the exception of the  foiled attack supposedly on the Israeli Embassy last week, were  intended to undermine government stability, Interior Minister  Chawalit Yongchaiyut said yesterday.    "The incidents that took place can be divided into two  categories. The first involves people wanting to put political  pressure on the government, while those responsible for the  second category are terrorists," Chawalit said at a press  conference after a 90-minute meeting with senior police officers.    Chawalit said the March 3 grenade assault on Social Action  leader Montri Phongphanit's home, the March 8 bomb attack on a  train in Songkhla's Chana district, the March 9 grenade attack  on Deputy Permanent Secretary for Interior Sawai Phramani, the  March 13 grenade attack on the Nakhon Phanom governor's  residence and the March 20 blast in downtown Hat Yai in Songkhla  province fell into the first category. [passage omitted]    But he claimed the attacks carried out by disaffected  political elements with the aim of destabilizing the government  were not of national significance.    "For example, the grenade attack in Nakhon Phanom (at the  provincial governor's home) may be a mistake on the part of the  assailants," he said.    "Acts of terrorism usually intensify and eventually lead to  armed struggle, which is exactly what happened in our country in  the past," he said. [passage omitted]</p>

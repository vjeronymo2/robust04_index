Joe Munoz.  </P> <P> Police confiscated 56 grams of cocaine and $42,000 in cash during raids  Wednesday on three residences in Oxnard, Port Hueneme and Ventura. Also seized  were 10 guns, four vehicles, sales records and assorted drug paraphernalia,  police said.  </P> <P> "We have evidence that we missed some of the dope that had just been  distributed," Munoz said. "But you need cash to buy the drugs and we got that."  </P> <P> Arrested were Oxnard residents Raymond Chaparro, Erma Hernandez and Lance  Williams, all 23. Also arrested were Todd Gamboa, 26, of Ventura and Raul  Losaya of Port Hueneme, Munoz said.  </P> <P> All five are being held at Ventura County Jail on bail ranging from $20,000 to  $100,000, Munoz said.  </P> <P> Hernandez was arraigned Thursday on charges of possession of a controlled  substance with intent to sell. The others will be arraigned today, police said.  </P> <P> The operation was the result of a lengthy investigation by the police  departments of Oxnard, Ventura and Port Hueneme; the Ventura County district  attorney's office; and the local branch of the federal Drug Enforcement  Administration, Munoz said.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, two men were arrested in Port Hueneme after an ounce of  methamphetamine was found in their car, police said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Police arrested Michael Crawford, 24, of Port Hueneme and Mark Cousineau, 28,  of Oxnard after the drug was discovered during a car search.

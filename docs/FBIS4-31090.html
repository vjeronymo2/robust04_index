			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Economics Minister Stanislav Zalud by </F> Marek Stonis; place and date not given: "Regional Policy Can Be  Implemented Even Without Subsidies"]    [Text] It has become increasingly clear recently that  some regions of the Czech Republic have greater economic  problems than others. This is the result of many factors--their  geographic position, a predominance of inefficient industry,  etc. We discussed the method by which the Ministry of Economics  is dealing with this fact with Stanislav Zalud, deputy economics  minister (ODS [Civic Democratic Party]).    [Stonis] At the Ministry of Economics, you are responsible  for the so-called development of regional activities in the  Czech Republic. How can those activities be fulfilled without  resulting in significant drawdowns of resources from the state  budget?    [Zalud] The best way to realize regional policy is to  support  individual regional projects. It is not a matter of thinking up  something in Prague--the regions themselves must decide  regarding the speed and quality of realization of individual  activities. A whole series of support systems exist--support for  activities, for ideas, for programs or connecting various  related matters. I frequently hear the question asked how we can  implement regional policy when we have no means at our disposal  for it in the budget. One can also achieve regional policy by  proving capable of implementing it even on the basis of other  resources. I do not require any of my own resources to initiate  what I am trying to do. The value of the individual projects  that are beginning to be realized in the individual regions lies  in the fact that they are related. In that case, the expending  of resources is efficient.    [Stonis] Can you be specific?    [Zalud] First of all, our ministry has established the  Czech-Moravian Development and Guarantee Bank, which does not  provide funds directly to entrepreneurs, but provides guarantees  for individual projects. Furthermore, we are offering a broad  pallet of programs supported by domestic or foreign resources.  Of course, the efforts are joined by finances resulting from  such programs as PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland  and Hungary], Overtura, Ecos, and HGP [expansion unknown]. I  consider it to be a success that the PHARE program has changed  and will no longer mean only technical assistance, as has been  the case thus far. Finally, for the first time, it is joining in  with massive utilization of its resources for individual  investments. We had lacked that thus far. The regions will be  helped the most if an adequate technical infrastructure exists  there--communications, energy network, etc. If this  infrastructure will function, then entrepreneurs will also  become active in the regions. Of course, a potential  entrepreneur frequently comes to find out that if he wants to  start a business and employ people he must, for example, first  build a wastewater purification capacity and this results in  financial ruin for him even before he opens his business. For  us, for the time being, this frequently represents an  insurmountable handicap.    [Stonis] Some political parties have recently drawn  attention  to the fact that the Czech Republic is beginning to break down  into a rich Bohemia and a poor Moravia. Are they correct?    [Zalud] It is true everywhere in the world that the  opportunities at the disposal of individual regions are not  equal. This is given by the geographic situation, by the  physical conditions, by the climate, etc. In this context, these  are not new theses in any way. One of the tasks of regional  policy is to balance these great differences. But not by  expending great resources in individual regions which might  disappear there like in a black hole. We are attempting to  balance the chances at the disposal of regions, but not by the  across-the-board use of subsidies.    [Stonis] Are there then actually some regions in Moravia  which are actually poorer than regions in Bohemia?    [Zalud] I believe that it continues to be a matter of some  kind of unresolved injustice, which is not always objective. I  believe that Moravia has the means of being economically as  successful as Bohemia. I anticipate, moreover, that it could  show more self-awareness and develop greater activity. I  frequently remind investors that, from the business standpoint,  there are other towns than the city of Prague which are  attractive. For example, Ostrava: I do not believe that it is  only black, but that it is attractive from the business  standpoint in many respects and has many opportunities, even  when it comes to tourism.    [Stonis] Of course, some regions--for example, in the  okreses  of Znojmo, Bruntal, or Novy Jicin--unemployment continues to be  relatively high. Do you believe that these regions have the same  opportunity to be economically successful?    [Zalud] These regions are the subjects of extraordinary  attention. Because they suffer from long-term and persistently  higher unemployment than exists elsewhere, the state has  invested certain resources in these areas. Now, it is only a  matter of these resources being correctly utilized. It is  important for okres offices, in collaboration with labor  offices, to select those most advantageous steps. One can  polemicize as to whether they have adequate resources for this  or not. But these are resources which the state was able to  release on an immediate basis.    [Stonis] Nevertheless, is this regional unemployment  dramatic  or not from your standpoint?    [Zalud] It is not. Together with the Ministry of Labor and  Social Affairs, we have worked out some common material in which  we have dealt in detail with unemployment in these regions. Last  week, we had a basic meeting on redistribution of additional  resources and unemployment in these regions has, in the  meantime, quietly and imperceptibly declined. I want to say that  the numbers are highly mobile and in no way dramatic. Just the  mere input of a certain amount of resources, which would, in a  certain way, solve transportation access to some locations, is  contributing to an immediate improvement in the situation.    [Stonis] Your name is coming up in conjunction with the  privatization of the former military area of Mlada-Ralsko. The  press continues to carry occasional polemics as to whether the  decision on utilizing this territory is correct. Do you believe  that the dispute regarding this military area has definitively  come to an end?    [Zalud] Privatization has definitively been decided on by  government resolution. It is true that there is always someone  in the press who is trying to create the impression that there  is yet another method by which privatization could be  accomplished. Perhaps he simply forgot the fact that the  decision has already been made. But these are matters with which  we are familiar. This happens with all large investment  decisions--for example, regarding the building of a highway.  They are long the subject of polemics and then a decision is  made, the highway is traveled for six years and arguments  continue to be heard regarding the fact that it could have taken  another route. Regarding the military area of Ralsko-Mlada, this  looks to me like the same problem.    [Stonis] What specifically will happen in this area in the  immediate future?    [Zalud] In view of the fact that preparation of the actual  privatization process, in harmony with the given procedures,  requires a certain amount of time, the government approved the  proposal made by our minister on 17 November 1993, with the  exception of approving Resolution No. 404/1993, calling for the  transfer of property to the city of Benatky nad Jizerou, Straz  pod Ralskem, Vsejany, and Mukarov. A similar proposal, whose  scope is essential to assure the continuing functioning of the  community, has been worked out for the community of Ralsko. The  actual procedure for transferring property within the areas of  Ralsko and Mlada is realized on the basis of a schedule of tasks  approved by the government on 22 December of last year.  Preparation for actual privatization is being handled by the  Privum budgetary organization, established by the Ministry of  Economics. The initial proposals for part of the property in the  area of Mlada have already been worked out and turned over for  public announcement. Part of the privatization project in the  above-listed areas also involves property operated by the Prague  Military Forests and Farms, state enterprise, the predominant  portion of which was already published on 8 April.    An essential condition regarding the territory of former  military areas is the working out of the appropriate territorial  planning documentation. The territory of Dobra Voda was handled  within the framework of the territorial region of the Sumava.  The territorial plans for Ralsko and Mlada have been worked out  and have been discussed--currently preparations for their  approval are under way.</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Business Travel Management (10): Why the implant could be on its way out - Does it pay for a company to have a travel agency on its premises? THE ARGUMENT for employing a travel agency implant to organise your travel is weakening as new technology reduces the need for specialist staff to occupy your premises. It will not be long before all arrangements can be handled over the telephone, writes Gillian Upton. The arrival of screen-based information and satellite ticket printers (STPs) for those companies with a large requirement for ticket issuing has made the difference. STPs allow airline tickets to be printed and issued remotely, negating the need for in-house agents to print them. Large companies with a high number of frequent travellers, a significant travel budget and demand for last-minute arrangements have been driving this segment of the market but their needs could be satisfied out-of-house. But what cannot be satisfied is the face- to-face interaction between travellers and travel staff and the emotional reassurance that often brings with it. A travel agency implant is defined by the full-time use of something between one and 25 travel agency staff subcontracted to your company and working on your premises. On the plus side, it automatically releases a full-time travel manager from day-to-day administration and leaves him or her to undertake a more long-term, strategic role. It also saves on the payroll, the implant staff can better integrate and become part of the culture of the company and perhaps do a better job. The business travel agents - American Express, Hogg Robinson, Thomas Cook and Wagons-Lits - compete with each other for a slice of this market sector. Those who dislike this arrangement point to possible security problems in companies where the whereabouts of top executives may be sensitive information, to the potential conflict of interest of the agency staff being loyal to their agency rather than the client and the fact that implants take up valuable floor space, although that has been less of a problem since UK commercial rents nosedived. Space for an implant is usually provided free of charge or well under the going rate to the agent. The anti-lobby say that it is important that implant staff work under supervision of a trained company travel manager whose goal it is to seek money-saving opportunities. Mr Norman Dickens, a travel manager from a large US oil company, has managed an implant for his employer for many years and vigorously defends their usefulness. 'We're in the business of energy, not in the business of running a travel agency. The implant takes on all the responsibility of purchasing, the electronics, training staff, and there are definite benefits. 'I make and maintain the standard of travel and do it as economically as possible,' he adds. Thomas Cook runs the implant with four full-time staff, handling 85 per cent of the client's UK business. The company spends Pounds 2m a year on air tickets. In contrast, one division of BT (British Telecom) rid itself of a travel agency implant some 15 months ago. Mr Jeremy Ing, BT Asia Pacific personnel manager, explains: 'You lose the convenience of being able to wander down to the department and fix an itinerary on the spot but the agent is only a phone call away: we're getting better deals using an agent out-of-house.' The agent in question, Thomas Cook, sends a courier two or three times a day to drop off tickets and travellers cheques and each travelling executive picks up the phone to pass on his/her requirements. 'The traveller is only doing what they were doing previously, deciding where and when to go, so it's no extra work,' says Mr Ing. 'We had a lot of resistance from the travellers initially, but that was only to the change,' he adds. The BT division, in Southall, Middlesex, employs 70 people, at least half of whom permanently travel, predominantly to the Pacific region and to Africa. The combined air and hotel spend annually of this division is around Pounds 4m. BT has lost the shared overhead of a travel manager, gained the floorspace the implant took up and is now reaping the benefit of getting the rebates previously passed direct to the implant. Mr Ing and his counterpart in finance share the in-house responsibility but he admits that very little of his time is spent on day-to-day liaison. 'It's been a gradually improving service over the 15 months,' he says, explaining that he can exploit Cook's larger network of hotel discounts and airline deals.</p>

			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / Arts: HRH The first monarch to bear the name of Windsor, so shrewd about the burgerlich values to be projected via such mass media as the rapidly spreading wireless, was woefully deficient in warmth and communicativeness in his immediate circle. His posterity have unconsciously had their revenge on the patriarch by using the mass media to undermine the image of familial propriety. Snoo Wilson's new play at Theatre Clwyd, Mold, off to Glasgow in three weeks, reminds us of the scandal that rocked the dynasty over half a century ago. It also emphasises how lucky we were to be rid of Edward VIII. On a circular dais, like the face of giant sun-dial, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor pace out their gilded exile in wartime governorship of the Bahamas. Given Wilson's fizzingly imaginative way with history (he has a notable arabesque on Shakespeare and Elizabeth I to his credit), we expect an irreverent, perhaps surreal, bagatelle. In fact we get a duologue full of the sort of anecdote, reminiscence and explanation inevitable with historical subjects, smacking of research but only occasionally igniting theatrically. Wallis resents David's abdication. He adores her in a helpless, nice but dim sort of way. She is obsessed to the point of paranoia by other people's animosity, corroded by Britain's refusal to accord her royal status. David has entrusted a shady businessman with Nazi sympathies with Dollars 2m; and the first act ends with the murder of local millionaire, Sir Harry Oakes. There follows a hypothetical explanation of the Duke's historical blunder in summoning police help from Miami without informing American or British authorities. None of this is especially gripping since we know little of the other characters. The play has little point beyond reiterating that David was in sexual thrall to Wallis. Giles Havergal's direction can do little with such a static piece beyond sit the two characters down or stand them up, facing different directions. Maria Aitken elaborately opens and closes her legs and stylishly delivers the work's one flight of fancy, a dream combining images of sex and wealth. David Yelland, pudgily resembling the Duke, grovels at her feet with a slightly too plummy voice: royals then sounded less posh than BBC announcers. Theatre Clwyd, Mold Box office: 0352 755114</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Kozoriz, Rural Renewal Department, Tel.: </F> 441-82-03: "What Will Happen To Our Own Stalingrad?"]    [Text] You have probably noticed that since MOLOD UKRAYINY  took Ukraine's agroindustrial complex under its patronage, there  have been substantial changes in this sector. "The rate of  decline of agricultural production has decreased significantly.  Compared with last year, gross agricultural production decreased  only two percent, while field-crop output increased seven  percent." This diagnosis was made by the Ministry of Statistics  of Ukraine in its report on the socioeconomic situation in  Ukraine in 1993.    We were pleased to learn of this, particularly because this  was not our only contribution in the agricultural sector. For  example, heeding our request, the Ministry of Agriculture and  Food replaced the massive oak doors at its main entrance with  light Duralumin ones. This reform was no small thing. As I  opened these doors one day, I unexpectedly ran into Borys  Yosypovych Kyrychenko, the head of the Main Administration for  Foreign Economic Relations of the Ministry of Agriculture and  Food. No sooner had I said hello than Borys Yosypovych invited  me into his office for a cup of tea (if only everyone was this  hospitable). As we drank our tea, I asked him an important  question: what is happening in the agrosector as far as foreign  investments are concerned? In light of the heightened interest  in this issue among the general public, I offer the readers a  synopsis of the answer that I received to this question from  Borys Yosypovych Kyrychenko.    1. Our agrarian complex depends on the West for some two  billion dollars in production resources. This money is spent to  buy veterinary medicines, chemicalization means, spare parts,  packaging materials, etc. In other words, it costs two billion  dollars just to keep the agroindustrial complex [APK]  functioning. To enable us to bring it closer to the level of the  agrosectors in Western countries, we would need an additional  four to five billion dollars. If we had this money, in three to  four years we could increase the export potential of farm  products to 10 billion dollars. The problem is that we cannot  get this kind of start-up capital from anyone. They have no  confidence in us.    2. It would be naive to count on receiving investments from  Washington as we once received capital investments from Moscow.  We need to take a more realistic view of things. We are  currently in the midst of an economic war. While our ancestors  began fighting by throwing rocks, then moved on to bows, and  finally developed nuclear weapons, the weapon in the economic  war is the dollar. The side with more dollars is always  stronger. Economic wars may be less savage than military  conflicts, but the results are the same -- the invasion of the  other side's economy. That is why the stage in which our economy  is today can be compared to 1941-43. Only we have not yet dug in  on our own Volga, near our own Stalingrad. We still have no  Marshall Zhukov who would know how to stop the retreat. We do  not yet have our own Stalin's decree: "Not another step back."  And we do not know what will happen to our own Stalingrad.    3. There is great interest in Ukraine in the world  community.  Not only because it has the most fertile black soil in Europe.  For example, we sow almost as much corn as the whole of Western  Europe. How much we reap is another matter. We underrate our  agrarian potential, while Western businessmen know its value.    Ukraine could build her whole economy on sugar, sunflowers,  and wheat. If our work met the standards of Western countries,  we could easily export close to 20 million metric tons of grain,  approximately 5 million metric tons of sugar, and almost one  million metric tons of sunflower oil. Moreover, at below  world-level prices, because production costs in our country are  significantly lower and our labor force is cheaper. This is  humiliating, but in today's situation it also gives us an  advantage. On the one hand, these factors attract those who want  to make money in Ukraine, while, on the other hand, the  competitiveness of our products in the world market scares  Western businessmen.    4. The agrarian sector can assure the country the necessary  supplies of oil products. But to do so, we need to set aside  three million of our 43 million hectares of land and use the  income from this area to purchase oil. We need to create special  companies, which could be organized into consortiums that would  produce farm goods, the proceeds from which would go to buy oil.  We would thus not need to look for other financial resources to  pay for fuel. We could also solve the problem of rural  investments at the expense of our agrarian potential. But this,  too, requires start-up capital.    5. In the past year, our agriculture with large private  firms  [as published] received 120-130 million dollars in short-term  credits. As a rule, these loans are extended for sowing with the  expectation that a profit will be made that the fall. Last year,  as part of such joint ventures, we grew sugar beets, sunflowers,  and corn on an area covering 300,000 hectares.    There are close to 70 joint enterprises in Ukrainian  agriculture, of which 22 are engaged in production, 36 in trade,  and the remainder are at the stage of being established.    Among the foreign companies that are in partnership with our  structures in the agroindustrial complex, Polish, Czech, and  Hungarian companies predominate numerically, while American,  German, and Italian firms lead in terms of the amounts of  capital invested. No one is asking who the winner will be [as  published]. At this stage, the most active are the Americans,  later, perhaps, the Germans may lead, although not every company  represents national or state interests. Today, the interests of  the transnational corporations dominate. For example, the  Tetrapak company, which is manufacturing packaging for milk  products in our country, is registered in Great Britain, but the  company's president, Hans Rausing, is a Swede. Why in Great  Britain? Because the tax rate is lower there.    6. Foreigners are being frightened away by our unstable  laws.  When they were first passed, they were exceptionally  advantageous for foreign investors. Later some of these laws  were fundamentally changed. Also the mechanism of settling  accounts with foreign partners has not been thoroughly worked  out, and double taxation makes the production of goods for  export unprofitable. These are the reasons that our agrarian  rating has fallen significantly in the world.    7. And lastly. Capital flows where there are profits to be  made. It is not possible to hold it with political actions. If a  businessman figures out that he can make money on Ukrainian  sunflower oil, he will bring his investment to Ukraine. These  are our trump cards. But one can lose even while holding a good  hand of trumps. Everything depends on the skill with which the  game is played.    Incidentally, apropos trump cards. Just as this material was  going into print, the State Program To Encourage Foreign  Investment in Ukraine was published unexpectedly.  Characteristically, the agroindustrial complex was included in  the priority sphere for investment along with other sectors of  the national economy. The program provides for the introduction  of highly productive farm technologies, the refurbishment and  modernization of food processing enterprises, the development of  the agricultural machine-building industry, etc. In a word,  exactly the things that we lack at present. Therefore, despite  the pessimistic notes sounded by Borys Kyrychenko in his  prognosis, there is room for optimism. We need only add that the  Law "On the State Program To Encourage Foreign Investment in  Ukraine" will come into force on 1 March 1994. Let us wait,  shall we?</p>

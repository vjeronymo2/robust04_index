			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / International Company News: Sarrio blames KIO as profits tumble SARRIO, the Spanish cardboard producer controlled by Italy's Saffa group, announced a sharp fall in net profits to Pta105m (Dollars 906,000) for 1992 from Pta2.7bn. The group said the blame lay solely with the Kuwait Investment Office. Mr Carlo Bonomi, chairman, said Sarrio was owed Pta8.6bn by Grupo Torras, KIO's investment arm in Spain, which bought Sarrio's special paper operations in February 1991. Sarrio is suing Torras, as well as the KIO and the Kuwait Investment Authority, the investment office's controlling department, for non-payment on the trans-action. At the same time, Sarrio has been forced to provide against a fall in the value of shares in Torras-controlled companies it acquired as part payment on the deal. Grupo Torras went into receivership at the end of last year. Mr Bonomi said Sarrio's results had been dramatically affected by the KIO.</p>

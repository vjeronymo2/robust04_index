			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / EC interest rates puzzle: Why Germany pushed at an open door on monetary policy THE reluctance of Germany's partners in the European exchange rate mechanism to cut their interest rates has caused considerable puzzlement in the two weeks since currency speculation forced the ERM countries to adopt 15 per cent fluctuation margins. Part of the answer appears to be that Germany specifically asked other ERM countries not to push interest rates down precipitately after agreeing the changes in the ERM at the August 1-2 crisis meeting of EC finance ministers and central bank governors in Brussels. Hitherto unreported details of that meeting may also provide clues as to how European Community countries will frame their international monetary policies in the months ahead. In particular: Britain, in the person of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, spoke in favour of retaining the ERM, rather than seeing the European Community adopt a generalised floating of currencies. Belgium came nearest to supporting exchange controls to combat speculation. Germany appears to have ruled out any 'fast track' monetary union with France ahead of the Maastricht Treaty schedule for Emu. According to European monetary officials, it was at the end of the bruising negotiations over the future of the ERM that Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank vice-president and president-designate, 'recommended' that other ERM countries should exercise caution in cutting interest rates once they had agreed to wider fluctuation bands. Some of those present in the early hours of Monday August 2 expected the other members of the ERM would pay little attention to his call. The move appeared designed to shield the Bundesbank from pressure to cut its own rates sharply and so undermine its counter-inflation programme. But it turned out that Germany was pushing on an open door. Except for Spain, all the ERM countries have proved reluctant to cut their interest rates. France, which earlier this year had been anxious to push short-term rates below German levels, has responded with only two small cuts in the past two weeks. The decision to keep the Dutch guilder within its old 2.25 per cent fluctuation margins against the D-Mark seems to have dissuaded other ERM countries from embarking on competitive devaluation within the ERM. France appears also to have opted to keep interest rates high for the time being to rebuild its currency reserves and maintain the prestige of Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, who earlier had threatened to resign rather than see the franc devalued. Germany may also have benefited from its display of strength in the early August crisis meeting, which came close to collapse when it was proposed that the D-Mark and guilder should be floated off from the rest of the ERM. Belgium insisted that it should stay within the old 2.25 per cent band against the D-Mark. It proposed that the Belgian franc should be supported by large-scale intervention and through the imposition of 100 per cent minimum reserve requirements to deter speculation. This suggestion, which would be equivalent to the imposition of exchange controls, was rejected by the other countries with the result that the meeting began to consider the option of a generalised float for the ERM currencies. Some officials believe that at this point the German delegation came under intense pressure from the office of Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, not to accept a generalised floating. Bonn received support from an unlikely quarter. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, who had played a very small part in the talks, sided with Mr Henning Christophersen, the EC commissioner for monetary affairs, in saying that a generalised float was a bad solution. Shortly after this, the meeting agreed to 15 per cent fluctuation margins. Although the UK had not participated in the ERM since the previous September, Mr Clarke was unwilling to see a free-for-all among European currencies that would undermine the competitiveness of UK exports to the rest of the EC. The UK also took the view that a generalised float would jeopardise the EC single market and threaten the monetary arrangements under the common agricultural policy while the existence of the ERM had eased the management of sterling as a floating currency over the previous 10 months. Mr Clarke's stance may earn him little support among the Eurosceptics of the British Conservative party. But they can probably take comfort from Germany's clear rejection of a 'fast track' move to monetary union with France. When this idea was put forward by a Portuguese delegate as one way out of the crisis, it was dismissed as a 'joke' by Mr Gert Haller, the state secretary in the Bonn Finance Ministry.</p>

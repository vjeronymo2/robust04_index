			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / International Company News: Amdahl expects deeper losses in fourth quarter Amdahl, the Californian mainframe computer manufacturer, expects to report a fourth-quarter loss of more than 35 cents a share - greater than Wall Street's expectations, writes Martin Dickson. The company, which has been suffering from a downturn in the mainframe market and does not have other products to fall back on, said unit volumes had increased in the fourth quarter over the low level of the third quarter. However, margins had declined because of pressure on pricing and a shift in sales mix towards smaller, dual processor systems.</p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (24): Surprising collaborations emerge - Value-added Services / Phone companies and software suppliers aim to reap the benefits of the electronic mail bonanza To ask a telephone company to do joint marketing with a software company is a bit like asking the tortoise if it would collaborate with the hare. It seems like a complete mis-match in commercial culture. Yet that could be just what the phone companies have to do in order to boost their value-added services business. The reason is electronic mail. Email is one of the fastest growing software applications for personal computers. Software giants Microsoft, Lotus and Novell/WordPerfect have targeted communications as the next big growth area for their own applications. They have simplified end-user email software and are aggressively pursuing it. One of the problems with email services in the past is that they were not user-friendly, and were usually accessed by equally unfriendly communications software. Lotus, Microsoft and Novell/WordPerfect have evolved software which makes it easy for people to send mail, directly from their spreadsheets and word processors: what they call 'mail enabled applications.' It uses the same interface that people are used to in their other applications, so that people do not need to learn a new way of working just to send mail. Jenny Proctor, UK marketing director of AT&amp;T Ezylink, cited the example of economists in the City of London who want to replace fax with email for sending reports to customers. This is the direct result of the improved personal computer software - 'in the finance sector, mail enabled applications are a growth area,' she says. This should be good news for the telephone companies, which have the opportunity to sell services to support the increased demand for connectivity - 'software companies such as Microsoft have simplified end-user software, and are promoting telecom activities. This is now acting as a driver for messaging services and frame relay managed data network services,' comments Neil Lawrence, applications and information marketing manager at British Telecom. The corporate email systems typically run on local area networks (lans); lans in different buildings are connected to create an 'enterprise-wide system.' One way to achieve lan-to-lan connections is to use a frame relay managed data network service - frame relay being a faster method of transmission than older packet switched data networks and more suitable for connecting lans. This segment of the market is currently small, with an estimated value of Ecu60m (Dollars 74.4m) across Europe, according to London-based market research consultancy Ovum; this is due to the fact that frame relay is a new technology. However, sales are growing fast, and vendors such as BT and AT&amp;T report that they are struggling to keep up with demand for frame relay services: BT claims this segment of the market is growing at 300-400 per cent, per year. Ovum analyst Clare McCarthy predicts a sharp upturn in growth from 1996 onwards - 'by 1998, we are looking at projected European revenues of around Ecu800m (Dollars 992m) for frame relay services,' she adds. Another way to connect lans is to use the public email services offered by the telephone companies. Most email services provide a simple way to connect the popular proprietary lans such as Lotus cc: Mail and Microsoft Mail. For example, cc: Mail users could connect to a service and send mail between two sites without ever knowing they were not using cc: Mail all the way. According to Ovum, this market will grow at an average of 53 per cent a year in Europe. However, in order to reap the benefits of the email bonanza, the telephone companies have to become as aggressive in their marketing tactics as the software companies themselves. It represents a significant cultural shift away from traditional telephone company thinking. According to Mr Lawrence, there has been a sea change in the way user purchasing decisions are taken. In the past, users would go through the IT department to get email. Now they buy it out of their own budget - 'end-users are now becoming more influential in purchase decisions,' he says. To attract end-users, the phone companies will have to work with Microsoft, Lotus and Novell/WordPerfect on product marketing as well as product development. For example, BT has a collaborative arrangement with Microsoft which permits geographically dispersed workers to use Microsoft groupware software for collaborative working over ISDN lines. This will be an odd situation for most phone companies. According to some industry observers, those who have faced competition in core services, such as the US or UK phone companies, should be flexible enough to cope. Others will have difficulty, especially those which still operate in a non-competitive monopoly environment. End-users are also being attracted by the Internet, and Compuserve, two global network services which actively target individuals, and sell the benefits of going on-line. They are pursuing high profile marketing campaigns and are creating an awakening as to the possibilities of email. This could represent a further threat to the traditional email networks as operated by the telephone companies. The take up of traditional email does not match the quoted numbers for the Internet, which has 30m users worldwide. The Internet - or 'The Net,' as it is commonly called - covers around 140 countries and is expanding at the rate of ten per cent a month. Well over two million computers are linked to the network. In the UK alone, there are a million Internet users and numbers are growing, according to David Mooring, marketing consultant with Pipex, a reseller of Internet connections. Pipex and others are targeting corporate customers, and they could provide more of a competitive threat to the traditional electronic mail services market. Mr Mooring points out that today most of those users are academics, but adds: 'The number of commercial users is growing. I reckon that in a year's time there will be more non-academic users than academics.' However, Neil Lawrence believes that business customers are attracted by the concept of the Internet, but find they need the greater security features of the business messaging networks. 'Once people consider investing, they ask 'Is it secure?' and 'Do I get an audit trail?'' he says. Mr Lawrence reports an increased number of enquiries for British Telecom's messaging services in recent months, in response to the Internet marketing campaigns. Jenny Proctor believes the email market will split into two groups: serious business applications and personal 'chat'/lightweight business use. She sees an emerging group of business customers who will require a more sophisticated electronic mail service, which the telephone companies are in the best position to provide.</p>

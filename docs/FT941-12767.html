			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / Observer: Whipped Belize The Labour party's seven-week-old procedural war against Britain's Tory government at Westminster is turning ugly. Labour's refusal to 'pair' with Tory MPs, the process whereby MPs of opposing parties agree to be absent during a vote, is forcing MPs to be on hand for virtually every Commons vote  -a stricture to which most are unaccustomed. As if this was not bad enough, one of the high spots in the MP's winter calendar - a fact-finding trip by the defence select committee, to the former British colony of Belize - has had to be cancelled. A case of the wrong type of guerrilla warfare?</p>

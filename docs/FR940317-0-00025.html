			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Paperwork Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Manufacturers opting to apply ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, citric acid, sodium ascorbate, or sodium citrate to fresh beef and lamb cuts will be required to develop and maintain a partial quality control (PQC) program. FSIS will receive, evaluate, and either approve or disapprove requests for such PQC programs. The PQC program will be placed on file in the establishment, and be available to any duly authorized representative of the Secretary. The information collection requirements contained in this final rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under approval number 0583&hyph;0087. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Wilson Foods Petitions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> On December 13, 1988, and October 24, 1991, Wilson Foods Corporation, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, submitted petitions, along with supporting technical data, to FSIS to permit the application of ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, sodium ascorbate, citric acid and sodium citrate, singly or in combination, to fresh beef cuts and fresh lamb cuts to delay discoloration of the meat cuts. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  The intended effect of ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, and sodium ascorbate is to serve as antioxidants; the intended effect of citric acid and sodium citrate is to serve as sequestrants. The petitioner's data demonstrate that the required amount to accomplish the intended effects, singly or in combination, would be at levels not to exceed 500 ppm or 1.8 milligrams (mg) per square inch of the product's surface of ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, or sodium ascorbate, and/or not to exceed 250 ppm or 0.9 mg per square inch of the product's surface of citric acid or sodium citrate. The data submitted by the petitioner were the results of experiments on products which were packaged in a modified atmosphere of carbon dioxide, oxygen, and nitrogen. It is the Agency's understanding that the benefits provided by the addition of these substances occur regardless of packaging conditions. However, this rulemaking concerns the addition of substances, rather than packaging gases, which are not a part of this rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 --> Copies of the petitions and supporting technical data are available for review in the FSIS Hearing Clerk's office. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The petitioner's data further demonstrate that such treatments result in delaying undesirable discoloration of the product for a period of time that does not exceed the product's microbiological shelf life. Fresh beef cuts and fresh lamb cuts treated with the substances mentioned above and stored at refrigerator temperature will remain wholesome for up to 21 days. Loss of the ``fresh'' color and marketability of beef cuts and lamb cuts occurs before the product becomes microbiologically unsafe. Some consumers are reluctant to purchase fresh beef or lamb cuts because of the change to a darker color of the product before spoilage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Current Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Section 318.7(c)(4) of the Federal meat inspection regulations (9 CFR 318.7(c)(4)) allows the use of ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, citric acid, sodium ascorbate, and sodium citrate on fresh pork cuts to maintain color at levels not to exceed either 500 ppm or 1.8 mg/sq inch of surface of ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid or sodium ascorbate, singly or in combination, and/or not to exceed either 250 ppm or 0.9 mg/sq inch of surface of citric acid or sodium citrate, singly or in combination. In addition, 9 CFR 318.7(c)(4) requires the use of such substances under an approved PQC program under 9 CFR 318.4(d) and (e). Section 317.8(b)(37) of the Federal meat inspection regulations (9 CFR 317.8(b)(37)) requires that when ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, citric acid, sodium ascorbate, and sodium citrate, singly or in combination, are added to fresh pork cuts, there shall appear on the label of that product, in letters of the same style and type and not less than one-fourth the size of letters in the product name, contiguous to the name of the product, a statement identifying the specific approved substance(s) by its common name and the purpose for which it is added such as ``Sprayed with a solution of water, ascorbic acid and citric acid to maintain color.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists ascorbic acid in 21 CFR 182.3013, erythorbic acid in 21 CFR 182.3041, and sodium ascorbate in 21 CFR 182.3731 as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) when used in accordance with good manufacturing practices for use as preservatives. FDA lists citric acid in 21 CFR 182.6033 and sodium citrate in 21 CFR 182.6751 as GRAS when used in accordance with good manufacturing practices for use as sequestrants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Proposed Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> On October 4, 1993, FSIS published a proposed rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 51581) to permit the application of ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, citric acid, sodium ascorbate, and sodium citrate, singly or in combination, to the surface of fresh beef cuts or fresh lamb cuts to delay discoloration of such meat cuts. The proposed rule would allow these substances to be used, singly or in combination, at levels of not more than 500 ppm or 1.8 milligrams per square inch of product surface area for ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid or sodium ascorbate, and/or not more than 250 ppm or 0.9 milligrams per square inch of surface area for citric acid or sodium citrate to achieve the intended technical effects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

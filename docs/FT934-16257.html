			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Arts: The Piano Lesson - Theatre The second half of August Wilson's The Piano Lesson is so good that one immediately forgives a rather laborious first act. The last 15 minutes are so dramatically clever that even the most seasoned play-goer is unlikely to foresee the ending. Twice I guessed wrong. When the gun is barely concealed in the lady's dress, I thought there would be a shooting, probably fatal. When the shooting was diverted by a drunken entrance stage right and the drunk proceeded to play the piano that is at the centre of the play, one wondered, knowing that the three hours were almost up, what on earth could happen next. As it turns out, divine intervention. Yet as the preacher exorcises the house and the piano, it is a reasonable assumption that the instrument which has been so rooted to the floor that not even grown men can move it, will become suddenly lighter. That does not happen either. Wilson's Piano Lesson ends happily, even sentimentally. Sentimentality, however, is no longer the dominant note, as it was in his play Fences, which was shown in London three years ago. Wilson is a black American playwright who writes mainly about blacks and has won most of the American theatre prizes. The evidence of The Piano Lesson suggests that he is up with the best, alongside Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller and David Mamet. It is Pittsburgh 1936, then not a bad place for blacks to live compared with the American south. At least there are jobs and prospects. One of the residents of the house works on the railways, enjoys wearing his uniform and travelling across the states. The widowed Berniece takes a pride in owning the house, working and bringing up her daughter who might go in for teaching. The problem is a mixture of the piano and the arrival of relations from the south, notably the Boy Willie. Willie is the brother of Berniece. He wants to sell the piano - a hugely ornate affair, though an upright  - in order to buy land back home. Berniece resists: the piano is the most prized possession that the family, such as it is, has ever had. In the past it had been exchanged for 1 1/2 niggers: one grown-up, one child. Wilson takes too long to set out the background. Yet, once it is established, there are some masterly scenes. Berniece, played by Cecilia Noble, is a very attractive and intelligent woman. She is not madly keen on coming out of her widowhood to marry the preacher Avery (Danny John-Jules), but comes tantalisingly close in the middle of the night, when much of the action takes place, to falling for one of her brother's friends. This friend is called Lymon, played by Cyril Nri. He is not very bright and takes a childish delight in being sold a white silk three-piece suit with silk handkerchief and white and brown two-tone shoes to match. He buys a perfume that he is told is worn by the Queen of France, then gives it to Berniece. In the marvellous second act, there are other felicities, not least in the twists and turns of the plot. There is also feeling. The play is directed by Paulette Randall and designed by Poppy Mitchell. If you cut the first act by 20 minutes, it would be the highest professionalism all round. Tricycle Theatre, London NW6, until October 31. (071) 328 1000</p>

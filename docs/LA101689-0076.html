			<p><P> October 16, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CENTRAL;  </P> <P> WESTMINSTER;  </P> <P> FIREWORKS BACKERS SEEK REFERENDUM  </P> <P> A group of Westminster residents opposed to the recently passed ordinance  banning fireworks in the city has submitted more than 6,000 signatures to City  Hall seeking a referendum on the issue.  </P> <P> The Westminster Citizens for a Safe and Responsible Fourth of July, a group  composed of local civic clubs and individuals, formed soon after the ordinance  was passed on Sept. 12.  </P> <P> "We began getting organized and having meetings the next week after the  decision on the ban was made," Cathy Zoellner, leader of the group, said. "We  feel this is an issue that the citizens should have a say on."  </P> <P> The ordinance automatically was suspended when the signatures were submitted.  If city officials verify that 3,734 of the signatures are those of registered  voters, a special election will be scheduled.  </P> <P> City officials say that they banned the fireworks because of safety hazards.  </P> <P> "There are only about six or seven other cities in the county that still allow  them," said City Clerk Mary Lou Morey. "So the city took that seriously into  account when it voted on the ban."  </P></p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Harrods to be asked to abandon pay freeze USDAW, the shop workers union, will this week attempt to persuade Harrods, the London department store, to lift a six-month pay freeze for its 4,000 employees. The Knightsbridge store, which has been encountering difficult trading conditions because of a drop in tourist numbers after the Gulf war, has told staff it will review the pay freeze, which started on April 1, in the autumn. Harrods, owned by House of Fraser, had offered its non-managerial staff a 3 per cent increase from April 1 with a further 2 per cent in October. Usdaw, which will be meeting senior representatives of Harrods on Thursday to ask them to re-open pay negotiations, said the offer was withdrawn on Friday and a pay freeze announced. Last month Harrods told all its 600 managerial staff that their pay was being frozen. Pay freezes have been adopted by a significant number of employers this year but Laura Ashley Holdings, the fashion and household retailer, was so far believed to be the only high-street retailer among them. Pay awards in the retail sector have been averaging about 9 per cent to 10 per cent although members of the Multiple Shoe Retailers' Association restricted pay rises for 19-to-21-year-olds to 5 per cent. Earlier this year Harrods shed 200 staff. The redundancy programme was to have been larger, but was trimmed after staff protests. It was prompted by poor trading conditions in February.</p>

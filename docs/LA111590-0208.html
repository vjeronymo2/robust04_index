			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORS ASK NAVY TO BELAY SEA OF DUST FROM WEAPONS BASE  </P> <P> As the wind began to kick up one afternoon this summer, the dust wafted across  Bolsa Chica Road and into nearby back yards, coating lawn furniture and landing  on pools.  </P> <P> The wind stiffened, and within minutes the swirling dust cloud blanketed roof,  patios, cars and, in some cases, indoor carpeting, furniture and drapes with a  thick layer of fine dirt. For drivers, visibility was reduced to less than 50  feet.  </P> <P> It was the beginning of a five-hour episode July 26 that residents in a  district of homes east of the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station call the Bolsa  Chica Dust Bowl of 1990.  </P> <P> It was the worst example of dust emanating from barren land on the naval  station site, a problem that has grown in recent years.  </P> <P> The dust was the result of unusual weather conditions, particularly dry,  powerful winds that also whipped up sprawling fires in Santa Barbara and  elsewhere around the Southland.  </P> <P> But residents of Westminster and Huntington Beach tracts south of Westminster  Boulevard along the eastern side of Bolsa Chica Road say the storm illustrates  the severity of the area's chronic dust problem.  </P> <P> Almost daily, the winds blow, and so comes the drifting dirt. Residents say the  dust routinely blows through windows, doors and chimneys, sullying drapes,  carpets and furniture. Some have attributed sinus and bronchial problems to the  dust clouds.  </P> <P> Many residents of the area of comfortable, two-story homes say they keep their  doors and windows closed, even during heat waves. And some say they have  abandoned their back yards entirely.  </P> <P> "We don't even use our back yard any more, Westminster resident Joyce Taylor  said. "You can't; it's so filthy. We don't barbecue any more. . . . We had our  grandchildren here last week, and we didn't even let them go out and play out  back."  </P> <P> Even before the July dust storm, the naval station was cited by the South Coast  Air Quality Management District. The dusty conditions "can cause severe health  problems," district spokeswoman Claudia Keith said.  </P> <P> More than 250 residents signed a petition requesting a remedy, which was  presented to naval officials.  </P> <P> About one-fifth of the 5,000-acre naval station is barren land. Navy officials  acknowledge that the problem has escalated during the last four years, for  several reasons:  </P> <P> * The statewide drought has dried up areas of Anaheim Bay National Wildlife  Refuge, which is part of the base.  </P> <P> * A row of adult oleander bushes and other plants, which for years had buffered  the neighbors from the wind-swept silt, were removed during 1985 and 1986  projects to widen a county flood-control channel running along the site's  eastern border. Until last month, none of those plants had been replaced.  </P> <P> * Some soil excavated for the expansion of the pier at the Port of Long Beach  was dumped at the Seal Beach station on a strip 100 yards by 1 mile.  </P> <P> To discuss solutions, officials from the naval station, Westminster and the  County Environmental Management Agency have been holding monthly meetings with  residents. The latest meeting is scheduled today.  </P> <P> Since the meetings began in August, some short-term steps have been taken to  curb the dirt. Three dirt roads have been treated with polymers. Each  treatment, which last about three months, costs $25,000 to $30,000, Thomas  said. The Navy also spent about $8,000 to pave some particularly offensive  spots.  </P> <P> Also, more than 800 oleander saplings, which Westminster bought for $1,000,  were recently planted.  </P> <P> Long-term solutions have been more difficult to find, officials say.  </P> <P> The best, least costly permanent solution, Thomas said, would be vegetation.  The Navy is awaiting results from soil studies to determine what kinds of  plants, requiring little or no watering, can grow there.  </P> <P> "We have to deal with it, but we can't make plants grow overnight," he said.  </P></p>

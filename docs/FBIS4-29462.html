			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 19 Jun Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] In reference to remarks made by Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata that could be interpreted as meaning that Japan has  the capability to develop nuclear arms, and asked by the news  corps in the prime minister's residence "How would you explain  it? There are big reactions from China," the prime minister  said: "What explanation? Does one have to give an explanation  on such a trivial matter? Talk about capability... I heard a  long time ago that even a Tokyo University student can make  them." He thus insisted that there are no problems with the  remarks he has made, and said he is not thinking about offering  any explanation.    The prime minister said emphatically, "To begin with, we  have  never even imagined going to war with nuclear arms. Shall I  call them stupid objects? As a politician, I have never once  thought about possessing them (nuclear arms). We can do without  such undesirable things. I will faithfully work toward  completing the abolition of nuclear arms."</p>

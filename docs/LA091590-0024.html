			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. OPEN SERVES TENNIS WITH POTENTIAL PROBLEM  </P> <P> The U.S. Open tennis tournament was entertaining at its best, but the  magnificent performance of Pete Sampras has served to place a dark cloud on the  horizon for this and other tournaments.  </P> <P> His awesome serve was so dominant that it could be the forerunner of a trend to  place too high a dividend on that one facet to the detriment of finesse and  many other exciting nuances of the game.  </P> <P> Perhaps some thought should be given to raising the net a few inches or  shortening the service area to prevent the power play from making a mockery of  the game.  </P> <P> BILL KRAUSE  </P> <P> Palm Springs  </P></p>

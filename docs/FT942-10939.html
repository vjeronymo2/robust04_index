			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / 'Could you spare five minutes?': Journalist John White tells his own experience of redundancy Birthday presents come in all shapes and sizes. On the day before my 38th I was made redundant. As a journalist I had written plenty about unemployment over the years, but I soon found I had never really understood the word: redundancy. I was not alone in facing the call-up to the ranks of the unemployed. First in line was the editor of our Emap-owned Cambridge-based free newspaper, known quaintly as the Town Crier. And queueing right behind me was our photographer. Three out of five members of the editorial staff out of a job in less than 15 minutes. Mick Ferris, the editor, was summoned to the managing director's office with the apparently innocuous phrase: 'Could you spare five minutes?' Five minutes, 10 minutes, an hour, days, weeks, months. Mick had plenty of time on his hands, though he did not at that point know it. He returned clutching a white envelope in one hand and moved to turn off his computer terminal. He had been told not to talk to the rest of us, he said, but he had been made redundant and they wanted to see me next. Knowing the state of the economy and realising our small-time outfit had been losing money for some time, I had been mentally preparing myself for this moment for more than a year, while continuing to hope for the best. I had reached 37 years and 364 days without having to 'sign on' but time was running out. I was motioned to sit on the other side of a boardroom-style table that looked larger and longer than I had noticed before. Facing me was David Nizol, the boss, recently recruited from London's Yellow Advertiser free newspaper group. He had shaken hands with me a few weeks earlier on being given the usual first-morning meet-the-people tour. At his side was Anthony Hawkswell, the newly-appointed group editor, looking rather stiff and awkward. Something was said. I do not remember what. It was management-speak. I do recall asking the face in the distance to cut the nonsense, but apparently there were procedures to go through. Whatever they were, I did not hear them and they amounted to no more in my language than: 'You're redundant.' Immediately afterwards the whole thing does not feel too bad. There is a comforting, sort of numb feeling and everything seems to be happening at a distance. Is this shock? It should not be. Today, everyone knows a little white envelope with their name on it may be lurking in their manager's top drawer. For whatever reason, for some time everything seems unreal. A chunk of your life has been taken from you and you know it has; a part of your existence has been torn from you, but your brain has not got round to accepting that an irreversible change has taken place. And so, people make appropriate noises saying how sorry they are (and they really are) and you go through the motions of accepting with good grace and a forced smile, their condolences and commiserations. By the time it gets to two or three in the morning and you still have not been to sleep, you decide to put the kettle on. You find yourself using a secondhand teabag and consciously thinking that you're having to save money now. You tell yourself you are coping quite well  -and you probably are compared to any others hurled into the psychological abyss of redundancy. Your situation is not as bad as it might be. Your partner is working. You have worked out your finances. You will be able to survive, just. Now I think about it, I do recall some phrases, and one in particular. The face on the other side of the table muttered something amazing as it was about to hand me my envelope. The mouth opened and it said it thought it was being quite reasonable about all this. Could it hear itself? Did it believe what it was saying? When your time comes, you are expected to sit on the other side of that table, conducting yourself in a civilised fashion. You are expected to accept that 'rationalisation' is vital for the future viability of the company, that the 'managerial bullet' has to be bitten. There is a form to be followed, as if the ritual will take away the pain for you and absolve others of responsibility. We must behave reasonably, maintain our posturing as sensible grown-ups. Unless we experience it for ourselves, it seems, we have no understanding of the way in which redundancy rips people's lives apart, tearing up the fabric of their home, stripping them of their sense of self-worth, and destroying their experience of being valued people with a place, a role and a stake in the community.</p>

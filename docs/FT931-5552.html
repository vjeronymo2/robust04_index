			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Finding fault with computer networks As companies acquire more computer networks from different vendors the problem of managing them inevitably increases. When problems do occur the fault is often minor. The difficulty is in finding the fault before business  -and the company's reputation - is lost. Network General, of Menlo Park, California, has developed a diagnostic tool which uses artificial intelligence to learn the configuration of the network. The Expert Distributed Sniffer system sniffs out any problems and then uses its in-built knowledge to recommend a solution. Network General: US, 415 321 0855; Belgium: 2 725 6030.</p>

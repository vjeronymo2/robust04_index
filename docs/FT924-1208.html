			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Hata launches Japanese faction to press for reform MR Tsutomu Hata, the former Japanese finance minister, yesterday launched Japan's newest political faction, dedicated to a sweeping reform of the country's scandal-ridden political institutions. Mr Hata said the group's aim was to create a political system which would enable Japan to play a larger and more responsible role in world politics. The Hata group has attracted 33 members of the Japanese parliament who were formerly in the Takeshita faction, the largest of the groups within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. The launch of the Hata group yesterday marked the formal split of the Takeshita faction, which has dominated the LDP, in one form or another, since the mid-1970s. The role of the Hata group is still unclear, but it plans to champion political reform in the wake of the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin scandal, in which LDP leaders have been accused of enlisting corrupt businessmen to act as intermediaries with organised crime gangs and far-right political groups. Mr Hata said: 'In the past, scandals have been solved by the resignation of a single person. We want a complete transformation of the political system.' The group will campaign to replace the current system of large, multi-member electoral constituencies in which candidates from the same party compete with one another. The new faction will press for the introduction of single-seat constituencies in which candidates from different parties challenge one another. Mr Hata said this change would promote the national debate about Japan's political priorities which the current system inhibited. However, there is little agreement within the Hata group over its strategy. Mr Hata believes the faction should appeal for support among the opposition socialist parties, and some of the group's younger members believe it should form the nucleus of a new party to challenge the LDP. However many of the group's senior members believe it should change the LDP from within by providing a power base for Mr Hata to become the party's leader and prime minister. They believe Mr Hata's political reform programme will make him an ideal candidate to revive the LDP's fortunes.</p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Strong session for ICI CHEMICALS and pharmaceut-icals giant ICI saw its shares enjoy their biggest leap since July last year, confusing critics who argue that the proposed split-up of the group will entail a very big rights issue. ICI has said it intends to launch its drugs arm as a separate entity, Zeneca, some time this year. The impetus for yesterday's share jump of 46 to 1175p appeared to come principally from the US. As the company is now in its closed period ahead of the announcement of results on February 25, the rise could be ascribed to technical trading rather than fundamental news. One dealer said US investment bank Goldman Sachs had been telling clients it had finally offloaded the famous Hanson stake which it took on board last May. Goldman was unable to comment on the rumour. There was talk that NatWest Securities, in spite of its negative stance on the stock, had a big buyer in the US, where investors have been keen buyers of several blue chips. Chemicals shares had risen sharply in New York on Friday following recommendations from broker PaineWebber. Finally, ICI has a strong exposure to the D-Mark, which gained two pfennigs against sterling yesterday. Mirror Group falls The rise and rise of Mirror Group Newspapers was checked yesterday following a dip in bid rumours and stories in the Sunday press which prompted concern of a strike by the workforce. The shares fell nearly 6 per cent, against the market trend, to close 7 lower at 110p. The fall was also prompted by a statement from Lord Hollick, the managing director of investment group MAI, that he was not seeking to take over the newspaper group. Also, it was reported in the UK weekend press that the Mirror might move its headquarters and that such a move would be accompanied by heavy job losses, threatening a workforce confrontation and possibly a strike. However, one analyst believed that the Mirror had prepared itself for industrial action by establishing a ghost workforce which would swing into action at short notice. Eurotunnel improves Shares in Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel moved sharply ahead after the com-pany's broker reiterated its positive stance on the stock and a press report said the company was about to reach a settlement in its dispute with tunnel constructor TML. At the day's best the shares were up 15 at 468p, before coming off the top following an afternoon bout of profit-taking to close 12 ahead at 468p. The French press report indicated that a settlement of the tunnel's cost overrun dispute was 'within reach', but sources close to the company later denied there had been any such breakthrough in the talks. SG Warburg, Eurotunnel's broker, repeated its buy stance on the stock in an internal note on Friday which came to the market's attention yesterday. Turnover in the UK was healthy and the shares were heavily traded in Paris. There was further whispering around Kingfisher, which last week admitted it was in talks with Darty, the leading French electrical retailer. Fears over a Pounds 1bn-plus rights issue had weakened the shares, but sentiment improved yesterday, with some in the market suggesting that Kingfisher was more likely to take on more debt, so that only around Pounds 300m might be raised by way of rights. However, Kleinwort Benson yesterday issued a buy note on the stock, arguing that if the deal goes ahead Kingfisher will get Darty, which the broker believes undervalued, cheaply. It also says that if agreement is not reached the shares will look cheap on the back of the rights issue fears. The stock added 4 at 531p. Bid favourite Alexon had a roller coaster ride as a variety of stories were heard. Weekend press speculation that executive heads would roll were spiced further by market talk that the clothes group was still in play and that a bid may still be forthcoming. The shares dropped 8 at the opening, jumped 16 by noon and weakened at the close to finish 5 ahead at 82p. There was very little pressure on British Gas shares ahead of the Ofgas report today, the stock closing unaltered at 290p. There was, however, renewed buying of BP from the US, where there were suggestions that Salomon Brothers had turned to be a strong buyer of the stock. BP shares managed a minor gain at 267 1/2 p, ahead of the fourth-quarter numbers scheduled for Thursday. The sale by Enterprise Oil of its interests in the Hudson, Hutton and North West Hutton oil fields in the North Sea to C Itoh, of Japan, for Dollars 106m in cash came as no surprise to the market but was nevertheless greeted with a 4 rise in Enterprise shares to 465p. Not surprisingly, Clifford Foods attracted buyer attention and climbed 8 to 513p following Friday's disclosure that it had received an approach. Northern Foods, a possible predator, saw large turnover of 4.7m as the shares put on 4 to 266p. Another candidate, Unigate, rose 2 to 327p. Warburg was also said to be recommending the stock. Food retailers were dull, VAT worries continuing to cloud the sector. Goldman Sachs recommended a switch out of Tesco, off 6 1/2 at 243 1/2 p, and into Argyll Group, steady at 374p. Tesco was also depressed by a reported downgrade and overvalued stance from Hoare Govett. The spectre of heavy rights issues continued to dog the banking and insurance areas of the market. Both sectors have recently come under pressure, having previously substantially outperformed the market. Lloyds, which begins the banks' preliminary reporting season this Friday, lost 3 more to 534p on 2.8m traded. Many analysts, however, expect Lloyds to register the biggest dividend increase of all the high street banks - a rise of 10 per cent to around 18.5p is viewed as the minimum the City expects - and profits are seen rising to as much as Pounds 800m, compared with Pounds 645m last time. The cash-call stories continued to impact heavily on National Westminster, which slipped 6 to 442p after announcing another 4,000 job losses. Some banks managed to register modest improvements but rises were achieved more by the closing of large short positions than any great weight of buying. The technical argument was borne out by the exceptionally low levels of activity in the sector. Barclays, due to report on March 4, picked up 5 to 434p and HSBC put on 5 at 574p. Royal Bank of Scotland (RBoS) settled a penny harder at 236p following confirmation that the bank had disposed of a 90 per cent stake in its merchant bank, Charterhouse, for Pounds 235m. Worries about the price RBoS received were not translated into selling pressure in the market, dealers said. Lloyds Abbey Life, expected to report marginally lower preliminary figures tomorrow, edged up 6 to 450p. Goldman Sachs reiterated its switch recommendation out of Ladbroke Group, 3 ahead at 206p, and into Rank Organ- isation, 5 firmer at 718p. Queens Moat Houses remained friendless, dipping 3 to 49p in big turnover of 10m. Speculation that Trafalgar House would soon be making a rights issue intensified and the shares gave up 4 to 87p. A bullish statement from the chairman at Avon Rubber's agm sent shares in the tyre and rubber goods manufacturer climbing 15 to 553p. James Wilkes appreciated 9 to 53p on bid speculation. Selling continued in British Steel and the shares eased 1 1/2 to 77p on volume of 7.4m. MARKET REPORTERS: Christopher Price, Joel Kibazo, Peter John, Steve Thompson.

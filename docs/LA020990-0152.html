			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PUC DIVISION URGES REJECTION OF EDISON, SDG&amp;E MERGER;  </P> <P> UTILITIES: THE UNIT SAID THE DEAL WOULD NOT GUARANTEE LOWER RATES AFTER 1993,  WOULD INCREASE AIR-QUALITY WOES AND CAUSE ANTITRUST PROBLEMS.  </P> <P> The state Public Utilities Commission division that represents utility  customers urged commissioners Thursday to reject Southern California Edison's  proposed merger with San Diego Gas &amp; Electric because it would not produce  long-term benefits for customers.  </P> <P> In a report issued Thursday, the PUC's Division of Ratepayer Advocates charged  that, as structured, the merger would not guarantee lower rates for customers  after 1993. The report also said the merger would worsen Southern California's  air-quality problems and cause severe antitrust problems.  </P> <P> "Our analysis shows that the benefits are smaller and less certain to  materialize than the applicants have claimed," DRA Director Terry L. Murray  said in the report issued Thursday in San Francisco. "DRA urges the commission  to reject the merger unless the applicants amend their proposal to make it  beneficial to California ratepayers."  </P> <P> The PUC's five commissioners will use the report -- along with thousands of  documents generated by the utilities and dozens of other interested parties --  when they make a final decision on whether to approve the merger and create the  nation's largest utility, with 4.8 million customers.  </P> <P> In April, the PUC will gather public comments on the merger in public hearings  throughout Southern California. The PUC hopes to complete its review late this  year.  </P> <P> Merger opponents on Thursday described the DRA report as one more important  barrier that stands between the utilities and a completed merger.  </P> <P> "This report, coupled with (state Atty. Gen. John K.) Van de Kamp's decision to  oppose the merger, constitutes a one-two knockout punch," said Michael Shames,  executive director of Utility Consumers Action Network, a San Diego-based  consumer group that is opposing the merger that Edison proposed in 1988. "We'll  never see this merger occur."  </P> <P> The utilities were "basically encouraged by the tone of the DRA report," Edison  spokesman Louis Phelps said Thursday. "They're basically saying that they have  concerns, and we're saying that we think we can resolve those concerns." Phelps  maintained that the merger would produce $1.7 billion in savings that would be  passed along to customers in the form of lower rates.  </P> <P> "We're certainly willing to open the door and talk with DRA," Bill Reed,  SDG&amp;E's regulatory affairs manager, said Thursday. "I think, bottom line,  that they have confirmed that there's a substantial level of benefits for our  customers."  </P> <P> State Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), who last year suggested that the  state needed to toughen up regulations governing utility mergers, said Thursday  that he is "not convinced that the guarantees for rate reductions were there.  Without guarantees, they probably shouldn't be doing the merger."  </P> <P> The PUC staff based its report on an "independent forecast" that tracked the  utilities' claim that a merger would produce significant savings for utility  customers by reducing operating, labor and fuel costs. The DRA forecast  suggested that customers would be better off if the merger did not occur  because a combination could "result in slightly higher rates in the long-run."  </P> <P> The DRA report also noted that while Edison and SDG&amp;E had guaranteed rate  savings through 1993, "there is no mechanism to ensure that ratepayers will  receive one cent of the savings after 1993." Edison and SDG&amp;E have  maintained that the bulk of the merger's savings would accrue in the long term.  </P> <P> On the complex question of antitrust issues, the DRA noted that the merger  would bolster Edison's ability to buy bulk power from other utilities but  create long-term problems for a handful of small, municipally owned utilities  in Southern California that import electrical power through Edison's already  impressive transmission grid.  </P> <P> "Based on what we know so far about DRA's position on anti-competitive issues  and access to the transmission system of the merged utilities . . . we believe  these issues can be resolved," Edison's Phelps said.  </P> <P> Larry O'Donnell, a businessman who formed a San Diego-based group that supports  the proposed utility merger, described most of the DRA's conditions as  "bridgeable." O'Donnell also cautioned that the DRA report is not the PUC's  final word on the complex merger.  </P> <P> "The important thing to remember is that the DRA often stakes out a strong  position which the commissioners often toss out," O'Donnell said.  </P> <P> San Diego Deputy City Atty. William Shaffran, who has long represented the city  in utility matters, doubted that Thursday's seemingly negative report would  dissuade Edison and SDG&amp;E from seeking to complete the merger.  </P></p>

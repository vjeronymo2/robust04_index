			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Aluminium (3): Next year may see a shortfall as stocks decline - The new global deal has cut production. But can it last? The unprecedented international trade agreement signed in February to encourage aluminium producers to cut production has transformed the market this year. Prices have risen to levels where all producers are making profits, and the huge level of world stocks has started to fall as consumption outstrips production at last. The fact that western producers sought an international deal to help curb the flood of metal from Russia is a measure of their desperation at the interminable build-up of stocks. By the end of last year, reported stocks totalled almost 4.5m tonnes, with 2.49m tonnes at the London Metal Exchange and just over 2m tonnes at the International Primary Aluminium Institute. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) - signed by Australia, Canada, the European Union, Norway and the US, as well as by Russia - soon started to be reflected in rising prices on the London exchange. By July, prices were 50 per cent above the eight-year low of last November  - Dollars 1,037 a tonne. The memorandum called for production cuts of up to 2m tonnes, including 500,000 tonnes in the former Soviet Union. The question now is how long can it be expected to hold together. As Anthony Bird Associates, a UK consultancy, pointed out in its annual review of the industry, there are great difficulties in getting such agreements to work. In addition to the conflict of interest between high- and low-cost producers, and legal problems faced by American and Canadian producers, Bird points out that, when such agreements collapse, 'the results can be devastating' - and he cites the 1985 tin crisis. Bird bases his forecasts on the assumption 'that the MOU will be mostly successful for a limited period.' Bird, in April, suggested that production and consumption should be roughly in balance this year. Since then, however, indications are that stocks will fall. Billiton-Enthoven Metals' analysts are looking for a supply deficit of 400,000 tonnes, with Western world output at 14.15m tonnes, net imports at 1.6m tonnes, and consumption at 16.15m tonnes. Another recent assessment - the Spector Report of the US - put the estimated decline in world stocks at 700,000 tonnes this year, in stark contrast to the 1.5m tonne increase in 1993. However, the real impact is likely to come next year. Bird suggests that supplies should be around 1.4m tonnes below output, while Billiton is predicting a shortfall of 1.18m tonnes. The prospective fall in stocks is not merely a reflection of production curbs - consumption is growing strongly, and has been remarkably healthy throughout the recession. 'We have little reservation in stating that the underlying demand outlook for aluminium is good, and probably better than for any of the other major base metals, with the possible exception of nickel,' says Billiton in its annual Aluminium Market Report. The report points to the underlying growth rate in non-mature economies, particularly south-east Asia, which increased its share of western aluminium consumption from 10.4 per cent to 19.1 per cent between 1979 and 1992. By the end of the decade, the proportion could be almost 25 per cent. At the same time, aluminium continues to take market share from other metals and materials in the industrialised economies. This is particularly true of the automobile industry. In addition, the packaging sector is continuing to grow spectacularly, and has proved itself impervious to recession. Billiton concludes that 'aluminium, mainly in the form of can sheet, will not only continue to dominate the expanding US beverage can market, but will also make increasing inroads in the European and Japanese markets where there remains considerable scope for growth.' However, it warns that much of the growth in packaging and automobile sectors is linked with recycling. 'Thus to some extent the growth in primary consumption will be constrained by competition from its own remelted scrap.' Nevertheless, Billiton believes an underlying growth rate of between 2.5 and 3 per cent can be achieved to the end of the decade and beyond. Bird is even more optimistic, predicting growth of 3.4 per cent between 1990 and 2004. It points out that one of the main reasons for the sector's resilience in the recession was the 'strong competitive position, which we expect to see maintained in the years ahead. But in addition we think the aluminium intensity of any given level of industrial activity has risen.' Ironically, demand for the metal is likely to outstrip production once the stocks overhanging the market have been drawn down, which will probably take only three years. Bird points out that there has been an investment famine in the west, because of the short-term excess of supply. As the rate of capacity utilisation is already above 90 per cent, 'it would not take much of a supply correction to bring the industry back to the point where new capacity was needed very urgently.' The only big project due to come on stream before the end of 1996 is the Alusaf smelter in South Africa. However, Spector believes that, in order to meet demand in 1997 and 1998, the industry needs a further 1.5m and 2.6m tonnes respectively of new capacity, 'and that's just not on the cards at the moment.' Observers wonder if the Russians will be able to make up the shortfall. Bird argues that there will be further falls in exports from the former Soviet Union, not because of the MOU, but because of cost constraints. In the west, production costs have been falling to an average of Dollars 1,135 a tonne. Russian costs are alreadyhigher at Dollars 1,234 a tonne - a level at which they can now make money. However, hyperinflation in the former Soviet Union is clearly evident when comparing the costs in 1990, which were only 3 per cent of the western world average. Bird thinks the Russians will 'price themselves out of western markets as a result of this cost explosion.' Paradoxically, the MOU, and the consequent rise in market prices, has taken some of the short-term pressure off the Russians. At the end of August, Spector suggested that Russian exports had already peaked, and that they could be down by as much as 100,000 tonnes a month for the last five months of this year. Taking all the indications together, it looks as though the remainder of the decade will prove an exciting time for the industry, with strong growth and a need for expansion. As Spector puts it: 'The fundamentals look great and are getting better.'</p>

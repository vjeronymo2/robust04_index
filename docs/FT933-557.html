			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (9): How Mr Moores hit the jackpot / Industry THE MAN WHO MADE LITTLEWOODS: THE STORY OF JOHN MOORES by Barbara Clegg Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 17.99 239 pages THIS biography of John Moores, the Littlewoods Pools billionaire, is not an infallible guide to voracious wealth-making. But it offers pointer after pointer - three of which shout out from the earliest pages. First, scrutinise the field and calculate the odds. John Moores' second job after he was thrown out of the Post Office was as a trainee telegraphist with the Commercial Cable Company. He wrote later: 'Somebody worked it out that more millionaires have come from telegraphists than from any other trade. There may be something in it]' Although he soon abandoned his career as a telegraphist, Moores did plenty of research into the subject of wealth. He compiled an archive on 'success.' According to his youngest sister: 'He wanted to read the lives of important men who'd got to the top. He wanted to know what they did, what they said. Always he wanted to know how. He couldn't be bothered with trivialities.' Second pointer: the greatest business fortunes are not always built on original ideas. You can copy someone else's - but get in fast and do it slightly better. Although Littlewoods Pools eventually generated the biggest private fortune in the history of gambling, the idea of a football pool, in which punters strive to win huge jackpots by predicting the results of soccer matches, was not originally Moores'. He heard of someone else doing it, a man in Birmingham, but not very successfully. So Moores and two friends set up their own version with a start-up fund of Pounds 50 each (this was 1924). Third pointer: make sure there is a good woman behind you to stiffen your resolve. In its first year Littlewoods ran into predictable difficulties, and Moores offered to buy his partners out for what they had by then put in, Pounds 200 each. But first he asked his wife, Ruby. She urged him to carry on. 'If you don't,' she told him, 'you will never quite convince yourself that another few months might not have turned the tide. I'd sooner be the wife of a man who has gone broke than a man who is haunted by regret.' So belts were tightened. The gross receipts of Littlewoods Pools for the last week of its first season, May 2 1925, were Pounds 54 8s 6d (Pounds 925 today) from which Moores took a 10 per cent commission to cover expenses. Littlewoods became a gusher, generating enormous quantities of cash virtually from thin air. But Moores did not stick to gambling. He went on to establish a formidable private business that in addition to Littlewoods Pools included six mail-order companies and 120 chain stores. In 1992 group turnover (including the pools business) was Pounds 2.7bn. By coincidence, Fortune puts John Moores' personal wealth at Dollars 2.7bn. Like many of the super-wealthy, Moores - still alive, at 97 - is a bit enigmatic. His personality was once likened to that of Jesus Christ's. Someone else said: 'He made Genghis Khan look . . . civilised.' This duality is well-captured by Barbara Clegg, who describes Moores' ability to achieve two results at once, often by pitting managers - or sons - one against the other. 'He was a staunch Conservative,' she writes, 'but at the same time he was admired by a grandson for his 'socialist capitalism.' He was in many ways a self-centred man, but his life was geared to looking after and providing for other people.' Mentally, she says, he was innovative and far-sighted in business, more than capable of looking ahead to the century's end. Yet his values and emotions remained largely fixed in the era of his late Victorian boyhood. Perhaps the key to Moores' money-making genius was his fixity of purpose. Once, years ago, he asked an assistant buyer to do something. The man declared it to be impossible. 'Mr John just sat there,' this person said later. 'Then he said: 'There is nothing impossible in Littlewoods'.' In March 1971 John Moores spelt out to his executives his basic policy, which he said had never changed. First: give all customers real value for money, consistently. Second: give all employees the opportunity to contribute to the growth of the company, and to develop their own abilities to the full, with every prospect of promotion and financial recognition. Third (but only third, and then 'by the grace of God') to make a profit.</p>

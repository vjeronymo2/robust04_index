			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> As a fan of "Star Trek: The Next Generation," I discovered its March 24 program  titled "The Offspring," by Rene Echeverra, to be a poignant fantasy.  </P> <P> The story in which Cmdr. Data (Brent Spiner) fathered and educated a child of  his own creation with the hope that he could give something back to the  Federation was done with a high degree of insight and joy. I do hope they bring  back Data's daughter as this was an outstanding teleplay that should lead to  another episode.  </P> <P> David W. Vickson, Alhambra  </P></p>

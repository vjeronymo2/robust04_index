			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> IMPACT REPORT CLEARS HERMOSA OIL DRILLING PLAN  </P> <P> Hermosa Beach's long-delayed effort to get its share of the South Bay's  petroleum reserves has moved a step forward with the completion of an  environmental impact report. But the project faces more hurdles, and drilling  is unlikely to begin for another six months to a year.  </P> <P> The consultant's report, prepared by Irvine-based Ultrasystems Inc. for the  city, generally concludes that an "urbanized" oil recovery effort, which  utilizes various mitigation measures, will have little effect on the  surrounding environment.  </P> <P> A public hearing on the report will be held by the Planning Commission,  probably late next month, when another obstacle may surface.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Drilling Approved  </P> <P> Two 1984 initiatives approved drilling at the city's maintenance yard at 6th  Street and Valley Avenue and at the closed South School site, a block away on  Valley. But two other initiatives that passed by substantially larger margins  in 1984 and 1986 mandate preserving the school land as open space. Normally, in  cases of conflicting initiatives, the one with the most votes prevails.  </P> <P> The city plan is to confine the drilling to the city yard and use a portion of  the school property for storage and processing tanks. But if the open-space  mandate of the initiatives stands, the city does not have sufficient room at  the maintenance yard to carry out the plan evaluated in the environmental  impact report.  </P> <P> After about two years of paper work and wrangles with the State Lands  Commission, which must ultimately approve oil drilling in the tidelands, the  city contracted in 1986 with Marina del Rey-based Macpherson Oil Co. to carry  out the current drilling plan.  </P> <P> Donald Macpherson Sr., a 30-year veteran of oil-recovery operations in  California and Texas, said last week that he hopes to begin work at the Hermosa  Beach yard in six months to a year.  </P> <P> "It's been a long haul getting to this point," he said. "But we're confident  that the oil is down there and we're committed to do everything we're asked to  do to fit our operation into the environment down there."  </P> <P> Tidelands extend three miles out to sea from the onshore tide level. Land-based  operations reach any oil under the ocean floor by drilling down and then  slanting the bores at angles up to 90 degrees.  </P> <P> Cities like Hermosa Beach hold the offshore mineral rights in trust, but  generally the state gets a cut of any revenues generated from oil and gas  operations, and a city's share is often restricted to public improvements in  the tidelands.  </P> <P> According to the consultant's report, Macpherson will start with three  exploratory wells at the city yard, using temporary production facilities at  that site. If tests prove promising, up to another 27 wells will be drilled at  the yard and permanent production facilities will be built on the nearby school  property.  </P> <P> To make room for the drilling operation, the city's maintenance yard will be  moved to the school site. Trucks will haul the oil and waste products until  production exceeds 800 barrels a day, when oil and gas pipelines will be laid  along Valley Drive and up Herondo Street to connect with an existing Chevron  pipe at Prospect Avenue.  </P> <P> The environmental report reviews about 20 factors, ranging from noise and air  quality to visual aesthetics and issues of public policy. The 175-page  document, plus appendixes, outlines elaborate measures to minimize potential  problems and make the operation blend into the surroundings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unavoidable Impacts  </P> <P> It estimates that the exploratory and drilling phase will take up to three  years and acknowledges some "unavoidable adverse impacts" during that period,  such as an increase in noise levels, emissions from trucks and construction  equipment, and a 135-foot derrick visible throughout the neighborhood. It will  be sound-dampened and camouflaged with neutral coloring.  </P> <P> Over the long term, the report says, "some hydrocarbon odor may be detected  periodically" and the upper portions of camouflaged, 16-foot storage tanks on  the school property will be visible from some locations.  </P> <P> The report may be viewed by the public at City Hall.  </P> <P> A primary motivation for the Hermosa Beach project originally was a perception  that Redondo Beach has been sucking up all the oil from the northern edge of  the Wilmington-Torrance field that extends under the two cities.  </P> <P> Sheila Schoettger, Redondo Beach's harbor director, said her city may have  drained a bit of the reserves under Hermosa Beach in its early oil-recovery  efforts, which began in 1955.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Complaints Are Rare  </P> <P> "But it's not like pulling a cork out of a bottle and everything runs out," she  said. "We believe that any drainage there may have been stopped long ago."  </P> <P> The Redondo Beach experience offers some encouragement on the environmental  front to its neighboring city. Schoettger said the city rarely receives any  complaints about noise and odors near the well site at Harbor Drive and Beryl  Street.  </P> <P> "A lot of people who visit the harbor area or live there don't even know that  we have oil wells," she said.  </P> <P> However, if the output from those wells is any indication, Hermosa Beach may  not find much black gold. Schoetter said Redondo Beach, which started with 58  wells, now has only 15 or 20 "in some sort of active state. It's not going  well. We're definitely on the downside."  </P> <P> She said production has dropped to about 45,000 barrels a year, down from a  peak of 705,000 in 1958. Total revenue over that span came to $14 million, she  said, with the city collecting only about $175,000 last year.  </P> <P> "We're definitely not getting high-grade oil, so the payoff is low for that  reason, also," she said. "About 98% of what comes up is water."  </P> <P> Early estimates of the hoped-for bonanza in Hermosa Beach ran as high as $25  million over the 35-year life of the proposed project. City Manager Kevin  Northcraft, a relative newcomer who missed the early years of the project, was  reluctant to offer a current estimate. But he said the oil revenue could be  substantial.  </P></p>

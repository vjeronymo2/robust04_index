			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RETAILERS SAY WEATHER WARMED MARCH SALES  </P> <P> Shopping for spring apparel and other seasonal items plus a temporary spell of  warm weather boosted retail business in March, department store chains reported  Thursday. And, with a late Easter selling season still ahead, results are  likely to improve further in April.  </P> <P> Executives of several major general merchandise and department store chains  said they were satisfied with their results. In a few cases, March sales  surpassed the weak levels retailers had privately projected.  </P> <P> "On balance, they are slightly better than expected," said Wayne Hood, an  analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. "We can look forward to a  continuing good trend in April," he added.  </P> <P> The overall results were good considering that holiday promotions timed to  capitalize on the Easter season had not gotten into full swing. Easter falls  three weeks later this year than in 1989.  </P> <P> Last month's tallies were measured against a year earlier, when retailers  benefited from a traditional pickup in shopping ahead of Palm and Easter  Sundays, a time that brings customers into stores hunting for new outfits.  </P> <P> But it appears that this year shoppers ignored the calendar somewhat and  started freshening up their warm weather wardrobes early. Mild temperatures in  parts of the country might have put them in the mood.  </P> <P> "Generally we look at March and April together every year because the Easter  holiday switches and that affects sales," said Gregg Sloate, retail trade  analyst at Los Angeles-based Seidler Amdec Securities.  </P> <P> Sloate said that, with the help of the brisk apparel business Easter typically  spurs, he expected stronger sales in April.  </P> <P> Apparel sales outpaced other types of merchandise in March, continuing a  pattern that has prevailed for more than a year. Sales of hard goods, such as  expensive household appliances, were softer.  </P> <P> Mediocre economic growth has kept consumers cautious about spending heavily or  going deeper into debt to finance costly purchases. Car buying, for instance,  has been very sluggish.  </P> <P> Wal-Mart Stores Inc. stood out from the rest of the pack. The Bentonville,  Ark.-based discounter posted a 27% March sales spurt.  </P> <P> MAJOR RETAILERS' SALES IN MARCH  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.77IN:1.67IN:1.78IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> In millions  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> %  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> of dollars  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1990  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> change  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Sears  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2,980  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +1.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Wal-Mart Stores  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2,430  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> +27.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> J.C.

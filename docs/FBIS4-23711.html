			<p>BFN     [Text] The leadership of the National Patriotic Front of  Liberia [NPFL] says one of its ministers in the transitional  government is continuing to undermine the goals of the NPFL.  The NPFL says it has identified this minister, who continues to  (?propagate) lies and deception against the interests of the  organization.    The NPFL says this minister in question has been  collaborating with ECOMOG [Economic Community of West Africa  States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] to carry out a diabolical  plan to arrest NPFL officials in Monrovia, exposed the minister  involved [sentence as heard]. Although the minister was not  openly identified, last week press reports in Monrovia quoted  Internal Affairs Minister Samuel Dhokie opposing the calls by  the leadership of the NPFL for the formation of a transitional  army to defend the sovereignty of Liberia in the wake of threats  by Nigeria-dominated alien army.    Minister Dhokie said he is opposed to the idea of the  formation of a national army until disarmament and internment  are completed. Political observers are questioning the motive of  Minister Dhokie in opposing the idea of a national army [words  indistinct] for an organization he represents. The observers  say Minister Dhokie must be clear on who he represents in the  LNTG [Liberia National Transitional Government], as his  pronouncements can only make anyone to believe that he is  representing himself.    Meanwhile, the leadership of the NPFL has expressed alarm  and  concern over the sweeping wave of arrests of Liberians in  Monrovia by ECOMOG. The citizens are being subjected to forced  labor by ECOMOG in Monrovia.</p>

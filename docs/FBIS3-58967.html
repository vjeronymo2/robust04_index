			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jan Syse, Nordic Council president: "Brussels, </F> the Baltic, and Nordic Cooperation"]    [Text] The activities of the Nordic Council this past year  have shown anything but the attitude of "Stop the world, I want  to get off." In both word and deed, the organization has  demonstrated that it does not merely want to remain on the  political scene, but also that it has a role to play.    To be sure, this year there have also been such turbulent  political developments on the North European continent that it  is difficult to keep up as both observer and actor. The  elections in the Baltics and Poland, the attempted coup and  elections in Russia, the complicated process involved in  concluding the Maastricht treaty, and the repeated postponement  of the EEA [European Economic Area] agreement have dominated the  political agenda and demanded great attention from the  politicians and the press.    The most important task of the Nordic Council for now is to  serve as an arena for the strong forces that are seeking a  uniform Nordic position toward the EC. A solid majority in the  council, with the exception of the Norwegian opposition group,  wants full membership for Finland, Sweden, and Norway. It is  just as clear that the overwhelming majority would not like to  see each country go its own way. As a result, simultaneous  referendums in all three countries would be an absurdity or even  a catastrophe and could increase the risk of a permanent rift  among the Nordic countries, unless the combined results would be  decisive for all three countries. That might be considered  genuine Nordic solidarity, but it is not particularly realistic.    What, then, has the Nordic Council accomplished this year?    Because the prime ministers decided a year ago to take  greater responsibility for promoting cooperation--a decision  long called for by parliamentarians--we now have clearer  priorities for the areas of cooperation that are to be on the  agenda. The governments decided to concentrate on cultural  issues, environmental cooperation, and trade policy. This is  reflected in the Nordic Council's 1994 budget, which was adopted  at the session in Mariehamn last fall.    The prioritizing of cultural cooperation in the budget is  both correct and important, but it must not allow us to overlook  the other important aspects of Nordic cooperation today.    Foreign policy issues have given the council new vitality,  even though these issues have no impact on the budget.  Environmental issues in and around the Nordic countries are of  vital significance, as demonstrated by the Nordic Council's  major international conference on the Arctic, held in Reykjavik  last fall. The council has also taken the initiative with  respect to the Sosnoviy Bor power plant in St. Petersburg. New  initiatives will also be taken in these areas.    At the Mariehamn session, the council held a broad debate  over what we in the Nordic countries can do together to  stimulate new growth, thereby creating new jobs and more faith  in the future among individuals. The finance ministers will  propose concrete measures well before the next session (this  March in Stockholm). Then, in April, the council will bring  together representatives of the governments, parliamentarians,  researchers, and labor market representatives to continue this  work. A successful campaign against unemployment is a  prerequisite for maintaining confidence in our democratic and  social systems and for stopping the racism that is beginning to  develop in our countries.    The Nordic Council became a pillar of support for the  liberation of the Baltic nations at a very early stage. We have  received grateful recognition of this from Baltic politicians.  Now the three Baltic nations are developing a system of  cooperation similar to that of the Nordic Council. The center of  this cooperation is an advisory parliamentary assembly, the  Baltic Assembly, but it has now been decided that the  governments will be drawn into this organization, which will be  given the name Baltic Council.    The parallels to our own organization are striking.    From the very beginning, we have had a cooperative agreement  with the Baltic Assembly. I have personally participated in all  three sessions held so far by the Baltic Assembly. There is  reason to be impressed and happy over the way in which it is  approaching its work. It is a victory for democracy.    But there are still Russian troops in Estonia and Latvia,  and  the Nordic Council is strongly pressuring Russia to withdraw  them quickly. The outcome of the elections in Russia merely  emphasizes how important this is.    Our involvement in northwestern Russia also increased during  the past year. The environmental threat gives us particular  cause to direct our attention at these areas, but we must also  utilize the opportunity to stimulate a better and more  coordinated development of trade.    Of course, the main thrust of our non-Nordic activities is  aimed at the EC and the EEA. The council is in contact with the  European Parliament at many levels, forming a valuable  compliment to the direct, bilateral contacts between countries.    It is interesting, by the way, that in our contacts with  politicians from other European organizations we have found that  they are placing more and more emphasis on the significance the  Nordic Council can and should have as an actor in Northern  Europe and the Baltic region. These are relatively new signals  that are a clear result of the regionalization and  decentralization that we are seeing in the EC, for example. I  believe that this application of the principle of geographic and  functional proximity in European cooperation will become more  prevalent in the months and years to come. In this case, it will  become increasingly important to have an established forum for  the exchange of political opinions on European issues that are  related to the Nordic countries. We of the Nordic Council  Presidium have taken up this challenge this year.    Clearly, this "foreign policy" activity by the council  cannot  occur in a political vacuum. Obviously, it is guided by the main  principles set forth by the Nordic governments and national  assemblies, but it is also dependent on the changed  international climate in Europe.    In this connection, I would like to mention the situation  that has arisen in Russia following the parliamentary elections.  Although Boris Yeltsin still has executive power and expanded  authority through the new Constitution, the political landscape  of our powerful neighbor has changed. This affects us, as well.  As German Count Lambsdorff so aptly put it, Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy of the so-called Liberal Democratic Party is  neither liberal nor democratic. He has ambitions and views that  must give rise to reflection and caution in the West. The Iron  Curtain is gone, but the uncertainty remains. We in the north  must realize that close cooperation not only with one another,  but with the rest of West Europe, is the key to future security  in a changing Europe. While the situation in East Europe is as  unstable as it unfortunately is, we must at least make sure we  stabilize the factors we can control. EC membership is one such  factor we can make use of if we want and dare to do so. If we  miss this opportunity, then isolation and insecurity here in the  north could increase considerably, particularly if Norway is the  only Nordic country (apart from Iceland) left outside the EC.    Nordic cooperation, particularly in the economic field,  cannot be genuine cooperation because we are so similar. Quite  simply, the Nordic nations do not compliment one another. This  is also why there was no Nordec [as published].    Together, in the EC, we could be a significant factor that  could complement and enrich the rest of Europe. This applies to  the security, economic, and cultural spheres. My vision, which I  share with many in the Nordic Council, is a strong Nordic region  within Europe. As I have said so often before, albeit in another  context, we must hang together, or we will hang separately.    In conclusion, let me add that the Maastricht treaty states  that regional councils shall exist within the framework of EC  cooperation. Here in the Nordic region, we already have such a  council: the Nordic Council. Consequently, the Nordic Council  will not cease to exist if we join the EC. On the contrary, it  will be a forum that can prosper in cooperation with other,  similar councils within what has been called the "Europe of  regions."    Based on the examples mentioned here and as a general  evaluation of the Nordic Council's work, I can state with  satisfaction that Nordic cooperation is in a period of  revitalization.</p>

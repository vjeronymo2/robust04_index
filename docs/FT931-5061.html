			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / International Company News: Called to account for past practices - Andrew Buxton of Barclays Bank faces a most testing time THE NEXT two weeks will probably be the most testing of Mr Andrew Buxton's career. After becoming chairman and chief executive of Barclays Bank in January, just in time to announce the first pre-tax loss in the bank's 96 year history, he faces a wave of doubt over whether he should stay in either job. His future will depend on meetings with shareholders around the country which start this week. Mr Buxton yesterday indicated the outline of the arguments he intends to put. That he accepts some blame for the past when he was managing director under Sir John Quinton in the late 1980s. That under his leadership the bank has improved its operating performance, and will continue to do so. And that he will hand over a significant part his responsibilities to a new senior executive this year. None of this is likely to come as a surprise to the bank's large shareholders. But they will be watching Mr Buxton's performance closely to see if he can alter their perception that he has not presented his own and the bank's case well so far. Some institutions believe his performance at last week's post-results press and analysts' conferences should have been more confident. The degree of dissatisfaction among shareholders is open to debate. Fund managers holding 15 per cent of the bank's shares contacted by the Financial Times on Friday expressed varying degrees of discontent, the strongest being the view that Mr Buxton should resign. But Barclays believes it has received support from the most senior executives of the institutions concerned. Yet the bank tacitly accepts the view that it cannot judge entirely on the basis of telephone calls made by Mr Buxton on Friday. The ultimate test will come in the post results 'roadshow' in which Mr Buxton makes plain he will play a full part. 'I have got to try to reassure them, and make sure they appreciate that the current management is getting decisions right,' he said yesterday. Mr Buxton's problem in doing so is his link with the past. This is partly as a member of one of the Quaker families in charge of the regional banks which came together to make up Barclays. But it is substantially to do with a more recent period of history: the time in May 1988 when he became managing director, just after a rights issue of Pounds 921m to expand lending had been announced. Mr Buxton made an incautious remark at the press conference on Thursday indicating that he had little direct responsibility for this lending growth. Yesterday, he was carefully emphasising that he bore some responsibility, and should have performed better. 'With hindsight, when I became managing director, I wish I had jumped on the problem of expansion earlier,' he said. His defence is that despite having made mistakes, he essentially arrived too late to stop lending mushrooming. He argues that much of the problem lending in the following two years came from large companies taking up more of what were already-agreed facilities. 'When you come in the middle of a fast expansion programme that is already taking place, it is difficult to control,' he says. This issue alone would provide enough material for debate. But Mr Buxton faces questions on a second point: when and how he will take steps to split his two roles. He remained cautious about details yesterday, but promised it would happen this year. 'I do not think later would be acceptable to shareholders, and I do not want an uncertainty of this sort any longer than necessary,' he said. There are two uncertainties involved. The first is whether the bank will actually appoint a chief executive in both name and deed, or have a chief opera-ting officer similar to Mr Buxton's old post of managing director. Any wavering is likely to stimulate discontent among shareholders, one reason for Mr Buxton's promise yesterday of handing over 'a significant part' of his job. The second uncertainty is whether the new senior executive will come from inside or outside the bank. As long as Mr Buxton remains chairman, investors are likely to place significance on the new senior executive coming from outside the bank. Yet this could present internal problems by risking curtailing the responsibilities of executives such as Sir Peter Middleton, the deputy chairman. Mr Buxton emphasised yesterday that this potential problem was one reason why he was taking some time to decide how the new management structure - first introduced in 1991 - should be reformed. 'It is a definite consideration. I must take the management team with me and ensure that I hold them together, and convince them that any new structure is going to work,' he said firmly. Barclays' chairman emphasised yesterday that he did not believe investors' concern was so great that they 'want to fire the whole of the management team'. But he would not be drawn on the question of what he would do if the shareholder meetings over the next two weeks convinced him otherwise. 'As the saying goes, I would prefer not to start from there,' said Mr Buxton.</p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / World Bond Markets: New York US markets are closed today for the Labor Day holiday, but when investors return to work tomorrow they are likely to still be digesting the implications of last Friday's August employment news. Although headline numbers were reassuring, the 30-year Treasury bond yield rose to almost 7.5 per cent as investors were worried that the rise in the manufacturing working week last month indicated a strengthening in the industrial sector of the economy. Friday's movement, however, seems overreaction to the data, and some rebound in the market is likely tomorrow morning, particularly as there will be no significant new statistics for several days. The calendar is relatively quiet until Friday, with data on July wholesale trade and consumer credit, second-quarter productivity and weekly money supply growth unlikely to have any impact on prices. Trading will be dominated by manoeuvring ahead of Friday's publication of the August producer prices index. Broking house Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette forecasts a 0.4 per cent increase in the August PPI, following July's 0.5 per cent rise, and a 0.2 per cent increase in the 'core' PPI, which excludes food and energy. If the forecasts prove correct, the annual rate of producer price inflation will be steady at 2.2 per cent.</p>

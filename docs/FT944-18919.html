			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / GM reaches deal with union General Motors and the United Auto Workers union said they had reached tentative agreement over a dispute which threatened to halt much of the company's North American production. The dispute, over GM's reluctance to hire more permanent workers as its output has risen in recent months, had led to a walk-out at a parts plant in Flint, Michigan, on Tuesday. This in turn forced a halt at a number of the company's production lines, affecting 22,300 workers in all. UAW members will vote on it today. GM has been trying to hold down its workforce to become more competitive with its main US rivals and to prepare it for any future downturn in the vehicle market.</p>

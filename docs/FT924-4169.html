			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Protection planned for banana suppliers THE UK and France are planning 'intermediate measures' to protect traditional banana suppliers, in case disagreement over reform of the European Community's banana import regime prevents settlement by the start of 1993, Mr John Gummer, Britain's farm minister, said yesterday. Addressing a House of Commons Agriculture Committee, Mr Gummer defended a recent British move to break deadlock over the shape of reform by suggesting tariff-based options. At present, traditional suppliers are protected by quota arrangements: 'We are not tied to a method: we are tied to an end,' he said. He emphasised that the UK was pressing hard for an 'imminent' breakthrough, but at the same time expressed concern at the lack of progress towards settlement of differences between countries like Germany, Belgium and Denmark, which import cheaper 'dollar' bananas from Latin America, and the UK, France, Spain and Portugal, which reserve their markets for more expensive suppliers (mainly in the Caribbean) as part of aid obligations under the Lome convention. Controversy has arisen because when the single market is set up on January 1 next year, cheap dollar bananas will be able to flow freely across the EC, putting the plight of traditional suppliers in jeopardy. Mr Gummer warned that whether the new regime were tariff-based or quota-based, 'countries (like Germany or Belgium) that never previously had to bear any burden now realise this is a community burden' which will inevitably have an impact on banana prices. 'Everybody has an interest in getting a solution by January 1. If we don't then there will be five EC countries insisting on interim arrangements. . . Do we want the community, on the very first day of the single market, to be rent asunder by political obligations?' he warned. Meanwhile yesterday the European Commission approved a French request effectively halting further imports this year of bananas from Ivory Coast and Cameroon, which exceeded their quotas by 16.4 per cent and 10 per cent respectively in November, according to a French official.</p>

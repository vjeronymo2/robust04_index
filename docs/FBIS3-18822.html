Illicit profits and gains cannot be considered earnings and  are subject to confiscation, but not taxation, decided the court  in a ruling on a case filed by the Naples prosecutors office in  November that involved a street seller of pirated tape  recordings.    The question had divided judicial opinion "in the absence of  any precise position by the legislature," the ruling stated,  with penal experts expressing the view the fruits of crime  cannot be taxed, while the civil section held it was appropriate  to levy taxes on all unreported income.    Today's ruling thus provides a precedent jurists had been  seeking, both for those courts dealing with underworld economic  activities as well as for judges dealing with the extensive  flows of bribes and kickbacks that has been unveiled in  anti-corruption investigations in the past two years.    The high court ruled that illegal activities "go against the  public interest protected by the constitution" and that they  would be legitimated if recognized as a normal tax source.    Further, the Cassation Court argued, those who commit crimes  such as theft, larceny, fraud, corruption, mafia association,  drug traffic and the laundering of illicit funds are already  subject to financial and penal sanctions that include: liability  to restore sums stolen and for payment of damages, and  court-ordered confiscation of property.    These existing measures, which aim to subtract all illegal  gains and profits from their holders, would thus be at odds with  a measure like taxation, which would recover only a part of  those illegal funds, the court decided.</p>

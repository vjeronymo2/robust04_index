			<p>BFN     [Text] Dr. Sayf Sayil Khalid, Politburo member and member  of the Central Committee of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP],  met today with the citizens of the town of Dar Sa'd following  the haphazard artillery shelling launched from the Sanaa regime,  which targeted the populated living quarters in the town of Dar  Sa'd. Some families and innocent children were victims of this  shelling. Dr. Sayf Sayil praised the high morale of the citizens  and their persistence and readiness to resist in the face of the  conspirators on the security, stability, and welfare of the  people.    In this connection he called for the necessity of organizing  the popular resistance to protect our beautiful city against the  conspiracies of the enemies. He said: We will not allow Aden  to be occupied, no matter what. He emphasized that the citizens  of the capital, Aden, are considered to come from all the  villages and regions of Yemen and that going to the resistance  fronts reflects the real pattern of unity of the sons of the  Yemeni people.    In the context of his talk with the citizens of the sons of  Dar Sa'd, Dr. Sayf Sayil indicated that the inhabitants, men and  women, all of them joined the Armed Forces to defend Aden. He  said that this mad war had targeted the Yemeni people, whether  on a human, economic or military scale. The instigators and  causers of this war will be cursed by history, he said, adding  that the will of the people is stronger than the will of the  crazy adventurous rulers. Victory will be only with the people,  he said.</p>

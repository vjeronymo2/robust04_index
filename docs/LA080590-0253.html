			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CRITICS' PICKS: CLOSELY WATCHED TRAINS/THE SHOP ON MAIN STREET  </P> <P> These two Czechoslovakian films, Oscar winners for best foreign film in 1966  and 1965, respectively, exemplified what, at the time, was Eastern Europe's  most vital film industry.  </P> <P> Both are humanist, pacifist works set during World War II. Jiri Menzel's  quirkier, more unclassifiable "Trains" is a wistful tragicomedy on the tangled  love life of an assistant train dispatcher. Janos Kadar's "Shop" boasts a  superb performance by Ida Kaminska (above, with Josef Kroner) as the old woman  forced to cede her button shop to a clumsy non-Jewish outsider. (KCET Saturday  at 9 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.) Michael Wilmington  </P></p>

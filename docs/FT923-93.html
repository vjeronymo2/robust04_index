			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Surrey Group back in the red SURREY GROUP, the USM-quoted bookmaker, returned to losses in the second half of the year to March 31. And with further substantial losses expected in the present six months it is changing its acquisition strategy in order to cut debts. At its flotation in 1989 it intended to reach critical mass for economies of scale by buying betting offices. However, the chairman said that the level of borrowing had become excessive compared with its ability to service it in the light of poor trading. In the year to the end of March pre-tax profits were Pounds 5,000 against losses of Pounds 216,000 in the previous year. Interim profits had been Pounds 117,000. From turnover of Pounds 49.6m (Pounds 35.8m) operating profits were Pounds 766,000 including Pounds 611,000 from the sale of betting offices and other operating income. An extraordinary charge of Pounds 398,000, relating to the company's former cricket centres which went into liquidation before the full consideration had been paid by the new owners, left the retained loss at Pounds 295,000 (Pounds 404,000). Earnings per share came out at 0.07p, helped by a tax credit of Pounds 98,000 (Pounds 65,000), against losses of 0.15p. The final dividend is being passed. Last time there was a single final payment of 0.05p.</p>

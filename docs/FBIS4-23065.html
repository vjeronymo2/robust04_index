Shevchenko and N. Espinosa-Ortis; UDC </F> 621.372.8]    [Abstract] a third variant of the method of  shift formulas for design of asymmetric planar optical  waveguides is proposed, two variants of this method having  already been described (V.V. Shevchenko; RADIOTEKHNIKA I  ELEKTRONIKA, Vol. 31 No. 5, May 86). Unlike the _a_-method of  transverse waves and the k-method of wave numbers, this  k_a_-method yields a complete expansion of a mode field into  modes of a reference waveguide. This method is demonstrated on  the TE-mode in a waveguide with a nonhomogeneous guiding layer  between two different homogeneous outer layers. As the  equivalent reference waveguide for comparative evaluation is  used one with a homogeneous guiding layer, as is being done in  the other two methods. The field function is obtained from the  appropriate wave equations by the usual procedure. The resulting  equation for the amplitude of the transverse electric field  component is then used for both approximate analytical and exact  numerical calculation of the key waveguide parameters such as  the critical frequencies and the propagation constants, also the  spectral parameter. For illustration is considered a waveguide  for surface waves with a guiding layer which has a truncated  exponential profile of dielectric permittivity. All those key  parameters of its modes have been calculated for various values  of the exponent q, to confirm the expediency of this method.  Approximate (analytical) calculations may as well be made by the  _a_-method, inasmuch as the k_a_ method does not refine the  results within the entire 0  q &gt;   range of the  exponent.  Exact (numerical) calculations for surface waveguides as well as  for embedded ones should, however, made by the k_a_ method.  Figures 4; references 4. @t</p>

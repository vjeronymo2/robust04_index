			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey </F> Kozyrev by program announcer Yevgeniy Kiselev; date not given;  from the "Itogi" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Kiselev] It goes without saying that the changes  which have taken place over the past six months in the  disposition of forces on the Russian political stage could not  have failed to place new emphases in Russian foreign policy,  too. In this connection, many people draw attention to the fact  that Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Andrey Kozyrev is no  longer the person we knew before.    In recent years, your position has evolved significantly.  For example, in 1991, you said that everything concerning human  rights in Estonia was alright, and you have since changed your  view quite sharply. At the beginning of 1992 you were in favor  of civilized relations with post-Soviet states, rejecting the  need for military pressure, even, one recalls, in the middle of  1992 you spoke very sharply against the War Party.    But once again there are new nuances, such as -- if one  believes press reports of course -- you once stated that it was  possible to hold talks with the Tajik opposition only with the  help of missile salvo's.    One way or another, an element of toughness has become quite  noticeable in your actions. Tell, me, am I right or wrong to  state that the position of the foreign affairs minister is  evolving? Or is it not evolving at all?    [Kozyrev] Well, I would put it like this -- yes and no. But,  firstly, some of those quotes you cited are not exactly  accurate, or have been cited not quite accurately in those media  outlets, or you, now, for the purpose of abbreviation...[pauses]  For example, that I had allegedly said in 1991 that, say, human  rights were not being violated in Estonia, Latvia, and  Lithuania. I do not recall that, and it cannot be, because if  you take my speech at the Supreme Soviet as it was, where I  asserted in Autumn 1990, and not 1991, my first speech, then  mention is already made there of the need to protect the rights  of the Russian-speaking population, first and foremost in the  Baltic states.    In other words, we have always said that. It is a mistaken  notion that the patriotic and nationalist opposition has foisted  this issue on us. But once again, I do not agree. Today, I am  most resolutely opposed to the War Party which speaks of  dispatching troops for the purposes of suppression and that  thinks that these problems, such as the violation of human  rights, can be solved by inflicting bomb strikes as Rutskoy  said, or as Zhirinovskiy says by the Russian soldier's boot or  something in that vein. This is irresponsibility, and I am  categorically against the War Party today, too.    It is a different matter that all these issues demand  resolution. Why now? Yes, because of course we would have been  bad democrats, and I would show disrespect to myself if I never  heeded the voice of the voters, the voice of the people that was  heard at the last elections, for example.    [Kiselev] You once stated, this was at the very start of the  reforms, of the Gaydar reforms, that you were a member of the  team of the reformers and that you would leave it only when they  left. Now, at the start of 1994, we see that those people who  have traditionally been associated with the concept of reformers  in our country have left the government. But you have remained.  With what is this decision linked?    [Kozyrev] Well to put it quite briefly and clearly, since  you  use the term team, then, the trainer and the captain of the team  is the same. Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin.    [Kiselev] In Russia, a strong foreign affairs minister is a  person who defends, who strictly defends the interests of his  department in its relationship with other departments. In this  regard, I have this question: To what extent does your  department, the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry, control the  process of elaborating the Russian position concerning such a  topical matter as the matter of unifying the monetary systems of  Russia and Belarus, and does the Foreign Affairs Ministry have  an official position on this problem?    [Kozyrev] Without a doubt, we take part in discussing these  matters, although it is true, of course, that our sphere is such  a priority as it were -- these are political decisions. In  political terms there are no doubts that, in this case, it is in  the interests of Russia and Russia's course, to get as close as  possible to Belarus. That is a political strategy.    But I have to tell you that the question here is of course  very concrete, it consists in the unification of monetary  systems, the unification. If it is not a payments union of some  kind, and so on, or a payments agreement, but unification, then  this demands the combination, the compatibility of both the  legislative process and so on, and of all economic activity,  which is a pretty complex problem of course.    I have to say that in the notorious agreement signed by  Chernomyrdin and his Belarus colleague this is actually stated.    [Kiselev] At one time, through the forces of the opposition  press, of course, the image of the pro-American politician, the  Russian diplomat of a pro-American bent was established. Do you  feel that this image has stuck with you and hindered you in your  work?    [Kozyrev] Well, I will tell you that if the opposition, the  extreme nationalist opposition -- what I call the anti-patriotic  opposition -- accuses me of being pro-American, then that means  that we are conducting the correct policy with regard to the  United States.    The opposition wants a relationship with the United States  and with NATO based on the foe principle. They need the foe  image, otherwise their whole impracticable and anti-national  design falls apart, you see.    It is a different matter that we have a pretty  complex...[pauses] New rules, principles, and mechanisms of  partnership are being worked out now with the United States. We  are quite open and sometimes even public about this. But for  the greater part, by means of our specific diplomatic methods,  we are of course holding discussions with them.    [Kiselev] And when they rebuke you for neo-imperialism, what  conclusion do you draw for yourself?    [Kozyrev] Roughly this, irrespective who issues the rebuke,  if I am rebuked by those whom the independent role of Russia as  a global power clearly does not suit -- and there are such in  the West -- then let us not close our eyes, because there are  forces who really do not want Russia to be a global power. I  think that this is a good indicator and it means that once again  we are doing everything right.    [Kiselev] And when you are rebuked by our -- shall we say  radical liberals?    [Kozyrev] Well, our radical liberals are at times also  inclined to such excessive radicalism. But what is there to  worry about? These are all internal arguments you see, we have  arguments, there is nothing to worry about.    If our extreme nationalists accuse us of listing toward the  Americans, then once again it means we are doing the right thing  because if they liked our American policy, then today we would  not be discussing the problems we are talking about now, but  would be saying: Okay, there is nothing to eat in the country,  but the main thing is that there is no nuclear war.</p>

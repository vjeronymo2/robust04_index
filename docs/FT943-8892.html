			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Working Life: Dentist in the house - Health Going to the dentist is probably on most people's list of least favourite things to do. The thought of giving up as much as a day's work to commute to a dental surgery, on top of hated drillings and fluoride treatments, means many employees may never make it to get their teeth cleaned by a dentist. The cumulative cost of their eventual visits to the dentist can be very large. To encourage employees to keep up their dental health, about 30 large companies in the UK, including Glaxo, Marks and Spencer, ICI and National Power - as well as the Bank of England - now provide dental services for their staff. These services range from contracts with National Health Service dentists to comprehensive in-house programmes with independent dental surgeons. According to Leslie Kaye, dental surgeon for Glaxo Research and Development and Glaxo Holdings, the company's in-house dental service saves up to 2,000 days of work because employees do not need to take time off to travel to see a dentist. At Glaxo R &amp; D's site in Greenford, Middlesex, Kaye, a hygienist and two dental surgery assistants regularly see 1,600 patients from the company's staff. They also provide services to 800 more employees from Glaxo's site in Ware. About 60 per cent of Glaxo R &amp; D and Glaxo Holdings' staff use the on-site dental surgery. Kaye is a NHS dentist, although Glaxo is considering moving the dental practice into the private sector. About 75 per cent of dentists working in industry are still in the NHS, though Jo Freeman, senior dental surgeon at Glaxo Pharmaceuticals in Stockley Park and president elect of the Association of Industrial Dental Surgeons, says more companies are moving in the direction of independent dental services. At Glaxo R &amp; D and Holdings, the government pays for 20 per cent of any dental service while each patient pays for 80 per cent. However, because the company pays for its dental staff's salary, Kaye says he can spend more time with each patient as he is not working for a fee. While the average non-industry NHS dentist books about 40 appointments a day, Kaye only puts about ten to 15 patients into the dental chair each day. Glaxo subsidises the more expensive services, such as crowns and bridgework. which an increasing number of NHS dentists do not provide. The dental surgery also checks employees for oral cancer as part of the company's general health screening programme. Kaye says that setting up an in-house service requires a relatively small capital investment for ultimately high savings for the company. He estimated that most of the necessary equipment for a dental surgery could be purchased for about Pounds 25,000. It is not just the large companies which can benefit from dental services. He says dental programmes become cost effective once a company has 700 employees or more. Smaller companies in office blocks can combine to hire one dentist. A company interested in the upkeep of its staff's teeth should hire a dentist who is willing to set up the service, rather than trying to establish the service before bringing in a dentist to run it. 'Any time an opening comes up in industry, there is a very high demand for the job,' says Kaye. 'Many dentists want to leave general practice. They want to get out of the rat race.'</p>

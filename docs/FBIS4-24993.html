These are the  guidelines stressed by Chen Huanyou, secretary of the provincial  party committee and governor, at the provincial conference on  enterprise work.    The three-day conference closed in Zhenjiang yesterday.  Early in the conference, Chen Biting, chairman of the  provincial planning and economic commission, outlined  arrangements on major tasks facing enterprises in the province  today. Comrade Chen Hongchang, vice chairman of the provincial  commission for restructuring the economy, explained why it was  necessary to select 100 enterprises to experiment with modern  enterprise systems. Comrade Zhu Tao, deputy secretary general  of the State Economics and Trade Commission, made a special trip  here for the conference. He also gave an important speech. Six  enterprises briefed the conference on their experience.  Participants spoke freely in the discussion. They put forward  many good views and suggestions on ways to carry out experiments  with modern enterprise systems, strengthen enterprise  management, and halt losses and increase profits. Vice Governor  Ji Yunshi and Secretary General Liu Jian attended the  conference. Chen Huanyou gave an important speech at the  closing session.    Chen Huanyou said: Since the beginning of this year, our  province has earnestly implemented the guidelines of the 14th  National Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee, followed the central guidelines of  "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider,  promoting development, and maintaining stability;" persisted in  emancipating the mind; sought truth from facts; and worked  actively and in a down-to-earth manner. As a result, reform and  opening up have gradually deepened, the provincial economy has  developed quickly, social and political stability has been  maintained, and the situation in general has been good.  Agriculture has also developed soundly, with summer ripening  crops expecting a good harvest. The percentage of products sold  has risen each month, and the adjustment of product mix has  accelerated. Key project construction has been strengthened.  Construction of a number of key projects selected by the state  and the province has been stepped up according to plans.  Necessary conditions have been acquired for the construction of  the new Nanjing airport, the Jiangyin highway bridge spanning  the Chang Jiang, and several other key projects. The financial  situation has been fairly stable. Deposits and loans of  different types with the province's banking institutions have  increased. Reserves in specialized banks have risen. Since the  implementation of the new foreign exchange system, foreign  exchange rates have remained basically stable. The province has  also actively carried out reform in finance, taxes, banking,  investment, foreign trade, and other areas. Developments in the  last four months and more have been generally sound. Enterprise  reform, which centers on the establishment of modern enterprise  systems, has gradually deepened, and the steps taken to change  operating mechanism have further quickened. New steps have been  taken in opening the province to the outside world. Foreign  trade, foreign investment, and foreign economic work have all  developed with a strong momentum. Good progress has been  achieved in the construction of the Suzhou Industrial Park as  the first-stage construction has officially begun. Now we must  seize the opportunity, pluck up our spirits, work hard, and keep  forging ahead to overcome difficulties and problems in our  current economic life and ensure sustained, rapid, and healthy  development of the economy.    Chen Huanyou stressed: Jiangsu's economic development now  faces a new situation. We must further deepen reform to promote  economic development and invigorate enterprises on the basis of  a new system through accelerating the transformation of  enterprises' operating mechanisms and governments' functions.  First of all, we must revolve attention around the  transformation of enterprises' operating mechanisms, practically  succeed in establishing a modern enterprise system at selective  enterprises on a trial basis, strive to construct the framework  of a standardized modern enterprise system in two to three  years, accumulate experiences, and gradually make progress. We  must promote a modern enterprise system at different enterprises  in different ways. While paying attention to successfully  establishing a modern enterprise system at selective enterprises  on a trial basis, we must promote reform of all enterprises. In  particular, we must successfully carry out various measures  adopted earlier for reform of enterprises as well as the  supportive measures for the introduction of a new enterprise  system and for enterprises to converge with the new system; we  must accelerate the transformation of enterprises' operating  mechanisms; we must successfully fulfill various basic tasks  designed to establish a modern enterprise system; we must make  efforts along the course of establishing a modern enterprise  system. First, in respect of the basis for enterprises' economic  decisionmaking power, we must steadfastly implement the  "Enterprise Law" and the "Regulations Governing Large and  Medium-Sized State Enterprises' Transformation of Operating  Mechanisms." Second, in respect of the basis for property  rights, we must appraise step by step the fixed assets and  circulating funds of large and medium-sized enterprises to  ascertain state-owned assets in Jiangsu this year. Enterprises  whose conditions permit must do a good job of clarifying debts  receivable and debts payable, strive to readjust the  assets-liabilities ratio, and optimize their asset structure.  Third, in respect of the basis for business accounting, we must  implement the "general rule governing business accounting of  enterprises" and the "accounting standards" in an all-around  way, and establish and perfect an accounting system that meets  international standards for enterprises to faciliate their  smooth convergence with a modern enterprise system. The key to  the establishment of a modern enterprise system lies in efforts  to be made by the enterprises themselves. Now, all enterprises  must greatly change their guiding ideology and working methods.  They must change from the past pursuit for returns from  preferential treatment to pursuit for returns from reform.  Priority may be given to experiments with reform measures so  long as they are conducive to invigorating enterprises and  improving their quality.    Chen Huanyou pointed out: To meet the needs of the  development of a socialist market economy, we must improve  practical management of enterprises. We must continuously  innovate, develop, and improve management of enterprises under  the new situation, and make efforts to change our concepts and  broaden our thinking. First, we must make the transformation of  enterprises' operating mechanisms and management of enterprises  mutually supportive and closely integrate the reform of  enterprises with their management. Second, we must enable  enterprises to continuously adapt themselves to market changes,  to improve market predictions and management decisions, and to  adopt advanced production and operation methods to consolidate  and develop markets at home and abroad. Third, we must make  technical advance suit the modernization of management. We must  treat technology and managment as the two wheels for  successfully running an enterprise and make the two promote each  other. Fourth, our management of enterprises must coincide with  the international economy. In particular, large and  medium-sized enterprises whose conditions permit must gradually  meet the needs of international competition, organize production  and business operations on the basis of international practice,  and acclerate convergence between management of enterprises and  the international economy. To improve management of  enterprises, we must focus attention on successful management of  their cost and funds. We must strive to reduce their  consumption of materials and their cost, and to increase their  economic returns by every possible means. To solve the problem  of funds shortage, besides requesting more funds from the higher  authorities and attracting more foreign funds, we must, above  all, turn our attention to enterprises themselves. We must  begin with improving management, pay attention to successfully  managing and using existing funds, stimulate the circulation of  funds on hand, and improve the efficiency of the use of funds.  We must arouse and organize the vast number of enterprises and,  in particular, the large and medium-sized state enterpises to  conscientiously conduct activities of "transforming operating  mechanisms, paying close attention to management, improving  internal operations, and increasing economic returns." Relevant  departments must strengthen leadership over such activities,  draw up good plans for implementation, and pay close attention  to their implementation in a bid to promote Jiangsu's management  of enterprises to a new level.    Chen Huanyou demanded: We must adopt concrete and  effective measures to vigorously carry out the work of halting  losses and increasing profits. This year, the province must  achieve the target of reducing the number of money-losing  state-owned industrial enterprises to 30 percent of the total  and keeping the amount of the losses basically the same as last  year. We must establish a system of responsibility, with every  enterprise and every person having a clearly defined  responsibility and with every level assuming responsibility for  the next lower level. All localities and departments must soon  organize a special task force and send it to money-losing  enterprises to conduct a general survey and analysis to find out  the causes of their losses. Appropriate guidance must be  provided in light of the specific situation and with a clear  objective in mind. Active measures must be adopted to reduce  burdens on enterprises and ensure that they can compete in the  market unhampered. We must make full use of the existing social  security capacity and use the social security fund according to  regulations. At the same time, we must step up the construction  and perfection of a labor market to find a way out for workers  who await jobs, who were laid off, or who lost their jobs. We  must create more job opportunities for surplus enterprise  personnel. We must adopt a variety of flexible asset management  methods to enliven money-losing enterprises. We must encourage  stronger enterprises to take over money-losing ones on a  voluntary basis. We must continue to increase our experiment to  let private sectors manage state- and public-owned enterprises  and to lease them out. Small state-owned money-losing  enterprises may be leased out, contracted out, sold, or managed  in the form of a stockholding cooperative system. Those in  downtown districts of cities may be retooled to operate tertiary  industries. Enterprises that are still partly operational may  be enlivened through the adoption of "multi-systems under one  plant management" or through the reduction of accounting units.  While accelerating internal enterprise reform, we must pay more  attention to the changes and trends of the market. We must  strengthen market survey and research, keep track of market  demands, work hard to open up new markets, and increase our  sales. We must take further steps to accelerate technological  transformation, adjust product mixes, and firmly limit the  manufacturing of goods that have no markets while reducing their  stock through sales promotions. In the course of halting losses  and increasing profits, we must make proper arrangements for the  daily life of workers in difficult enterprises to ensure their  basic livelihood.    Chen Huanyou emphatically concluded: We must step up  changing government functions and create a favorable external  environment for enterprise reform and development. Everyone in  the province, from the top to the bottom, must make joint  efforts with one mind to deepen reform, revitalize our vast  number of enterprises, and play a bigger role in our province's  reform, opening up, and socialist modernization.</p>

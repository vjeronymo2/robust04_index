			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Moscow eyes bank profits Mr Oleg Soskovets, Russian deputy prime minister, yesterday floated the idea of forcing banks to invest a fixed percentage of their profits in the country's investment-starved industry. He told a banking conference that one idea was to compel banks to sell 50 per cent of their profits from 'speculative' hard currency operations to the state. He gave no details, although this would only generate a profit if the banks were not paid the full market rate or were not paid on time. The proposal, which was dismissed by Mr Victor Gerashchenko, central bank chairman, as unlikely to work, provided the latest evidence of the government's mixed instincts on market reform. Until now, it has talked of the need for tax incentives and lower inflation to encourage capital investment. At the same time, it has been discouraging investment through frequent tax increases and changes in legislation.</p>

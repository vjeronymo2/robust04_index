			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Islam turns S E Asia's secular heads: Several violent incidents have served as a reminder of growing religious power THE normally peaceful life of southern Thailand, where gilded Buddhist temples give way to the domes and minarets of mosques amid the rice fields and rubber plantations, has been rudely disrupted since the beginning of last month by a series of violent incidents. They include an ambush that killed two soldiers, an attack on a train in which a woman died, the throwing of a grenade into a Buddhist temple and co-ordinated arson attempts on 35 schools. There is no doubting the seriousness of the attacks, but there is little agreement about who is to blame. Thai Moslems say at least some of the incidents have more to do with domestic Thai politics than with religion, but they have served as an unwelcome reminder to South-East Asia's secular governments of the growing power of Islam in the region. The mood in Thailand's south, in the fundamentalist-led Malaysian state of Kelantan over the border and in the nearby Indonesian territory of Aceh give the lie to the conventional wisdom that South-East Asian Moslems practise a 'milder' form of Islam than their co-religionists in the Middle East. In reality South-East Asia's 200m Moslems are as diverse in their beliefs as Moslems are in the Arab world or Christians are in Europe. South-East Asian Moslems include the mystics of Java, the Cham fisherfolk of Cambodia, and the Libyan-trained guerrillas of the Moro National Liberation Front in the southern Philippines. The largest populations are in Indonesia  -the biggest Moslem country in the world  - and Malaysia. Government officials and businessmen have often said that Islamic fundamentalism in South-East Asia peaked at the time of the late Ayatollah Khomeini's control of Iran in the 1980s and has since declined under the influence of industrialisation and increasing wealth. But Moslem radicals themselves - and their liberal and feminist opponents - disagree. Some Moslems say that Islam is growing stronger because economic growth has benefited only a privileged minority, and because Islam is a peaceful force for democracy in conflict with auto-cratic governments. They deplore the impact of imported western television programmes on Moslem morals. The killing of Moslems in Bosnia, the Israeli bombardment of Moslem villages in southern Lebanon, and the persecution of Moslems by the Burmese military government have also angered Asian Moslems. 'Islam is a growing strength in this part of the world because they (Moslems) were so frustrated with the past and present system that dominates them,' said Mr Subky Abdul-Latif, an executive committee member of the Parti Islam se-Malaysia (PAS), the fundamentalist Malaysian opposition party. 'Moslems are being suppressed all over the world.' PAS, which has controlled the state government of Kelantan on the Thai border in a coalition with another Malay party since the 1990 elections, is attempting to introduce sharia law for all the inhabitants of the state although this would appear to contravene the Malaysian constitution's guarantee of religious free-dom. Thai military officers have accused PAS of harbouring separatist guerrillas from Thailand in Kelantan. PAS says - ambiguously - that it respects the international border. 'We don't want to interfere, but we don't want them to bully the Moslems there,' said Mr Abdul-Latif. Malaysia's neighbour Indonesia, meanwhile, has long used brutal methods in its attempts to suppress an Islamic separatist rebellion in Aceh on the northern tip of Sumatra. According to Amnesty International, the human rights group, Indonesian troops have summarily killed about 2,000 civilians there. On the main Indonesian island of Java, Moslems attacked several Christian churches and homes in November and December last year, apparently in response to a rise in Christian fundamentalist proselytising. The Indonesian and Malaysian governments, perceiving the growth of Islamic influence, have - at the same time as trying to crush their opponents or defeat them politically - attempted to co-opt fundamentalist Moslems by becoming more Islamic themselves. President Suharto of Indonesia and Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, have each established Moslem organisations to promote Islam as something compatible with the technological, social and economic development they are pursuing. Both governments are encouraging the development of 'interest-free' Islamic banking in parallel with conventional banking practices. Only last month, Malaysian officials said they expected all financial institutions in the country to offer some kind of Islamic service within a year. In Kuala Lumpur these days, it is more common than it used to be to see women wearing Islamic headgear covering their hair and shoulders. Malaysian Moslems can be, and occasionally are, punished under state sharia laws for drinking alcohol or for being in close company with someone of the opposite sex (excluding relatives); even government officials opposed to PAS say they want to increase the authority of the sharia courts. The Malaysian capital is still a lively, cosmopolitan city, but some middle-class Moslems, not to mention the minority Christians of ethnic Chinese origin, are worried by what they see as an emerging mood of Islamic orthodoxy. Although there is little sign of separatist fervour among Thai Moslems, who are the majority in the south but make up only 4 per cent of Thailand's population, they resent what they regard as Buddhist domination of their lives, especially in education. Islam has grown stronger over the last decade, and devout Thai Moslems say they want primary as well as secondary school girl pupils to wear the modest attire known as hijab. They would like an end to compulsory Thai dancing lessons and factory workers to be allowed time off to pray. And they say Moslems should have the chance to use Islamic financial institutions.</p>

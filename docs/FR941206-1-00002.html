This proposed action is intended to establish the Agency's requirements with respect to poultry products produced by mechanical separation, including the requirement that they be labeled as, in the case of MS(K) derived from chicken carcasses, ``mechanically separated chicken.'' Such action would help ensure that meat and poultry products distributed to consumers are not labeled in a false or misleading manner and are not misbranded.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before February 6, 1995.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Written comments to: Policy, Evaluation and Planning Office, Attn: Diane Moore, FSIS Docket Clerk, Room 3171, South Building, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250.

The Department first conducted a rulemaking regarding this product in 1969. Over the years, the amount of such product being manufactured and the number and range of poultry products and meat food products in which it is used as an ingredient, has increased significantly. Moreover, the Department has gained a great deal of knowledge from its rulemakings regarding the livestock product resulting from the mechanical separation and removal process which is called Mechanically Separated (Species) (MS(S)). More recently, in a lawsuit,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bob Evans Farm, Inc. et al.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mike Espy, Secretary of Agriculture (D D.C. Civil Action No. 93&hyph;0104),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> several red meat sausage manufacturers alleged that, without a regulatory definition and standard for poultry products produced by mechanical separation, a disparate situation exists between labeling mechanically separated poultry and the livestock product resulting from the mechanical separation and removal process for which a regulatory definition and standard exist. The red meat sausage manufacturers have alleged that the disparate labeling situation poses an unfair advantage for the manufacturers of mechanically separated poultry products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In view of these developments, and taking into account the information and experience acquired since 1969 and current regulatory policies, the Agency reviewed and reevaluated the existing regulations, particularly in light of the labeling issues. As a result of its review and reevaluation, the Agency believes that further regulatory action is necessary pursuant to its statutory responsibilities to protect the public and prevent the preparation and distribution in commerce of poultry products and meat food products which are misbranded or not properly marked, labeled, or packaged. See sections 4(h) and 8 of the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) (21 U.S.C. 451  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and sections 1(n) and 7 of the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) (21 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ); 21 U.S.C. 453(h), 457 and 601(n), 607. In particular, the Department now believes:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

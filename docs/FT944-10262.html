			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Observer: Winkled out Having recently created a record 58 new partners, Goldman Sachs probably feels it can afford to let slip a few other names. But probably not fixed-income chief Mark Winkelman. The departure of Dutch-born Winkelman is a serious blow to the investment bank. Several key partners - including previous chairman Stephen Friedman and head of its Japanese operation, Henry James - have now resigned in the last few months. And given that Goldman is struggling to recover from this year's bond market crash, Winkelman's razor-sharp trading skills will surely be missed. He is withdrawing to spend more time with his family - yes, that old cliche. But in September Winkelman was passed over for the firm's leadership. His fellow co-head of Goldman's bond business, Jon Corzine, was named chairman and senior partner, while investment banking supremo Henry Paulson became vice-chairman. At 48, Winkelman is a year older than Corzine and the same age as Paulson; did he deduce his chances of becoming top dog were slim? What will he do, apart from enjoying domesticity? Goldman's Wall Street rivals might be drooling, but Winkelman insists he will probably move into teaching, like other Goldmanites who have gone before him.</p>

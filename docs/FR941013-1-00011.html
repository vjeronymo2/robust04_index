These Super Bowl rules require that operators of Super Bowl tours that are promoted as including game tickets must have those game tickets in hand or under contract before they advertise or sell the tours, and that they must refund the entire tour price to any customer who does not receive a promised game ticket. This proposed rule would also extend the charter rule's prohibition on last-minute price increases to non-charter tours to special events. This initiative arises as a result of problems on certain tours to the 1994 Rose Bowl on which participants did not receive game tickets that were promoted as being included in the package, or were required to make additional payments in order to receive tickets. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments should be received by November 14, 1994.

Many of those tours were promoted as including a ticket to the Rose Bowl game. However, a significant number of these individuals either did not receive the game tickets that they had been promised and did not gain admission to the game, or were required to make an additional payment after they arrived in Pasadena in order to obtain their tickets. The Department is seeking comment on a proposal to extend its rules on Super Bowl tours to include air tours to other types of special events where admission to the event is advertised as being included in the package.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department's rules on Super Bowl charters are contained in title 14, part 380 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR part 380): <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Section 380.2 defines a Super Bowl charter as a charter flight that is represented by its charter operator as including tickets to the National Football League's Super Bowl game as part of its ground package. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Section 380.18a states that a Super Bowl charter may not be advertised unless the operator has submitted verification to the Department <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  that the operator (1) is in physical possession of enough Super Bowl game tickets to provide them for a substantial number of seats on the charter, or (2) has a contract with the NFL or with an NFL team for such a number of game tickets, or (3) has a contract with another person who has a contract with the NFL or an NFL team for such a number of game tickets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> References to ``the Board'' in Part 380 refers to the Civil Aeronautics Board, the Department's predecessor in aviation economic and consumer matters. The Department of Transportation now administers this rule as authorized by the Civil Aeronautics Board Sunset Act of 1984 (P.L. 98&hyph;443; 98 Stat. 1703). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Section 380.18a also states that a Super Bowl charter may not be sold unless the operator has submitted verification to the Department that the operator has possession of, or contracts for, enough game tickets to provide one to every person who is to receive one under the terms of the operator/participant contract for the charter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Section 380.31(c) states that if an operator receives a booking for which he or she does not have possession of or a contract for a game ticket, the operator must return that participant's money within 3 days, unless the participant has authorized the operator in writing to retain the payment while the operator seeks additional tickets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

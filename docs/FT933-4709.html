			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Rao and Li Peng ease border row INDIA and China moved yesterday to end a 30-year border dispute, vowing to cut troops numbers on their frontier and to maintain peace in the region, Reuter reports from Beijing. A joint statement hailed the pact as a landmark in relations. But differences remain over how many soldiers each should withdraw from the border area where they fought a war in 1962, Indian officials said. The agreement, signed after two days of talks between Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the visiting Indian prime minister, and Mr Li Peng, Chinese premier, prepares the ground for a final settlement of the border issue, the officials said. 'The two countries have agreed to undertake a series of confidence-building measures, including the reduction of military forces deployed along the India-China border,' a joint statement issued by the Indian embassy said. 'Pending a boundary settlement, India and China have agreed to respect and observe the line of actual control (LAC).' The line has separated the troops of the two nations since the brief 1962 war. 'This landmark agreement lays down the framework for maintaining peace and tranquility along the LAC,' the joint statement said. Indian opposition leaders have given a rare unanimous mandate to Mr Rao to resolve the dispute along the 4,000km (2,485 mile) border.</p>

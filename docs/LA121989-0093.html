			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY 1990;  </P> <P> DON'T EXPECT BASEBALL SALARIES TO HIT THE ROOF IN THE 1990S, AGENT SAYS  </P> <P> Projecting astronomical salaries for major league baseball players in the 1990s  based on this year's advent of the sport's first $3 million men will result in  overinflated guesses, according to a player agent.  </P> <P> Tom Reich, whose clients include Lance Parrish and Brian Downing of the Angels,  said it's unrealistic to expect that salaries will continue to increase at the  pace they skyrocketed between 1988 and '89, because the end of collusion made  this year unique. Salaries and revenues will be higher in the '90s, Reich  predicted, but the escalation won't proceed at a breathtaking pace.  </P> <P> "Nobody should project (1990s salaries) based on a percentage or proportion of  the increase from last year to this (year), because this is a four-year  catch-up from a price fix," said Reich, who declined to speculate on exact  salaries or averages in the coming decade. "Like after a wage or price freeze,  legal or illegal, there's a catch-up period and that's what we're having now.  That doesn't mean we won't get some increases, but we're not going to get the  same kind (of escalation) like last year to this . . .  </P> <P> "A bankable star, whether in music, movies, TV or sports, is going to get his  price and always will. The salaries of megastars will go up, but franchises  will have higher value, too. What I do think we'll see is a revenue deal,  revenue sharing between the players and owners cutting up that big, fat,  opulent pie. TV revenues are going to go up; the potential of pay-per-view is  staggering. Could you imagine what they could get if pay-per-view sold the  World Series around the world?  </P> <P> "There's always been a relationship between revenues and salary since free  agency. Before, the owners kept all the money. Now, the players get their cut.  There's a direct correlation between revenues and salary."  </P> <P> However large the increase in salaries, baseball's upper-echelon players are  sure to benefit far more than the game's lesser lights.  </P> <P> "The journeyman infielder will always be vulnerable," Reich said.  </P></p>

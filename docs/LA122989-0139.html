			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANN CONWAY: THE 1980S: A LITERAL GLITZ BLITZ  </P> <P> Orange County society won't be crying in their Dom Perignon when they say "see  ya" to the '80s. It's been a vintage decade for the glitz-set.  </P> <P> For starters, the Orange County Performing Arts Center opened in 1986, giving  the glitterati a stylish new way to spend an evening: First, they dress to  kill. Then, they dine at an A-list bistro near the Center (usually Antonello),  watch a performance at Segerstrom Hall and then party till the wee hours at a  nearby hot spot (usually the posh and private Center Club.).  </P> <P> We're still shaking our heads in disbelief. Clothing vendor Amen Wardy  installed a ballroom, complete with crystal chandeliers, in his maze-like  boutique in Newport Center Fashion Island. Its opening-night bash in 1984 saw  sexy Joan Collins, dripping in spangles, and then-husband Peter Holm ogling  designer wear while party guests ogled them. In recent years, Wardy's showplace  has been the site of Orange County's most-talked-about luncheon-fashion show,  the one annually sponsored by Angelitos de Oro, a support group of Big  Brothers/Big Sisters of Orange County. Regularly on the guest list: members of  the international society set such as fashion superstars Oscar de la Renta and  Bob Mackie.  </P> <P> Something we loved to see disappear in the '80s: the canopy of blue smoke that  used to hang like a rain cloud over a ballroom while a party was in progress.  Now, smoking cigarettes during a bash precipitates "who let you in?" stares.  Polite guests puff outdoors. Ashtrays are rarely found on party tables.  </P> <P> Something we hated to see appear in the '80s: "The valet stomp," the  itchy-twitchy dance step party-goers execute post-party time, while they wait  for their Jags, Rollses, Ferraris and Mercedeses. Some hotels have valet  parking only (tsk tsk). And some hotels need to hire more valets.  </P> <P> Now that you're primed for looking back, grab that Mont Blanc pen. It's time to  take the 1989 Society Trivia Quiz, the end-of-the-season game that tests your  social IQ. Now don't go kicking your secretary in the shins if you miss a few.  You were probably so busy kicking up your heels, you didn't have time to read  this column. But if you get them all right, something is dreadfully wrong.  You've got to get out more, stop being the voyeur. (Answers below.)  </P> <P> 1.

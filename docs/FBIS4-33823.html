			<p>CSO     [Text] A new problem has cropped up in the campaign of  presidential hopeful and former Sao Paulo Governor Orestes  Quercia. Besides his poor showing in the polls and the  ever-increasing popularity of former President Jose Sarney, his  rival in the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]  primaries, Quercia will now have to defend himself in court. The  new problem arose out of an old case, the import of $310 million  in electronic equipment from Israel. After studying the case for  16 months, Federal Prosecutor Paulo Sollberger concluded that  the former governor had participated in a "fraudulent  transaction" that permitted two companies, Trace Company and  Sealbrent, to profit from the importation, done "without seeking  competitive bids and at excessively high prices -- as much as 20  times more expensive," to the detriment of the state. Sollberger  charged Quercia under a well-known article of the Penal Code:  Article 171, which defines the crime of swindling.    The accusation will now be studied by 27 justices on the  Superior Court of Justice, who face no deadline for decision. If  the charges are rejected, the case is closed. If not, Quercia  will be indicted and tried. He can still run for president, but  would have to conduct a bizarre campaign, forced to spend a good  part of his time explaining things to the court instead of  seeking votes. Also charged are former Quercia Secretaries Jose  Machado de Campos Filho (Finance) and Luiz Gonzaga Belluzzo  (Science and Technology). Five businessmen are also on the list  of the accused. Among them is Arie Halpern, owner of Trace Trade  Company. Besides the charge of swindling, Halpern also faces a  charge of diversion of foreign exchange. Quercia reacted to the  accusation with a typical campaign-trail argument."That's the  work of PT [Workers Party] infiltrators," he said. The day  before, expecting that the accusation would not be made, Quercia  described the same Federal Prosecutor's Office as "impartial" in  an announcement published in the newspaper.  <H5>  Dummy Invoices </H5>   Sollberger's charge, set down in 36 pages, were based on  various documents. The main one is the "Technical, Scientific,  and Technological Cooperation Protocol" signed in 1988 by  Quercia and a witness at his wedding, then-Consul of Israel Tsvi  Chazan. As the prosecutor sees it, that was when the plot was  hatched. Based on a document he himself had signed, Quercia  claimed the backing of an international agreement to do whatever  he pleased. Another important document is an official  communication sent by the former governor to then-President Jose  Sarney. Although sent less than a month after the protocol was  signed, the letter already announced the intention to import  equipment from Israel, stating that "there was no similar  Brazilian product available." Sollberger notes that Quercia's  justification "was the same one cited as the reason not to seek  international competitive bids" to equip the universities. The  prosecutor concluded: "This shows that the governor was  directing the state agencies to purchase the equipment offered  by Trace."    The prosecutor observed that the equipment purchase was  completed with surprising rapidity. According to the charge,  Sealbrent, which appears as the vendor of the products, exists  only on paper. Its headquarters are in Dublin, Ireland, a tax  haven, and it was founded with only two pounds sterling of  capital. Its owners are the same as those of Trace, the  Brazilian firm that brokered the transaction. Sealbrent hastily  registered in Israel as a "foreign company." The prosecutor's  conclusion is that Sealbrent was set up solely for the  transaction with Quercia. As a foreign company, it could easily  send money out of Israel. Further evidence are the "dummy"  invoices issued by Sealbrent. They are dated 20 March 1989, four  months before the company was founded. The case file states that  the Trace Company tried to sell the same equipment to  then-Governor of Parana Alvaro Dias, who thought it was not a  good deal for his state. Finally, Trace sold a training system  to Mercedes-Benz of Brazil for $12 million. Similar equipment  cost the Sao Paulo government $55 million.  <H5>  Candidate-Defendant </H5>   Quercia's attorneys have 15 days from the date of the charge  in which to present their defense. VEJA consulted two of Sao  Paulo's best-known lawyers concerning Sollberger's charges. They  think the prosecutor did a good job. "The charge reveals with  crystal clarity that there was a swindle," one of them said.  Both thought it strange, however, that the prosecutor accused  Quercia of swindling rather than another crime that, in their  opinion, fit the actions better -- misappropriation of public  funds. Misappropriation of public funds is when a government  employee (which Quercia was) takes possession or permits others  to take possession of public funds, as occurs in cases of  overbilling. Swindling, however, requires a specific victim and,  according to the lawyers VEJA talked to, Sollberger did not  demonstrate this as clearly.    Current Sao Paulo Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho, who at  the time was secretary of public safety, has not yet been  accused. According to the prosecutor, it was not possible to  have an expert examine the equipment Fleury bought for the Sao  Paulo police and there are no grounds for accusing him of  overbilling, as happened in the case of the universities, an  area for which Luiz Gonzaga Belluzzo was responsible. The  exclusion of Fleury worked to Quercia's disadvantage. If the  governor had also been charged, proceedings could only be  initiated with authorization from the Legislative Assembly,  where the PMDB has enough allies to block the investigation.  With Fleury not involved, the accusation will go directly to the  Superior Court for consideration. The court's decision, for  which Justice Costa Leite is rapporteur, will not be handed down  before the PMDB primary, scheduled for 15 May. And that has  created a new problem for the party: the possibility that  Quercia will win the primary and be indicted shortly afterward.  A movement to cancel the primaries was already under way last  week with the idea of postponing the decision until the  convention scheduled for the end of the month, by which time the  legal status of would-be candidate Quercia may be known. "We  must not nominate a candidate-defendant," said Senator Gilberto  Miranda (PMDB, Amazonas State).</p>

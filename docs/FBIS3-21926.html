The PGR's [Office of the Attorney General of the Republic]  Michoacan State branch office, headed by Luis Aguilar, reported  the largest confiscation, totaling 1,375 kg of marijuana, near  the municipality of Apatzingan. Julio Cesar Cisneros Corona and  Gerardo Andrade Alcazar were captured while carrying the drugs  in a tractor trailer truck.    Found in a secret compartment in the body of a Kenworth  trailer truck, which was riveted and covered with a layer of  asphalt, were 445 packages of various weights and sizes, holding  the aforementioned total amount of drugs.    The other operations were carried out in Sonora, Sinaloa,  Baja California, Chihuahua, Tamaulipas, San Luis Potosi, Nuevo  Leon, and Coahuila. [passage omitted].</p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: THE PAY-OFF  </P> <P> What is an Oscar worth? A study done by Entertainment Data Inc. predicts that  the producers of the best picture winner can count on a cool $20-million  windfall. At least, that has been the average post-Oscar box office on the best  picture winners since "Gandhi" swept the board in 1982. "Gandhi" did 73% of its  $52.7 million theatrical business after the Academy Award nominations were  announced that year. Of the best picture winners in the last six years, 1983's  "Terms of Endearment" was least affected by the Oscar (it grossed $14.5 million  after winning the big prize), but it had been an immediate box office hit and  was almost played out when the Oscars were given. Other best picture winners  and their post-Academy Award victory performances: "Amadeus" (1984), $17.5  million; "Out of Africa" (1985), $17.4 million; "Platoon" (1986), $35.2  million; "The Last Emperor" (1987), $18.9 million. Of course, what the study  doesn't show, and no one knows, is how much these films would have earned if  they'd lost. ALEENE MacMINN and Jack Mathews  </P></p>

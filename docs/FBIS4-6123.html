			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi, April 16 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign Minister  Josef Zieleniec today continued his official visit to Vietnam  with separate meetings with his Vietnamese counterpart Ngyuen  Manh Cam, Premier Vo Van Kiet and Chairman of the National  Assembly (parliament) Nong Duc Manh.    At talks with the Vietnamese foreign minister Zieleniec  raised the question of human rights. He informed Cam on  receiving an open letter from the Czech section of the  Vietnamese Renewal Party shortly before leaving Prague for  Vietnam which contained a list of almost 150 people imprisoned  in Vietnam for their religious convictions or for expressing  disagreement with the Vietnamese Government.    Zieleniec pointed to world discussion on the topic of the  universal nature of human rights and rights arising from  historical and practical life conditions.    Zieleniec told journalists that he pointed to his Vietnamese  colleague how important it was for the former Czechoslovakia  that Western countries were concerned that human rights there  were observed. He added, however, that the question of human  rights did not hamper the Czech-Vietnamese talks as a whole and  had adequate proportions.    He said that Vietnamese leadership rejects the criticism in  this respect using the arguments which had once been used by the  Czechoslovak communist leadership.    The essential part of the talks was dedicated to the  possibilities for economic cooperation. The preparation of a  trade agreement and an agreement on the employment of citizens  of the other country were discussed. As soon as these two  agreements are signed the preparation of an agreement on  investment protection and the prevention of double taxation  would start, Zieleniec said.</p>

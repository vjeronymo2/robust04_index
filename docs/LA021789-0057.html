			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THOMAS BERNHARD; AUSTRIAN PLAYWRIGHT  </P> <P> Controversial writer and dramatist Thomas Bernhard, whose works dwelt in the  dark reaches of alienation and terrorism and whose last play in Vienna sparked  public demonstrations and cultural divisiveness, has died.  </P> <P> The enfant terrible of Austrian theater and literature who had been likened an  heir to Franz Kafka was 58.  </P> <P> Police said Thursday that Bernhard was found dead of apparent heart failure in  his house in the town of Gmunden on Sunday morning.  </P> <P> A spokesman declined to say why it had taken four days to announce the death,  but the Austria Press Agency later reported that it was Bernhard's wish to be  buried before his death was announced.  </P> <P> Bernhard, whose play "Heldenplatz" ("Heroes' Square") accused Austrians of  being anti-Semites and fascists and enraged many politicians, had suffered for  many years from a lung condition that Austrian radio said required regular  treatment with cortisone.  </P> <P> Born in the Netherlands, Bernhard was the illegitimate child of a Salzburg  woman and a peasant father whom he never knew.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Times book critic Richard Eder in reviewing Bernhard's "A Memoir"  in 1986 said that because of the circumstances of his birth, the author had  since burned "with a succession of prosecutorial fires: infantile, adolescent  and adult. . . ."  </P> <P> He grew up in Vienna, the Austrian countryside and southern Bavaria before  being sent in his early teens to a home in Salzburg.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Grocer's Apprentice  </P> <P> Leaving school early to become a grocer's apprentice, Bernhard was hospitalized  for months at a time with severe lung complaints from 1948 to 1951. In 1955, he  entered Salzburg's famed Mozarteum to study acting and music and in 1957  published his first volume of poetry.  </P> <P> Publication of several novels, short stories and more poetry followed, winning  an increasing series of awards for the man whom prominent West German critic  Marcel Reich-Ranicki termed "the most melancholy poet and most bitter prophet  of German literature."  </P> <P> His plays, often directed by the controversial director of Vienna's  Burgtheater, Claus Peymann, were a continual subject of controversy in Vienna  and Salzburg.  </P> <P> In 1976, for instance, his play "The Famous" opened in Vienna after being  rejected by the Salzburg festival because of its criticism of prominent  Salzburg cultural figures.  </P> <P> Peymann's production of "Heldenplatz" at the Burgtheater last fall also sparked  a raging controversy over whether state money should be used to subsidize art  so critical of Austria.  </P> <P> Many Vienna critics, however, praised the play and its performance.  </P> <P> "Heldenplatz" tells the story of a Jewish professor who emigrates in 1938 when  the Nazis march in, returns later and eventually commits suicide because he  feels Austria in 1988 has barely changed its attitude toward Jews.  </P> <P> In 1984 police seized his book "Woodcutting" because of allegations that it  insulted a well-known Viennese cultural figure.  </P> <P> In general, Eder wrote, Bernhard's sense of life was "implacably hostile."  </P></p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / BTR buys Pirelli units for Pounds 110m BTR, the UK-based industrial conglomerate, yesterday announced a Pounds 110m acquisition in Europe and a disposal worth Dollars 145.4m (Pounds 76m) in the US. The Pounds 110m deal covers the purchase of automotive and industrial rubber products businesses in Germany, Spain and the UK from Pirelli of Italy. BTR will pay Pounds 60m in cash and assume Pounds 50m of borrowings for the businesses, which employ 4,600 people. Total sales last year were Pounds 285m, of which more than 80 per cent was accounted for by the German companies. The businesses include German-based Metzeler Automotive Profiles and Metzeler Gimetall, Pendelastica and Perfiles del Automovil in Spain and Metzeler (UK), based in Cambridgeshire. Last year they made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.2m. Mr Alan Jackson, BTR's chief executive, said: 'The acquisition accords with BTR's objective of strengthening its presence in the original equipment manufacturing arena of continental Europe.' He believes increased product-ivity could make these companies as profitable as BTR's Schlegel business in the US, which last year had profit margins of 12 per cent to 14 per cent on sales of Pounds 300m. This is Pirelli's second large divestment since the tyre company decided six months ago to concentrate on core business, cut losses and reduce debt. The group plans to sell a total of seven business units. Pirelli said that since the end of 1991, it had reduced overall debt from L3,700bn (Pounds 1.7bn) to L2,900bn. The remaining business units to be sold cover activities such as hoses, leisure goods and defence. Non-core business accounted for L1,700bn in annual turnover and the companies sold so far represent 40 per cent of this. Pirelli claims these sales, combined with a L500bn capital increase, have improved group finances and in the first five months of the year operations showed a marginal profit. BTR also announced a sale in the US by a subsidiary of Hawker Siddeley, the UK engineering group it bought for Pounds 1.55bn last year. Interests in Richmond Power Enterprise, which owns a power plant in Virginia, have been bought by Enron Richmond Power for Dollars 15.4m, together with the assumption of borrowings worth Dollars 130m from BTR.</p>

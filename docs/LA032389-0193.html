			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACT TO LEASE BUSES APPROVED  </P> <P> The Foothill Transit Zone this week approved a $5.5-million lease agreement for  30 new buses, which will allow the agency to add three lines in the San Gabriel  Valley by mid-1989.  </P> <P> The bus purchase, to be made on a lease-purchase option from Gillig Bus Co.,  will be underwritten by the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission. The  commission gave approval in 1987 for Foothill to eventually take over service  on 20 Southern California Rapid Transit District lines within three years.  </P> <P> Since late last year, Foothill Transit buses have been doing standing-room-only  service on two former RTD park-and-ride routes from the eastern San Gabriel  Valley to downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> At the Monday meeting, the zone also approved a $75,294 annual contract with  Foothill Executive Director William P. Forsythe, the county consultant who  helped bring the zone into being.  </P> <P> Trial is slated to begin in May in Los Angeles Superior Court on a lawsuit  brought by RTD drivers and mechanics, challenging Foothill's existence. The  union says Foothill Transit threatens RTD jobs and represents an illegal  breakup of the massive transit operator.  </P></p>

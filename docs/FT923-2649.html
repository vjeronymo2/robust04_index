			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / The Liberal Democrats At Harrogate: Ashdown moderates stance on referendum MR PADDY ASHDOWN'S calls for a referendum on the Maastricht treaty on closer European union have come under strong attack from within his own party, forcing the Liberal Democrat leader to tone down his advocacy of the idea. Senior party officials said that a rebellion against Mr Ashdown's stance among Lib Dem MPs had forced the leader to agree not to promote the demand as party policy. At what some officials described as an acrimonious meeting of the 20 MPs, an informal deal was struck allowing Mr Ashdown to continue to voice support for a referendum when pressed on the issue but constraining him from actively campaigning for one. It is understood that more than half-a-dozen of the party's MPs - including Sir David Steel, the foreign affairs spokesman, have said that they would not back a plebiscite in any debate in the House of Commons. Mr Ashdown believes the constitutional implications of Maastricht - with its commitment to monetary union and shared decision-making on defence and foreign policy issues - merit a popular vote. The Liberal Democrat leader has also argued privately that a referendum in which his party was campaigning alongside Labour politicians for a Yes vote would enhance the prospect of wider co-operation between the two opposition parties, similar to the 1975 referendum on British membership of the EC. But even some of those MPs who back a referendum caution that party activists might well refuse to mount joint campaigns with Labour.</p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Observer: Gift of the gab How far the Treasury's seven-strong panel of outside advisers has raised the tone of economic debate in the UK is open to question, but the panel members' own public profiles have certainly improved. According to the FT's fame ranking, now entering its second year, no fewer than five of the wise men, who have been sounding off for nearly 12 months, feature in the top seven. This invidious table rates UK economists according to the numbers of times their names have been mentioned in Britain's non-tabloid newspapers in the year to November 1. This time, arch-monetarist Tim Congdon tops the pile with 263 mentions. Joint fourth in the rankings previously, he knocks fellow wise man Gavyn Davies off his number one perch; Davies slips to third place. Patrick Minford, joint fourth last year, comes in second. But how about Andrew Sentance, who has zoomed up from 21st, with a piffling 29 mentions, to joint fourth, with 176 articles featuring his name? Note too the rise of Wynne Godley, who comes in at fifth, up from 16th. David Currie and Andrew Britton are a trifle more taciturn. They rank 12th and 15th in this year's survey, still an improvement on their previous positions of 24th and 25th respectively. Among the economists outside the Treasury panel, honourable mentions go to Roger Bootle of Midland Bank, up one notch at sixth, and David Kern of National Westminster Bank, at seventh, after ranking 10th. Meanwhile, Kleinwort Benson's Peter Spencer and UBS's Bill Martin - both apparently on the shortlist for the Treasury panel first time round - could try harder. While Spencer has fallen from 10th place last year to 21st in the latest rankings, Martin has plummeted from second place to an ignominious 14th.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Halls Homes in receivership Halls Homes &amp; Gardens, the USM-quoted manufacturer of conservatories, garden buildings and home improvement products, yesterday had its shares suspended at 3 1/2 p and passed into the hands of receivers. The action jeopardises a Pounds 1.5m debt-into-equity swap agreed by National Westminster, its bankers, in February last year, which reduced borrowings to about Pounds 6.3m. Mr Tony Houghton and Mr John Richards, partners in accountants Touche Ross, were appointed receivers. Mr Houghton said the company had suffered from the effects of the recession.</p>

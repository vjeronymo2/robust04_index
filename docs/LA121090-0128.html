			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE GAMES  </P> <P> Rodney Peete always wanted to play for the Raiders, first when they were in  Oakland and later after they moved to Los Angeles.  </P> <P> He gets to play against his heroes tonight as his Detroit Lions meet the  Raiders at the Silverdome. "I grew up a Raiders fan," Peete said. "I liked them  when I was still in high school. Later, when I was playing at Southern Cal, I  probably knew as much about the Raiders as I did about my own teammates."  </P></p>

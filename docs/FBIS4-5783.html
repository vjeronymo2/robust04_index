			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of National Defense said today that a  Chinese military attache office will be opened in the ROK on 16  April. General (Jin Hunghen) and Colonel (Shang Kyo) will come  to the ROK as military attache officers.    The Chinese military attache office will be opened in  accordance with an agreement between the ROK and PRC Governments  signed in September 1992 to open military attache offices in  each capital. In December last year, the ROK opened its  military attache office in China.    Regarding this, the Ministry of National Defense said that  China's opening of its military attache office in Seoul is an  expression of its will not to unilaterally support North Korea's  aggravation of tensions on the Korean peninsula, and that this  will help ease North Korea's recent will to provoke South Korea.</p>

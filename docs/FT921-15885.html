			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Survey of Kenya (17): Coping with tranquillity - Kiwayu THE Air Kenya twin-engined aircraft banked smoothly, passing over the mangrove swamps and pygmy palms which sprawl along Kenya's northern Indian Ocean coastline. It headed towards what appeared to be a small sandy clearing in the scrubland and then suddenly alighted, coming to a sharp stop at the end of a narrow airstrip. Waiting in the warm breeze by the side of a makeshift shady lean-to was an open jeep, watched over by a tall Kenyan in a sarong, a G3 automatic rifle slung over his shoulder. For the four passengers who disembarked, this welcome to Kiwayu, one of Kenya's most splendid and exclusive beach resorts, was both unexpected and unnerving. Seclusion is what Kiwayu - inaccessible by road and serviced by irregular flights - is all about. To the south lies the belt of hotels catering mainly for the package holiday visitor, lured by keen prices, modern amenities and cheap curios. Kiwayu, at the other end of the market, has fought to preserve its solitude and its Robinson Crusoe atmosphere while ensuring that its guests receive all the creature comforts of a fine hotel. Balmy monsoon winds blowing down from Arabia roll in across the tropical, azure Indian ocean in front of the camp. With the fragrant breeze comes rough-hewn fishing boats and Arab dhows, their frail, dirty white sails fluttering in the wind, laden down with spices to sell along the ancient trade routes of the African coastline. The camp is a stone's throw away from a scrubland where buffalo and antelope abound. At night, the deep gruff sound of a lion can be heard above the murmur of the surf and occasionally one of the big cats can be seen basking in the sunlight on the beach. Elephants, which used to come down through the mangrove swamps, have suffered from the poaching of Somali bandits, known locally as shifta. 'Trying to get back to nature,' is how Mr Alfredo Pellizoli one of the partners of Kiwayu camp describes the 25 bandas (beach huts) set in a wide bay on an expansive, sun-bleached, unspoiled white sandy beach. The bandas are the essence of the castaway image that Kiwayu has cultivated. Each is thatched with coconut leaf and the walls are covered in raffia matting. There are no doors and no locks, just mats which unroll to give visitors privacy from the few local fishermen walking along the beach. Basic plumbing, showers and flush toilets have been installed but, one suspects, with the reluctance of the proprietors of the camp. Fresh seafood is standard Kiwayu fare - huge prawns, lobster and crab caught locally and bought each day in the fishing villages which dot the area around the site. All other produce has to be flown in when there are new arrivals at the camp. 'In the past at Kiwayu,' Mr Pellizoli recalls, 'it was possible to shoot an elephant in the morning on the beach and catch a huge marlin in the sea the afternoon.' Today, hunting is banned and elephants run shy, but guests at Kiwayu can at least still take advantage of Kenya's terrific big game fishing for marlin, sailfish and tuna. More leisurely activities of wind surfing, water-skiing and day excursions by speedboat along the coast are available. For most visitors, Kiwayu provides a rare opportunity to walk along a deserted beach at night with crabs scuttling across the sand, the moon shimmering across the bay and only the African night-time sounds of crickets to break the silence. Most guests stay several days. A few, unable to cope with the tranquillity hard to find in the western world, leave early. According to Mr Pellizoli, they find 'Kiwayu is something beyond their comprehension'. For the rest of us, this is part of Kiwayu's charm.</p>

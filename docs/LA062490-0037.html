			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> DEATH TOLL IN IRAN QUAKE NEARS 29,000;  </P> <P> DISASTER: RESCUE WORKERS STRUGGLED TO REACH SURVIVORS AS AFTERSHOCKS CONTINUED  TO ROCK THE AREA. ABOUT 100,000 PEOPLE ARE BELIEVED INJURED AND 400,000 ARE  HOMELESS.  </P> <P> Rescue workers and dazed survivors struggled Friday to dig thousands of dead  and injured from the rubble of an earthquake in northwest Iran as the official  death toll rose to nearly 29,000 -- the highest for an earthquake in 14 years.  </P> <P> A dozen towns and hundreds of villages were devastated by the temblor that  spread across two provinces near the Caspian Sea early Thursday. Aftershocks  continued to rock the area, with 140 counted by Friday.  </P> <P> The Red Cross in Geneva, quoting the Iranian Red Crescent Society, said about  400,000 people are believed homeless. The Iranian mission to the United Nations  estimated that 100,000 were injured.  </P> <P> "Whole towns were flattened like they were never there. We have no way to get  to many," said Mohammad Afshar, a Red Crescent official.  </P> <P> "For the next 10 days we will be digging through the rubble for corpses,"  Afshar said. "Roads are blocked by falling rocks, and planes have difficulty  landing in the mountains of Gilan," a province on the Caspian Sea coast hit by  the quake.  </P> <P> Iran's official news agency IRNA reported Friday that the known dead number  28,950. It said 25,241 bodies have been counted in Gilan province, on the  Caspian Sea, and 3,709 in Zanjan province. That toll surpasses the 25,000  killed in Soviet Armenia in December, 1988, and is the highest know worldwide  since July, 1976, when a earthquake in China reportedly killed 242,000.  </P> <P> The U.N. Disaster Relief Organization in Geneva said it was told by the Iranian  Foreign Ministry that the death toll was expected to reach 35,000, with 105,000  people injured. A total of 28,198 people were injured in the two provinces,  IRNA said.  </P> <P> More shocks followed the big quake. Interior Minister Abdullah Nouri said a  main road in the disaster zone, cleared Thursday, was blocked by a fresh  landslide Friday.  </P> <P> President Hashemi Rafsanjani visited the hardest-hit area, including the town  of Roudbar in the Caspian province of Gilan, where at least 6,000 died.  </P> <P> He told reporters that Iran, fiercely proud of its self-reliance since  Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's 1979 Islamic Revolution, would accept foreign  help for quake victims.  </P> <P> Rafsanjani said "nothing worth mentioning" was left of towns and villages he  saw during a helicopter flight over the quake zone. Gilan province and  adjoining Zanjan have a population of about 4 million people.  </P> <P> Four of Iran's bitter enemies -- the United States, Israel, Iraq and Saudi  Arabia -- sent offers to help. A senior U.S. official in Washington said the  American offer was accepted.  </P> <P> "The catastrophe is so serious . . . " Rafsanjani told IRNA. "International  help is needed. We should accept the help that is offered."  </P> <P> He said the greatest need is for heavy equipment -- especially cranes to lift  huge pieces of rubble.  </P> <P> Iran told the Swiss-based League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies that  it needed medicine, tents, blankets, food, trucks, cranes and bulldozers. It  said it did not need doctors and other experts or blood supplies, sniffer dogs  or used clothing.  </P> <P> Iranian television showed doctors tending victims on stretchers in a makeshift  hospital in a parking lot. Masked rescuers in white aprons pulled dust-covered  bodies from under concrete slabs. Corpses were laid on blocks of ice in open  trucks.  </P> <P> Television showed scenes of devastation, including the remains of an entire row  of hillside village houses that collapsed and slid down the hill.  </P> <P> Rescuers scooped up rubble and used police dogs to find victims. They gently  fed water to one man who was trapped in a mass of stones and earth, only his  head protruding.  </P> <P> At Manjil in Gilan province, Parvin Nemati clutched the headless body of one  daughter wrapped in a blanket. Her husband and relief workers unearthed the  body of another daughter, 10-year-old Fatemeh, an Iranian correspondent  reported.  </P> <P> A man in Roudbar told Iranian television "a rock as big as a building" crashed  into his home, killing four of his six children. His wife said she lay in the  ruins for hours with one of the surviving children beside her.  </P> <P> "There is not a single house in this area which has been left standing," farmer  Ali Mohammadi said in Roudbar.  </P> <P> Television showed villagers looking at houses turned into heaps of mud bricks  and wooden beams by the quake, which was measured at a magnitude of 7.3 by  Tehran University; the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo., put it at 7.7.  </P> <P> Farhad Shad, a spokesman for the Geophysics Center at Tehran University, told  IRNA that 140 aftershocks were registered after the killer earthquake.  </P> <P> Hospitals overflowed with victims. Tehran Radio said some of the injured were  flown 600 miles from the disaster zone for treatment.  </P> <P> Tehran airport was thronged with people trying to reach the quake zone to learn  the fate of relatives. Officials turned them back, saying the planes were  needed for relief workers.  </P> <P> A French government plane carrying 205 rescue workers, 18 sniffer dogs and 25  tons of aid was heading for Iran, although the Iranian Red Crescent said  experts were not needed.  </P> <P> A 17-member British team set out with ultrasonic listening devices and thermal  cameras which can sense body heat beneath ruins. A planeload of doctors, rescue  workers and aid was on its way from the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Five members of the Paris-based charity Doctors Without Frontiers were already  helping at an air force hospital in Tehran, IRNA said.  </P></p>

On the  30th anniversary of the naming of this collective of heroes by  the Ministry of Defense, we send warm congratulations to all the  officers and men of the 6th Company and pay high respect to  leaders at all levels and the broad masses who have spent a  great deal of effort for the growth and progress of the 6th  Company!    Great times have produced a great Army and the revolutionary  spirit has nurtured a collective of heroes. As an all-round  tough heroic company and a flag for the basic-level army  building of the entire PLA, the "Hard-Boned Company" is the  inevitable result of implementing the PLA's goal in earnest and  carrying forward the fine tradition of the people's army as well  as the model that resolutely implements Mao Zedong's military  thinking, Deng Xiaoping's thinking about army building during  the new period, and Chairman Jiang Zemin's "five-sentence"  general demand. Their fundamental experience is carrying  forward the hard-boned spirit of the proletariat.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping once pointed out: "The work style of  the Hard-Boned 6th Company is not only the work style of a  company. All companies as well as cadres at all levels should  learn diligently and train laboriously like they do and should  have political thinking like theirs." Military Commission  Chairman Jiang also pointed out: "The hard-boned spirit is the  PLA's fine tradition and precious spiritual wealth. This spirit  is embodied in the fact that no matter what difficulty one is  faced with, one does not yield, dares to struggle with it, and  courageously makes sacrifices until one triumphs over it. This  hard-boned spirit is needed both in wartime and in peacetime."  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's and Chairman Jiang Zemin's important  instructions have made a high, summing-up appraisal of the basic  experience of the "Hard-Boned 6th Company," revealed the rich  contents of the hard-boned spirit, and given a direction for the  entire PLA to learn from the Hard-Boned 6th Company and for  strengthening the all-round buildup of the troops.    The PLA has large numbers of heroes. The hard-boned spirit,  which was produced in the battlefield of blood and fire, is not  only the spirit of a company, but also the common spiritual  wealth of the PLA. This spirit fully embodies the "five types  of revolutionary spirit" advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping,  vividly reflects the firm political position and lofty  ideological virtues of the officers and men of the entire Army  and their fighting will of making sacrifices courageously, and  fully demonstrates the PLA's strict army discipline and the  spiritual mood of being an army that captures every stronghold  it fights against and wins every battle it fights. In the new  historical period, energetically carrying forward this spirit is  of very great significance to consolidating our political  beliefs, withstanding all sorts of tests, strengthening the  all-round buildup of the troops, and improving their combat  effectiveness.    The PLA is a strong pillar for the people's democratic  dictatorship. It shoulders the sacred mission of protecting the  security of the motherland and offering a safe environment for  reform and opening up and the modernization drive. Properly  carrying out the glorious functions of the people's army  presents a heavy task and numerous difficulties and tests. We  must arouse morale and encourage the fighting will with the  hard-boned spirit, be unyielding before the enemy, not fear  difficulties, step forward bravely in times of danger, and  always maintain the powerful strength of overcoming the enemy,  unyielding tenacity, and stamina of persevering to the end.    Carrying forward the hard-boned spirit demands that we study  basic Marxist theories in earnest, arm the brains of officers  and men with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and his ideas on army  building during the new period, lay a solid ideological  foundation, and enhance the initiative and determination to  implement the party's basic line.    Carrying forward the hard-boned spirit demands that we  standardize army building at the basic level, attach importance  to basic-level units every year, lay a foundation every year,  carry the nurturing of the hard-boned spirit through in all the  jobs of every company, and bring up large numbers of companies  that are as tough overall and as "politically qualified,  militarily tough, possessing a fine work style and strict  discipline, and providing effective safeguards."    Carrying forward the hard-boned spirit demands that we  educate officers and men to steel themselves in the course of  struggle so that they can defend the country and guard the  border courageously and tenaciously, take part in rescue and  disaster relief operations in a self-sacrificing manner, and  undertake demanding and strict military training, acquire  knowledge in earnest and painstakingly, overcome new, key  technological research problems, and be devoted to production  and work.    Carrying forward the hard-boned spirit also demands that we  uphold the integration of the revolutionary spirit and a  scientific attitude and the integration of inheriting ideas and  bringing forth innovations so that it retains the traditional  content full of vitality while continuously injecting the spirit  of the new times, continuously building up a modernized,  regularized, and revolutionary Army.</p>

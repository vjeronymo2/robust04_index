Before 1 July 1994, the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers  will examine the question of price formation in the  agro-industrial complex, starting from the need to observe  optimal parity between prices for agricultural output and raw  materials and industrial output.    2. The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers, in agreement with the  Ukrainian National Bank, will grant, on a priority basis, in  June-September 1994, special-purpose credits to enterprises and  organizations of the agro-industrial complex against state  contracts and orders for delivery of agricultural output to  state food resources and for preliminary payment for animal  husbandry products within the limits of the possibilities of  putting a primary credit emission into circulation for this  period.    The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers, in agreement with the  Ukrainian National Bank, will within 10 days direct 1.7 trillion  karbovantsy, taken from the return of stabilization resources,  to enterprises of the meat, dairy, canning, food, and other  sectors of industry that process agricultural output and raw  materials to make payments to the commodity producers of the  agro-industrial complex for agricultural output and raw  materials purchased.    3. It is established that, in 1994-1995, the Ukraine  joint-stock commercial agro-industrial bank will perform state  functions associated with credit, settlement, and currency  services to the enterprises and organizations of the  agro-industrial complex in their activities aimed at generating  state resources of foodstuffs. Procedures for performing these  functions will be established by the Ukrainian Ministry of  Finance in coordination with the Ukrainian National Bank.    4. It is established that, beginning on 15 June 1994,  commercial banks will direct 10 percent of their mobilized  credit resources to credit for enterprises and organizations of  the agro-industrial complex and to purchase certificates of  deposit of the Ukrainian National Bank.    It is established that for commercial banks that direct  mobilized credit resources to credit for enterprises and  organizations of the agro-industrial complex and to purchase  certificates of deposit of the Ukrainian National Bank, the  income tax rate for the part of income received from these  credits and certificates of deposit will be lowered to 11  percent.    Credit at an annual interest rate of 30 percent will be  granted to enterprises and organizations of the agro-industrial  complex to finance state agrarian programs.    The difference between the rate at which credit resources  are  attracted (not greater than the discount rate of the Ukrainian  National Bank) and the 30-percent rate for credit use will be  compensated for from the Ukrainian State Budget.    During preparation of proposals to specify the indicators of  the 1994 Ukrainian State Budget, the Ukrainian Ministry of  Finance will envision the appropriations necessary for this.    The Ukrainian Ministry of Finance, with the participation of  the Ukrainian National Bank, will within 10 days develop and  ratify the procedure for forming and using mobilized credit  resources, keeping records of the commercial bank income  received in this, and applying tax to such income.    5. The Ukrainian National Bank, with the participation of  commercial banks and the appropriate ministries and departments,  will within 10 days define and institute a mechanism, mandatory  for commercial banks and their debtors, for transferring  indebtedness on loans granted out of credit resources that the  state has granted to agricultural commodity producers and  enterprises of the processing and mixed feed industries to the  purchasers of their output.    6. Before 1 July 1994, the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers  will see that procurement and processing enterprises and  organizations are given 50-percent advance payments for  agricultural commodity producers against the state contract,  including advances for seed for agricultural crops and for  pedigreed livestock, and they will envision the appropriations  needed for this during preparation of proposals to specify the  indicators of the 1994 Ukrainian State Budget.    7. The Ukrainian National Bank will establish a most favored  status for commercial banks that take part in carrying out  priority agrarian programs.    Agricultural enterprises and organizations will make  extensive use of the credits received against the security of  their output. In this connection, one exception will be  established for them in payment of the state fee for registering  security; it will be 0.3 percent of the value of the property  used as security, but not more than 5 million karbovantsy.    8. It is established that enterprises of the wholesale and  retail networks, regardless of their form of ownership and  including consumer cooperative enterprises, will use all of the  earnings they receive, with the exception of the trade margin,  from the sale of agricultural output and food bought from the  producers of Ukrainian agro-industrial output exclusively for  settling accounts with those producers. If these earnings are  used for other purposes, the tax inspectorates will impose an  indisputable penalty of three times the amount used improperly,  to be paid to the local budget.    9. It is established that wholesale and retail trade  enterprises, regardless of their form of ownership and including  consumer cooperative enterprises, must pay a fine of 3 percent  of the total payment to suppliers of agricultural output, raw  material, and food and a 3-percent payment to the local budget  for each day payment is overdue after a three-day period, unless  a larger penalty is envisioned by agreement.    The Ukrainian National Bank will institute a procedure for  collecting this fine from its clients who violate payment  discipline by a nonacceptance withdrawal.    10. The Ukrainian State Committee on Material Reserves will  put an additional 90,000 tonnes of animal fat and 30,000 tonnes  of meat into the state reserve in June-August 1994.    The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers will ensure timely  payment  for this output and envision the means for this in the state  budget.    11. The government of the Republic of Crimea and the oblast,  Kiev, and Sevastopol state administrations, with the  participation of the Ukrainian Ministry of Agriculture and Food  and other interested ministries and departments, will ensure  that, before 10 June 1994, the accounts of agricultural  commodity producers and enterprises of the processing industry  with organizations of wholesale and retail trade, regardless of  forms of ownership and including consumer cooperatives, for  agricultural output and processed food products delivered as of  1 June 1994 are reconciled.    The purchasers of agricultural output and processed food  products are obligated to complete payment for the output  received before 15 June 1994.    Article 9 of the present edict will apply to enterprises who  do not ensure timely payment for output received.    12. In connection with the present Ukrainian presidential  edict, Edict No. 458, dated 15 October 1993, entitled "Payments  for Deliveries of Food and Agricultural Output" is declared  repealed.    13. The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers and the Ukrainian  National Bank will bring normative enactments published earlier  into line with the present edict.    14. The present edict goes into force on the day it is  signed.    [Signed] President of Ukraine L. Kravchuk    City of Kiev, 2 June 1994</p>

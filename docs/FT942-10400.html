			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Law fees eclipse court selection In a week when American eyes might have been on President Bill Clinton's search for a new justice for the Supreme Court attention has been diverted by an issue even older than the highest bench; the relationship between the law and money. Mr Clinton did confer yesterday with senior advisers on the court selection after mounting speculation over who has been on and off his moveable short list. Most frequently mentioned names include Mr Richard Arnold, a distinguished federal judge who happens to hail from Arkansas, Mr Bruce Babbitt, the interior secretary, and Mr Jose Cabranes, a federal judge of Hispanic extraction. But the White House staff has been preoccupied with a far more prosaic issue  -how to pay for Mr and Mrs Clinton's private legal fees resulting from the Whitewater investigations and the sexual harassment law suit filed by Ms Paula Jones against the president. Ms Jones has an equivalent financial problem on her hands, the cost of prosecuting her case. The first family (declared income last year Dollars 293,000) has contracted with two high-priced (Dollars 400-Dollars 500 an hour) lawyers. The White House is considering inviting private contributions to finance the bills which could easily rise towards the Dollars 1m range, capable of wiping out their known private assets. Rough precedents include private donations to the Reagans to help redecorate the White House, but that also attracted conflict of interest criticisms. Ms Jones (income unknown but small) might well find backing from conservative sources intent on embarrassing Mr Clinton. But accepting funding from such sources would suggest her action was politically motivated, not exactly the way to win over a jury in her Dollars 750,000 damages suit if the case ever comes to trial. Her lawyer said yesterday that only one Dollars 50 contribution had been received. But even the financial scale of their problems were dwarfed this week by news of another lawsuit. Mr Brian Mooar, a reporter/photographer for the Washington Post, sued the District of Columbia government for no less than Dollars 171m - and this from a government whose budgetary shortfall is such that it wants to postpone Dollars 230m in payments to its pension fund. Even his editor expressed doubts about the size of the damages sought. Mr Mooar, en route one night last December to another crime story, photographed a woman handcuffed to a mail box after she had been pulled over on suspicion of drunken driving. Two policemen who tried to grab his camera in a tussle in which the reporter suffered back injuries were later cleared by an internal police investigation. Mr Mooar's lawyer declared: 'This suit is not about money.' These were exactly the same words used by Ms Jones's lawyer last week, prompting Mr Robert Bennett, Mr Clinton's attorney, to counter-charge: 'This suit is all about money.'</p>

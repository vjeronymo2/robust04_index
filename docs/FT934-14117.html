			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / New car sales forecast to fall RECOVERY in new car sales will be thrown into reverse when next April's company car taxation changes come into effect, according to a forecast yesterday by the Charterhouse banking group. The tax changes will cut company car purchases by 80,000 next year and a further 40,000 in 1995 from this year's levels, says the report's author, Professor James Morrell, the former director of Henley Centre for Forecasting. He says the decline in the company sector will more than offset increased demand from private motorists, so that sales of new cars next year will fall to 1.73m from this year's projected 1.78m, and to 1.72m in 1995. The new system will base the tax payable by an employee on the private benefit of a company car on a percentage of its list price when new, plus any extras. The forecast says many business car users will pay marginally less tax but many others will pay substantially more. Business Forecasts for the Motor Trades to 1998.

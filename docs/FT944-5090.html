			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Soares in clash over Angola aid Mr Mario Soares, Portugal's Socialist president, has clashed with the centre-right government of prime minister Anibal Cavaco Silva over the issue of Angola, Portugal's former colony. Mr Fernando Nogueira, defence minister, tendered his resignation after Mr Soares vetoed the reappointment of General Narcisco Mendes Dias, air force commander, because of alleged military aid to the Angolan government. Mr Cavaco Silva rejected the resignation and officials described the president's veto as 'deeply unjust'. By blocking the reappointment, Mr Soares is holding Gen Mendes Dias responsible for the alleged servicing of Angolan government fighter aircraft by a Portuguese company, damaging Portugal's standing as a neutral arbitrator in Angola's civil war. Newspapers have published details of the military assistance, but the government denies knowledge of the service contracts. However, Mr Nogueira has accepted the resignation of the head of the public-sector company involved, saying the government should have been informed. The dispute is the most serious clash between the president and the government since Mr Soares was elected in 1986 and comes less than a year before the next general election.</p>

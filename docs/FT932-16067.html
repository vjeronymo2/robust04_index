			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: RTZ in Burundi nickel deal RTZ, THE world's biggest mining company, might join the world's select few nickel miners via a long-term agreement signed in London yesterday with the Central African Republic of Burundi. The agreement gives RTZ exploration and potential development rights to half of Burundi's prospective nickel belt which is 300km long and 40km wide in places. This is the first agreement signed by the government of Burundi with a big mining company. However, Burundi is also having talks with Broken Hill Proprietary, Australia's biggest natural resources group, about a potential exploration deal covering the other half of the nickel belt. At present RTZ's only nickel interest is the Empress refinery in Zimbabwe which toll refines about 6,000 tonnes a year of the metal for BCL, Botswana. An RTZ official pointed out that its exploration policy excluded no commodity but the group was interested only in world-class deposits. The deal with Burundi followed an RTZ review of the mining potential in African countries, carried out since 1990. Most of the potential resources are nickel but Burundi also has deposits of gold, phosphate and industrial minerals such as kaolin and cement raw materials.</p>

The department made the decision Thursday [16 February] in  response to President Bill Clinton's Feb. 3 move to end the  19-year-old trade embargo against Vietnam.    Clinton said, "I have made the judgment that the best way to  ensure cooperation from Vietnam and to continue getting the  information Americans want on POWs and MIAs is to end the trade  embargo."    The U.S. business community has hailed the President's  decision, saying the move will open up a new venue for American  goods and investment.    The U.S. United Airlines made a decision on February 3 to  offer flights between Los Angeles and Ho Chi Minh City hours  after the President announced the lifting of the trade embargo  on Vietnam.    The airlines said it would begin service to Vietnam as soon  as it could get government approval.</p>

Further disqualifications will be made if the application is deemed to have serious deficiencies in the technical and/or business plan, if the application does not fall within the overall scope of the Program, or if the application is more appropriately funded by other U.S. or Israeli government-funded research and development efforts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;In the second step, referred to as the ``technical and business review,'' applications are evaluated under the preceding Evaluation Criteria. Applications are rated as ``not recommended'' or ``recommended.'' Applications must have high scientific and technical merit to be recommended. Only those applications rated as ``recommended'' are considered further. Such applications are referred to as ``semifinalists.'' If a majority of either country's representatives rate an application as ``not recommended,'' that application will be disqualified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;In the third step, referred to as ``selection of finalists,'' the Joint Panel will prepare a final scoring and ranking of recommended semifinalist applications, based upon evaluative criteria. A list of ranked finalists is then submitted to each respective nation's Selection Official. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;In the final step, referred to as the ``selection of awardees,'' the Selection Officials select funding recipients from among the finalists, based upon the rank order of the applications on the basis of all Evaluation Criteria (see above), assuring appropriate distribution of funds among technologies, activities and recipients, the availability of funds, and upon a determination as to the responsibility of the applicant. The decision of the Selection Officials is final. Applicants not chosen will be notified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;In the event that a U.S.-Israeli joint venture is ranked as a finalist, but is determined to contain weaknesses in its structure or cohesiveness that may substantially lesson the likelihood of the proposed project's success, the applicant may be informed of the deficiencies and negotiations may be entered into with the applicant in an effort to remedy the deficiencies. If appropriate, funding up to 10% of the amount originally requested by the applicant may be awarded by the Program to the applicant to assist in overcoming the organizational deficiencies, or in the conduct of feasibility studies. If the Program determines within six months that the organizational deficiencies have been corrected, the Program may award over the life of the project the remaining funds requested by that applicant to that applicant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Program reserves the right to negotiate with applicants selected to received awards over the cost and scope of the proposed project, e.g., to add or delete a task in order to improve the probability of success. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Funding Logistics <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _Funding will be made directly to the U.S.-based firm(s) that is/are party to the U.S.-Israel joint venture. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rights to Inventions <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _The provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act (35 U.S.C. &sect;201, et seq., concerning patent rights in inventions made with Federal assistance) and the Government Patent Policy set forth in President Reagan's memorandum to the heads of Executive Departments and Agencies, dated February 18, 1983, shall apply to all Federally-funded research and development activities performed under this Program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other Requirements_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Federal Policies and Procedures <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _Recipients and subrecipients are subject to all Federal laws and Federal and Department of Commerce policies, regulations, and procedures applicable to Federal financial assistance awards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Past Performance <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _Unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal awards may result in an application not being considered for funding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Preaward Activities <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _If applicants incur any costs prior to an award being made they do so solely at their own risk of not being reimbursed by the U.S. Government. Notwithstanding any verbal or written assurance that may have been received, there is no obligation on the part of the Department of Commerce to cover preaward costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

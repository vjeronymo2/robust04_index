			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO FWY TO CLOSE OVERNIGHT  </P> <P> All northbound lanes of the San Diego Freeway between the Santa Ana and Corona  del Mar freeways will be closed at 9 p.m. tonight for construction work,  Caltrans officials said.  </P> <P> The closure is needed so crews can install so-called K-rails, the concrete  barriers that separate traffic from construction work, officials said. The  northbound lanes are scheduled to reopen at 5 a.m. Tuesday. The Santa Ana  Freeway will remain open.  </P> <P> The closure on the San Diego Freeway is part of a widening project that  includes installation of car-pool lanes. A five-mile segment of the northbound  car-pool lane is already open from the Springdale Street bridge in Westminster  to the San Gabriel River Freeway in Seal Beach. The entire project is scheduled  for completion in July, 1990.  </P></p>

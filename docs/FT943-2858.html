			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / International Company News: Dairy Farm to cancel HK listing Dairy Farm International, the food retailing arm of Hong Kong's Jardine Matheson group, yesterday said it would follow Jardine Matheson and withdraw its secondary listing from the Hong Kong stock exchange from March 31 of next year. The decision, widely anticipated, accompanied a disappointing set of interim results. First-half net profit grew 59 per cent, to USDollars 108.4m from USDollars 68.1m in the same period last year. But this was almost wholly reliant on a USDollars 41.8m exceptional item from the sale of a factory site in Hong Kong by its joint venture with Nestle, the Swiss foods group. Turnover rose 11 per cent to USDollars 2.6bn from USDollars 2.4bn, partially lifted by a 2 per cent movement in exchange rates. Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, pointed to severe competition and noted: 'While the overall result for the year will be enhanced by the exceptional gain recorded in the first half, the operating profit is likely to remain at a similar level to 1993'. The interim operating profit was USDollars 63.8m, an increase of 3.7 per cent on last year's USDollars 61.5m. Pre-tax and interest earnings from Asia swelled 17 per cent to USDollars 38m, with Taiwan making its first significant contribution, according to analysts. The group is shortly expected to disclose further ventures in Asian markets, including Indonesia. Earnings from Australasia fell 10 per cent, mainly due to increased operating costs for extended trading hours and start-up costs of the fresh food chain which will complement Franklins. In New Zealand, Woolworths maintained market share but suffered from the industry-wide erosion in margins caused by strong competition. Simago, the Spanish operation, continued as Dairy Farm's biggest bugbear. Continued losses from Simago held back European operations which chalked up a loss of USDollars 7.8m, marginally less than last year's USDollars 8.3m. Earnings per share before the exceptional item were unchanged at 4 US cents; including the exceptional gain earnings per share rose 50 per cent to 5.99 US cents. Directors are proposing a 1.65 US cent dividend, a 6 per cent improvement over the 1.55 US cents paid out last year.</p>

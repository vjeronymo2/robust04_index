			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / International Company News: Gold Fields holds fall to 4% GOLD Fields of South Africa (GFSA), one of the country's leading mining houses, held the decline in earnings in the year to June to 4 per cent in the face of weak commodity markets. Pre-tax profit dropped to R342m (Dollars 123m) from R358m while attributable profit was down at R302m from R314m. Revenue fell to R505m from R518m in 1991 but the decline was attributable to a R20m decline in profit on the realisation of investments. Income from investments  - mostly dividend income from its gold mines  - rose marginally to R289m from R285m while income from fees, interest and other sources also increased  - to R215m from R212m. Gold Fields' main source of income is its large portfolio of investments, mainly in precious metal mining companies. GFSA has the highest exposure to gold of all South Africa's mining houses. Its Driefontein and Kloof gold mines are among the richest in the world. The dividend was maintained at 200 cents per share on earnings of 314 cents.</p>

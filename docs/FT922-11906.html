			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / UK Company News: MTM wins breathing space in refinancing talks MTM, the troubled speciality chemicals group, yesterday announced that it had extended the short-term credit facilities with its bankers until the end of May. They were due to expire on April 30 after the company breached its covenants. The company said discussions were still continuing with a view to securing longer term funding. The two main syndicates are led by Chase Manhattan of the US and Standard Chartered, the international UK-based bank. The company is believed to have debts of about Pounds 70m. Shareholders are still waiting for the company to announce its full-year results. Publication was postponed after BDO Binder Hamlyn, the auditors, refused to sign off the accounts in a dispute about asset values. The company is obliged by Stock Exchange rules to publish the results by June 1.</p>

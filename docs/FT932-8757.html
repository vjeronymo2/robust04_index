			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / World Trade News: EC to push Japan over tariff cuts EUROPE would seek further tariff cuts, especially in processed food, from Japan which in talks in Toronto last week offered a 55 per cent reduction in about 770 industrial products, Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, said yesterday. In an attempt to allay persistent suspicions in Brussels that the Commission is signing deals behind the back of France and other EC governments, Sir Leon said the aim of last Friday's meeting in Toronto with US, Japanese and Canadian negotiators had been 'to try to commit Japan, to a certain extent, to a market access agreement' before the Group of Seven's July summit in Tokyo. Japan's tariff offer on industrial products is 'a step in the right direction', he said, but it did not go far enough, particularly for processed foods. Speaking before meetings with French ministers yesterday, Sir Leon praised last week's French government memorandum on Gatt as setting out 'clearly and in detail' its position, though he was sceptical about the call for new forms of protection against unfair trade. 'I think we have enough instruments; the question is whether the Community wants to use them.' The French memorandum urges the EC to revive its so-called new community instrument. This 1984 provision allows the Community to retaliate unilaterally against unfair trade practices, but has rarely been used for lack of a consensus within the EC council of ministers. Sir Leon said he was counting on a definitive settlement of the US-EC oilseeds dispute next month. Future farm disputes with the US could be avoided, he told the Institute of Political Science in Paris on Sunday night, if the EC reached an overall agricultural agreement with the US and other Gatt partners. Such an agreement would also 'give for the first time explicit recognition' to the EC's form of farmer support, while restricting US as well as EC export subsidies in cereals.</p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HERMOSA TIGHTENS BUILDING RULES BUT WON'T RECONSIDER STRAND HOTEL;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: THE PLANNING COMMISSION WILL REVIEW PLANS FOR ALL NEW BUILDINGS  EXCEPT SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES.  </P> <P> Amid charges that weaknesses in the Hermosa Beach Municipal Code allowed a  controversial beachfront hotel to be approved without public scrutiny, the City  Council on Tuesday broadened its powers to make sure that such projects will no  longer slip by without local review.  </P> <P> Under a new ordinance, every building proposed in the city -- except for  single-family homes and remodeling projects or additions smaller than 1,500  square feet -- will be reviewed by the Planning Commission to ensure that it  will be compatible with the neighborhood.  </P> <P> If the project is likely to lower property values, interfere with the public's  enjoyment of the area, look inappropriate in the neighborhood or adversely  affect the environment, the commission could reject it.  </P> <P> But on a narrow 3-2 vote, the council decided against forcing the developer of  a luxury hotel planned for The Strand to undergo the new hearing process. The  decision cleared the way for Brentwood developer David Greenwood to break  ground late this year on a scaled-down version of the project that has divided  opinion in the city since 1984.  </P> <P> The two decisions stemmed from a longtime debate over what to do with the  city-owned site of the old Biltmore Hotel on The Strand. For 25 years, since  the old hotel was razed, the city has squabbled over what, if any, development  should rise in its place.  </P> <P> Among the ideas was Greenwood's plan to build a five-story, 260-room hotel and  conference center that would cover not only the Biltmore site but the adjacent  1300 block of the beachfront street where the abandoned Strand Bathhouse now  stands. But voters rejected the plan in 1984 amid charges that it would ruin  the city's character, generate traffic and pollution and saddle the city with a  financial albatross.  </P> <P> Greenwood and his former partner, Joe Langlois, scaled back their plans to  include only the Strand Bathhouse block, which Greenwood now owns. As the city  continued to struggle with plans for the Biltmore site, Greenwood presented the  city Building and Safety Department staff with more modest plans for a 172-room  hotel.  </P> <P> Because the project conformed to the city's zoning code, and because the  council had rejected earlier advice from its planning directors to broaden the  city's powers of review, Greenwood needed only a building permit for his  project and the approval of the California Coastal Commission.  </P> <P> Not even an environmental impact review was needed, because Greenwood's  proposal for a larger hotel had already undergone an EIR, and the city could  not legally require a second one for a scaled-down version of the project,  retired Councilman Jim Rosenberger said.  </P> <P> Instead, he said, Greenwood agreed last year to meet 42 conditions that would  have been imposed under the old EIR. Meeting in a closed session -- because the  decision required an opinion from the city attorney -- the council approved  those conditions, Rosenberger said.  </P> <P> Consequently, the public hearing usually required for such large developments  never occurred in Hermosa Beach, and when the Coastal Commission approved the  project this month, it was a surprise to many of the hotel's neighbors.  </P> <P> "This hotel will set the tone for Hermosa Beach, and the people should have a  say in that process," said Councilman Robert Essertier, who led the effort to  belatedly hold a public hearing on the hotel.  </P> <P> However, Councilwoman Kathleen Midstokke warned that the city would be open to  a lawsuit from Greenwood if the council tried to impose new conditions on his  hotel now, with ground breaking only months away. Essertier's proposal died on  a 3-2 vote, with only Councilman Albert Wiemans on his side.  </P> <P> Instead, the council approved a new, broadened hearing process that Planning  Director Michael Schubach suggested last fall. The council had rejected it  then, fearing that it would clog Planning Commission agendas and create a  subjective "art jury" for new development.  </P> <P> However, Councilman Chuck Sheldon, who had earlier charged that the new review  process would "remove any incentive for (commercial) investment in this  community," softened his position and joined Midstokke and Essertier in voting  for the broadened reviews.  </P> <P> Councilmen Roger Creighton and Albert Wiemans opposed the measure. Creighton  said the new layer of reviews will only raise "false hopes" among opponents of  development because the city will still have to prove that there are  substantial problems with a project before it can deny a permit.  </P></p>

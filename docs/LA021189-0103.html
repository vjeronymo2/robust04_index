			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GRANADA HILLS DISPOSES OF TAFT BEHIND BROWN'S 28  </P> <P> Cleveland High Coach Bob Braswell calls him the "Garbage Man."  </P> <P> Taft Coach Jim Woodard chastises him for lack of defensive skills.  </P> <P> Opposing fans poke fun at his bulk (6-5, 250 pounds).  </P> <P> But say what you want about Granada Hills' Alvin Brown, he gets the job done  more often than not.  </P> <P> Friday night, Brown scored a game-high 28 points and grabbed 14 rebounds to  lead the Highlanders to a 68-56 upset of Taft in a North Valley League game at  Granada Hills.  </P> <P> The game meant nothing to Taft (16-5, 6-4 in league play), which has sewn up  second place in the North Valley, but the win moved Granada Hills (13-8, 5-5)  into a tie for third with Kennedy and could give the Highlanders a slightly  weaker first-round opponent when the City Section playoffs open next week.  </P> <P> But how about that Brown?  </P> <P> "Maybe he's not perfect in everything, but I wouldn't trade him," Granada Hills  Coach Bob Johnson said. "He's big and round, and he doesn't jump well, but he  gets the ball in the basket."  </P> <P> Taft's Woodard was slightly less complimentary.  </P> <P> "It's boom, score. Boom, score," said Woodard, lowering his shoulder and  leaning into a reporter, mimicking Brown's play around the basket.  </P> <P> Woodard was also displeased that David Puathasnanon, father of former  Highlander basketball star Sam Puathasnanon, was one of the officials.  </P> <P> Puathasnanon called a charging foul on Taft's Tony Middleton (20 points and a  game-high 17 rebounds) in the fourth quarter, and moments later, after Brown  had "nudged" Middleton off the floor to score a layup, Puathasnanon whistled  Woodard for a technical foul when the latter argued for a foul on Brown.  </P> <P> Brown, who scored 20 points in the second half and was nine of 14 from the  floor and nine of 12 from the free-throw line, converted both foul shots for a  65-54 Highlander lead with 2:07 to play.  </P> <P> Taft had closed to 55-54 midway through the period on a three-point basket by  Middleton, but Granada Hills went on a 13-0 run over the next three minutes to  break the game open.  </P> <P> Toreador guard Dedan Thomas, bound for Nevada Las Vegas, made his first shot  then missed the next eight and finished with two points and 12 assists.  </P></p>

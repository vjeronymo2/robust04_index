			<p>BFN     [Text] As you know, France has become involved in the  Rwandan conflict, with Senegalese soldiers as their sole de  facto African ally on the ground. On the occasion of the  meeting of the franc zone countries in Gabon, a broader stance  was expected from francophone African countries. Stephane  Manier and Philippe Josselin report:    [Mannier] The 14 francophone African heads of state support  France in Rwanda. They approved the humanitarian intervention  in order to please Paris, whose greatest fear was that it would  remain isolated. There is relief even if some reservations have  slipped in behind this apparent unanimity. The final  communique, for instance, uses generalities to approve the  intervention and insists on the authority of the United Nations  as a framework for any African participation. Does African  participation necessarily mean sending in military troops?    [Begin recording] [President Pascal Lissouba] In order to  support the efforts currently under way, yes.    [Mannier] In what framework will these troops be involved?    [Lissouba] In whatever framework. Everything is now  supported by the United Nations. [end recording]    [Mannier] In any case, this will take a long time to  implement, not only because the logistics of this participation  must be finalized--and this is never simple in Africa--but  mainly because it is important to know who will pay:    [Begin Lissouba recording] My country is wrestling with  major  difficulties and we do not have means of transport, we do not  have any equipment, we do not have the necessary logistics for  that, so we are waiting for the United Nations to show  willingness to help us, the United Nations or other countries,  France for instance. [end recording]    [Mannier] In fact, this is fair enough since this Libreville  summit was theoretically devoted to monetary issues and to the  aftermath of the CFA [African Financial Community] franc  devaluation. The francophone African countries pointed out  that, if Paris wanted to be helped, it had to show understanding  toward Africa. The message seems to have been received. This  is the way the best friendships are reinforced.</p>

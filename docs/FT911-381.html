			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / The empire crumbles but the suffering goes on: A look at what is happening to the people now that socialism has broken down even in the proletarian heartlands of the Soviet Union THE BREAKDOWN of socialist society in the Soviet Union, an irreversible and ugly process, is now evident in the proletarian heartlands. Novokuznetsk, once called Stalinsk, the mining and metallurgical centre of Western Siberia, is one example. Like moneylenders in the temple, the new signs of market behaviour and individual enrichment display themselves among the icons of a collapsing power. The slogans of the 1970s, and earlier, (dis)grace every large building: 'The service of the state is the interest of all' and 'Raising the people higher is the aim of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union' and even, interwoven into a socialist realist mural on the side of an apartment building: 'Land to the peasants]" The miners' strike, which ended reluctantly three days ago , had its militant core here in the Kuzbass coalfield. According to Alexander Aslanidi, the man who emerged with Gregory Malykhin as the most articulate exponent of their views, one source of their bitterness is that they feel they cannot trust the government. 'We think it plays political tricks. Even now, the agreement between Yeltsin and Gorbachev is to benefit them, not us.' There is more to it than that, though. The distrust is fuelled by the sheer oppressiveness of the ideology which surrounds lives oppressed already by harsh working conditions, poor, cramped apartments and slop food which is,in any case, available only with coupons. Vast factories like the Kuznets Metal Combine, the ZapSib (West Siberia) steel works and the two aluminium plants disgorge sulphurous smoke into the valley which contains the city. The food in the canteens is greasy: rissoles, rice or mashed potatoes, tepid soup and dry, crumbling bread. The flats - a mixture of Stalin-era gothic and slabs from the 1960s and 1970s, with some fantasy added outside - are typically two or three small rooms, kitchen and bathroom. The old wooden houses, some mere shacks, mostly have outside lavatories. At night, you can hear screaming, desperate rows coming from the stinking stairwells and you walk among stumbling, incoherent drunks on the streets. 'You see, there is something to strike about,' said Alexander Romankov, a young mine manager (who was nevertheless against it). There is, however, another reason for the unrest, which could be the most powerful. Among the Stalinist ikons, the new motto is the old one - 'enrich yourself'. Kuzbass is not like the Ukrainian Donbass field - or, for that matter, South Wales or the Pas de Calais. Many of the mines have rich, thick seams of high quality coal for which there is international demand. They have a market future. But several things have happened simultaneously. First, the centralised control of the Union coal ministry has, like all other such controls, been weakening for some time: indeed, the transfer of control of the Russian mines from Union to Russian Government in the past week was more of a logical, if large, step in an already evident direction than a sudden turnabout. This has meant, for example, that the dozen pits belonging to the Kuznetsugol Combine in Novokuznetsk have been able to trade coal abroad, under license, for some years. Second, decentralisation has impoverished central government. Its foreign debts have ballooned and its exports, especially of oil, have gone down. It is starved of hard currency and takes whatever is earned by the fledgling enterprises. Kuznetsugol, and other combines, have sought to circumvent this by barter - coal for Japanese goods. The Sonys now appearing in the cramped living rooms are nominally available at a subsidised price of Rs2000 (and can be bought on the black market for Rs12,000). The shining new Nissan Patrols and Urvans and Sunnys which litter the Kuznetsugol car park are even more obvious signs of the new affluence. The combine ships them in through Vladivostok, hauls them across Siberia on the railways and sells them to the mines and the miners at highly subsidised prices (after which, of course, the black market takes over). Matters have not stopped here. Some pits have been leased to their workers, who must fulfil the state's output target but can then sell the excess on the market. One pit, Polosuxinskaya, 30 kms from Novokuznetsk, is the first Soviet mine to hand over majority control to a foreign capitalist. It is relatively new and very rich in coal. Two years ago, Igor Gladun, now 43, took over as its director. A short, powerful man of great energy, he saw how the wind was blowing and got rid of its (full time) Communist Party secretary (most enterprises in the town now have, according to Romankov, who has worked in several.) Last year, Gladun sold 55,000 tonnes of his high quality coking coal abroad at Dollars 46 a tonne: this year he hopes to sell 90,000 tonnes at Dollars 50-55. Gladun knew he needed access to Western capital and equipment if he was to make his pit spin real money. At the same time, Morris Cartwright, a British coal trader in his early 50s, was sniffing about in Moscow looking for a new challenge. They were brought together by Valentin Aksilenko, a former Soviet diplomat in Cuba who had set up his own consultancy called Uni-Eko. Last month, an agreement was signed giving Cartwright's company, Britseco, and a Swiss partner, Traiko AG, a majority share of the output of Polosuxinskaya. The deal sets up a new company, valued at Dollars 15m, also includes Gladun, Aksilenko, Kuznetsugol, the local railway concern and the regional soviet (council) at Kemerovo. This company could become very rich. The pit must produce 2.3m tonnes a year for the state but it can sell everything above that - and Gladun reckons he can produce 2.5m tonnes this year. And although only two days were lost to strikes during the wave just ended, he has told his miners they must work hard now they are under capitalist ownership. By chance, Cartwright has now played the role of strikebreaker in two continents: in the British miners' strike of 1984/85, he helped ship coal into the little ports which were still open on the south coast, beating Welsh pickets and getting the coal to power stations. Gladun has marked out a vast area of reserves - 100m tonnes, called Antonov 2  - which is Britseco's to exploit. The core of the deal is that Cartwright will, over the following months, invest heavily in (mainly Western) equipment to drive the roads and set up the faces on Antonov 2. This machinery will then sheer away the thick seams of coking coal, load it onto the railways and wait for the profits to roll in. As simple as that? The infrastructure is bad; and the collective farm beneath whose fields Antonov 2 waits for exploitation is cutting up rough. Gladun says he needs Dollars 4.5m worth of investment right away, but that he cannot get it until Cartwright sees some coal. If Polosuxinskaya does not fail badly, pits like it will receive the same attention and investment. Their workers will be much better off than those around them - who may well become worse off soon, since much of Novokuznetsk has a technological death sentence hanging over it, with cuts looming in work forces and production. Most of Aslanidi's pit delegates know of this. Some may hope to gain others fear to lose. Finally, although the strikes were a product of political collapse. Not only have the Gladuns of Novokuznetsk kicked out their Communist Party secretaries but the party itself, although still in command of the town, is isolated and disliked, especially by the young. A vast statue of Lenin, which should have been completed a decade ago, remains barely started and is hardly likely to swell the mass ranks of its fellows now. An amateur video shot by some local enthusiasts on their (Japanese) video shows snatched, jumpy interviews with citizens who responded to questions about what they thought of the current state of politics. The supporters of the status quo (or the past) were usually on sticks: the young and middle aged were dismissive or contemptuous. On the edge of town, you will find the Preobrazhenie Sobor, or Transfiguration Cathedral. Here worshipped Dostoyevsky. After the revolution it was, in turn, a bakery and a warehouse and was to have been made into a dance hall. The loosening of political control and the rapid rise in the power of the church has meant that its partly burnt structure is now being repaired. Services are taking place although the roof is still being constructed. On Tuesday, about 12 old women, one old man and a young man with long wild hair and beard made up the congregation. A small choir of elderly women chanted the Orthodox service. A youngish priest paraded about with a censer. The heavy, mystical atmosphere - the opposite of, and the antidote to, the triumph of will and reason outside - was evident even in the handful of ageing bodies genuflecting among the sawdust. The Orthodox Church has not come out of its decades of trial as a liberal institution: it has also lost generations of potential faithful and might never recapture future ones in the atomised, urban society. But it, and the Nissan Patrols and Aslanidi's followers and Cartwright's mine, are the elements out of which Novokuznetsk is seeking to restore itself.</p>

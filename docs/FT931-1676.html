			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Zaiteku becomes a tainted custom in Tokyo - Making money from money not production lines has got a bad name ZAITEKU is a tainted word in Tokyo. During the late 1980s, two-thirds of listed Japanese industrial companies indulged in zaiteku - financial engineering that ranged from the innocent exploitation of interest rate differences to massive speculation in the stock market. Japanese companies are still counting the cost of that 'engineering'. Mitsubishi Corporation, the core company of Japan's largest corporate group, this week rescued M. C. Finance, a financial subsidiary, which has Y28bn (Dollars 237m) in unrealised losses on securities investment funds. And two members of the Kosugi family were forced to resign at Kosugi Industry, a textile company which makes Jack Nicklaus brand casualwear. Kosugi is expected to announce heavy consolidated losses for the year to January arising from a stock investment programme begun before the market peaked in late 1989. From the machine tool manufacturers to the great trading houses, zaiteku was an important supplement to operating profits in the late 1980s. It was originally defined as the management of surplus corporate funds, but took on a speculative meaning in the late 1980s, when otherwise conservative companies established aggressive financial subsidiaries. Happy to support zaiteku operations when the stock market was rising, Japanese banks, creaking under the weight of non-performing property loans, are now wary of lending to companies with a zaiteku reputation. And even though many of the better known manufacturers indulged, a post-'bubble' shift of opinion now condemns companies which make money from money and not from their production lines. The banks' tougher line on lending comes as the burden of stock investment losses has risen. Mitsubishi itself had unrealised losses of Y80bn on its Y310bn in securities investment funds as at the end of September. Other large trading houses had similar losses, including Y98bn at Marubeni and Y92bn at Itochu, and all are now attempting to reduce their exposure. But Itochu said not all zaiteku activities were bad, adding companies, such as trading houses, must employ surplus funds as profitably as possible. 'For a trading house, financial dealings are part of the main business, and so we are not going to stop zaiteku. We are reducing securities investment funds, but we will not stop completely,' Itochu said. While the trading houses have the resources, including latent profits on their long-term cross-shareholdings, to cope with losses on investment stocks, the situation is more serious at manufacturers such Nachi-Fujikoshi, a maker of bearings and machine tools. Nachi hoped a stock price recovery would save it the embarrassment of writing off investment losses. But it was forced to report a net loss of Y16.4bn for the year to November and to suspend dividend payments for the first time since 1968. The stock price collapse hit Nachi on two fronts. The parent company had stock appraisal losses of Y7.96bn last year and was also forced to write off Y5.5bn in loans and guarantees for a financial subsidiary. 'Originally, we had no intention to make profits from zaiteku, but two ex-managers were reckless. Of course, we don't want to do any more zaiteku, and we regret what happened in the past,' Nachi said. Mitsubishi adds that M. C. Finance, established in 1986, was not a securities investment company but an umbrella financial company for other subsidiaries and affiliates. It was supposed to borrow large sums at discount rates from banks and pass on the savings to smaller companies, which would otherwise have paid higher interest rates. But M. C. was later encouraged by Mitsubishi management to invest in stocks. As with many other players, an initial windfall prompted even more ambitious forays. Before the stock crash, as a car machinery maker in Nagoya explained, shareholders were asking why a company was not dabbling in stocks to boost profits. Mitsubishi has told M. C. to go back to basics, 'concentrating on core activities of providing financing, accounting and related services' to group companies. The theme is prevalent among manufacturing companies, which confess to having strayed too far into finance and away from their core skills. Some companies which invested in stocks are still unable to accept that they bore full responsibility for the risk involved. Several trading houses are known to be negotiating with trust banks about compensation for losses incurred, negotiations apparently prompted by the trading houses' perception that returns were guaranteed. There is also resentment at the tough line taken by commercial bankers, who fear that risks may be hidden in their customers' books. An executive at a large steelmaker said the banks have become 'obsessed' by property and stock market exposure, and that if 'you use the word zaiteku now, bankers get nervous'. His sentiments were echoed by a finance manager at a leading food manufacturer: 'There is nothing wrong with us issuing commercial paper, depositing the money in a large lot account and reaping the benefit of the difference in interest rates.'</p>

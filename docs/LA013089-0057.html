			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VICTORY! AUCTION IS A THRILLER  </P> <P> Donna Frieden, 34, went shopping Sunday and paid $1,400 for a black fedora.  </P> <P> "This was my birthday present, my Christmas present and my anniversary  present," the Sherman Oaks voice-over artist said. "I'm not going to buy any  clothes for a long time."  </P> <P> This was not just any hat, mind you. This particular headpiece belonged to  superstar Michael Jackson, and Frieden had long coveted one. Several times she  came close to catching the trademark fedora that the performer tossed into the  audience after singing "Billie Jean" in his concerts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Always Wanted His Hat  </P> <P> "I have always wanted to catch the hat at his concerts, but it always went to  the person in front of me or next to me. I've always wanted it so badly," said  Frieden, who attended two concerts in Jackson's 1984 "Victory" tour and three  during his just concluded "Bad" tour.  </P> <P> "I'm not normally star-struck. I don't usually go after things like this, but  Jackson is such an incredible performer."  </P> <P> Frieden was able to buy her heart's desire at an auction in a North Hollywood  warehouse where Enid Jackson sold some of the clothing and memorabilia she won  in a divorce settlement with her ex-husband, Jackie Jackson, Michael's older  brother.  </P> <P> Enid Jackson said she has "warehouses and warehouses full of stuff," belonging  to members of the Jackson clan that she plans to sell because she no longer  wants to pay for its storage and maintenance.  </P> <P> Though Frieden admits that $1,400 is a lot of money to pay for a hat that she  will be "too afraid to wear in public," she said she and her husband agreed she  could bid as high as $1,500 for it.  </P> <P> Most of the Jackson-related items at the auction -- including a silver lame  suit, blue and gold brocade vests, an iridescent jumpsuit, a black and white,  tiger-skin patterned spandex leotard, a turquoise and rhinestone spandex  leotard, a number of belts, pairs of boots, and several gold and platinum  records -- were snapped up by businessmen who hope to capitalize on people's  attraction to stars.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Memorabilia Shop  </P> <P> "A lot of people love anything associated with their favorite artist," said  Paul Scharfman, who purchased several costumes worn by Michael Jackson's  brothers during the Victory tour. Scharfman hopes to resell the items at The  Rock House, a boutique he plans to open on Melrose.  </P> <P> He said he has been planning to open the boutique for 10 years and will feature  clothes and memorabilia from musical stars.  </P> <P> The biggest purchaser of Jackson memorabilia was Brian Murphy, director of  memorabilia artwork and display for the Hard Rock Cafe. Murphy spent about  $12,000 for more than a dozen Jackson items, which he said will be used to  decorate the cafe's London restaurant, and branches under completion in  Washington and Boston.  </P> <P> Murphy said he attributes much of the famous restaurant chain's success to the  power of music memorabilia to draw large numbers of people.  </P> <P> As she watched strangers bidding for costumes she helped design for her  ex-husband and former brothers-in-law, Enid Jackson took it all in stride.  </P> <P> "I have pictures and I have memories that no one can take away," she said.  </P></p>

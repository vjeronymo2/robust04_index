			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> MISTRIAL IN DRUG CASE OF EX-TIMES WORKER  </P> <P> A Superior Court trial in Santa Ana ended in mistrial when jurors voted 11 to 1  Tuesday to acquit a former Los Angeles Times employee on a charge of dealing  cocaine at the company's Orange County facility.  </P> <P> Shawn Daugherty, 34, of Riverside is the third to go to trial of 20 employees  arrested at the Costa Mesa plant on Jan. 31, 1989, in an Orange County  Sheriff's Department undercover operation conducted in cooperation with The  Times.  </P> <P> The trial of Carlito Carles, 33, also ended in mistrial with a 10-2 jury vote  for acquittal. He later pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge, defense  attorney Milton C. Grimes said. The other, Artis Grigsby, 45, was acquitted,  Grimes said.  </P> <P> Two others -- Rudolph Maduena, 48, and Paul Hendricks, 35 -- have pleaded  guilty to felony drug charges, Grimes said. All of the employees were fired by  The Times.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Ronald E. Owen, who declared the mistrial Tuesday in the  Daugherty case, set a May 11 date for prosecutors to determine whether he will  be retried. Grimes argued to jurors that Daugherty had been the victim of  entrapment by a Times employee, who was cooperating with the authorities in the  undercover operation.  </P> <P> "This guy asked my client six to seven times to get cocaine for him, and  finally he agreed," Grimes said. "But it was clearly a case of entrapment, and  no jury is ever going to see it any other way."  </P> <P> Grimes represents seven others of the 20. Those cases are still pending.

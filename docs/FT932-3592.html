			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / French bank reform backed THE French National Assembly has approved the Balladur government's proposals to reform the statutes of the Bank of France so it can become an independent central bank in keeping with the terms of the Maastricht treaty, Alice Rawsthorn writes from Paris. Despite opposition from hardliners in the Socialist opposition and from Gaullist nationalists within the centre-right coalition government, the National Assembly voted to accept the proposed reforms by an overwhelming majority. Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, will on Wednesday present the final proposals for the new Bank of France legislation to the council of ministers. Under the new law the term of office of the governor and two deputy governors of the bank will last for six years and can be renewed once.</p>

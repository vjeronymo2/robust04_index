			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: Reduced interest costs behind Greencore rise Greencore Group, the Irish sugar, malting and milling group, achieved a 15 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 19.5m (Pounds 19.03m) for the half year ended April 1. The improvement reflected a 54 per cent reducution in net interest charges to IPounds 2.95m, which Mr Kevin O'Sullivan, finance director, said had been achieved through strong cash flow, lower working capital requirements and lower Irish short-term interest rates. Turnover fell from IPounds 203.54m to IPounds 194.21m, a decline of 4.6 per cent, while operating profits slipped 6 per cent to IPounds 20.6m partly because of poor weather conditions in the spring which affected demand for products from the company's agribusiness division, and difficult trading conditions in the malting business which saw operating profits in the malting and flour division fall by 19.5 per cent to IPounds 4m. Mr Gerry Murphy, chief executive, said the company's sugar and flour businesses were performing strongly, with sales and operating profits up in the core Irish market. However, he saw no improvement in the market for malt 'for 12 to 18 months'. He firmly defended last month's decision to acquire HDM, a Belgian malting company for IPounds 2.6m, saying that it had 'state-of-the-art' facilities which would require no additional capital investment and which had been bought at a knock-down value. The two plants have a combined 100,000 tonne capacity a year which Mr Murphy said would be brought on line 'as market conditions permit', starting with the Benelux countries. Greencore also announced that it was increasing its stake in Kears, a UK bakery associate, from 30 per cent to 50 per cent for a consideration of IPounds 8m. Mr Murphy said the two investments would have a 'significant impact' on the group's business by 1995-96. Further acquisitions in the milling and malting divisions were under review in the EU, central Europe and North America. At the half year end gearing stood at 41 per cent (77 per cent) and was expected to drop to 15 per cent by the end of the financial year. Mr Murphy said Greencore had the financial strength to borrow up to IPounds 100m to fund further acquisitions. Earnings per share emerged at 19.2p (17p) and the interim dividend is being lifted to 3.7p (3.3p). COMMENT The half-year downturn in operating profits looks largely seasonal and should not disguise the strong cash flow which is producing healthy earnings growth and a solid balance sheet. This is a good platform from the management's expansion plans and earnings per share for the full year of 37p, up 6p, is now easily within reach, giving a prospective p/e of 9.6. This is lower than some other large stocks in the sector yet Greencore's potential for growth is somewhat higher than theirs.</p>

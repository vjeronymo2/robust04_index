			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PICTORIALIST'S ART OF '20S-'30S AT JAPANESE CENTER  </P> <P> An exhibit that evokes a long-gone era of Japanese culture opens May 21 at the  Japanese American Cultural and Community Center.  </P> <P> "The Photography of Teikoh Shiotani," through July 12, features 53 images from  the '20s and '30s by the Japanese pictorialist whose images have been compared  to those of Jacques Henri-Lartigue.  </P> <P> "The show contains mostly landscapes and genre scenes," said Robert Hori,  director of the center's Doizaki Gallery. "Shiotani was from Tottori  Prefecture, a province on the coast, so there are a lot of scenes of fishing  and the sea. The area also featured large sand dunes, which he photographed."  </P> <P> Shot in soft focus, many of the sepia-toned pictures look like etchings, Hori  said.  </P> <P> "They are very nostalgic and I think the many older Japanese-Americans living  here will appreciate that feeling. There's a sense of a Japan that doesn't  exist anymore, an agrarian and pre-industrial Japan. There's a serenity that  you don't see nowadays."  </P> <P> Shiotani's works fell into obscurity until the early 1980s when interest in  Pictorialism was renewed. However, toward the end of his career, he received  highest honors at Photokina, a major international photographic exhibition,  which won the artist recognition as a world-class photographer, Hori said.  </P> <P> REBUILDING: Pauli DeWitt has been named executive director of the Woman's  Building. She succeeds Terry Wolverton, who recently resigned to write a book.  </P> <P> DeWitt, who assumed the post this week, was executive director of the Napa  County Arts Council and previously associated with the Oklahoma Arts Council.  </P> <P> "DeWitt had all the different kinds of expertise we were looking for, a long  history in arts management and a real effervescence and enthusiasm for the  position," said Wolverton.  </P> <P> JUST LIKE NEW: Eight artists have been awarded $500 each to restore their  murals in the Emergency Relief Fund for Mural Restoration sponsored by the  Social and Public Art Resource Center. The artists are Wallace (Rip) Cronk,  Larry Gruda, Arthur Mortimer, Frank Romero, Ann Thierman, Richard Wyatt, Emily  Cordova and Henry Brown III.  </P> <P> ON THE AIR: The Museum of Contemporary Art is broadcasting its experimental  radio series, "The Territory of Art," over station KCRW-FM (89.9) through the  summer on Tuesdays at 7 p.m.  </P> <P> The radio programs, most of which have been previously aired, are half-hour  performances of contemporary music, poetry, comedy, drama and various forms of  "audio art" such as poetic collages of language, music and sound. They are  created by painters, poets, playwrights, actors, dancers, composers, musicians  and other artists.  </P> <P> Some upcoming programs include "Border-X-Frontera," on Tuesday, by Gomez-Pena  and David Schein; "Catalyst to an Image," on May 23, by four photographers; and  "Song of Lawino," on May 30, based on the poetry of Okot p'Bitek.  </P> <P> A series of new radio works will be broadcast on KCRW beginning in October.  </P> <P> STUDY HARD: The J. Paul Getty Trust has awarded another round of research  grants and fellowships to 22 art history and humanities scholars from around  the world. Fifteen scholars who received their doctorates within the past six  years were each awarded $23,000 fellowships for a year of research and writing.  Seven scholars who are beyond the postdoctoral level received 1989 grants of  varying amounts to pursue advanced research projects.  </P> <P> In the former category, the America-based winners are Hilary Ballon, S.

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Associates boost for Rowe Evans THE CONTINUATION of firm palm oil prices and increasing crops from its Indonesian estates, helped profits at Rowe Evans Investments advance from Pounds 1.88m to Pounds 6.08m pre-tax in 1992. The result was boosted by a Pounds 3.4m contribution from associates, because of their better trading results, a land disposal by Bertam Holdings and the sale of a Malaysian estate-owning subsidiary by Lendu Holdings. Turnover improved to Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 3.93m) while trading profits advanced from Pounds 938,000 to Pounds 2.42m. Earnings per share worked through at 9.63p, compared with 2.71p, and the proposed final dividend is being doubled to 2p. The company said that 1993 oil palm crops were expected to show a marked increase over 1992 levels.</p>

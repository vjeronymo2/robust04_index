			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Election gains for Japan's LDP after party split JAPAN'S RULING Liberal Democratic party delivered a telling display of its resilience by increasing its strength in elections to the Tokyo metropolitan assembly yesterday. The main opposition parties were devastated by the rise of the Japan New party, a conservative group formed last year, which might occupy a pivotal role as a potential coalition partner after the July 18 general election. The results came at the end of a week in which the LDP has undergone its most serious split since it rose to power 38 years ago, with 56 LDP parliamentarians breaking away to form two new parties. The Tokyo vote suggests that the general election, called after the LDP's defeat in a no-confidence motion 10 days ago, will be extremely closely fought. The main losers from the LDP's fracture might be the socialist opposition, which may see its urban support decline markedly as voters switch to new conservative parties. About 9.3m people, almost 10 per cent of Japan's voting population, were eligible to vote in the Tokyo elections, the first test of the LDP's standing since the no-confidence vote. The results for the 128-seat city assembly throw into question the widespread assumption that the LDP could be defeated in the general election by a coalition of non-communist opposition parties, including the LDP defectors. The LDP increased its strength in the Toyko assembly from 42 to 44 seats in the face of the deepest recession for 20 years, outcry over a string of recent corruption scandals and last week's split. The LDP's performance is all the more remarkable because the opposition coalition has claimed it will rise to power by representing younger, cosmopolitan voters in urban areas. The LDP vote is even more robust in provincial and rural areas. The Japan New party of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, a former regional governor, increased its standing to 20 seats from two before the election. The JNP rose by taking seats from the socialist opposition, splitting the non-LDP vote. The JNP has refused to join the opposition coalition fighting the general election, but will not co-operate with the LDP. The Tokyo vote suggests that the Social Democratic party might be the main loser from the rise of the new conservative parties. The SDP lost 18 of its 32 Tokyo assembly seats.

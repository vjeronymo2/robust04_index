			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   Minister Modise's Gagging of Newspaper -- "Strange, is it  not, that within weeks of taking office, an ANC Minister should  seek to gag a newspaper in precisely the same way as his  Nationalist predecessors did," questions the Johannesburg THE  STAR in English on 13 June in a page-10 editorial. "The  interdict which Joe Modise sought last week against the WEEKLY  MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN bore the hallmarks of many previous similar  actions by the old regime -- obsessive secrecy over defence and  a knee-jerk reaction to stop matters of legitimate public  concern being aired." "We do not know the merits or demerits of  the spies' case, and still less about the Minister's motives.  What does not augur well is that the new Government should slip  so easily into the ways of the old and trample so readily over  the public's right to be informed."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   Minister Modise's Gagging of Newspaper -- "The bid by  Minister of Defence Mr Joe Modise to use apartheid's apparatus  to muzzle a newspaper is deplorable," begins the Johannesburg  SOWETAN in English on 13 June in a page-6 editorial. "It seemed  rather odd when the former MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the  Nation; ANC military wing] commander brought an interdict in the  Supreme Court last week to prevent the WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN  from publishing revelations by former CCB [Civil Cooperation  Bureau] members. He was rightly condemned by his own party for  seemingly attempting to cover up past covert operations of the  SADF [South African Defense Force]." "We hope the ANC's  criticism of Modise is a signal to other ministers that  cover-ups and a lack of transparency in government will not be  tolerated."</p>

			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES : DOWNTOWN  </P> <P> When Gillian Theobald draws twin, abstract tree trunks on two sheets of paper,  the images play conceptual games about seeing and perception. Skin-smooth tree  trunks float on the page, solid from the ground up, sensuously rounded with  thick limbs that recall the human body. As the image shifts from left to right,  the ground goes from light to dark and the image flips front to back. Rendered  in charcoal, the black-on-black drawing is a hard-to-see, image of intriguing  subtlety.  </P> <P> A large part of this exhibit is devoted to a "Diary Project" begun in 1982.  It's a series of 309 self-portrait drawings. Many were done without a mirror.  Small liberties with what is observable -- like orange flames that ignite the  face -- describe the artist's state of mind. The drawings have the feel of Zen  exercises that encourage repetitive small rituals to achieve a new  consciousness. They have a plodding, systematic sensibility. Taken together  they are strangely static, even when dipping into the potent realm of  psychological balance. Most often the face is vacant and the drawing  graphically direct. It's only in the context of the whole that a tentative  sense of the artist can be felt. That may be intended to raise questions about  art's ability to actually represent reality, but the formula seems slanted to  arrive at a negative conclusion. (Cirrus, 542 S. Alameda St., to June 24.)  Suvan Geer  </P></p>

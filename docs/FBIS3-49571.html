			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Nikola Koljevic, vice president of the </F> republic of Srpska, by Slobodan Kovacevic in Pale on 10 January  -- live]    [Excerpts] [Kovacevic] We shall now be talking to Nikola  Koljevic, vice president of the Serbian Republic. Like  President Radovan Karadzic, he has had a strenuous day today, a  day without a break.    Professor Koljevic, you did not even have time for a break.  You are waiting to join the deputies in the assembly hall any  minute now. We should clarify a couple of things first. We are  interested in new details regarding the talks with the UN  special envoy Akashi. We informed the listeners of Belgrade  Radio in the main newscast that all problems, misunderstandings,  all Muslims' tricks about his arrival in Sarajevo were clarified  at the very beginning of the meeting.    [Koljevic] Yes, this moment is exceptionally dramatic,  especially regarding foreign affairs. I think that it would not  be an exaggeration to say that we are indeed dealing with war  and peace, with the issue of war and peace. How important Mr.  Akashi's visit is is evident from several details. He landed  yesterday, not at Sarajevo airport, but at another place,  because he was prevented. The airport runway was damaged by a  Muslim shell. Despite this he came here. You see that he  considered this very important. Second, he has assumed an  extremely important role in relieving Mr. Stoltenberg of the  burden of civilian matters in this sector of the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Third, he arrived in Pale today and brought  us a very encouraging piece of news, namely that UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Force] is currently engaged in civilian  administration to a significantly greater degree, at least in  the Sarajevo region. Therefore, the military option is further  and further away. It is increasingly more a matter of  individual irresponsible politicians from, I would say, Europe.  Regarding the United Nations, we were today given firm  guarantees that there will be no military interference, military  intervention without their permission, that they are not in  favor of it at all, and that they expect a peace agreement.    Finally, he also brought us news from Bonn that the talks  between [Bosnian President] Izetbegovic and [Croatian President]  Tudjman continued, that they had a long dispute about central  Bosnia last night, about the enclaves of Travnik, Vitez, and the  Lasva valley, that these differences have probably been overcome  today, and that some progress has been made in Bonn.    Regarding the Serbian side, we gave him guarantees that we  are ready to sign peace, that we will adopt a platform on that  today, that under certain conditions we are ready to place some  communes of former Sarajevo, excluding Pale, under UN  administration. Therefore, things are moving in a positive  direction, although they do not look all that great in reality.  As you know, there has been some heavy fighting, some strong  attacks, especially on Grbavica in Sarajevo and fierce clashes  in central Bosnia. [passage omitted]    [Kovacevic] Professor Koljevic, can you give us some other  details. How successful were the talks that were conducted  during the first visit by the new UN coordinator Akashi?    [Koljevic] Relatively speaking -- everything is relative and  can only be compared with what happened in the past -- the talks  were exceptionally successful. We received the news today from  the Croatian media and from Bonn that there is a possibility of  a Muslim-Croatian union being created. We are not opposed to  this at all, because we consider this to be a democratic right  of both the Croatian and the Muslim peoples. Of course, we  retain the right for the Serbian people to democratically decide  in what way they want to be linked with these two republics of  the former Bosnia-Herzegovina.    We here even considered a wider, more global approach. We  considered offering to the European Union a possibility of  creating a confederation on the territory of the former  Yugoslavia, in which all individual regions that have separated  themselves could freely and democratically chose the way they  want to participate in an association or a confederation of  Yugoslav states.    Therefore, everyone would be able to decide democratically  whether he wants a monetary union, or only a customs union,  whether he wants firm federal links. This would be a completely  democratic solution in line with the current European trend of  integration of certain regions and, of course, their free choice  regarding their political sovereignty. [passage omitted]    [Kovacevic] As we said, in about half an hour you will join  the deputies in the assembly hall to discuss the platform for  the continuation of the Geneva talks. You resolutely said that  if there is no real wish for peace, if the so-called Geneva  peace remained here in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, nothing  will come of Geneva.    [Koljevic] We think that we should decidedly demonstrate to  Europe, which saw how much we favor peace, that we want peace,  if such peace can be established. If peace cannot be  established, we can no longer fool our own people. The Serbs  will not agree to the further procrastination of a solution.  The Serbs can decide to fight to the end, but would much prefer  an end to the fighting. However, people are not prepared for a  third alternative, as could have been seen in the assembly today.    I think that a platform will be adopted today, although it  is  difficult to predict things. I think that it will be peaceful  and constructive. I think that demands set to us so far will  also be discussed. I hope that under certain conditions the  deputies will accept the postponement of the solution, that is,  accept the UN protectorate in Sarajevo for two years at the  most. Third, I think that a very important thing for us in the  platform, after percentages, would be the make possible the  exchange of quality for quantity, something we insisted on in  the past. We think that other parties are also interested in  it. Regarding other matters, it remains to be seen what will  happen because the deputies will voting on them.</p>

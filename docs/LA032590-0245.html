			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SIMMONS BATTLES 'RAIDER' LABEL IN BID FOR LOCKHEED  </P> <P> Harold C. Simmons is trying to take control of Lockheed Corp., the aerospace  giant based in Calabasas, but he doesn't like being called a "takeover  specialist."  </P> <P> "I am not a takeover specialist," he said, responding at a recent New York news  conference to a question that characterized him as a corporate raider. "I am a  builder of companies."  </P> <P> The distinction is crucial.  </P> <P> In recent years, high-yield, high-risk junk bonds have been used to finance  many corporate takeovers, but with the growing unpopularity of the bonds in the  past year, many outsiders trying to seize control of big companies have had to  find other methods. Simmons has chosen to go the way of the proxy fight.  </P> <P> And that means that he must persuade a majority of the shareholders that he is  not an enemy -- not a raider -- and that he and his colleagues can run Lockheed  better and more profitably than its present managers. The results will be  announced Thursday at the company's annual meeting.  </P> <P> Before then, the Texas financier hopes to emphasize another image: that of a  master strategist who develops the companies that he acquires. The effort is a  key part of his campaign.  </P> <P> Simmons' rejection of the "raider" label at the New York news conference was  also revealing because he did not -- at that moment -- support his assertion  with details of his business record or his management philosophy. In fact,  Simmons appeared ill at ease. He is, by his own admission, shy in the  spotlight.  </P> <P> He professes to be comfortable in boardrooms and in one-on-one chats with  individual reporters. He acknowledged during a recent interview: "I've had  stage fright in the past, and I still have it. . . . I don't like to make  speeches, and I (generally) don't accept speaking engagements because I'm not a  good speaker."  </P> <P> </P> <P> On the Road  </P> <P> But despite his discomfort, he clearly recognizes the need to woo shareholders  and has hit the road to meet Wall Street analysts and Lockheed's institutional  investors. Much depends on his ability to perform effectively in the larger  forums, gatherings of pension fund managers and other holders of large blocks  of Lockheed stock.  </P> <P> "This (campaigning) is certainly different," Simmons said in the interview. "I  didn't expect to be doing this and I don't like it."  </P> <P> The question-and-answer sessions at the shareholder meetings present  opportunities for Simmons to both score and stumble. He has a history of  controversy over things that he has done and said -- things he says were  misunderstood.  </P> <P> There are lawsuits and financial failures in Simmons' past, but the companies  that he now controls have generally performed well, many Wall Street analysts  say.  </P> <P> The Simmons empire is vast. He has either a controlling interest or 100%  ownership in 17 companies, 13 of them incorporated. It is a diverse dominion  that includes firms offering products as varied as furniture and roast beef  sandwiches, wire fencing and oil field services.  </P> <P> The Simmons corporate collection is of Byzantine complexity and is better  understood when charted on paper. Simply put, all of his companies are owned or  controlled by Contran Corp., which is 100% owned by a family trust that Simmons  controls. The trust is the treasure chest of his empire.  </P> <P> The major jewel is a Dallas-based holding company called Valhi Inc., under  whose umbrella are seven companies. Among them are Amalgamated Sugar Co.;  Baroid Corp., an oil field services firm, and NL Industries, a Houston-based  chemical company.  </P> <P> In all, the value of the Simmons trust's holdings has been pegged at $1.9  billion, making him one of the nation's wealthiest people, according to a 1989  Forbes magazine survey. He has five homes, including a 24-acre estate in  Montecito, near Santa Barbara, that he bought from actor Gene Hackman.  </P> <P> Simmons, 58, was brought up in extremely modest circumstances. He first became  well-known by borrowing to acquire a chain of drugstores in Texas in the 1960s  and establishing himself in the insurance business. He lost much of his wealth  in a series of financial reversals and legal entanglements in the 1970s, then  rebounded by making big gains in the stock market and by acquiring and  retaining control of a number of companies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Humble Beginnings  </P> <P> Recognition of his success is important to Simmons. The inadvertent omission of  his name from one annual listing of billionaires in Forbes magazine prompted  Simmons to protest with dry humor in a letter to the magazine's editor:  </P> <P> "Since your last issue about billionaires omitted my name, I have been  embarrassingly besieged by calls from my friends wanting to know what financial  catastrophe has befallen me."  </P> <P> Simmons is clearly proud of his climb up the financial ladder. The rise is  chronicled in biographical material he has had prepared. It describes his  upbringing by his parents, both grade school teachers, in a home without indoor  plumbing in tiny, rural Golden, Tex.  </P> <P> "Some of Golden's old-timers remember Harold as the shy Simmons boy who was  thoughtful and mentally quick," the biography states.  </P> <P> At another point it says: "His success in acquiring companies and investing are  legendary."  </P> <P> But before that legend began to grow, Simmons had his troubles. Borrowing  heavily in the 1960s, he built a chain of 100 drugstores in Texas, then sold  the chain to another drugstore group, Jack Eckerd Corp., for $50 million in  Eckerd stock in 1973. Under the agreement, he was prohibited from selling the  stock for one year.  </P> <P> The value of the stock plunged to about $14 million in 1974, leaving him in  dire straits. His banks even canceled his credit cards.  </P> <P> At about the same time, state investigators accused him of looting and  bankrupting his two Texas insurance companies, and he was hauled into court.  Then he was indicted by a federal grand jury in Chicago on charges of mail and  securities fraud in connection with the collapse of his Illinois insurance  company. The courts found in his favor in all three cases, but there were  millions of dollars in losses and legal fees.  </P> <P> Simmons now says he borrowed too heavily during that period.  </P> <P> The experience "made me more conscious of how much I borrow, the terms under  which I borrow and what I borrow for," he said. "It helped my self-confidence  to come through bad times."  </P> <P> Simmons brought himself back to financial health by playing the market,  successfully buying and selling stock in a variety of industries for large  profits. More recently, the Valhi holding company has been Simmons' principal  profit vehicle. It announced a 20% increase in earnings in 1989. Net income for  1989 was a record $103.4 million on revenue of $2.4 billion, compared to the  previous record of $85.9 million on revenue of $2.3 billion in 1988.  </P> <P> Valhi owns 66% of Houston-based NL Industries, one of the world's largest  producers of additives used in paints, inks, adhesives and cosmetics. Simmons  acquired the controlling interest in NL for Valhi in a hostile takeover in  1986.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Proxy Challenge  </P> <P> Now NL has become Simmons' vehicle for his effort to gain control of Lockheed.  The chemical company owns 18.9% of Lockheed's stock, the largest stake in the  aerospace firm.  </P> <P> Although Simmons had been buying and selling significant amounts of Lockheed  stock for about a year, NL did not officially launch its proxy challenge until  March 12. Simmons had indicated that he would mount the attack in January, when  Lockheed refused to allow NL to place six representatives on Lockheed's board.  </P> <P> Simmons had demanded representation on the board after Lockheed reported a  decline in earnings in 1989. Lockheed, citing losses associated with cost  overruns on fixed-price Defense Department contracts, posted earnings of $2  million on sales of $9.9 billion, compared to a profit of $624 million on sales  of $10.4 billion a year earlier.  </P> <P> Simmons has contrasted the performance of NL Industries with that of Lockheed,  noting that NL's stock price has more than doubled since 1986, when he gained  control, while Lockheed's stock price has dropped about $15 since last April.  He is also quick to cite earnings reports that show NL's 1989 profit of $172.9  million on sales of about $1 billion, compared to a $162.9-million profit on  sales of about $1 billion in 1988.  </P> <P> Lockheed has responded by raising questions about Simmons' ability, intentions  and integrity. For example, in a March 5 letter to shareholders, the company  noted that Simmons was "found by a court to have violated his fiduciary duties"  in his handling of the pension fund at Keystone Consolidated Industries, a  Dallas-based steel and wire-fence maker that he controls.  </P> <P> Keystone had been experiencing financial losses and difficulties in keeping its  pension fund adequately funded before Simmons acquired the company in the early  1980s.  </P> <P> The case involved shifts of assets Simmons made between Keystone's pension fund  and other Simmons companies. In 1983 and 1984, he moved about $15 million in  real estate assets from his other companies into the pension fund and used $15  million of the pension fund money to help finance his takeover of Amalgamated  Sugar. The court frowned on the moves because federal regulations stipulate  that all contributions to pension funds are to be made in cash or guaranteed  assets like government bonds. They also require that those who control assets  belonging to others act solely for the benefit of pension plan members and not  in their own interest.  </P> <P> However, the court also found that Simmons' violation was not willful and that  the shifts were "good faith" actions involving sound business judgment. Under  terms of a settlement with the court in 1985, Simmons admitted no wrongdoing  and was enjoined from violating any other provisions of federal pension fund  law for eight years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Simmons Defended  </P> <P> Since then, Simmons has claimed that if the court had not reversed the asset  shifts, the pension fund would have benefited substantially because the value  of the real estate increased.  </P> <P> Many associates -- former Keystone Chairman J. Walter Tucker, for example --  defend Simmons, saying that Keystone's performance has improved under his  guidance.  </P> <P> Tucker said Simmons' backing of a decision to modernize a mill in Peoria, Ill.,  was significant. With more efficient plant facilities, Keystone recorded  earnings of about $12 million in 1989, he said. Ironically, however, mechanical  problems associated with the mill, which was completed in March, 1988,  contributed to a $24-million loss at Keystone that year, according to the  company's annual report.  </P> <P> Other Simmons associates note two successful spinoffs by Simmons companies.  </P> <P> Keycon, once a unit of Keystone, was converted into a separate company in 1984  and later placed under the Valhi umbrella. A 1989 Forbes survey of corporate  spinoffs found that, of the companies studied, Keycon stock experienced the  greatest increase in value between 1984 and 1988.  </P> <P> The other example involves oil field services operations that were part of NL  Industries until a December, 1988, spinoff, when the business was reconstituted  as a separate firm called Baroid Corp. Since the spinoff, Baroid shares have  also increased in value.  </P> <P> Simmons has been citing his successes in talks to groups of financial analysts  and institutional investors around the country. However, in many forums, he  allows NL Industries President J. Landis Martin, who seems more comfortable in  the limelight, to do most of the talking.  </P> <P> Standing stiffly and speaking in his rapid-fire Texas accent, Simmons recently  told investors in New York that Lockheed had erred by diversifying too heavily  away from its "core" business of defense and aerospace contracting.  </P> <P> "We do not allow investments to linger in areas that do not give an adequate  return," Simmons said. "We know how to deploy our capital. . . . We do that  better than Lockheed."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lingering Controversy  </P> <P> However, Lockheed's managers have said the company's diversified operations are  producing acceptable profits, contending that Simmons doesn't understand  Lockheed. They defend as wise their moves to increase the proportion of  Lockheed's revenues that come from non-defense sectors, pointing to the  declining Pentagon budget.  </P> <P> They have also raised questions about Simmons' intentions, suggesting that he  might sell off valuable Lockheed operations. Lockheed executives have described  their operations as interdependent, saying certain units rely on the technology  and expertise of others to develop products and attract business.  </P> <P> "We don't know what he (Simmons) plans to do," Lockheed Chairman Daniel M.  Tellep said in a recent interview. "If someone started breaking it (Lockheed)  up . . . parts couldn't help each other. Any split-up diminishes the value of  the whole."  </P> <P> Simmons says he has boosted the value of his companies by eliminating  "under-performing" units. He insists that he would put certain Lockheed  operations on the block only if he were unable to make them more profitable.  And he bristles at any implication that he buys companies just to make  quick-and-easy profits by selling off parts.  </P> <P> He is still haunted by a controversy over remarks that he made in an Oct. 6  interview published in the Woodland Hills-based Daily News. According to the  report, Simmons said he hoped to sell his shares in Lockheed and had been  feigning interest in taking over the company to mislead arbitragers Such  speculators buy stock of takeover targets, driving up the price and hoping to  profit from the increase.  </P> <P> "You've got to put out misinformation if you really want to buy something for a  fair price," Simmons was quoted as saying.  </P> <P> Immediately after publication of the article, Simmons said he made the remark  in jest, an assertion that he continues to make.  </P> <P> With staff to help him guard against mistakes and associates to encourage him,  Simmons is out on the potentially hazardous public speaking circuit again. And  he says he's encouraged by the response that he has received from Lockheed  investors.  </P> <P> Still, there's not much immediate gratification for Simmons.  </P> <P> "I don't like to campaign," he said. "I do it reluctantly."  </P> <P> But if the shy billionaire's effort succeeds on Thursday, it will all have been  worth it.  </P> <P> HAROLD SIMMONS' EMPIRE  </P> <P> HAROLD SIMMONS FAMILY TRUSTS  </P> <P> CONTRAN CORP.: 100%  </P> <P> Valhi Inc.: 88%  </P> <P> Keystone Consolidated: 52%  </P> <P> Flight Proficiency: 100%  </P> <P> National City Lines: 86%  </P> <P> NOA Inc.: 100%  </P> <P> Southwest La.

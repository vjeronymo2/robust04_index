			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Colette Braeckman: "Rwanda, Burundi: The </F> Deterioration"]    [Text] In Rwanda and Burundi, there had been signs of hope.  After three years of war, but also after the opening up to a  multiparty system, the Arusha agreements accepted by all the  Rwandan protagonists, had laid the foundations for a fairer  distribution of power, for a peaceful transition to democratic  elections.    The United Nations, which is now so reluctant to be involved  on multiple fronts, had agreed, at Belgium's insistence, to  sponsor the peace process. In Burundi, exemplary democratic  elections had brought to power FRODEBU [Burundi Democratic  Front] headed by President Ndadaye, a moderate.    In both cases, the change was dramatically interrupted  despite the fact that peaceful transitional structures existed  and that a "civilian society" -- free press, human rights  defense associations -- were becoming increasingly active.    What therefore happened to bring about the failure of  reforms  and national reconciliations amid bloodshed? In both cases, we  have witnessed the obstinacy of the ruling political class,  which refused to give up or share power. For the Burundian  Army, or at least for the most radical of its officers, there  was no question of seeing a Hutu become president. In Rwanda,  in President Habyarimana's entourage, a group of political  racketeers who benefited more from war than from peace grew up,  and they did not intend to share the "national cake" with other  regional or ethnic groups and were even more intransigent than  the defunct president himself.    In addition to these internal obstacles, the external  context  is not very favorable to democracy: In Uganda, President  Museveni is the determined opponent of a multiparty system which  he regards as a source of tribal struggles. Is there any need  to recall the interminable crisis which has paralyzed  neighboring Zaire, making it impossible to implement the  resolutions of the national conference? Paradoxically, (but is  it really unintentional paradox?) the violent chaos which  currently reigns in Rwanda is strengthening the position of the  region's "strong men" who are becoming synonymous with stability.    The hopes of the nineties have misfired in Africa, and, in  many countries on the continent, democracy has been wiped out,  less because of a so-called immaturity on the part of the  peoples than because of the refusal of the leadership classes to  bow to the verdict of the polls or majority rule. It is also  because of the faintheartedness of the "Western friends" who  were arguing for change but without having the courage to  effectively support those who believed in their democratic  statements.    The power vacuum, the political crisis in these two African  great lakes countries are now forcing the Western countries, and  more especially Belgium, the former colonial power and the  leader in terms of cooperation, to face their responsibilities.    Brussels, in the framework of the United Nations, has  already  started to play a positive role in Rwanda, but it has tragically  abandoned the Burundian democrats, turning a deaf ear to the  appeals from Bujumbura at a time when a rapid intervention would  have saved thousands of civilians, Hutus and Tutsis. It is true  that Belgium was not stingy in its humanitarian assistance after  the event.    Today, the same choices face us, even more urgently than  before. First, because there is no guarantee that the lives of  expatriates will not be threatened in the general conflagration.  Finally because, especially in Rwanda, the opposition leaders,  the human rights campaigners, and priests are being killed or  imprisoned, the United Nations' authority is being flouted, and  thousands of human lives are in danger.    The duty of humanitarian intervention is stronger than ever.  For the sake of democracy, but primarily for the sake of human  solidarity toward peoples in danger.</p>

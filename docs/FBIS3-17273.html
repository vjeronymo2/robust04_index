			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Naryshkin] </F>   [Text] Zagreb March 23 TASS -- The talks between Croats and  Serbs that ended last night at the Russian embassy in Zagreb  failed to bring the sides to sign an agreement on ceasefire and  withdrawal of troops from the front line.    The talks will resume next week. They will be mediated by  Russian troubleshooter Vitaliy Churkin, U.S. Ambassador to  Croatia Peter Galbraith and EU and UN representatives.    In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday,  Churkin praised the activity of the mediators whose efforts have  helped the sides pull through the hardest stages of the talks.  Although no formal decision was adopted, progress is obvious,  he added.    Churkin said that "previously, such meetings focused only on  local truces on the line of engagement. Now we are seeking full  disengagement of troops to rule out aimed fire along the front  that stretches for several hundred kilometers."    "The terrain where the disengagement line should run is very  difficult, while the situation, from the military and  psychological point of view, bears the burden of two-year  hostilities. Considering the three-month break in the  negotiation process, it was impossible to reach the pace  allowing us to finish the meeting in just one day," the Russian  diplomat said.    With a week to go before the next round of talks, the sides  will iron out technical details and think over their arguments  and position once again.    "Today's meeting has helped speed up the whole process of  settlement in former Yugoslavia and I hope that this week we  will be able to reach more progress in two directions -- the  Bosnian issue and Serb-Croat relations," Churkin said.    "The discussion was rather concrete and to the point. I  think we will be able to maintain this approach at the second  round of talks scheduled for March 29," he concluded.</p>

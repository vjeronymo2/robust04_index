			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / GE breaks up Kidder with sale to rival Kidder Peabody, the troubled investment banking subsidiary of General Electric, will be broken up in the coming months and its most attractive businesses transferred to Wall Street rival PaineWebber. The deal, agreed late on Sunday and announced yesterday morning, brings to an end GE's troubled eight-year ownership of Kidder Peabody. Rocked by an insider trading scandal and loss-making junk bond holdings in the late 1980s, Kidder has been hit this year by tumbling bond markets and an alleged bond trading fraud which resulted in fictitious profits of Dollars 350m. The US industrial conglomerate said it would take a charge of about Dollars 500m as a result of the sale, taking the total cost of its ill-fated involvement with Kidder to more than Dollars 1.5bn. GE paid Dollars 600m for 80 per cent of Kidder in 1986 and subsequently injected another Dollars 800m of capital. By the middle of this year, Kidder had returned a total of Dollars 250m in profits, GE said. Since then, the firm is understood to have lost Dollars 85m. The deal with PaineWebber is worth a net Dollars 90m to the US industrial giant. Under the agreement, Paine-Webber will acquire Kidder's retail stockbroking business and its fund management operation. It will also take over parts of the firm's investment banking and trading businesses, though final agreement will be reached over the coming weeks. PaineWebber will also receive Dollars 580m in net assets from GE. In return, the securities firm said it would issue Dollars 670m of ordinary, convertible and preferred shares to GE, which if fully converted would give the industrial group a 25 per cent interest. Mr Jack Welch, GE's chairman, who negotiated the original Kidder purchase, said yesterday that the group would retain an interest in 'a much larger, well-established franchise' in the broking industry. The deal will further PaineWebber's ambition of becoming a full-service investment bank, combining a retail broking force with underwriting securities issues, advising on takeovers and trading, said Mr Donald Marron, chairman. Rivals pointed out, though, that the acquisition would do little to strengthen PaineWebber's underwriting and advisory operations. Lex, Page 22</p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Smith says plan would benefit 'eight out of ten': Labour's shadow Budget proposes to increase taxation for higher earners EIGHT out of ten taxpayers would be better off after the first Budget of a Labour government, Mr John Smith said yesterday as he announced plans to increase taxes for high earners in order to give more to those lower down the income scale. The shadow chancellor's alternative Budget, to be enacted soon after an election victory, was designed to seize the initiative in the first week of the election campaign in which the parties were running neck and neck in the opinion polls. A Harris poll for today's Daily Express, however, gives the Tories a three-point lead over Labour. As the battle over tax and spending moved to the centre of the election campaign, Mr Smith said he would raise income tax thresholds by 10 per cent, abolish National Insurance contributions for the the first Pounds 54 per week of income and increase state pensions and child benefit. To pay for those measures and raise funds for public spending, Labour would re-move the present ceiling on National Insurance contributions and introduce a new 50p top rate of income tax on earnings above Pounds 40,000. The changes would mean everyone earning more than Pounds 21,060 would pay 9 per cent more on every extra pound of income and those with gross incomes over Pounds 40,000 would see their tax rate rise from 40 to 59 per gure. The documents accompanying Mr Smith's statement suggested that a single person earning Pounds 40,000 a year would be Pounds 1,500 a year worse off. For those on much higher incomes, the losses would rise sharply. Labour's calculation is that the package will be attractive to the vast majority of voters. Those earning less than Pounds 21,000 a year should gain. According to the Tories, average male earnings are Pounds 18,000 a year. Mr Smith said that a couple with two children and an income of Pounds 16,000 a year would gain Pounds 5.98 a week from the combination of higher tax thresholds, the abolition of the 2 per cent starting rate for National Insurance contributions and higher child benefit. The package brought charges of a Labour 'retreat' over the principle of tax cuts from Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. Mr Chris Patten, the Conservative party chairman, said higher taxes on middle incomes would threaten a collapse in the housing market in southern England. But Mr Smith's colleagues said that the package was a 'carefully calculated gamble' to outbid the Tories in the battle for the votes of those on average incomes. Even in some of the crucial electoral battlegrounds of London and the south-east, only about 15 per cent would lose, they claim. The shadow chancellor, whose package includes incentives for industrial investment, increased training provision and provides more funds for health and education, acknowledged that the measures would involve a significant redistribution of income. He calculated that over two years, his Budget would release Pounds 1bn for the health service, Pounds 600m for education and Pounds 1.1bn for his 'economic recovery programme'. He told a packed London press conference: 'We have had 13 years at which people at the top got preferential treatment. In this Budget we are starting to take back something for the average taxpayer and the average family.' Some of the money needed to finance the package would be raised by postponing for a further year the abolition of stamp duty on share transactions and by scrapping the 2 per cent incentive paid to those who opt out of the state earnings-related pension scheme. His promise that 8 out of 10 taxpayers would benefit won the backing of the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies. Labour leaders seized on further IFS calculations showing that relative to Mr Lamont's proposals in last week's Budget, 48 per cent would gain more from Mr Smith's. The shadow chancellor would scrap the new 20 per cent income tax band if Labour wins, but is pledged to maintain the basic rate at 25p. His proposed 10 per cent increase in the tax threshold would take 740,000 people out of income tax. Child benefit, currently at Pounds 9.65 per week for the first and Pounds 7.80 per week for subsequent children, would be paid at Pounds 9.95 for all. The state pension would be increased by Pounds 5 per week for a single person and Pounds 8 per week for a couple. Mr Smith dropped plans to extend National Insurance contributions to savings income.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- What the Labour Budget would do to weekly take-home pay compared with the Lamont measures  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                        Married Couple Gross annual   Single       No     1 earner   Both earning earnings       person   children   2 children  2 children  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  5,000       +0.45pw     +1.08pw     +3.53pw     +3.53pw 11,000       +0.02pw     +0.02pw     +2.47pw     +4.04pw 20,000       +0.02pw     +0.02pw     +2.47pw     +2.49pw 25,000       -6.80pw     -6.80pw     -4.35pw     +2.49pw 40,000      -32.24pw    -32.23pw    -29.78pw     -2.59pw 50,000      -68.76pw    -65.46pw    -63.00pw    -12.42pw 75,000     -160.12pw   -156.80pw   -154.34pw    -59.65pw 100,000    -251.46pw   -248.15pw   -245.69pw   -117.92pw 150,000    -434.15pw   -430.84pw   -428.38pw   -312.54pw  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Joint earners assume 60/40 split Source:  Labour party and Price Waterhouse  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

Nesterenko, V. Zelenkin, and I. Bespalov) held a news conference  on 23 March in the former House of Political Enlightenment.  Their visit to the kray was the result of an exacerbation of  the conflict between the municipal and kray authorities, which  ended with the events that are known to everyone.    For the sake of objectivity, the deputies first listened to  the aggrieved side, and afterwards a series of meetings was held  with the leadership of the kray, the kray UVD [Office of  Internal Affairs], and the city and kray procuracies. In a long  conversation with the governor, according to V. Zelenkin, the  governor was forced to admit that the kray organs "went too far"  in recent events. A conversation with K. Tolstoshein, the  acting head of the city, did not transpire: He met the Moscow  guests in such a way that, in the words of the same Zelenkin,  "we were compelled to get up and leave."    The deputies were very restrained in their comments on the  situation in the kray, declaring that they were not authorized  to give a legal evaluation of the events. At the same time,  they unanimously admitted that "the methods for changing the  city leadership were absolutely improper, exceeding that which  is authorized." V. Zelenkin also noted that despite the need to  resolve local problems through local courts, he does not see any  possibility of resolving them (the problems) without the  intervention of the center and the General Procuracy, two of  whose representatives were already in the country. Moreover, a  representative of the Russian Human Rights Committee is also  here today.    To the question as to whether the deputies were in the kray  court and saw the court's decree on dismissing V. Cherepkov from  his position, I. Bespalov answered that "we were not shown such  a decree, and we saw only the decree of the procurator stating  that it concurs with the kray court."    Regarding the appointment of Tolstoshein, the deputies  remarked that according to the law, the head of the kray in the  given circumstances can appoint anyone he wants, although now,  incidentally, the Duma committee on local self-government,  headed by V. Zelenkin, is considering a law that envisions an  election procedure for electing the head of a local government.    Concerning mass discharges in the Grey House, the deputies  could report only that they had not yet seen the pertinent  documents, having received only an oral explanation of the  reorganization of the managerial structure of the city that has  taken place. In particular, as he told them, no one "dismissed"  Gilgenberg--it was simply that the new structure did not provide  for the position of city manager.    The result of the deputy trip will be a note addressed to  the  president, the State Duma, and the General Procuracy. They  promised that they will try once again in the next few days to  raise the "Vladivostok question" at a Duma meeting. The events  in Vladivostok are so out of the ordinary, the deputies said,  that they reverberate throughout Russia.    The opinion of the deputies on the postponement of the date  of the kray elections is interesting: V. Zelenkin thinks that  in this decision the governor of the kray violated an edict of  the president that established the date for the conduct of  elections at the end of March. However, in a telephone  conversation with the chairman of the Central Election  Commission, the latter affirmed that the postponement of the  elections to a later date was authorized.    In the opinion of the deputies, rumblings in a number of  regions where elections have been disrupted for one reason or  another (mainly because of the passivity of the voters) should  not delay the dates of elections to local representative organs.</p>

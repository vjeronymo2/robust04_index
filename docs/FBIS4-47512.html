			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vyacheslav Andreyevich Vasilenko, director </F> of the Scientific Research Institute (NITI) of the RF Ministry  of Atomic Energy (Minatom Rossii), under the rubric  ``Science--The Hour of Decision''; conducted by POISK  correspondent A. Kuznyetsov; date and place not given.    [Text] The Chernobyl disaster has doomed Russian  atomic energy to the role of unwanted stepdaughter--favored  neither by the people, nor by the powers that be--just a source  of constant headaches. But, atomic energy currently provides 25  percent of the electrical energy used by the European part of  Russia, and it would be impossible to simply dispense with it.  At the same time, the useful lifetime of the present generation  of nuclear reactors is now drawing to a close, and we must think  about the construction of replacement facilities. Given  existing conditions, this undoubtedly will only be possible if  the population in locales of proposed AES (atomic energy  station) construction--in addition to being provided with  economic incentives--are convinced of their safety. The concept  of atomic energy development which has taken form in Minatom  Rossii calls for installation of a new generation of safer  reactors, which achieve reliability through inherent design  characteristics, rather than by the thickness of the reactor  walls. The record of past mistakes points out the need for  creation of scientific-industrial centers for atomic energy,  which will document reactors in order to conduct in-depth  verification of their safety. One such center is currently being  created in the city of Sosnoviy Bor in Leningrad Oblast, on the  grounds of the formerly hush-hush Minatom Rossii research  center. Our correspondent met with its director, V. Vasilenko,  and asked about the project to develop a Northwestern  Scientific-Industrial Center for Atomic Energy, as well as the  work the institute itself.  [Kuznyetsov]Vyacheslav Andreyevich: Until recently,  your institute was well known only to a narrow circle of  specialists. What have you been doing there?  [Vasilenko]The institute (NITI) was formed in 1962 by  a decree of the government of the USSR. Its creator, Academician  A. Aleksandrov, personally selected the site for the institute,  and, in subsequent years, the institute gave life to the city of  Sosnoviy Bor. In 1964, the first offices were laid out in the  structural framework, and, in 1968, work was begun on  development of testing facilities designed by NIKIET [expansion  not provided], ``Gidropress,'' and OKBM [expansion not  provided]. The institute was established as a test base for  experimental naval nuclear power facilities (YaEU), and, in the  course of its own development, progressed from conducting  complex experimental work to wide-ranging scientific  investigations of all aspects of the facilities. This resulted  in the development and introduction of new technological  processes which increased the tactical and technical data bases  of these facilities.  [Kuznyetsov]Which is to say, your institute actually  brought these facilities into existence?  [Vasilenko]Yes, that is an accurate assessment. The  institute worked with the chief designers, assuming the very  difficult and, frankly, thankless role of critic, inasmuch as we  were called upon to uncover inadequacies in these facilities,  the correction of which required design and technology changes.  The institute thus gave birth to the basic, fundamental,  sea-going power facilities.  [Kuznyetsov]How many researchers are there at the  institute now?  [Vasilenko]More than 2000 people, of whom about a  fourth are scientific and technical personnel carrying out  broad-based research. More than 500 nuclear industry service  workers provide maintenance services, as well as preparations  for experiments and modernization operations. A powerful  infrastructure also exists which permits the institute to thrive  and grow.  [Kuznyetsov]In our difficult times right now, what is  it that the institute is concerned with?  [Vasilenko]We are actively working with the Navy, and  the total volume of its orders amounts to about half of our  financing. There are government orders from a number of  enterprises within the atomic energy complex--this allows us a  respectable subsistence. In the process of building naval  nuclear reactors, we have developed several operational  directions, one of which is the design of training systems.  Operational personnel receive their training in our systems, and  the trainers are aggressively employed as preparation for  operations under non-standardized conditions, as well as for  handling other situations. And, it is only after nuclear power  plant processes have been extensively modeled in trainers that  we proceed with the power plant testing program, which improves  substantially the safety of these potentially dangerous  facilities. In addition, we have worked on the neutron physics  properties of the RBMK reactors [large-capacity, pressure-tube  reactors], and, in the process of this work, an enormous  potential has been put in place. In particular, the ``Sapfir''  program developed by our enterprise: It can be used to compute  the reactor core design for any reactor of this type. We are  aggressively offering our programs to consumers in the nuclear  power station sector.  [Kuznyetsov]This kind of research and development  requires a potent scientific base.  [Vasilenko]As far as that is concerned, we pride  ourselves on it. Since 1972, each one of the institute's  installations has developed computerized test-measurement  systems which have scale capabilities five to ten times superior  to the standard measurement devices used in atomic energy  installations. We are required to demonstrate and document that  our measurements are precisely and metrologically aligned. We  have accumulated archives of experimental data, which--I  believe--belongs to the nation. We are intensively utilizing  this, not only to obtain the most precise characteristics of  systems now being used, but also to plan the parameters of  future reactors. The capabilities of our computerized data  collection and processing system, ``ANIS,'' have, to this time,  not been surpassed within the field. This instrument allows  observations of the condition of reactors, as well as standard  control and testing systems, which, in combination with  extremely accurate experimental data, provides a new level of  quality in research.  [Kuznyetsov]What products and services are you  offering to the international market?  [Vasilenko]We have a number of highly competitive  products, especially, an innovative, fail-safe operational  system which functions in real time. This system is unique in  its ability to counter any type of malfunction in the  computerized test equipment and assure operations even during  degradation of a test-measurement or control system. The  principles underlying its operation are still state-of-the-art.  We also possess technology for equipping trainers of any size  and class, including conceptual, functional, local and  half-scale types. We are in a position to put together, without  outside help, a real-time simulator system for training  operational personnel, and for analyzing crisis situations. The  technological characteristics and economic indicators of these  systems are better than for similar systems being supplied by  joint ventures and Western firms.  [Kuznyetsov]If your trainers are of such high  quality, what do you say to the question of why you are not  producing them for our stations? As far as I know, French and  American trainers are being installed these days in preference  to yours...  [Vasilenko]It is, unfortunately, for us as well, a  somewhat puzzling situation. One of the reasons I can see in the  fact that, previously, the West was closed to people in our  ministry, but now, one may quietly travel abroad and purchase  whatever is needed. Another factor is that defense industries  began to offer formerly secret products of a higher quality,  which had not been available to the civilian atomic energy  sector. Project designers and equipment operators seemed to be  confused, since they were not familiar with these technologies,  but their use substantially restructured the very technological  solutions which they traditionally employ. And, there, the West  offers familiar solutions--almost, in fact, a gift... Help for  us from abroad! They help, but not to the benefit of our atomic  energy industry. Nearly all joint projects--they are Trojan  Horses, in which Western firms calculate how to move into our  atomic market. This process, whether willingly, or unwillingly,  is continually accelerating, which will produce a serious effect  in the future. Our own high-level native technologies are  becoming irrelevant, In the final analysis, this will lead to  our atomic energy industry being pushed into the background,  where it will not develop to any significant degree. France, for  example, jealously defends its market, and protectionism is  growing there. With us, everything is exactly the reverse. In  fact, a number of things, particularly associated with safety,  are being artificially exaggerated and depreciated. Conditions  are driven by the formation of public opinion, which does not  provide for the required level of safety in our atomic power  stations. I think that, at first, it is necessary to equalize  the forces needed for elevating domestic testing and control  systems to a higher level, and to examine the possibility of  using our own technology, and then adopt solutions. Right now,  there is still time to develop domestic atomic power station  control systems, based on new principles and technologies.  Otherwise, tomorrow, we shall find ourselves bound to the West.  [Kuznyetsov]What are the institute's plans for the  future?  [Vasilenko]For the past three years, we have been  intensively applying our wealth of experience to the civilian  atomic energy sector, and we are now working on the creation of  the Northwestern Scientific-Industrial Center for Atomic Energy  (NPTsAE). This work is part of the Russian effort to develop a  new generation of medium-capacity, safer nuclear plants, which  are being brought on line in accordance with the government  program, ``Environmentally Clean Energy.'' Since 1991, we have  been working with the Leningrad institute,  ``Atomenergoproyekt,'' to develop the new-generation VVER-640  (V-470) water-moderated, water-cooled power reactor designed by  the experimental design bureau, ``Gidropress.'' Together with  the reactor facility design team and the scientific  leadership--the Kurchatovskiy Institute--we shall be conducting  research on the dynamics of reactor behavior, as well as  processes within the reactor and containment vessel.  [Kuznyetsov]Why have you experienced delays on this  same project?  [Vasilenko]This reactor incorporates substantively  innovative approaches, such as passive heat venting, a high  degree of automation, and a dual containment feature based on a  design developed for the descent of high-altitude military  aircraft. The use of reactor cores employing reduced unit loads  allows for better fuel utilization and improves nuclear station  safety. The passive systems provide an outlet for residual heat  release from the reactor core during an emergency situation.  Nuclear plant safety is assured, under normal operation, over  the course of the entire projected service period, which amounts  to 50-60 years. An example of the use in this project of new,  high-level technologies previously not seen in civilian reactor  design is the base slab of the reactor vessel, which is capable  of withstanding earthquakes of up to 8 points on the MSK-64  [expansion not given] scale. The levels of radiation exposure  for nuclear plant workers do not exceed 0.1 percent above  background values common in Russia--that is to say, the  radiation exposure for the population and the environment is  measured at minimal. Its inherent characteristics enable the  VVER-640 to be sited at any location on earth. It does not  require water resources, as it can make use of dry cooling  towers. When the reactor is outfitted for water cooling, it can  exhaust as much as 60,000 cubic meters of feedwater per day. At  640 MW, the electrical power capacity of the reactor also is  optimal for the majority of regions, not all of which require  million watters. After thoroughly analyzing the new projects  developed by our reactor designers, we came to the conclusion  that the VVER-640 project is the most promising, not only from  the perspective of the internal needs of Russia, but also for  penetration of foreign markets. This conclusion has been  confirmed by our subsequent research and by the results of an  international competition in St. Petersburg, where a panel of  judges marked this particular project, ``recommended,'' and  ``advanced.'' Yet, the special nature of this project lies in  the fact that enterprises in Leningrad Oblast and St.  Petersburg, such as the production associations, ``LMZ,''  [Leningrad Metals Plant] ``Izhorskiy Zavod,'''' [Izhorskiy Heavy  Equipment Plant] and ``Kirovskiy Zavod,'' and others, are in a  position to fully assume the entire range of operations involved  in the engineering, manufacture and supply of nuclear plant  power blocks using the VVER-640 reactor to regions within  Russia, as well as abroad. We suggested to local authorities at  all levels that the scientific-industrial center for  new-generation reactor development be organized around our  facilities, explaining its prospective benefits for us and the  region. Both the Ministry and the government have supported the  project. The future promise of this project is already being  confirmed by the generation of orders in Russia; a decision is  in place concerning construction of the triple-exchange  [triple-loop, heat exchange] blocks on the Kola Peninsula, and  talks are underway on construction of the triple-blocks in  Primorye, as well as preliminary negotiations on their  construction abroad, and one of the indispensable conditions for  closing the export contracts is construction and testing of the  main block. The electric power being produced in our main block  will travel to such potential consumers as future Russian ports  on the Baltic Sea, and the high-speed, St. Petersburg-to-Moscow  rail line.  [Kuznyetsov]Why did this specific NITI become the  base for the center?  [Vasilenko]Our advantage lay in the fact that the  institute had at its disposal the necessary potential in terms  of technology, experience and knowledge to complete the work in  the shortest time-frame, and to develop a new-generation main  block for use as a potent argument in the atomic sector of the  Russian energy program. We also have no need to create storage  facilities or district heating networks, and we have control  over the construction, having built the four blocks at the  Leningrad nuclear station, in addition to holding a license for  construction of atomic power stations. We have dozens of atomic  sector enterprises nearby, with great project-management  capabilities. Which is to say that the center combines the  construction, as well as technical and technological, experience  of the entire atomic energy industry, the coordination of which  will allow us to obtain a new result, a new level of  quality--and a safe new-generation power station.  [Kuznyetsov]According to statistics, about 50 percent  of the incidents at atomic energy stations are the fault of  personnel. What are you doing to forestall such extraordinary  occurrences?  [Vasilenko]We will not simply build a main block, but  create a scientific-industrial center, where, along with the  reactor facility, we shall establish a teaching-training complex  with a center for analysis of crisis situations. There is a  proposal for a fully staffed trainer at the complex, not only to  deal with issues of training and retraining of personnel, but  also to simulate emergency situations, and provide follow-up  analysis of them. The center for analysis of crisis situations  will receive information from all operational power blocks, and  we will be capable of disseminating safety recommendations to  cover any situations. The complex will house a technical school  for training mid-level technicians from atomic power stations  under construction. In addition, the center will contain test  facilities for modeling emergency processes, and for  experimental research on serious emergencies, as well.  [Kuznyetsov]What do you think will happen if this  project is delayed?  [Vasilenko]A study of the prospective projects of  Western firms indicates that the ``Westinghouse'' firm is  planning to obtain a license to construct a similar block in  1995. If we delay our construction, they will be the first to  enter the world market. Right now, we have a real chance to get  there ahead of them. We just have to persevere, and we will make  a breakthrough onto the world nuclear market.  I</p>

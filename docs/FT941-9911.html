			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: India Fund aims to raise up to Dollars 400m The India Fund, a newly-launched closed-end fund, hopes to raise up to Dollars 400m from international investors looking for exposure to the Indian stock market. The liberalisation and deregulation of the Indian economy during the past couple of years - and the prospect of strong economic growth - has sparked considerable interest in Indian equities from international and emerging market investors. The India Fund, which has a New York Stock Exchange listing, will concentrate on investing mainly in medium-sized companies. 'We think the medium-sized companies are better able to adjust to the reform process, and also they are much cheaper,' said Mr Jeff Chowdhry, fund manager at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Investment Management which is acting as investment adviser to the fund. Mr Chowdhry said the sectors which are likely to be of particular interest are those related to infrastructure projects (such as the telecommunications and power sectors), as well as tourism-related stocks, for example companies in the hotel business. The fund hopes to raise up to Dollars 400m through the sale of 2.666m shares priced at Dollars 15 per share, according to the prospectus. It is aiming for long-term capital growth. Advantage Advisers, a subsidiary of Oppenheimer &amp; Co, will act as investment manager to the fund, while Infrastructure Leasing &amp; Financial Services Ltd, an Indian company, will act as country adviser to the fund.</p>

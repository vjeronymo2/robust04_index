			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINANCIAL MARKETS;  </P> <P> CURRENCY;  </P> <P> HOLIDAYS ABROAD SLOW DOLLAR TRADING  </P> <P> The dollar ended mixed against key foreign currencies in thin, abbreviated  worldwide trading.  </P> <P> Currency dealers said trading was quiet, with Japanese markets closed for a  national holiday.  </P> <P> Many European markets will be closed today for May Day, and some dealers took  an early, extended break, they said.  </P> <P> "With all the various holidays this week there doesn't seem to be any reason to  break from the trading ranges," said Trevor Woodland, chief corporate trader  for Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago. "Everybody is in a bit of a wait-and-see  mood."  </P> <P> Overseas, traders are expected to pay close attention to the local government  elections in Britain as a test of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's  controversial reform of local taxes. The elections could effect the British  pound.  </P> <P> In West Germany, Bundesbank officials are set to meet this week, although  traders said it was unlikely they'll move to raise interest rates in that  country. Higher rates tend to support a currency.  </P> <P> In London, the dollar fell to a closing 158.85 Japanese yen from 159.08 yen at  Friday's close in Tokyo. The dollar stood at 158.90 yen in New York, down from  159.30 yen Friday.  </P> <P> The dollar was also weaker against the British pound. Sterling sold for $1.6390  in London, up from $1.6360 late Friday, and for $1.6405 in New York, up from  $1.6350.  </P></p>

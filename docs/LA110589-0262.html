			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WAITING FOR THE QUAKE;  </P> <P> SAN ANDREAS FAULT;  </P> <P> GEOLOGISTS PLOT A SCENARIO FOR A 8.3 MAGNITUDE QUAKE  </P> <P> This map, from a 1982 scenario prepared by the state Division of Mines and  Geology, provides a hypothetical look at the degree of ground shaking and  ground failure that might result from an 8.3 magnitude temblor along the San  Andreas Fault. It would be equivalent to the greatest earthquake ever recorded  in California.  </P> <P> The scenario's authors chose the San Andreas Fault because it is the longest,  most famous fault in the state. It also produced the last 8 magnitude  earthquake in Southern California, centered at Fort Tejon, between Los Angeles  and Bakersfield, in 1857.  </P> <P> In putting the epicenter of the scenario's 8.3 earthquake also at Ft. Tejon,  </P> <P> the scientists at the Division of Mines and Geology chose a spot on the fault  close to the Los Angeles metropolitan area that would presumably cause the  greatest shaking in that area. But they may have opted for something less than  a most-likely outcome, according to two leading Caltech seismologists.  </P> <P> Hiroo Kanamori notes that most earthquake scientists believe the next "Big One"  on the San Andreas in Southern California is likely to occur further east, in  the Coachella Valley. The epicenter's greater distance from -- and different  orientation to -- the Los Angeles area would likely produce less shaking  intensities than shown in the map.  </P> <P> And a second scientist, Kerry Sieh, said it is "very unlikely" such a temblor  would occur in the Ft. Tejon area soon.  </P> <P> Scientists have calculated a theoretical average interval of about 130 years  for quakes in the area. But Sieh found that since about 700 AD only one quake  had actually occurred according to that timetable. That's because the quakes  have tended to be bunched in twos or threes fairly close in time, with  intervals of 250 or 300 years separating the clusters, Sieh said.  </P> <P> If an 8 magnitude earthquake were to occur on the fault segment which is the  focus of the San Andreas scenario, it would unquestionably be a serious event  in the Los Angeles area, resulting in "significant interruption of ground  transportation, communications, water supply, sewage treatment, electricity and  pipeline distribution of natural gas and petroleum," according to the scenario.  </P> <P> Legend for the San Andreas map showing three levels of intensity, slightest  first:  </P> <P> Areas in white -- Little or no structural damage to buildings of good design,  considerable damage to poorly built or badly designed buildings. Considerable  fall of plaster and window breakage.  </P> <P> Areas in gray -- Considerable structural damage in ordinary substantial brick  buildings,  </P> <P> partial collapse of wooden houses.  </P> <P> Areas in dark gray -- More serious damage; fall of walls, chimneys, monuments,  also factory stacks and towers.  </P> <P> Liquefaction zones:  </P> <P> Soil is subject to liquefaction. Under intense shaking, it becomes like gelatin  or quicksand, often resulting in collapse of structures above or breakage of  underground pipes.  </P> <P> Source: U.S. Geological Survey  </P></p>

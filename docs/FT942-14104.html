			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: Travelers' operating income in line with previous period Travelers, the diversified US financial services group formerly known as Primerica, reported operating income of Dollars 342.6m in the first quarter. This was broadly in line with earnings in the previous three months from comparable operations. However, operating earnings per share fell to 99 cents from Dollars 1.10 as the company issued new shares to pay for its acquisition of the Travelers Insurance company, completed at the end of the year. After a Dollars 2.8m loss on investments, net income was Dollars 340m, or 98 cents a share. Smith Barney Shearson, the group's brokerage arm, reported operating profits of Dollars 144.3m in the quarter, similar to the previous period and equivalent to a return on equity of 26.6 per cent. Income from trading in financial markets was Dollars 239.4m. Mr Sanford Weill, chairman, said he was 'very pleased' with Smith Barney's results. But he said 'we fully expect that the months ahead could be somewhat difficult, and are proceeding with caution.' Life insurance businesses accounted for after-tax profits of Dollars 121.4m, while property/ casualty insurance returned Dollars 384.7m. These results are not comparable with earlier periods due to the completion of the takeover of Travelers Insurance at the end of the year. Mr Weill said: 'We are starting to see some benefits from our aggressive cost reduction program (in the insurance businesses) and expect the savings pace to pick up as the year progresses.' Travelers' consumer finance business, the only part of the group unaffected by the acquisitions of last year, recorded a 5 per cent increase in revenues from a year before, to Dollars 299.6m, and a 5 per cent increase in net income, to Dollars 48.3m. In the final three months of 1993, the new Travelers group reported operating earnings of Dollars 276.6m, with the old Travelers insurance company making Dollars 61m.</p>

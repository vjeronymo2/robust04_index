			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Union may win Pounds 400,000 costs THE TGWU general workers' union, which had a deficit of nearly Pounds 12m last year, is likely to recoup about Pounds 400,000 of its costs from the long-running industrial tribunal which found that 19 Tilbury dockers had been unfairly dismissed. The Port of London Authority sacked the dockers and contested their claim for unfair dismissal. Unusually for such a case, the tribunal has ordered the authority to pay 40 per cent of the union's costs. The authority already faces a separate bill of about Pounds 750,000 for compensation to the sacked dockers unless it wins its appeal against the decision. The TGWU's legal costs have soared in recent years from a total of Pounds 1.75m in 1987 to Pounds 4.94m in 1991.</p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Allied Domecq to lift Spain Alecq stake Allied Domecq, the drinks group, said it would lift its stake in Spain Alecq, owner of the Domecq group, from 73 to almost 100 per cent. The share deal is the result of a put option granted to the Domecq family when Allied paid Pounds 739m for control of Pedro Domecq, the Spanish drinks producer, in March. Mr Ramon Mora-Figueroa, part of the Domecq family, said the Pounds 280.4m option would be exercised by December 30. Mr Mora-Figueroa sits on Allied Domecq's board with executive responsibility for Domecq. Allied said the option had been exercised considerably earlier than expected. The option enabled the family to sell its 27 per cent stake in Spain Alecq within six years of the acquisition. Mr Tony Pratt, director of Allied Domecq corporate affairs, said: 'At the time, both parties thought it might be rather longer than this to exercise the put option. They have now chosen to do so and this is entirely due to their own circumstances.' The group said the price of the option was likely to be reduced because it included an element in US dollars. The final figure will not be announced until the option is exercised. At the time of the Domecq acquisition, Allied claimed the deal made it the world's second largest spirits producer. The group has since embarked on a series of disposals to concentrate on spirits and wines. Last week the group said it was negotiating the sale of its Dutch brewing subsidiary to Interbrew of Belgium. Last month it announced the Pounds 74.3m sale of 641 pubs to Scottish Amicable, the insurer, and the pension fund of Strathclyde Regional Council, Scotland's biggest local authority.</p>

			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Budget performance US government long bond yields around 6.5 per cent hardly suggest that the markets are bothered by the Federal government's budget deficit. President Clinton, however, may be making a mistake when he claims credit for the bond market's recent strength. US growth is still very sluggish and, despite an uptick in the second quarter, inflation is subdued. That is probably more responsible for low bond yields than the president's deficit reduction package. Besides, the national debt and the size of the budget deficit as a proportion of GDP hardly stand out against other OECD countries. What is more worrying is the way that the politicians have struggled so mightily to bring forth such a weak compromise. Passing the bill was certainly important, given that Mr Clinton had invested so much political capital in it. Yet even on the government's own figures, the deficit will still be Dollars 250bn by 1998, and spending will have risen by 20 per cent  -always supposing that expenditure estimates are not exceeded in the way they have been in the past. To be sure, the markets would have responded very badly had the vote failed, and the president's authority been significantly weakened. Now it has passed, the focus will be on slow growth. With little sign of the recovery gathering pace, Treasury bonds may well rally further. Equities may also benefit. For those still prepared to overlook the monotonous regularity of exceptional charges in US company results, there is little reason to suppose that equity prices are stretched beyond the limit.</p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Arts: Stunned by a mighty Pine - Jazz Those people at the Jazz Cafe in London whose last experience of jazz saxophonist Courtney Pine was his 1992 disc To the eyes of creation must have stumbled into the Camden night feeling dazed and confused last week, not to mention a little deaf. Leading an acoustic group which included South African Bheki Mseleku at the keyboard, the young tenorist - he is 29 - left his similarly young audience with the look of a colony of rabbits caught in the headlights of an oncoming juggernaut. Although the tunes were taken from the album, an easy and persuasive mix of reggae and soul-washed modern jazz, they were delivered with such fierce and sometimes brutal fervour, it seemed that Pine might be exorcising their memory. 'Healing Song', a bright and easy opener for the album was started caustically by Pine before he was even in sight. By the time he had reached the stand, striding around the upper gallery, drummer Mark Mondesir had established a polyrhythmic barrage of sound down below and the tenorist's sonic attack was under way. 'Country Dance', another ostensibly beguiling tune, exploded into an extraordinary and somewhat two-dimensional assault with drummer Mondesir all but suffocating Wayne Batchelor's string bass, Mseleku's piano and Cameron Pierre's acoustic guitar. Respite from Pine's abstract soprano scribbling and curtain of tenor modality finally came with the hymnal 'Psalm', a traditional song beautifully arranged by the leader. Bheki Mseleku unfolded the irresistible melody, though the sound quality did him no favours and Mondesir held off for a while. The reprieve was short-lived, however, and Pine returned to purge the melody with a display of circular breathing at the soprano which only just failed to find the resonant frequency of the bar's cocktail glasses. One after another, seemingly innocent tunes were dragged by Pine and Mondesir into a harsh and free environment to be wrung of all their sweetness. The night was not entirely filled with reed abuse, however, and further rest periods were provided by the appearance of Talvin Singh whose reverberating tablas led Pine's soprano in a cheeky duet. Mseleku tried his hand again with a cut from his own album 'Celebration' but the sound from the keyboard had not improved and the eager 'township' contagion was all but lost. This sort of display of firepower and technical brilliance gone haywire is not to everyone's taste of course, but in Pine's hands it does have a curiously purging effect on the senses. When it comes out of a composing and organisational talent as fresh as his, it is exhilarating.</p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPANESE WORKERS GO EXTRA MILE TO ENSURE CARS' QUALITY  </P> <P> The banners were hung throughout Nissan's sprawling assembly plant here, urging  workers to attain a goal that many did not even understand at first:  </P> <P> "First in Rogers!" the banners said in Japanese.  </P> <P> The hidden meaning behind that slogan: All Nissan workers must join as a team  to build the best cars in the world.  </P> <P> Nissan's executives figured that if one of their cars could be ranked first in  the Rogers Report, a little-known quality newsletter put out by an Ohio  research firm, then Nissan could also win top honors in the more prestigious --  and more widely publicized -- quality surveys by J. D. Power &amp; Associates,  an Agoura Hills automotive market research firm.  </P> <P> "We felt that if we won Rogers, then we would win Power, too," said Nissan  engineer Masayoshi Horike. "But we had to make some videos to explain what the  banners meant to the workers."  </P> <P> Such exhortations to pull together as a team may sound corny to Americans, but  in Japan they really work: Once they understood the banners, the Oppama workers  went on to help make the Nissan Maxima first in Rogers and first in J. D. Power  in 1989.  </P> <P> Now, more than a decade after the Japanese first became a major force in the  American car market, Detroit has still failed to catch up on quality.  </P> <P> One key reason is that the Japanese still get their workers to do the little  things better. They have maintained an obsessive attention to detail that  results in what industry experts call a better "fit and finish" to their cars.  </P> <P> Doors do not rattle. Sheet metal panels line up straight on car bodies.  Brand-new cars do not have to go back to the dealership to fix annoyingly  defective light switches or turn signals.  </P> <P> The Japanese call such workmanship issues "taken-for-granted quality" -- doing  the things right that customers expect and demand that you do right.  </P> <P> "I believe the Americans have caught up in some areas, but I think the gap is  still great in this 'taken-for-granted' area," observed Katsuyoshi Yamada,  general manager of quality control at Toyota.  </P> <P> To be sure, much of the credit for Japanese automotive quality must go to their  superior design and engineering processes; the Japanese themselves talk  constantly about the need to "design in" quality before a car ever reaches the  factory floor.  </P> <P> Yet the genuine sense of teamwork among factory workers here at Oppama and  elsewhere in Japan has clearly played a critical role in helping the Japanese  maintain their lead in quality throughout the 1980s.  </P> <P> Workers are willing to pay attention to details when they really feel that they  are part of a team, and the Japanese auto companies still do a much better job  of that than do the Big Three.  </P> <P> American executives, of course, have talked teamwork almost to death throughout  the 1980s.  </P> <P> But the Japanese really live it, and that makes all the difference when it  comes to exhorting people in a factory to pay attention to details and build  quality products.  </P> <P> Ironically, the Japanese maintain this sense of teamwork between management and  labor even though their society is rigidly hierarchical; the Japanese obsession  with exchanging business cards is part of a subtle effort to determine who  ranks higher and who should bow the lowest.  </P> <P> But while status and power vary widely in Japan, pay does not. There is a much  smaller salary differential between boss and employee in Japan than in the  United States, and the absence of an American-style economic gulf between the  executive suite and the shop floor seems to be one reason that factory workers  in Japan believe that management's commitment to teamwork is genuine.  </P> <P> For example, a bucho, or general manager, at Toyota -- one of the top officials  in the largest company in Japan -- makes only about $120,000 including bonus,  less than half what a comparable executive would make in Detroit, American auto  industry officials acknowledge.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, at the current exchange rate, the average Toyota assembly-line  worker makes nearly $23 per hour, or roughly $49,000 a year, counting bonuses  and overtime. In fact, with overtime and extra pay for night work, it is even  possible for a foreman at Toyota to make more than a mid-career engineer,  according to Toyota spokesman Kanji Sugamoto.  </P> <P> Japan's pay parity even extends to the company chairman and president.  </P> <P> Most chief executives of major Japanese auto companies make $350,000 to  $450,000 a year, roughly 10 times what their factory workers earn. By contrast,  the chief executives of American auto companies can make $2 million or more,  including bonuses and stock options, about 50 times as much as their workers.  In some years, that ratio has skyrocketed to as much as 500 times more. But  Japanese executives do not get those glittering perks, such as stock options,  that have proliferated throughout American industry, inflating executive pay in  Detroit and across the nation. Such ostentatious compensation is considered  tactless in Japan. Several Japanese auto companies have recently bought  helicopters to ferry their executives above Tokyo's massive traffic jams, but  at least a few reportedly hesitated for fear of appearing too showy.  </P> <P> In fact, only a handful of the very highest auto executives are given free cars  -- which flow like water to every middle manager in Detroit. "I don't get a  free car," acknowledged Tadahiko Fukuyama, a senior manager in charge of  Nissan's international public affairs operations. "I just get a 10% discount."  </P> <P> But it is Toyota that, more than most Japanese firms, goes to extreme lengths  to make sure that its workers do not feel that management is taking advantage  of them.  </P> <P> For instance, there is no carpeting on the floors in Toyota's vast engineering  offices in Toyota City, the company's headquarters town in central Japan.  </P> <P> Because there is no carpeting along its assembly lines, Toyota decided that its  engineers shouldn't have any, either. That's so that when factory workers are  brought in to discuss new projects with the engineers, they will not think that  Toyota is treating its engineers any better than its workers on the shop floor.  </P> <P> "There is a kind of corporate socialism here," noted John Shook, who in the  early 1980s became the first American to work for Toyota in Toyota City. "And  so the sense of teamwork is genuine. The workers believe it."  </P> <P> But the Japanese have had more trouble instilling that spirit of teamwork in  their workers at their new American factories, a troubling omen for an industry  that is shifting more and more production from Japan to the United States.  </P> <P> Discontent has raged this year both at Mazda's Michigan assembly plant and at  Nissan's Tennessee factory, as workers have complained that Japanese labor  policies aimed at "constant improvement" are actually being abused to allow  management to increase line speeds and eliminate jobs.  </P> <P> But virtually all of the workers' complaints have been with the way their  American supervisors manipulate the Japanese labor system, and not with the  system itself.  </P> <P> "In America, the differences between blue collar and white collar are still  very strong," noted Horike of Nissan. "It isn't so here."  </P></p>

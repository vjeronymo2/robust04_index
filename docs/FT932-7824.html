			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Observer: Grave economies Even death no longer provides South Korea's citizens with an escape from their government's national austerity campaign. The ministry of health and social affairs has pronounced a ban on unduly ornate tombs for ancestors. To shame ostentatious descendants into conforming, the ministry has published a list of 109 cases of excessive embellishment, of which 55 have already been corrected by the removal of stone statuary and the like. The posthumous offenders included former law-makers, several leading businessmen, and Unification Church leader Moon Sun-myung.</p>

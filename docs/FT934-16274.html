			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / People: New finance director for Simon Engineering The new team at Simon Engineering is making another move to try to reverse the fortunes of the struggling process engineering to hydraulic platforms group, bringing in a new finance director. Tim Redburn, who most recently was working with David James at LEP, takes over as finance director with immediate effect. He replaces Alan Jarvis, who had held the post four years. Jarvis remains a director. The appointment of Redburn, 40, is the latest in a round of changes at Simon which began with the death earlier this year of the former chairman, Roy Roberts. In July Michael Davies became chairman. A month later he recruited Maurice Dixson as chief executive, replacing Brian Kemp - who had been blamed by some shareholders for the company's unsuccessful diversification into environmental businesses. Redburn faces a tough task at Simon. Last month, the group announced a first-half pre-tax loss of Pounds 52.6m, passed its interim dividend and said that it had breached one of its banking covenants. Dixson said then that his main priority would be to reduce net debt from Pounds 143m to less than Pounds 100m. Achieving this would involve focusing on the internal control of money and reducing the cost base. 'I have brought Tim Redburn into Simon to work closely with me to restore the group to financial health,' said Dixson yesterday. Dixson believes Redburn is the man for the job because of his considerable experience working with companies undergoing change and restructuring. Before his stint at LEP, Redburn was finance director of Davies &amp; Newman, finance director at Electron House and finance director and general manager of Hoverspeed.</p>

			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / It's fun, fun, fun on Rio's fringe WHILE official Earth Summit delegates drily discuss strategy in small fibreglass cubicles, members of 2,000 non-governmental organisations are in tents 30 miles away in a seafront park debating how they would save the planet. A replica Viking ship bobs in the harbour. A group in black body stockings sing bossa nova while manipulating a large Muppet sat astride a leather bag. Stalls sell everything from Earth Repair Handbooks to Grow Your Own Mini Ecosystem kits. A blue fibreglass globe balanced on a cluster of iron bars spits and sizzles as its creator, Antenor Colussi, explains that it is generating ozone from a 48,000-volt box underneath. 'This shows we can produce ozone and send it to the North Pole,' he explains to passersby. This is the parallel conference, where everything from feminism to socialism to racism is on the agenda along with the environment. Inside the tents, groups discuss diverse topics such as 'Breastfeeding is an Ecological Act', 'Mental Pollution in the Inhabitants of Large Cities', 'The Culturing of Worms in the Process of Organic Fertilisation' and 'Zambian Women and Energy-Efficient Cook Stoves'. Everyone is here, from the World Bank to the Film-makers' Union of Kazakhastan, the Brazilian state mining company to the Socialist Youth, Olivia Newton John to the Grand Mufti of Syria. On the grass, orange-robed swamis sit crosslegged and meditate in the baking sun. Sessions include workshops on alternative technologies, debates on climate change and discussions of the environmental problems of China and the sustainable development successes of countries such as Botswana and Costa Rica. An Earth Parliament of spiritual leaders and parliamentarians has attracted such noteworthy participants as His Holiness the XIV Dalai Lama - who told crowds he was having 'fun, fun, fun'. A daily meeting of engineers and architects is putting forward plans for an 'Ecopolis' - the environmentally friendly city of the future. Designs resemble giant beehives suspended over water where families live on shelves and park boats underneath. There is much to see, discuss, and marvel at, but the Global Forum as it is known has not succeeded in its objective of pressuring delegates at the official conference. However, NGOs have had considerable input in the treaty formulation process before Rio and will be essential for monitoring governments to ensure they stick to what they sign. The Forum, meanwhile, is facing financial difficulties. Still Dollars 2m short of the Dollars 11.6m (Pounds 6.3m) target to fund the Rio event, organisers are appealing for funds to 'ensure the legacy we leave is not one of debt - the opposite of the goal of sustainable development.'</p>

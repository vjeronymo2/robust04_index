			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marica Lalovic from Pale] </F>   [Text] The session of the people's assembly of the  republic of Srpska continued behind closed doors in Pale this  morning. The issues concerning the republic's domestic and  foreign policy are again on the agenda today, the second day of  the session. A report by the republican Defense Ministry is  also on the agenda. The deputies are also expected to discuss  the continuation of the peace negotiations on the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The negotiations are scheduled to take  place in Geneva tomorrow [2 June] and were called by Yasushi  Akashi, special envoy of the UN Secretary General.    Commenting on his talks with [Russian Deputy Foreign  Minister] Vitaliy Churkin yesterday, Momcilo Krajisnik, chairman  of the people's assembly of the republic of Srpska, said on his  arrival in Pale that the vital interests of the Serbian people  are not for sale, and that the contact group and other  international community's mediators in the talks on the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina have already been made aware of that.    Krajisnik stressed that Churkin had said that the delegation  of the Serbian Republic would travel to Geneva to attend the  two-day talks on the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, but that this  did not mean the continuation of the negotiations on the fate of  the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, which the Serbian Republic is  linking to the lifting of sanctions imposed on the Serbian  people.    The special Russian envoy [Churkin] should arrive in  Sarajevo  today, where he will probably try to convince Alija Izetbegovic  and the Muslim side that it is necessary for them to attend the  negotiations in Geneva.</p>

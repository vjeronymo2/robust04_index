			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa has announced that it will delay its decision  to accept a cease-fire, as demanded by the United Nations, as a  result of Saudi statements that the Arabian Gulf states may move  if battles in Yemen continue.    This was announced by a northern official, who said verbatim  that Sanaa was about to officially inform the UN secretary  general of its agreement on a cease-fire, but that Saudi Foreign  Minister Sa'ud al-Faysal's statements delayed that announcement.</p>

			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / International Company News: MGM-Pathe tussle dents Parretti's pride - How the end of the year turned sour for the Italian financier To say that 1991 ended badly for Mr Giancarlo Parretti would be an understatement. With the panettone still fresh on the cake-stand, the 50-year-old Italian financier was arrested in Italy on December 27, supposedly on charges of tax evasion. Instead of boarding a flight to Tunisia, Mr Parretti was taken into police custody at Rome's Ciampino airport and subsequently transported to Sicily for questioning. That was only the beginning. Less than a week later, on December 30, a US judge awarded continuing control of MGM-Pathe Communications, the Hollywood film company which Mr Parretti acquired in 1990, to his bankers, Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland (CLBN). This ruling, which was backed up by 89 pages of damning commentary, represented the culmination of a complex legal battle between the Italian businessman and the French-owned bank over control of the studio. In the way of US court actions, hearings had begun as long ago as August. Not surprisingly, the Credit Lyonnais camp has been cock-a-hoop. 'We intend to see that the lion roars again,' was the formal comment from Mr Alan Ladd, the MGM chairman installed at the behest of CLBN last year, although the studio made a Dollars 159.9m net loss in the first half of 1991 and there has been talk of negative cash flow of about Dollars 200m for 1991 overall. More unexpected, perhaps, was the response from Mr Parretti's public relations people. As 1991 died, out came a release describing the ruling as 'unfortunate', and the court action as 'lamentable'. More pertinently, it suggested that a 'lender liability suit', counter-filed against CLBN in the Los Angeles courts, would still be pursued. In truth, however, the December 30 ruling by Mr William Allen, the Court Chancellor, has shed little glory on anyone. At the heart of the Delaware legal battle has been a 'corporate governance' agreement which CLBN obliged Mr Parretti to accept last spring, after the heavily-leveraged acquisition of MGM turned into a financial disaster. The bankers hoped that the agreement would effectively insulate the company from Mr Parretti's interference. That proved over-optimistic. In the court action, CLBN - together with its various management appointees, including Mr Ladd - claimed that Mr Parretti's behaviour and repeated violations of the agreement entitled it to change directors and wrest control. Mr Parretti, by contrast, argued that the bank manipulated him and MGM into a precarious situation, with the very intention of seizing the reins. Not only did Chancellor Allen side with CLBN, but he did so in unequivocal terms, repeatedly dismissing Mr Parretti's testimony as untrue. 'I have been forced to conclude,' he declared at the beginning of his judgment, 'that defendants' principal witness, Giancarlo Parretti, did not give truthful testimony when he testified under oath in this court.' Justifications for this assertion are numerous. Indeed, the Chancellor even goes on to quote - and give credence - to a conversation between Mr Parretti and Mr Charles Meeker, a Los Angeles lawyer brought in by CLBN as president of MGM. Mr Parretti, Mr Meeker claimed, threatened him along the lines of 'You have to understand. I am crazy . . . I want you to understand, Meeker, that I am crazy . . . I want you to understand that I am really dangerous. I am very dangerous.' That said, Chancellor Allen also makes clear how speedily doomed the MGM acquisition was - with a cash crisis descending 'almost immediately' - and how wantonly exposed CLBN became. He is not required to explore why a subsidiary of a leading bank arrived at this position without ensuring sufficient controls, but the question hangs in the air throughout his ruling. Finally, the Delaware judgment cuts through some of the claims and counter-claims over where financing for the MGM deal was eventually secured. If nothing else, this was the height of financial ingenuity. Chancellor Allen's description of the funding as 'Byzantine' barely does it credit.</p>

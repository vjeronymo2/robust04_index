			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN)--German Chancellor Helmut Kohl  believes there is a "very good chance" that the governing  coalition with the FDP [Free Democratic Party] can be continued  after the Bundestag elections in October. Kohl also made it  clear in Bonn today that he expects the Free Democrats to issue  a coalition pledge in favor of the Union. The FDP has always  known what is in its own best interests, Kohl said. He is  confident they will continue to do so. In addition to this, they  can hardly point out to voters the good work done by the  coalition and at the same time announce its break-up.</p>

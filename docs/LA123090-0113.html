			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> THOUSAND OAKS RIPS BUENA, 103-66  </P> <P> Don't be surprised if the Ventura tournament becomes a fixture on Thousand Oaks  High's preleague schedule.  </P> <P> The Lancers, who first played in the tournament in the mid-1970s then won the  consolation championship last season in their second appearance, blasted Buena,  103-66, in the title game Saturday night at Ventura High.  </P> <P> With tournament most valuable player Chris Loll scoring 34 points and Buena  getting into early foul trouble, Thousand Oaks controlled the tempo after the  first quarter.  </P> <P> The Lancer defense also slowed down Bulldog guard Lance Fay, holding him to 17  points after he scored 31 in a semifinal win over Lompoc on Friday.  </P> <P> "He was our No. 1 concern coming into the game," Thousand Oaks Coach Ed  Chevalier said. "We must have said his name in practice 50 times today. And I  think the kids got the message."  </P> <P> The win was the fifth in a row for Thousand Oaks (9-1) and gives the Lancers  plenty of momentum as they head into their Marmonte League opener against  Newbury Park on Wednesday.  </P> <P> "That was important to us," Chevalier said. "We stressed that with the kids."  </P> <P> Loll, who made 14 of 20 shots from the field and five of six free throws, also  had nine rebounds, three blocked shots and three steals.  </P> <P> Led by Loll with 99 points in three games, Thousand Oaks set a tournament  record for total points with 282, breaking the previous best of 256 by Ventura  in 1968. The Lancers' total against Buena was a school record.  </P> <P> Junior guard Andrew Borg scored 15 points and senior guard Brian Capella, an  all-tournament selection, added 11 for Thousand Oaks, which won its own  tournament two weeks ago.  </P> <P> Matt Bortolin, Fay's backcourt mate, scored a team-high 19 points for Buena  (6-4), the two-time defending tournament champion.  </P> <P> In other games:  </P> <P> Camarillo 74, Lompoc 67 -- David Harbour and David Nathaniel each scored 17  points for Camarillo (5-2) in the third-place game.  </P> <P> Harbour, who made only seven of 21 shots from the field and three of nine free  throws, scored 14 of his points after intermission.  </P> <P> Channel Islands 66, Ventura 61 -- Marlowe Durmiendo scored a game-high 20  points and Noe Noyola added 15 as Channel Islands (8-2) won the consolation  championship. Jon Seiler led Ventura (4-5) with 18 points.  </P></p>

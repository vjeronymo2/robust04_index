			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STARS FAN OUT TO GLITTERY PARTIES AFTER  </P> <P> After watching the Motion Picture Academy dole out awards for 3 1/2 hours,  Hollywood's stars fanned out from the downtown Music Center to glittery parties  thronged by hordes of fans.  </P> <P> "Was it a good show? You can never tell when you're there," said Anjelica  Huston at a bash at the Mondrian Hotel Monday night.  </P> <P> Huston wandered around the palm-tree-lined patio with the likes of Rob Lowe,  Dudley Moore, Billy Crystal, Christina Applegate and former California Gov.  Jerry Brown.  </P> <P> Oliver Stone, winner of the best director Oscar for "Born on the Fourth of  July," was mobbed in the lobby by autograph-seeking fans. He posed briefly for  pictures with Crystal and was hustled into an elevator.  </P> <P> A few blocks up Sunset Boulevard, hundreds of squealing fans cheered a  procession of limousines dropping off passengers at the prestigious Spago party  put on by literary agent Irving (Swifty) Lazar. Inside, guests dined on  Wolfgang Puck's famous pizza and pasta.  </P> <P> Back downtown, the prestigious Board of Governors Ball took on the festive  atmosphere of what it must have been like when the Academy Awards were  celebrated in ballrooms at local hotels.  </P> <P> Music Center patrons had only to move a few yards into a huge white tent with  oversized balloons at the top.  </P> <P> Winners and losers congregated around the dance floor and congratulated and  commiserated with each other in a communal spirit rarely seen in today's  Hollywood.  </P> <P> Warren Beatty and Jack Nicholson, who handed out the best picture award to  "Driving Miss Daisy," checked out the scene and chatted with friends like  Jessica Lange and Daryl Hannah.  </P> <P> Best actress winner Jessica Tandy and her husband of 47 years, Hume Cronyn,  accepted congratulations at their table while Martin Scorsese, Spike Lee and  Danny Aiello represented the New York crowd in their own corner.  </P> <P> "Mighty good show," commented past Oscar winner Gregory Peck, who presented the  best actress award to Miss Tandy for her starring role in "Driving Miss Daisy."  </P></p>

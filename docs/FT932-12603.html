			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Clinton keeps the Balkans guessing: The debate in Washington on what a 'stronger' Balkans policy should mean PRESIDENT Bill Clinton can choose his words with great care. One adjective he has used more than once when publicly discussing his options in Bosnia is 'humble', both in contemplating the enormity of any form of US intervention and the intractability of the Balkan problem. This sense of humility extends beyond the Oval Office to many of those contributing to the public debate on Bosnia. For though there is a vocal US lobby for a maximalist US role, there are also plenty of voices advising caution. Both camps accept that there are no easy options. Caught squarely in the confused middle is the American public, intermittently bombarded with graphic media coverage but not consistently so. Last week, for example, the bloody end of the siege in Waco pushed Bosnia down the newslists. The latest Newsweek poll split evenly - 47 per cent to 47 per cent - in response to the question of whether Bosnia was America's problem. A CNN/Gallup survey found a 62-30 per cent opposition to air strikes. It is worth noting that Mr Clinton pays very careful attention to public opinion. Divisions on the Bosnian options apply to Capitol Hill, where two Democrats influential in foreign affairs take diametrically opposed views. Congressman Lee Hamilton of Indiana, chairman of the House foreign affairs committee, argues that Bosnia is not a vital US interest, believes in continuing with sanctions and diplomatic pressure. But Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware, chairman of the European sub-committee of the foreign relations committee and just back from Bosnia, has put out an eight-point plan including immediate western air strikes and the lifting of the UN arms embargo against Bosnia itself. Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, has also come out guardedly in favour of air strikes. Inside the administration, similar divisions apply. Mrs Madeleine Albright, the UN ambassador, has advocated air strikes, allowable, she says, without further UN approval. The 12 regional desk officers at the State Department endorse this approach. Mr Les Aspin, the secretary of defence, and Mr Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, are thought to favour limited offensive action. But Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, is thought to favour caution, as does General Colin Powell, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. Mr Clinton, who has problems with his own military on several fronts, acknowledged at his press conference last week the legitimacy of Gen Powell's view that 'we must have a clearly defined objective that must be met'. In the media, the heavyweight pundits of the New York Times - Les Gelb, Anthony Lewis and A M Rosenthal - have thundered behind the cause of US action. But the Boston Globe at the weekend advised against unilateral bombing. Richard Cohen, the Washington Post columnist, wrote yesterday that the public debate was still mostly among 'engaged Op Ed writers' and that no popular mandate existed behind intervention. Also weighing in behind intervention have been Mr Elie Wiesel, addressing Mr Clinton directly at last week's opening in Washington of the Holocaust museum, and, yesterday, Mr George Shultz, secretary of state in the Reagan administration, who called for 'very large, sustained air and sea based attack' on positions inside Serbia itself. Amid this confusing welter of external and internal advice, with western Europe, after its latest foreign ministerial meeting, incapable of doing other than wait on the US initiative, and with still some uncertainty about the Russian reaction even after Sunday's referendum victory for President Boris Yeltsin, Mr Clinton has promised 'a stronger policy' by the US and its allies 'within a few days'. The New York Times, quoting an unidentified senior official, reported yesterday that the most likely US action would involve a programme of limited bombing of Bosnian Serb installations, designed to produce a ceasefire and a new round of negotiations. But it said that lifting the arms embargo was still under active consideration as an alternative to air strikes. This would be preceded by further consultation with US allies and at the UN, perhaps including a European trip by Mr Christopher or another senior official, more White House meetings, and extensive consultation with Congress. The task of preparing America for what comes next has barely begun.</p>

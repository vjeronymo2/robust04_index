			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: Chairman of Taiwan Aerospace resigns MR DAVID HUANG, chairman of Taiwan Aerospace, a consortium of the Taiwan government and local companies, has resigned. The move provides further evidence that the government is distancing itself from the consortium's proposed Dollars 2bn deal with McDonnell Douglas, the aircraft manufacturer, to buy up to 40 per cent of the US group's commercial aircraft operations, and manufacture parts in Taiwan. Mr Huang quit ahead of a meeting on April 22, when executives of Taiwan Aerospace and Mr Vincent Siew, Economics Minister, are to decide to what extent to go ahead with the deal. Although state-owned companies hold 29 per cent of Taiwan Aerospace, the government recently denied direct sponsorship of the proposed deal, in response to criticism that financial problems make McDonnell Douglas a bad choice for such a venture. Analysts say that Mr Huang's resignation shows a cooling in the government's approach to the deal, and indicates that Taiwan Aerospace might take as little as a 25 per cent stake in McDonnell Douglas.</p>

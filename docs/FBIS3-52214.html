At the talks, the Pakistani delegation will be led by the  foreign secretary, Dr. Shaharyar M. Khan. The Indian side will  be led by its foreign secretary, J.N. Dixit. The Indian foreign  secretary arrived in Islamabad last night with a four-member  delegation to participate in the talks.    Speaking to newsmen at the airport, Mr. Dixit said Kashmir  is  an outstanding issue between Pakistan and India and both sides  will seriously discuss it in view of its significance. Replying  to queries of newsmen, he said there might be differences in the  perceptions of the two countries. They, however, will make  efforts to understand each other's points of view and to narrow  down differences on the Kashmir issue. Asked whether there will  be a discussion on the issue of holding a plebiscite in Kashmir,  Dixit said both sides can raise questions according to their  stand on the issue. When he was asked whether both sides will  exchange views on resolving the Kashmir issue along the lines of  autonomy granted to the Palestinians in the Gaza territory, the  Indian foreign secretary said it depends upon the nations  concerned. If they learn lessons and experiences from history,  it will be better for them. Mr. Dixit refused to say whether he  has brought a new proposal for the seventh round of talks. He  said there is no program to involve Kashmiri representatives at  the current round of talks.    Foreign Secretary Shaharyar M. Khan, who will lead the  Pakistani delegation, said Pakistan is glad that India agreed to  hold talks on all aspects of the Kashmir issue. He said both  sides will consider the issue with seriousness. He expressed  the hope that there would be progress at the talks between the  two sides.    Radio Pakistan's diplomatic representative says Pakistan and  India expressed their readiness to resume secretary-level talks  to discuss all outstanding issues, including all aspects of the  Kashmir issue, last November. The previous round of talks was  held in New Delhi in August 1992. Pakistan is expected to urge  India to honor the aspirations of the Kashmiri people and pave  the way for a plebiscite in the area to find out their opinion  in accordance with the UN Security Council.    It is expected that Dixit will also call on President Farooq  Ahmad Khan Leghari and Foreign Minister Asif Ahmad Ali.</p>

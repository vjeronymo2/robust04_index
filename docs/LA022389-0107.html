			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The AFL-CIO will hold "Worker Memorial Day" ceremonies in several cities across  the country on April 28, the 18th anniversary of the Occupational Safety and  Health Act, to pay homage to the thousands of workers who have been killed or  injured or contracted diseases on the job each year. Among the sites of rallies  will be Henderson, Nev., where two people were killed and 250 injured in a  mammoth blast that leveled a plant making rocket fuel last year; Bridgeport,  Conn., where 28 workers were killed in the collapse of a high-rise building  under construction in 1987, and Cincinnati, which is near an Energy Department  nuclear fuel processing plant where workers daily face the possibility of  exposure to radioactive materials, said Margaret Seminario, the AFL-CIO's  health and safety director.  </P></p>

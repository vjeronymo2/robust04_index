			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 1 (YONHAP) -- Japan has not detected  any signs that North Korea is about to provoke a war against the  South, despite rumors of a crisis on the peninsula caused by  Pyongyang's suspected nuclear arms program, a Japanese newspaper  quoted a Defense Ministry source as saying Friday.    The source, who has collected and analyzed various data on  North Korean military moves, said the communist state is not in  a state of extreme tension nor is it taking any preparatory  action for war, the MAINICHI SHIMBUN reported.    "There is no strange sign in North Korea. We cannot catch  any change in communications or frequency in North Korean  military bases. They did not stop periodical reconnaissance  flights either," the source was quoted as saying.    Defense Ministry staff do not think an emergency will arise  at this stage, he said.</p>

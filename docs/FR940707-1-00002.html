These proposed rules have been organized into a new part 1003 within chapter X of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations. They streamline and distill the procedures governing the conduct of proceedings before the OHA and update pertinent filing information. They will be utilized by OHA in cases that do not involve the former Federal petroleum price and allocation control regulations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments may be submitted by September 6, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Seven copies of written comments should be mailed to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Marcia B.

Introduction and Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) is a quasi-judicial body reporting to the Secretary of Energy. It is generally responsible for conducting informal adjudicative proceedings of DOE where there is provision for separation of functions, other than those which are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In connection with these duties, OHA holds hearings, receives evidence, develops the record, and issues final agency determinations, which are subject to review in the Federal courts. Except for regulations governing proceedings before the Board of Contract Appeals and other transaction appeals boards in DOE, which are components of the Office of Hearings and Appeals, procedural regulations governing OHA practice generally appear in part 205 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Part 205 is a part of chapter II, Subchapter A of the DOE regulations, and are designed to apply to matters involving the former oil price and allocation control regulations which were in effect during the period 1973 through 1981. Because those oil-related proceedings are winding down, and the OHA is conducting a variety of other informal adjudications for the Department, it has become apparent that the OHA procedural regulations should appear in chapter X of title 10, which contains the general provisions of DOE regulations. The rules will be organized into a new part 1003 within chapter X. At the same time, procedures governing the conduct of proceedings before the OHA have been streamlined, and pertinent filing information has been updated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Apart from general filing procedures, the regulations proposed today set forth OHA procedures for adjudicating various applications, petitions, motions and related requests filed by the public. These regulations include procedures for the filing of:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Applications for Exception from DOE orders, regulations and rulings;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Appeals of DOE orders;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Applications for Stay of DOE orders;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Motions for Modification or Rescission of OHA orders;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Requests for Conferences and Hearings before OHA; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Petitions for Special Redress or Other Relief.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These rules are not intended to grant by themselves any new authority to the Office of Hearings and Appeals to conduct informal adjudications. They are designed to provide standard procedural rules that may be used to cover a variety of situations that may be encountered by the many different programs that the Department implements. There are two ways these regulations become effective. First, the procedures outlined in these rules become effective where program rules specifically reference them and state that a member of the public can make a request for relief under these rules. For example, the program regulations that the Department promulgated in the Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products states that any person receiving an order may file an appeal with the Office of Hearings and Appeals utilizing that office's appellate rules. See 10 CFR 430.27(n). Similarly, in implementing the Payments-Equal-to-Taxes provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the Department stated that an entity may file an appeal with the Office of Hearings and Appeals of a DOE payment equal to taxes (PETT) determination utilizing the OHA's 10 CFR part 205, subpart H appellate rules. See Payments-Equal-To-Taxes Provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as Amended, Interpretation and Procedures, as published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on August 27, 1991 (56 FR 42314).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, these rules may be effective where a statute requires the Department to provide procedures that permit the public to seek redress, and the appropriate departmental official has delegated the responsibility to implement that requirement to the Office of Hearings and Appeals. For example, section 504 of the Department of Energy Organization Act requires the Secretary to provide for the making of adjustments to any rule, regulation or order issued under four statutes_the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973 (since expired), the Federal Energy Administration Act, the Energy Supply and Environmental Coordination Act of 1974, and the Energy Policy and Conservation Act_as may be necessary to prevent serious financial hardship, inequity, or unfair distribution of burdens. The Secretary has delegated that responsibility to the Office of Hearings and Appeals, which promulgated rules by which members of the public could seek an exception to rules, regulations or orders issued under the four named statutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

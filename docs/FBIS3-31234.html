			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As our correspondent from Bihac, Mirza Sadikovic,  reports, the Serbian aggressor today continues with fierce  attacks on Bihac. The heroes of the 5th Corps are resisting  horrendous artillery-tank cannonades and infantry attacks that  are being carried out in waves by the so-called Glamoc Wolves --  Karadzic's killers and mercenaries. Helicopters have been  reintroduced again which are skillfully taking advantage of  [word indistinct] and performing a twofold task. First, they  are bringing heavy artillery from the hills around Sarajevo and  at the same time surveying the hills. They help in evacuation  of injured and killed chetniks, whose number in Vrapcici is  growing. Several tens of howitzer bombs have landed on the  villages around Cazin and Bihac since this morning. While the  heroes of the 5th Corps and the people of the free part of the  Bihac district have been bleeding for 11 days, dying on the  streets while everything here is being destroyed, Fikret Abdic  [president of autonomous region of western Bosnia] proceeds in  his shameful task of betraying his own people. In the morning  the forces of his army in the Cazin commune again attacked the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army soldiers in the area [word indistinct]  and (?Resic). Because the attacks are still underway, no  information about the casualties has been released yet, but it  is certain that several of the 5th Corps soldiers have been  wounded.    The Croatian Army is attacking the center of Gornji Vakuf  today also. Our correspondent Akif Agic reports that the  Croatian offensive in central Bosnia is suffering blows daily.    Yesterday, the enemy continued with the provocations in the  zone of responsibility of the 3d Operative Group. Our  correspondent Smajl Terzic reports that in Tesanj, in the  Kalosevic area, a great number of our fighters managed to repel  what has, so far, been the strongest enemy infantry attack. In  the ensuing counterattack in the form of a saboteur action, they  inflicted great losses in manpower to the enemy.    As the information service of the 1st Corps reports, some  parts of the town [Sarajevo] were not spared the chetnik  activities today either. The aggressor is contemplating [words  indistinct] cease-fire. This particularly refers to Sokolje and  its surroundings, which has been targeted by antiaircraft  machine guns from Rajlovac since early morning. [Word  indistinct] localities from the same direction several tens of  grenades have landed already. Chetnik killers with sniper  rifles with silencers are active at several localities in the  town. In the vicinity of Vrbanja Most, one person was killed.  The perfidiousness of [word indistinct] is, therefore,  limitless. (?The Army) urges maximal caution while moving about  the town.</p>

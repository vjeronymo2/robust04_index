"We are willing to cooperate with the Mexican Government in  whatever it believes we can cooperate," Cristiani told a news  conference. The Salvadoran president asked today the  Legislative Assembly for permission to leave the country, and  according to the president, he "might" go to Mexico this weekend.    Cristiani said that he was "disappointed" by the outbreak of  clashes between the Mexican Armed Forces and the so-called  Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN), which supports  demands of the very poor Indian population in Chiapas State, on  the border with Guatemala.    Along with Spain, Colombia, and Venezuela, Mexico forms part  of the "group of friendly countries" which supported the  negotiations between the Cristiani government and the former  rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, which  in 1992 ended a 12-year-old civil war in El Salvador.</p>

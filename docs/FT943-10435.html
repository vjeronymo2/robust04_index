			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Sweden rebukes Russia over spy Sweden yesterday withdrew permission for Russia to post a military attache in Stockholm and protested strongly to Moscow for continuing to employ a Swedish spy originally recruited by the Soviet intelligence services. Senior officials said Mr Stig Bergling, a Soviet double agent who escaped from a Swedish jail in 1987 but who returned home unexpectedly this week, had served as an officer in the GRU military intelligence services in Lebanon until recently. They accused the Russian authorities of denying knowledge of Mr Bergling to Swedish officials - including Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister. 'This shows that the structures and thinking of the old era are still alive in Russia,' Mr Bildt said. 'They ought to have admitted what happened in a democratic spirit.' The prime minister added, however, that the case posed no threat to links between Sweden and Russia. Mr Bergling's sudden reappearance revived Sweden's most serious cold war spy scandal. Although neutral, Sweden has always had a strong military which, recent revelations show, has had contacts with US and Nato forces. As a senior security services officer, Mr Bergling apparently passed on information on Sweden's military planning. He was jailed for life in 1979 after being caught by Israeli agents but escaped.</p>

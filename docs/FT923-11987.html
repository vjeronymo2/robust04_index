			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Sotheby's will sell Thurn und Taxis treasures: Saleroom SOTHEBY'S is to sell works of art from the collection of the Prince of Thurn und Taxis - one of the finest private art collections in the world - and hopes thereby to begin to restore its flagging fortunes. Johannes, 11th Prince von Thurn and Taxis, died suddenly in December 1990, leaving a nine-year-old heir, Prince Albert. Death duties have forced the family to value its collection and to sell works of art, which are expensive to maintain and offer no income, rather than the family's land and industrial holdings. The collection is mainly housed at Regensburg in Bavaria, and incorporates art and furnishings from the 25 castles the family disposed of between 1920 and 1970. The Thurn und Taxis fortune is traced back to the 15th century, when Franz von Taxis established the first postal service in the Holy Roman Empire. The first auction, to be held in Geneva on November 16 and 17, will include jewels, silver, and works of art. It is expected to raise Pounds 8m, although with the art market depressed, Sotheby's has set very modest estimates. The actual total raised for works of exceptional provenance and rarity may be much higher. Among the most desirable lots are two rare 18th-century diamond and emerald pendants bearing the insignia of the Order of the Golden Fleece, valued at Pounds 300,000 and Pounds 100,000, and the pearl and diamond tiara commissioned by Napoleon III on his marriage to the Empress Eugenie in 1853. It is composed of precious stones and pearls from the French State Treasury and carries a conservative estimate of Pounds 100,000. A jewelled and hardstone snuff box created for Frederick the Great about 1760 is estimated at Pounds 800,000. Among the silver, the most expensive item should be a silver gilt ewer and salver made in Augsburg around 1740 by Johann Christoph Stenglin: it carries an estimate of up to Pounds 280,000. Sotheby's expects to organise more sales from the collection over the next few years: the extent of the family's tax demands have yet to be finalised. There might also be a wish to raise money for Prince Albert's two sisters. A sum of Pounds 40m has been estimated for the eventual realisation of the dispersal, although the 500-room castle at Regensburg will remain full of treasures. At Sotheby's in London yesterday, an auction of English literature totalled Pounds 589,655 but was 37 per cent unsold, confirming that the recession is affecting sections of the art market traditionally dominated by serious collectors and immune to setbacks.</p>

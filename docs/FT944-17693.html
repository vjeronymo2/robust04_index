			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / BSkyB to go public with Pounds 1bn shares sale British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television company, confirmed yesterday that it plans to go public by staging a share issue on the London and New York markets. The issue, tentatively scheduled to take place before Christmas, is expected to involve the sale of up to Pounds 1bn of new BSkyB shares, or 20 per cent of its enlarged equity, valuing the company at just under Pounds 5bn. The news of the proposed flotation marks the culmination of BSkyB's spectacular recovery after its troubled launch period and years of losses. It follows this summer's announcement that the company, which now has over 3.45m subscribers, increased operating profits to Pounds 176.8m in the year to June from Pounds 54.1m in the previous year. 'We all expected BSkyB to go public at some stage,' said Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive of Granada, the UK leisure group which is one of the company's four shareholders. 'It was simply a question of whether it would be sooner or later.' The proceeds of the issue, which will be sponsored by Goldman Sachs and Lazard Brothers, will be used to reduce BSkyB's Pounds 1.7bn debt: specifically to repay the Pounds 1.2bn portion of the debt given or guaranteed by its four shareholders. Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, will be the chief beneficiary because, as the largest investor with 50 per cent, it provided roughly half the Pounds 1.2bn shareholder debt. It should receive around Pounds 500m. The other shareholders - Pearson, the media group that owns the Financial Times, Chargeurs, the French textile company, and Granada - will benefit largely from the eradication of their debt guarantees. Pearson's shares yesterday rose by 8p to 590p. News Corporation's shares, however, were unchanged at 229p, Granada's slipped by  1/2 p to 490 1/2 p and Chargeurs' fell by FFr29 to FFr1,284. The impetus for the flotation is understood to have come from BSkyB's management. Chargeurs is believed to have been the only shareholder to have been hesitant but it has struck a deal to buy more shares, avoiding dilution of its stake. Lex, Page 20 London stocks, Page 38</p>

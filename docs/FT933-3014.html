			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / ANC call to lift sanctions soon MR Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, is expected this month to call for the lifting of sanctions. The stigma of doing business with South Africa will at last have been removed. Yet this signal, for which investors have waited years, risks being being undermined by a damaging dispute between the government and the ANC over cellular telephone licences. The issue has become so serious that Mr Mandela and President F W de Klerk this month held a meeting purely on this subject. The cabinet was yesterday preparing to authorise the issue of the two licences which on Tuesday Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary general, warned would be reviewed and possibly revoked by a new government. Vodafone of the UK has a 35 per cent stake in Vodacom, one consortium expected to win a licence. The public utility Telkom has a 50 per cent stake and Rembrandt 15 per cent. The other consortium likely to be successful includes Cable &amp; Wireless. The two winners will run competing services. Although the ANC says it is not opposed to cellular telephone networks, it has raised numerous objections to the way in which the government is issuing the licences. The ANC maintains the government is proceeding with 'unilateral restructuring' of the economy, that is trying to privatise the telecommunications network, and that the technology chosen is too expensive and unsuitable for South Africa. Within the government and the business community these reasons are widely dismissed as a fig-leaf for objections that are purely political  - that government money should no longer be spent without the ANC's agreement. There is also a more insidious suspicion that the ANC is trying to delay the issue of the licences in order to allow various US and Scandinavian companies to participate when sanctions in those countries are lifted. There have even been unsubstantiated suggestions that the ANC expects financial contributions from successful bidders. On the ideological level, the ANC believes cellular phones should be run by the state - and subsidised if need be - while the government sees them as a means of introducing competition into the telecommunications sector. It also sees a cellular network as the cheapest and quickest means of offering most South Africans access to a telephone. The message to foreign investors will be clear and unpalatable: the ANC remains an organisation that favours state over market, and South Africa remains a country where political interference can be expected in business decisions. If the government presses ahead with awarding licences, there must be some doubt as to whether those chosen will proceed while the security of their investment remains in doubt. Each licence is expected to involve the investment of about R1bn (Pounds 193m), with an estimated R700m of this coming from abroad. In South Africa telephone penetration (fixed phones per 100 people) is only 9.6 (about 2.4 in the black community; ten times that among whites). This compares to only 1.5 for the rest of Africa but to an average of about 50 for developed countries. The tender documents stressed that a criterion which would 'weigh heavily' was the extent to which the applicant was prepared to provide telephone services to the underdeveloped part of the community, almost certainly at subsidised tariffs. Vodacom's plans include introducing at least 22,000 subsidised card-operated community telephones to over 60 township and rural areas. Mr Alan Knott-Craig, chief executive, argues: 'It took us 100 years to provide 1 per cent of blacks with telephones. Within five years we aim to provide 10m South Africans with meaningful access to telephones.'</p>

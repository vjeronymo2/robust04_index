			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TIME TRAVELER;  </P> <P> FLIGHT ON RESTORED B-17 IS A JOURNEY TO THE PAST  </P> <P> The air in the radio compartment throbs angrily and the tentative shudder of  the fuselage at low revolutions becomes a shake and then a wild cacophony of  rattles and growls and blasting roars as, on the other side of the bomb bay,  David Tallichet presses the four throttles forward. The old plane strains  against the brakes.  </P> <P>  Finally, Tallichet releases the pressure on the rudder pedals and Number  44-83546 begins its takeoff run, rapidly accelerating toward the hills in the  west. Still ground-bound, the plane continues to buffet and wind begins to howl  through the open hatch above the radio compartment.  </P> <P>  Then, almost imperceptibly, we are airborne, and Tallichet begins the slow  climb out of Chino Airport. It is an exalting sight to look backward out of the  hatch, down the fuselage and past the tail and see the dairy farms recede in  the crackling air as Number 44-83546 thunders into the sun.  </P> <P>  Below, on the roads, brake lights wink on and cars slow as the drivers see the  great green ghost rising. It is an awesome object, out of place and time, and  it leaves an indelible print on the mind's eye.  </P> <P>  The eyes below squint to see the writing on the nose, beneath the gun. Does it  really say "Memphis Belle?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> It was a visit to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington in the  early 1960s, along with some encouragement from another collector, that did it,  Tallichet says.  </P> <P> "I left Washington excited," he says. "I said, by God, that's what I'm going to  do. I'm going to collect airplanes."  </P> <P> Tallichet had the means to do it, and the flying background. He flew 21  missions over occupied Europe in early 1945 as the co-pilot of a B-17 Flying  Fortress heavy bomber. After the war he remained on active Air Force reserve  status until 1957, flying a variety of aircraft.  </P> <P> Then, in 1958, after a dissatisfying stint as a supply officer, he went on  inactive status and opened his first restaurant, the Reef in Long Beach. It was  the first of what would become a nationwide network of restaurants operated by  Anaheim-based Specialty Restaurants Corp., of which Tallichet is today  president and chief executive officer.  </P> <P> As the money came in from the successful restaurant business, Tallichet and his  partner at the time bought a pair of vintage planes, a Stearman and a T-34.  Shortly after, Tallichet bought his first P-51 Mustang fighter for $13,000 and  the promise of extensive spare parts that could be sold to pay off the loan.  The seller skipped with the parts, leaving Tallichet to pick up the tab. Today,  he said, he still has the restored P-51, which is now worth about $500,000.  </P> <P> After his Smithsonian visit, Tallichet began collecting and swapping planes  throughout the world with the elan of a horse trader. He created the  Chino-based Military Aircraft Restoration Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of  Specialty Restaurants, specifically to handle the traffic in vintage military  aircraft.  </P> <P> "In relation to today," he says, "the planes were quite cheap and business was  good, and I made quite a few trips" to places like New Guinea, the Yukon  territory of British Columbia, India -- all to buy or sell old airplanes. He  has owned, bought, traded or restored -- and, for the most part, flown -- such  historical craft as B-25 Mitchell bombers, Korean-era MiG jets, P-40 Tomahawk  fighters, F4U Corsairs, even giant B-29 bombers.  </P> <P> Today, the 68-year-old Orange resident, through his company, owns about 100  planes in various stages of restoration, most of which are World War II vintage  military aircraft. The majority of the collection is at Chino Airport. Between  30 and 40 of them, he says, are fully airworthy. By any yardstick, it is an  impressive collection.  </P> <P> But, Tallichet says, none of the planes have gotten quite the amount of  attention that Number 44-83546 has received in the past couple of months. It is  a fully restored B-17G heavy bomber -- and Tallichet flew it during the filming  of the current film "Memphis Belle."  </P> <P> The plane played the title role.  </P> <P> Forty-six years ago, combat pilots loved this plane. It was easy to handle. It  was forgiving. It was tough. Some called it a tank with wings. Dozens of them  got shot to pieces in the ferocious battles over Europe and still flew their  crews home.  </P> <P>  "It's an easy, gentle, sweet airplane to fly," Tallichet says. "You'd have to  have a lot of bad luck or stupidity or both to hurt yourself in a B-17."  </P> <P>  But it was built for function, purely. Creature comforts in this restored  model are few. To walk from the radio room amidships to the cockpit, one must  traverse the bomb bay on a catwalk barely the width of one's shoe.  </P> <P>  But beyond the darkness of the bomb bay is the brilliance of the cockpit,  where Tallichet watches the gauges as the plane makes a left climbing bank. The  whirling propellers are only inches away, but it is less noisy here because the  engines are now behind us and no wind rushes in. It is perfect flying weather  and the sun floods in.  </P> <P>  Still, it is not the sort of flying that commercial airline passengers are  used to. The four huge, 1,200-horsepower Wright Cyclone engines vibrate every  inch of the airframe, and the cabin is not pressurized. There are sudden and  unexpected small surges in altitude that force the knees to bend if one is  standing up and it makes crawling under the cockpit and into the nose a  stop-and-go task.  </P> <P>  But the nose holds several revelations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tallichet acquired his B-17 the same way he got many of his planes: though a  series of sales, deals, horse trades, some coincidental, some intentional. The  brief version holds that Tallichet acquired and restored an Air Force B-29  bomber and the Air Force, in return, gave him a huge C-123 transport, which he  then traded to a firefighting company for a B-17 they were using as a plane to  drop water and chemicals on forest fires.  </P> <P> He began to scour the world for parts: a top turret, a ball turret, war surplus  radio gear, bomb bay doors, a Norden bombsight. Everything it would take to  restore the plane to its wartime configuration. That was eight years ago.  </P> <P> Several months later, Catherine Wyler, daughter of the filmmaker William Wyler,  began to piece together a plan for a fictionalized film based on her father's  widely seen wartime documentary film about the combat career of the real  Memphis Belle and her crew. As the production began to take shape and the  search began for airworthy B-17s -- there are only a handful left in the world  -- Catherine Wyler called on her uncle, David Tallichet.  </P> <P> "She knew her uncle had gone through many years of his life and never found  that hero status he wanted, being kind of a nobody in the war," Tallichet says.  "So she said, 'Would you like to fly in my movie?' And I said, 'You bet I  would.' "  </P> <P> Last year, Tallichet flew his B-17 to England, where it was modified and  painted to resemble the real Memphis Belle. (The real Memphis Belle is today  restored as a static exhibit in Memphis.)  </P> <P> Robert Morgan, the pilot of the original Memphis Belle, made a flight at the  controls of Tallichet's version of the plane while in England to observe the  filming, his first flight in a B-17 since the war. A studio press release  quotes Morgan as saying at the time that the flight "was like five Christmases  all on the same day."  </P> <P> The nose, like everyplace else in the plane, is cramped, but it doesn't feel  that way, at least not on the bombardier's seat. The seat is a small, padded  swivel chair and it is at the very tip of the nose, just behind the Plexiglas  bubble and the black metal Norden bombsight. The view of the ground is  unimpeded and panoramic. It is like being hurled through space independent of  engines, airplanes, physics.  </P> <P>  It is the sort of view -- and feeling -- you get when you fly in your dreams.  </P> <P>  It is even quieter here, farther forward of the engines, in the area airmen  called the greenhouse. Still, it's not difficult to visualize what a terrifying  place it could have been while flying through fields of greasy flak or head-on  fighter attacks.  </P> <P>  On this flight, however, there is nothing but bright sun and the comforting  sight, just out of the tiny side windows, of the giant engines drumming away  relentlessly. It is very easy to fall in love with this airplane.  </P> <P> </P> <P> How much does it cost to keep a B-17? That depends, Tallichet says, on whether  it works.  </P> <P> "You're going good until you lose an engine," he says. "That'll cost you 30  grand."  </P> <P> And the parts are out there, somewhere, "in a garage, in a back yard.  Someplace, somebody has the part if you have the money to pay for it,"  Tallichet says.  </P> <P> The aviation fuel the plane gulps by the hundreds of gallons usually is paid  for by those who hire Tallichet to fly the plane at air shows and other  aviation events.  </P> <P> He says he doesn't know what his B-17 is worth, and he doesn't want to sell it.  But, he says, the last airworthy B-17 sold in the United States probably went  for between $400,000 and $500,000 two years ago.  </P> <P> The modern version of the Memphis Belle has kept Tallichet's Military Aircraft  Restoration Corp. out of the red for the first time in its history, he says.  </P> <P> "We lost money every year but last year," he says. "That's when they made  'Memphis Belle.' The money we got from that gave us our first profitable year."  </P> <P> Tallichet jokingly calls his passion for planes "an idiot's hobby." But for the  man who says he never saw a propeller-driven fighter from the pilot's seat of a  bomber until the filming of "Memphis Belle," it is an enterprise that keeps him  young.  </P> <P> "You fly it for the challenge, I think," he says. "I'm 68, and it's kind of fun  to be flying in 1990 when most of my colleagues have long ago given up flying."  </P> <P> The wind and the prop blast rush into the waist ports and over the mock-up  .50-caliber guns, and the muscles in the thighs work harder to keep the body  standing as Tallichet makes a final long, lazy bank to set up his final  approach. The wind, the gently changing view out the open window, the pounding  of the engines, the gold of the setting sun, all combine to become achingly  exhilarating.  </P> <P>  The wheels ($1,350 each) screech quickly on the runway and Tallichet turns the  giant plane onto a taxiway. The propellers immediately raise a huge cloud of  dark brown dust from the adjacent dirt infield. Out on the ramp, knots of  people stand and stare, still transfixed, at this apparition from the past that  comes thundering slowly toward them. It is too loud, too insistent, too  overpowering to be a ghost.  </P> <P>  But it is almost too wonderful to be real.  </P> <P> </P></p>

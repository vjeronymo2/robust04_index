Regarding reports about  comments made by Kinkel in interviews over the weekend, Foreign  Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann said the minister had only  said he would not shy away from a political dialogue with  Zhirinovskiy and his party. Given the election success of the  right-wing extremist in Russia, this dialogue could not be  avoided in the long-term. [passage omitted]</p>

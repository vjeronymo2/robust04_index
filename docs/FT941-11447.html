			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Judges overturn price tag ruling The High Court yesterday ruled that Toys R Us was wrongly convicted and fined Pounds 22,200 for putting price tags on items which did not tally with till prices. Two judges said in a test case that the toys retailer should be acquitted of 34 offences of misleading the public because it was company practice for staff to check that ticket prices on items for sale matched those appearing on bar codes read at the tills. When discrepancies occurred, till operators were required to charge the customer the lower price. Lord Justice Kennedy, sitting with Mr Justice Scott Baker, said this meant goods were in reality 'available' at the lower price and therefore no offence had been committed under the 1987 Consumer Protection Act. The judges directed magistrates at Whitminster, Gloucestershire, who found Toys R Us guilty of the 34 offences in December 1992, to acquit the company on charges brought by the county council's trading standards department. The department indicated that the case might go to the House of Lords for a final ruling.</p>

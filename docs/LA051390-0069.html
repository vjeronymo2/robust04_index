			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STREET LEGAL;  </P> <P> YOUTHS FORM NEW 'GANGS' WITH DESIGNS ON CHANGING GRAFFITI TAGGING INTO ART  </P> <P> "Spank" is one of many young toughs in Hollywood who have grown tired of the  gang fighting and graffiti tagging of buildings that have for years been the  pastimes of choice on the streets.  </P> <P> A growing number of youths like Spank are choosing another way to express  themselves. They are joining "crews," or loose-knit gangs of graffiti artists  who are painting huge, spectacular -- and legal -- murals in Hollywood and  elsewhere in the city.  </P> <P> The crew members, many of them former gang members, are highly competitive, but  in a different way from traditional gang rivalries.  </P> <P> "We do graffiti against each other," said Spank, otherwise known as Julio  Crespo, 20, "without having to kill each other."  </P> <P> Another youth, "Skate," is so enamored of the burgeoning artistic craft that he  now leads his own crew of 20 youngsters. He is teaching them, in his spare time  and for free, to spray paint murals and use airbrush techniques.  </P> <P> "I got into this because it isn't a gang," said Skate, 20, whose given name is  Aaron Anderson. "It's fun, without the violence and the vandalism."  </P> <P> The crew concept originated in New York in the mid-1970s, and crews with names  like "Can't Be Stopped" and "Most Wanted Artists" began cropping up in Los  Angeles about five years ago.  </P> <P> Until recently, they functioned in an outlaw netherworld, where so-called  bombers kept one eye on their "piece," or illegal artwork, and the other eye  peeled for the cops.  </P> <P> While many crew members remain primarily engaged in tagging -- the practice of  marking territory with cryptic names and gang affiliation all over walls --  some, such as Spank and Skate, have become genuine artists.  </P> <P> To underscore this change of emphasis, "Can't Be Stopped," Skate's crew, now  calls itself "Creating Better Styles."  </P> <P> And with the help of a coalition of neighborhood groups called United Streets  of Hollywood, the local crews are being coaxed into the open.  </P> <P> In exchange for being allowed to paint legally on giant spaces, such as  building sides and construction sites, the crews have pledged to work to  eliminate tag-style graffiti and help businesses create the murals, to police  the art pieces themselves and to encourage other youths to get involved.  </P> <P> Motivated by a desire to create, not vandalize, there are now at least 10  Hollywood crews, and more than 500 artists ranging in age from 9 to mid-20s.  </P> <P> "This art is coming from the streets," said Laura Dodson, president of the  neighborhood coalition, who first brought the street artists into contact with  city officials and area businesses.  </P> <P> "Instead of painting it over, we should look at it," Dodson said. "It is  something people should really experience and feel. . . . This is a movement."  </P> <P> Under Dodson's supervision, as many as 200 of the young artists pitched in  recently to paint a vast mural, depicting the theme "Hollywood Legends" on a  plywood wall surrounding the Galaxy construction site at the corner of  Hollywood Boulevard and Sycamore Avenue.  </P> <P> After being approached by Dodson and city officials, project developer  Kornwasser &amp; Friedman agreed to allow the mural and put up $1,000 for paint  and supplies. The mural project, called Boulev Art, began in February and was  unveiled March 25, more than 600 cans of spray paint later.  </P> <P> At the unveiling, City Councilman Michael Woo presented the artists with  commendations from the city for helping to beautify Hollywood. Several youths,  including Spank, ventured to City Hall in late April for more honors.  </P> <P> Before an audience in the ornate City Council chamber, Spank said: "People  stereotype (graffiti artists), saying all we do is vandalize. But we can also  do art that can beautify a city."  </P> <P> Woo says he hopes the artistry can continue on blank walls, alleys and  construction sites throughout Hollywood, as long as the youths receive  permission from building owners. Otherwise, no matter how beautiful, the murals  are illegal and punishable by a potential fine and jail term.  </P> <P> Another project under way by the crews, with Dodson's help, is an ambitious  40-by-1,000-foot mural on the side of a Hollywood disco, done in a colorful  jungle motif. That mural will be finished by mid-June.  </P> <P> Skate says he takes particular pride in that unfinished mural, and says he  looks forward to doing others, even if he does it for free (minus expenses).  </P> <P> "As long as I get the wall and a chance to work, I'm fine," he said in an  interview.  </P> <P> Dodson has continued as a liaison between the street artists, the city and  local businesses.  </P> <P> "People do not realize how many kids are doing this," Dodson said. "The kids  are always being put down, and all they want is to be up. They have talents and  they want to be great artists."  </P> <P> The mural artists say they belong to the culture of "hip-hop," which mixes rap  music, spray paint art, skateboarding and underground dance clubs. Many crews  are highly organized. Indeed, Dodson says she contacts some of them by beeper.  </P> <P> Despite all the changes, Dodson notes that gang attitudes still exist among the  youths, often very close to the surface. "It was touch and go there for a  while" when the crews were working together on the BoulevArt project, she said.  "But we made it through. They realized there was a lot on the line here and  didn't want to mess up."  </P> <P> Some of the artwork is so impressive, Dodson said, that the creators have been  approached for commercial ventures. She said the youths are learning to have a  sense of community spirit and will participate in a June 16 cleanup of  Hollywood in which they will wash off all the tag-style graffiti.  </P> <P> Michael Dubin, Kornwasser &amp; Friedman vice president and a member of the  Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, said he is trying to encourage other businesses  to allow the artists to paint on their walls.  </P></p>

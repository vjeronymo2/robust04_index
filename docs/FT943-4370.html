			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Lord Young left with a face to match his bright red bow tie The phone hype of the year began at 6.30am yesterday morning. Lord Young scooped four minutes live on BBC Radio Four's 'Today' programme to claim that Mercury One-2-One, the mobile phone company run by his Cable &amp; Wireless group, was taking British Telecommunications to the cleaners. One-2-One's 'inside option' would appeal to 'everyone who wants to save money', enthused Lord Young. 'We are the cheapest of all and this is making us now, on this tariff from home, cheaper than BT.' By 9am Lord Young, sporting a bright red bow tie, was before the media unwrapping a huge parcel for One-2-One's first birthday. Out came placards proclaiming that One-2-One 'inside' was 25 per cent cheaper than BT for daytime local calls, 15 per cent cheaper for national calls, and 10 per cent cheaper on international calls. 'Today we've done it again with a mobile-phone service that's cheaper than BT for daytime calls made from the workplace,' said Lord Young. Then came the details. The service is available only in the London area. Calls qualify for the 'inside' tariff only if made from a single designated 'home cell' little more than the area of a building. Stray 'outside' and the price of a daytime local call escalates nearly fivefold. 'It looks like a mobile phone for stationary people,' quipped Cellnet, one of the three other mobile-phone operators. Vodafone and Orange reacted similarly. Over lunch came rumours that One-2-One phones do not work inside some buildings. 'Different buildings behave in different ways,' confessed a press officer. 'In some buildings the phones do not work adequately.' Apparently it is all to do with steel and frequencies. After lunch was the number-crunching which put the One-2-One 'savings' in perspective. The rental for a One-2-One line is Pounds 67.47 a quarter - against Pounds 32.66 for a BT business line. The handset costs at least Pounds 200. And for all calls made in the evenings and at weekends, BT is far cheaper than One-2-One 'inside' - let alone outside. Even in the daytime, callers who are frequent BT users can get 14 per cent or more off standard tariffs for a payment of Pounds 2.17 a month. Only local calls are then cheaper with One-2-One for a three-minute chat. Bargain hunters will be on tenterhooks for Lord Young's next birthday treat for One-2-One.</p>

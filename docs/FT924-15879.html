			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Kuwaiti election will please allies more than emir: Restoration of parliament will expose the government to fierce criticism BY MONDAY night, Kuwait's 81,400 voters will have elected a new National Assembly, at once reviving the Gulf's oldest parliament and, in western eyes, tying an appealing democratic rosette on the victory of Desert Storm. For the US and other governments which helped evict Iraqi forces from Kuwait last year, the election result will be seen as the happy end to a job well done: Kuwait has been freed, its rulers restored and the state set fair on a democratic path which, they hope, other Gulf states will follow. Within Kuwait, however, the election of a new parliament will represent the return to business rudely interrupted not so much by the Gulf war as by the decision of Sheikh Jaber al-Sabah, the emir, to suspend the previous assembly in 1986 for what he considered its obstructive and divisive opposition to the government. It will mark a return, in fact, to a political tradition which Kuwait has enjoyed, with interruptions, since the late Sheikh Abdullah al-Sabah signed the country's founding 1962 constitution empowering a National Assembly with rights unknown in other Gulf emirates, sheikhdoms, sultanates or kingdoms to initiate and veto laws and to question and even remove ministers. By western standards, Kuwait's democracy pales before the real thing. Just 13 per cent of the 606,000 Kuwaiti citizens are allowed to vote under a franchise extended only to men over 21 who can trace their lineage back to the 1920s (though this small proportion is due in part to the fact that 60 per cent of Kuwaitis are under 21). Naturalised Kuwaitis and, in particular, women, have argued bitterly for the vote during the campaign - a wish which there appears a strong national consensus eventually to grant. Moreover, Kuwait's democratic style has a peculiarly cosy and social feel. Most campaigning takes place by night at the often lavish campaign tents of the 278 candidates vying for the assembly's 50 seats. Thousands of voters gather there to hear candidates or huddle in discussion served, at the most opulent tents, by waiters bearing soft drinks or with buffets which would make the most profligate Wimbledon corporate host blush with humility and the most purist democrat simply blush. But as convivial and unrepresentative as the campaign may appear, it has been fought in considerable earnest. The election of a majority, or even a sizeable minority, of government opponents could offer the ruling al-Sabah family a serious and discomfiting challenge, if not quite a true contest for power. For the most part, Kuwait's informal opposition groups - political parties are not permitted - represent factions which pre-date the Gulf crisis, holding familiar positions which have been sharpened rather than changed by the effects of Kuwait's occupation. Broadly, the organised opposition divides into the secular, led by the Kuwait Democratic Forum (KDF), and the religious, represented by the Sunni groupings of the moderate Islamic Constitutional Movement (ICM), the more radical Safanayeen and a smaller, coalition of candidates loosely representing Kuwait's 35 to 40 per cent Shia population. But none of these groups is fielding more than a handful of candidates each  -the KDF is fielding nine, for instance, and the Safanayeen seven. Despite long-standing attempts since liberation to co-operate more closely, candidates from these groups are in many constituencies running against each other. These organised groups are considered unlikely, therefore, to win more than their traditional small share of seats. The opposition's success is also likely to be limited by the general conservatism of Kuwaiti voters, who in many constituencies have previously tended to vote more along tribal than ideological or religious lines. The government has been assiduous in seeking to reinforce such conservatism. Since Kuwait's liberation, the government has written off all outstanding consumer loans, raised government salaries by 25 per cent (92 per cent of Kuwaitis are public employees), and offered KD1,000 (Pounds 2,000)grants to Kuwaitis who endured the occupation. Mr Jassem al-Saddoun, a prominent local economist, reckons the government has spent KD3.8bn on directly political public expenditure. Most local observers therefore conclude that voters will return only a minority of outright opposition candidates. 'I think about 30 per cent will be for the government, and maybe 30 per cent opposition,' says Mr Abdulla Nibari of the KDF. The remainder, he suggests, will be broadly independent. A similar mix in the previous parliament did not prevent it from sufficiently upsetting the government, largely by seeking to delve deeply into the financial affairs of certain senior ministers, for the emir to suspend the assembly in 1986. 'The parliament has real powers in Kuwait, but only if the opposition can find the right issue around which to unite,' says one western diplomat. 'A sufficiently vocal minority on the right issue can swing the whole parliament behind it.' A build-up of frustration since 1986, combined with widespread disaffection with the government's competence before, during and since the Gulf war may well provide such issues early in the parliament. Many candidates, and not only those of the organised opposition, believe the government has for too long been held unaccountable for its policies. 'We are going to hold the government accountable for everything it has done since 1986,' says Mr Jassem Qabazard, an independent running in the central Rumaithia constituency. 'We are going to ask, 'What have you been doing all this time?',' he says, adding, with emphasis: 'What have you been doing with our money?' Two specific issues could bring such discontent into an early confrontation between the parliament and the government. One, which has been a hot topic in Kuwait's diwaniyahs (informal social gatherings) for months, is the handling of Kuwait's overseas investments. Kuwaitis have read with dismay on the front pages of local papers about investments by the London-based Kuwait Investment Office in lossmaking Spanish industry. 'We strongly feel that what happened in Spain is the responsibility of leading people in Kuwait - even some of the ministers,' says Mr Ali al-Ghanem, another independent candidate. A second issue is the government's scheme to recover billions of dollars of debt left over from the 1982 collapse of the Souq al-Manakh informal stock market crisis. Although the government recently took over the KD5.8bn of residual debt lying on the books of Kuwait's banks, it has yetto propose a convincing scheme to recover money still owing. It was, after all, the attempts by the previous parliament to uncover who owes money and how much which prompted its suspension. Many candidates believe such an option would not be open to the emir with the next parliament - not least with US eyes watching closely. 'People's attitudes in Kuwait and outside pressure will be a hindrance in this case,' says Mr Nibari. Kuwait's next National Assembly could then reopen at much the same temperature as that in which the last was closed.</p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: UCB boosts profits 21% at mid-term UCB, the Belgian chemicals and pharmaceuticals company, boosted pre-tax profits 21 per cent to BFr1.28bn (Dollars 39m) in the first six months of the year, aided by improved economic conditions in Europe, writes Emma Tucker in Brussels. Post-tax profits of BFr1.23bn were lower than in the first half of 1993 when they were BFr1.74bn. The group's sales rose to BFr25.2bn from BFr23.43bn in the same period a year earlier. Exceptional profits were below those of the previous year, which had been boosted by the sale of Vel, the group's Belgian chemicals subsidiary UCB said its pharmaceuticals sales had benefited from buoyant demand for Zyrtec, the company's successful anti-allergy drug, which normally sells well during the spring.</p>

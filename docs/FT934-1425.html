			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Reclaiming income tax My wife and I have established a discretionary trust, with our grandchildren as the beneficiaries. One of our sons works for an EU institution abroad and his children have visited Britain only on holidays. When they get income from the trust, can they claim back the income tax already deducted from it, as their UK-resident cousins can do? If so, where should their father apply for such repayment? It appears that your grand-children are British citizens no matter where they live. Thus, they are entitled to their annual personal allowance for income tax. It should be possible for them to claim back the tax deducted on payments from the trustees. In order to do this, the trustees should supply the children with a certificate showing tax deducted. This should be submitted with a letter requesting a refund to Claims Branch, St John's House, Merton Road, Bootle, Merseyside L69 9BP. You will need to check the way in which the income distribution is taxed in the country where the children are resident. Reply by Barry Stillerman of accountant Stoy Hayward.

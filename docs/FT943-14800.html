			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Role of 'Dear Leader' is still a puzzle The transfer of power to Mr Kim Jong-il as North Korea's new leader appears to be proceeding smoothly, South Korea's intelligence chiefs said yesterday. But other government officials and diplomats in Seoul readily admitted such predictions were based mainly on guesswork. 'We don't know what is going on in North Korea. We rely heavily on the North Korean media to tell us what's happening,' a western diplomat said, commenting on the difficulty of penetrating one of the world's most closed societies. Analysts were busy yesterday examining televised pictures from Pyongyang of Mr Kim's first public appearance since his father, President Kim Il-sung, died last week. When he attended a lying-in-state ceremony on Monday evening, close attention was paid to the ranking order of 100 senior officials who accompanied Mr Kim, the 'Dear Leader', to determine if he had won the support of the ruling Korean Workers' party, the military and the government for his succession. South Korean officials concluded Mr Kim's assumption of power seemed complete, as he appeared flanked by the head of the military, Mr O Jin-u, and Mr Kang Song-san, the prime minister. But there is still speculation that Mr Kim may have difficulty retaining power because he is believed to be opposed by the conservative military leadership and other old guard elements who supported his father. A more significant test of whether he still faces a potential power struggle could come this week or next when the ruling party and the North Korean parliament select a new general secretary and president. If the 52-year-old Mr Kim is elected to both positions, it would indicate his control over North Korea is secure. But if he must give up the nominal position of president to another senior official, it would suggest he has not completely established his authority. South Korean officials cited other reasons for their belief that Mr Kim's transition was secure. One intelligence chief said that China, North Korea's closest ally, was making efforts to ensure that the political situation in Pyongyang remained stable. He indicated that Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, had earlier given his approval for the younger Mr Kim to take over the leadership of North Korea. This could persuade the North Korean old guard to support him as his father's successor. Mr Kim has been criticised for lacking the credentials of his father's revolutionary background. South Korea's prime minister expressed confidence that Mr Kim would continue the policies of his late father in resolving the dispute over the North's nuclear programme by holding negotiations with the US and South Korea.</p>

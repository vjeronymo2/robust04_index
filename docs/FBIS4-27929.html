			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun Sen </F> at Pochentong Airport on 3 June with unidentified reporters --  recorded]    [Text] [Hun Sen] Ladies and gentlemen, I am very happy to  return home today. I would like to stress that there will be no  interpretation here, thus the foreign journalists should do  their own interpretation.    I know that you must have received the statement and  communique of the Royal Government concerning this matter. I  also know that Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, first prime  minister, had already informed you and all our compatriots of  the outcome of the Pyongyang meeting. I know also that our  journalists might want to know about everything, or just a  little more detail if not everything. This is why this  conference is being held. I will not make a statement, but just  spend all the time answering your questions.    [Reporter] After leaving Pyongyang, did you travel to any  other countries? Did you achieve any success during your trip  to each of those countries?    [Hun Sen] This trip was quite different from the previous  ones. Someone may wonder why members of the joint delegation  led by the National Assembly chairman and the two prime  ministers made the trip on different planes. I must stress that  it was because we were afraid of the risk involved if we took  the same plane. Therefore, Samdech Chea Sim, Prince Krompreah  Norodom Ranariddh, and I agreed to make the trip separately on  different planes. That was how the trip was made. As for me,  after leaving Pyongyang, I went to Beijing. There were no  specific discussions, except visiting some places there.    My trip to Bangkok can be regarded as a significant blazing  of the trail. I stopped in Bangkok on the way home as a guest  of the Thai Foreign Ministry. I did not hold any official  discussions with Thai officials, however. As you all know, I  have many old friends in Bangkok. Therefore, following a period  of tension in the relations between Cambodia and Thailand, I  think that my stay in Bangkok can be said to have political  significance. That is, it constituted a resumption of dialogue  after a period of interruption. My meeting with a number of old  friends constituted a discussion to seek mutual understanding  and ways to solve the problems between our two countries. We  think that all problems between our two countries can be solved  because Thailand and Cambodia will always be neighbors.  Therefore, we need to resolve all problems through peaceful  means. This means that we do not want to confront several  problems at the same time. The present problem with the Khmer  Rouge is more than enough trouble for us. We do not want any  problems, particularly with neighboring countries, now or in the  future. This is because development requires not only internal  security but stability and friendship with neighboring  countries. This is (?the trip I made). Thank you.    [Reporter] You have said that you met with Thai officials.  I still wonder whether you have discussed (?the old problems  concerning the Khmer Rouge) with the Thai officials?    [Hun Sen] I must tell you that I did not hold any formal  meetings in Bangkok. I can tell you frankly that I met  yesterday with General Charan [Kulawanit], Thai National  Security Council secretary general, and last night I had dinner  with my old friend, former Prime Minister Chatchai Chunhawan who  is currently leading an opposition party. This morning, I had a  breakfast with General Chawalit Yongchaiyut, also an old friend,  (?who is now) minister of the Interior. The most important  topic we discussed was how we should solve problems in the  future [words indistinct]. We should forget whatever happened  in the past because that will only give us a headache. What we  want to know is how to solve our future problems. I must tell  you that I did not discuss the Khmer Rouge issue with any  country, let alone Thailand. I never discuss the Khmer Rouge  problem with any country. I will hold no discussion about the  problem with other countries, including Thailand. This is the  stance of Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and mine as well as  the common stance of the National Assembly and the Royal  Government. The Khmer Rouge issue is solely an internal concern  for Cambodia. What I wanted to discuss was Cambodian-Thai  relations. These relations (?include) the development of  cooperation in economics, culture, investment, trade, and so  forth. There are so many things to discuss concerning relations  between the two countries.    [Hun Sen continues] I would like to return to your  question on the Khmer Rouge. What is the Khmer Rouge doing now?  They are striving to internationalize the Khmer Rouge problem.  We should not fall into the dangerous games of the Khmer Rouge.  Why did the Khmer Rouge refuse to meet in Phnom Penh? Why did  they ask for the meeting to be held in Jakarta or Paris? If the  government fell into this dangerous game, it would be tantamount  to allowing the Khmer Rouge to destroy the outcome of the Paris  agreement.    As a way out for the roundtable, however, the government  respected and followed his majesty's advice by agreeing to meet  at the king's palace in Pyongyang. Therefore, the Khmer Rouge  could not internationalize its problem. Generally speaking,  they already made a false step politically when they refused to  join the elections and opposed the Constitution, king, and  government which resulted from the elections.    Therefore, they have refused to accept the cease-fire  because  they made a false step politically, but they still have their  military activities to resort to as a means of resurrecting  their political fortunes. Therefore, I would like to stress  once again that now or in the future, the Khmer Rouge problem is  not an issue to be discussed with any other countries. The  Khmer Rouge problem should be discussed within the Cambodian  framework and might be discussed in the Cambodian National  Assembly in the future. How do we solve the Khmer Rouge  problem? Concerning this, I would like to stress the general  policy of the government with regard to the Khmer Rouge issue  [words indistinct] America, France, and all other countries,  including the neighboring countries, such as Thailand. We will  not discuss the Khmer Rouge issue (?with them). Thank you.    [Reporter] I would like to know whether you will ask the  National Assembly to outlaw the Khmer Rouge if the roundtable on  15 (?June) fails?    [Hun Sen] We need to wait for the outcome of the 15 June  meeting. Anyway, I, Samdech Krompreah, and Samdech Chea Sim are  feebly optimistic. Why? It is because the delegates from our  government and National Assembly to the negotiation at the  Chhanghsu-on Palace in Pyongyang are all competent persons who  can make decisions. As for the Khmer Rouge, they are  represented by Khieu Samphan. Therefore, since the leaders who  are authorized to make decisions promptly could not solve the  problem, can we place any hope in this roundtable working group?  I have no hope for it. I am not optimistic about this. Prior  to my departure (to Pyongyang), you asked whether I had any hope  for success. I answered that I was only 0.1 percent hopeful and  99.99 percent hopeless. That was the summit negotiation. Now  that the coming negotiation, the coming discussion, is just at  the level of a specialized roundtable group, I really have no  hope for it.    Henceforth, we must think about what more we should do.  Concerning this matter, I think that it is still too early for  me to say what to do in the future [words indistinct] as in the  football game. Sometimes, from one point to another, there  might be a new situation. Nevertheless, how should we solve the  Khmer Rouge issue? Do we agree to accept Cambodia as a federal  state?    In Pyongyang, it was fortunate that Samdech Chea Sim and  Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh authorized negotiation with  Khieu Samphan. During the negotiation, I told Khieu Samphan  that it was a very good time for us to issue a joint statement  expressing recognition for a unified Cambodia free from  secession and division. But it would be totally meaningless if a  cease-fire could not be implemented, because Cambodia [words  indistinct], not just with Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos. There  are also borders between the government and the Khmer Rouge.    If the cease-fire is not implemented, the process of  national  reconciliation will be impossible. Will we continue to accept  such a divided Cambodia? This is the problem. Will we allow  the Khmer Rouge to kill people at will? This is the problem  that we must think of. I [words indistinct]. Some people have  blamed the government of waging a meaningless war, of kindling  the war. But let me ask you this: Suppose the Khmer Rouge were  mosquitos. Should we allow them to bite us, or should we use a  mosquito net or pesticide to prevent them from biting us?    That is one matter. That is the government's duty. If we  allowed the Khmer Rouge, the mosquitos, to bite people, it would  be another matter. To protect the people from being bitten by  the mosquitos, we must use mosquito nets or other means, such as  pesticide, to drive away the mosquitos. The Khmer Rouge are the  mosquitos and our people are their victims.    But when the Royal Government carried out its duty of  protecting the people and [words indistinct] as stated in the  constitution, they said the government is the warmonger, the  belligerent, while not mentioning the Khmer Rouge killed  thousands of our people and burned down thousands of houses.  What should the government do in such a case?    The other day when I was in Sihanoukville, I told the Prince  Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh (?and announced) that if the people,  through a referendum, want the Royal Government's troops to  withdraw from all the cities, then I do not know what to do.  The Prince Krompreah and I are the commanders in chief of the  armed forces. If the people want the armed forces to withdraw  from Phnom Penh and all the cities so as to let the Khmer Rouge  control all areas, I really do not know what to do. We defend  the people because they want us to. In defense, we naturally  cannot avoid clashing with the Khmer Rouge. Defending the  people does not mean that we must wait until we are attacked  first.    Do not forget that the constitution has defined that the  government is duty-bound to control the entire territory without  division. This is what I want to stress.    So, what should we do next? I still do not know whether to  put the Khmer Rouge outside or inside the law or what status to  give it. But, it is very clear that the Royal Government will  not give up its duty of preventing the people from being  massacred by the Khmer Rouge. We will strengthen our capability  in protecting the people. This is our vital task. Thank you.    [Question by an unidentified correspondent] What do you  [words indistinct]?.    [Hun Sen] There has been no change. I must emphasize also  that yesterday, Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh met with the  diplomats to explain the situation to them. He also expressed  regret over the number of pessimists who see the Cambodian  situation as being gloomy, so very gloomy that the government  should be dissolved and a reelection held. But, as for me, I  think that before talking about the present situation, we should  first refer to what had happened on 3 June 1993, and what is  happening today, 3 June 1994. We must talk about this so that  we can clearly reflect on the situation. I am not going to talk  about the impasse or this or that difficulties. But if we speak  about the political situation. Today last year, we saw people  fleeing the country, some to Bangkok and others to Vientiane,  Vietnam, or abroad, or who were packing up and getting ready to  flee. But today, we are together. All parties have turned from  confrontation, politically, ideologically, and militarily, to a  cooperation that has brought stability to Cambodia. This is  what we must see. This situation [words indistinct].    As for the Khmer Rouge problem, it depends on what  importance  we give them. If we give them as much value as we did in the  past, it would be as if Cambodia is facing a civil war. I do  not understand this. I must boast a bit that no other prime  minister in Cambodia can remain in this position longer than Hun  Sen, that is if we speak about history. I served as prime  minister in the former government for eight years and six  months. And I have been prime minister of the new government  for a year now. No one has served as prime minister for a  longer term than I have. I do not understand why.... the Khmer  Rouge are not that significant, but the Khmer Rouge issue has  been emphasized to the point as if there is a civil war in  Cambodia. There is no civil war in Cambodia right now. The  present war is just a destructive one waged by Khmer Rouge  rebels against a legally elected government.    I [words indistinct] the situation. It is known to all that  immediately after the signing of the Paris agreement, I was the  only one who could cope with the (?military) situation, while  the economic blockade continued against us. But we survived.  We have survived all along in order to find a political  solution. What else do we have to be afraid of now? All  parties, all political parties which have their own armed  forces, political and military parties have come together. All  newly-formed political parties are joining hands except the  Khmer Rouge. The whole world recognizes the (?Phnom Penh)  government only and provides aid to them. So, what else must we  be afraid of? I really do not understand this claim -- hotels  are now unoccupied, because there are no conferences.    Yesterday, Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh told the  diplomats in Phnom Penh that we have peace in 95 percent of the  territory, while only five percent have none. Can we carry out  development with this 95 percent peace? As I used to say, peace  prevails in the majority of our territory at all times. As for  war, it takes place only occasionally in some scattered areas.  Then why is it not possible for us to carry out development?  There is no war in Phnom Penh; fighting takes place only in  Pailin. Why must the people in Phnom Penh be that alarmed?  Tourism, restaurants, and so forth are in Phnom Penh, not  Pailin.    Thus, the situation has not changed. It all depends on us  whether the Khmer Rouge issue is important or not. If we just  forget about them, they would certainly be forgotten. They are  so notorious. The most important thing is we must forget about  them.    [Hun Sen continued] I still remember in October, [changes  thought] in November last year, Prince Krompreah Norodom  Ranariddh declared (?at this Pochentong Airport] that the Khmer  Rouge problem was not a major issue. The major issue was the  socioeconomic development. At that time, the Khmer Rouge were  alarmed. Why? Because they have already died politically.  What they are so afraid of is being forgotten. Thus, they have  tried hard to raise the Khmer Rouge issue so that a solution  must be found for it. To seek a solution, so that they (?can  stage a comeback). How can they come back? They can do so by  internationalizing the Khmer Rouge issue [words indistinct].  Not only have they demanded a part in the current government,  they have also proposed a maximum political program to establish  a new government through the dismantling of the present National  Assembly and government. Therefore, our people and compatriots  should consider this situation for themselves. They should  consider whether it is necessary to dissolve the National  Assembly and government that were born of the elections  organized through the joint effort of the Cambodian people and  the international community. Should they dissolve this  government and this National Assembly to form a new government  with Khmer Rouge participation [words indistinct]. That is what  they should think about.    Again, I must stress that the Cambodian situation remains  unchanged. It is still the same old Cambodia. It has not  changed. Its territory is still 131,035 square kilometers. The  Khmer Rouge remain in the same, old, and small area. I must  emphasize also that the Khmer Rouge problem is not new. Some  (?Cambodians) seem to have forgotten about the origins of the  Khmer Rouge. Do not forget that the Khmer Rouge have not just  been born. I have heard about them since I was a child. They  have opposed the government since the time of His Royal Highness  Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Therefore, the Khmer Rouge issue is  not an outstanding one. The Cambodian people have known about  it all along. Therefore, we must not give any significance to  the issue. And we must not also [words indistinct]. But, do  not forget that in political and legal terms, the Khmer Rouge  are already dead. However, if we want them to be alive, they  will be alive. If we want them to be dead, they will be dead.  We regard their military activities only as sabotage,  espionage, and destructive acts. These acts should not be  regarded as civil war. This is what I want to emphasize. I  want also to stress a few more points to avoid any  misunderstanding that the government only looks and speaks about  good things while avoiding the bad ones. The government has  many problems to solve. Not only the Cambodian Government, the  Royal Government of Cambodia, even the Japanese, French, and  U.S. Governments have one problem after another to solve. After  solving the employment problem for the people, they face another  problem, the AIDS problem. Our Cambodia also has many problems  to solve. Such problems cannot be resolved within a day, a  month, or a year. That is too short to evaluate the ability of  the government and the capabilities of the ministers or the  state secretaries. By saying so, it does not mean there are no  more possibilities for changes among some government members or  under state secretaries. [words indistinct] can be evaluated.  The volume of our work is so enormous while our ability is (?so  limited). [words indistinct] is the joint efforts of all  sectors. The National Assembly, the royal government, the armed  forces, and people must make efforts simultaneously toward  building a prosperous Cambodia. Thank you.    [Question indistinct].    [Hun Sen] [passage indistinct]. Therefore, we did not set  any preconditions for negotiations. When we reached the  negotiating table, the government also did not regard the  cease-fire as a precondition for (?negotiation). Although the  cease-fire proposal was not proposed at the Pyongyang talks, the  government still adheres to the King's formula on the coming  roundtable in Phnom Penh. But why does the King and the Royal  Government want a cease-fire? Because this is an urgent wish of  the people. We must know what the people want most right now.  It is peace. To achieve peace, it is imperative to stop  fighting first. During the negotiations, I spoke to Mr. Khieu  Samphan on behalf of the Prince Krompreah and Samdech Chea Sim.  I said: Your Excellency Khieu Samphan, I have heard your  speeches where you said we should negotiate and that if we could  not solve the problem now, we will face not only the Khmer Rouge  issue but more problems if someone else creates another armed  group.    That was what I told him. Then the two supreme patriarchs  and  Venerable Patriarch Khousananda and Venerable Patriarch Mongkol  Tepeacha also asked him repeatedly to accept the cease-fire.  But Khieu Samphan refused. He regarded the cease-fire as part  of the minimal policy program. He insisted on rearranging the  Paris agreement. This is because the Paris agreement sets the  cease-fire [words indistinct]. Therefore, with the aim of  dumping the outcome of the Paris agreement implementation, Khieu  Samphan has raised and termed the cease-fire issue as being in  the minimal policy program.    That is a contradictory stance, though not between the Royal  Government and the Khmer Rouge. Rather, it is the Khmer Rouge's  stance (?in opposing) the King. The Royal Government and the  National Assembly support the King's proposal for the cease-fire  to begin at noon on 15 June. But the Khmer Rouge have opposed  it. This is what I want to stress.    [Question indistinct].    [Hun Sen] I want to tell you that foreign aid has nothing to  do with the negotiations between the Cambodians. It is  imperative to clearly distinguish the aspects of this matter.  The problem of the Khmer Rouge is solely an internal affair of  Cambodia. The current circumstances are different from the time  prior to the implementation of the Paris agreement. Then, the  Paris agreement instructed all warring factions to stop  procuring military aid. But today, according to the third phase  defined in the Paris agreement, with or without the Khmer Rouge,  this government is fully entitled to accept foreign aid,  including economic, financial, technical, and military  assistance. Therefore, these two aspects are not linked. I must  stress that for (?Cambodia), the Royal Government dares to even  do the following.    Although the Royal Government is entitled by law to foreign  military aid or to buy arms from foreign countries, to persuade  the Khmer Rouge to agree with the cease-fire, the Royal  Government has agreed to:    1. After the inter-Cambodian cease-fire overseeing  commission is set up, this commission may monitor the presence  of foreign troops in Cambodia.    I told Khieu Samphan: I understand what you are up to. You  keep talking about the presence of foreign troops, meaning  Vietnamese troops. Therefore, if you suspect that foreign  troops are still present, in addition to monitoring the  cease-fire, you should go and look for them.    That is the first point.    2. We dare to do this even -- that is, if you accept the  cease-fire, the government will stop accepting foreign military  aid for the time being to create an atmosphere of trust. That  is also part of the King's proposal. The King said he has not  yet discussed this with the Royal Government, but the Royal  government would like to voice support for this proposal. That  is for a permanent cease-fire to be observed first until the  Khmer Rouge forces are integrated into the Royal Government's  army. Only then will we arrange to use the military aid to  strengthen Cambodia's national defense capability. Despite all  that, the Khmer Rouge still disagreed.    I must reiterate that the Royal Government has the full  right  to accept all foreign aid. [passage indistinct]. But we must  accept the aid for national development and for consolidating  our national defense capability. We are entitled to accept it.  No one can say we should not get it. [passage indistinct].    This third step in the Paris agreement does not forbid  Cambodia from accepting foreign military aid to strengthen the  capability to defend Cambodia's [words indistinct] territorial  integrity. Thank you. Now I think that this is enough  explanation for you.    [Question by an unidentified correspondent] [words  indistinct] that there is little hope in settling the Khmer  Rouge problem through peaceful means [words indistinct] military  means to settle the Khmer Rouge problem. How much confidence do  you have in the capability of our government troops to put an  end to the Khmer Rouge threat? If you [words indistinct].    [Hun Sen] At first we believed [words indistinct] if the  Khmer Rouge problem cannot be solved through political means,  what should we do? As I said just now, we regard the Khmer  Rouge as the mosquitoes -- so, should we let the mosquitoes bite  us or should we use a mosquito-net to prevent them from biting  us or use pesticide or charcoal smoke to chase them away? That  is the point. The duty of the government as authorized by the  constitution is to defend the nation's independence,  sovereignty, and territorial integrity. (passage indistinct]. I  cannot evaluate the government troops' capability. But, one  very clear point is that the Khmer Rouge can in no way eliminate  or topple the government. That is one thing. Another is that  the Khmer Rouge will not be able to expand their territory. I  can assure you of this. To answer when we can get rid of all  the Khmer Rouge forces, I can only say that it does not depend  solely on military means. A bomb that is capable of causing the  widest destruction is development in the social and economic  domains. This is what we should resort to in order to solve the  problem. The use of arms cannot solve the problem. The lessons  from Malaysia and Thailand in disbanding the communist parties  do not the involve the use of arms. It is true is the duty of  the (?troops) to use arms to protect the citizens. But rural  development and all-round economic development, eradicating  social injustice, and the elimination of corruption are the  important matters for the Royal Government. If these problems  cannot be resolved, we will face not only the Khmer Rouge issue  but more problems if someone else starts creating another armed  group.    Therefore, we should now mobilize all the efforts of our  national forces and international assistance for social and  economic development -- a most powerful bomb for destroying not  only the Khmer Rouge but all other things, including corruption,  which has caused social inertia. This is [words indistinct] not  only the military and police forces.    [Question by an unidentified correspondent] [words  indistinct] do you still want to negotiate with the Khmer Rouge?    [Hun Sen] It is clearly recognized across the world that Hun  Sen is the advocator of negotiation. Because of this, during my  term as the prime minister of the former State of Cambodia, I  went everywhere to hold negotiations. The success of  negotiations has already been recognized by the Cambodian people  and the international community. His Excellency Sieng Lapresse  [Information Ministry's spokesman], who was also in the  negotiations, knows I have been a tireless negotiator. But now  that I am fulfilling my duty as the prime minister of the King,  I will follow whatever advice that is given by the King. But if  asked whether I like it, I must say I do not. Why? Because I  know that it is useless. When the King appealed for a  cease-fire, the Khmer Rouge retorted that the cease-fire was a  scheme of the aggressors. The Khmer Rouge charged the King's  advice as being a scheme of the aggressors. In seeing that, I  think there is no way to talk to them. [passage indistinct].  But if the King so wishes, I will [passage indistinct].    Now I want to talk about the harmony between Prince  Krompreah  and myself. We get along very well. This is why I have never  [passage indistinct]. Some newspapers, I say some newspapers  and am not going to say which ones, have said that the FUNCINPEC  [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful,  and Cooperative Cambodia] has breached its promise. Leaflets  have also been distributed asking the FUNCINPEC to end its  meaningless war. I said nothing about this. The Prince  Krompreah has also said nothing. I have given support to all  the efforts he made [words indistinct]. This is because I know  and understand it well. Maybe Mr. Khieu Samphan does not want  to negotiate with me. Thus, it will be useless for me to  negotiate. If he wants to negotiate, then come to Phnom Penh.  But why does he not want to come to Phnom Penh? It is not  because it is inconvenient. [passage indistinct]. Why does he  not want to come? It is because he wants to internationalize  the Khmer Rouge issue. [passage indistinct].</p>

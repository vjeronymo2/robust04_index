			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Russian Federation Security Council press service report: </F> "Fight Against Crime Will Be Reinforced"]    [Text] On 24 May, by an edict, the Russian Federation  president ratified the federal program for reinforcing the fight  against crime for 1994-1995, which had earlier been examined and  approved by the Security Council.    It was elaborated by an interdepartmental working group at  the Security Council with the participation of specialists from  ministries and departments, leading criminologists, and  practical workers in law enforcement organs. The process of the  formation of a program was accompanied by a broad discussion of  its provisions both in the center and in the regions. Over  1,000 proposals were submitted to the Security Council.    The program is based on Russia's existing legislation. It  takes into consideration our state's international-legal  commitments, the results of a comprehensive analysis of the  state and forecasting of the development of crime, and domestic  and foreign experience of the elaboration and implementation of  programs for fighting against it.    The implementation of the program presupposes the pooling of  the efforts of law enforcement organs and other state  institutions and the whole of society. It presupposes the  interlinking of economic, political, legal, educational,  organizational, and other measures while relying on giving  consideration to and organically combining the interests of the  citizen and society.    The program defines the following spheres as the most  important ones in fighting against crime: the formation of  legislative and organizational-legal principles; preventive  measures against crimes; the fight against crimes against the  life, health, and property of citizens; the fight against  malfeasance and economic and organized crime; the fight against  crime in the Armed Forces; the development of international  cooperation in the sphere of the fight against crime; the  improvement of resources, including cadre, scientific, and  information backup for the fight against crime.    The edict of the Russian Federation president envisages  concrete measures for the implementation of the federal program.</p>

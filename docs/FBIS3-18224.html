"I am extremely anxious, not so much about the fact that  four  Serbian planes have been shot down, but rather in the light of  the observations of sudden movements of heavy weapons in (the  exclusion zone -- BELGA editor's note) within the 20 kilometers  surrounding Sarajevo, and also following the outburst of renewed  acts of hostility elsewhere in Bosnia," highlighted the foreign  minister, speaking on the sidelines of the European Union's  enlargement talks.    Mr. Claes believes it is clear that the aircraft that were  brought down most definitely belong to the Serbian forces.    The minister also confirmed that six or seven tanks  belonging  to the Bosnian Serb forces had been moved within the safe area  surrounding Sarajevo.    "Apparently, these arms had not been withdrawn or placed  under UN control, and had evidently not been registered" by NATO  forces, added Mr. Claes, giving rise to the suspicion that the  Serbs might have concealed some of their equipment.    "The cease-fire around Sarajevo is imperilled once again,  but  I think that the international community must surely be capable  of preventing the situation from deteriorating," continued the  foreign minister.    "However, I am less fearful of an escalation of violence in  Sarajevo than in other regions of Bosnia," he concluded.</p>

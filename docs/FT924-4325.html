			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Japanese budget becalmed in parliament THE Japanese supplementary budget needed to implement most of the Y10,700bn (Pounds 57bn) emergency public spending package announced in August is becalmed in the upper house of parliament. It passed the lower house only after four weeks of tortuous debate. The budget itself has been hardly discussed. Most argument has centred on which politicians, aides and businessmen should be questioned in parliament over their involvement in the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin financial scandal. The budget committee of the lower house passed the budget after the ruling Liberal Democratic party acceded to opposition demands that a top aide to Mr Shin Kanemaru, the party's fallen kingmaker, should testify over the scandal. Mr Kanemaru resigned from the parliament after being fined Y200,000 for accepting an illegal Y500m donation from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, the trucking company. Mr Kanemaru said that his top aide, Mr Masahisa Haibara, distributed the money to about 60 LDP politicians. The LDP has also indicated that it will call Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former prime minister, and Mr Kiyoshi Sagawa, the trucking company's former president, to give evidence to the upper house. Mr Takeshita has already given evidence to the lower house. However, the opposition is pressing for other figures in the scandal, including Mr Kanemaru, to give evidence. The delay makes it increasingly unlikely that the budget will be passed by both houses by December 8, when the current extraordinary session of parliament is due to end. It is likely the session will be extended by several days to allow further testimony on the scandal to be heard. Meanwhile, the severity of the downturn which prompted the supplementary budget was reflected in figures yesterday which showed that the value of consumer electronics production in September was 20 per cent down on the same month last year. The decline in industrial electronics products output, however, has slowed, with production value down 10 per cent in September from the same month last year. The value of camcorder production - about 4.4 per cent of consumer electronics output - was 29 per cent down in the first nine months of the year compared to the same period last year, according to the figures published by the Electronics Industry Association.</p>

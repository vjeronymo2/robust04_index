Pointing out that in  several hours' time he will meet U.S. President Bill Clinton in  Prague, with whom he will discuss, among other things, the  results of the NATO Brussels summit, the president said: We  should have one position on this issue -- where Poland is and  where it is going.    After the meeting, which lasted almost an hour, Speaker  Oleksy told journalists that the Partnership for Peace  initiative is not regarded by him or the president as  sufficient, although it is a step in the right direction, and a  step which makes it possible for Poland to continue to aspire to  NATO membership. The speaker said that he will discuss the  decisions taken by the Brussels summit with German politicians  during his visit to the Federal Republic as early as Wednesday.</p>

			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: The Week Ahead SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American pharmaceuticals and consumer products group, reports its first quarter results on Thursday. Analysts expect pre-tax profits to increase about 9 per cent from Pounds 253m last year to about Pounds 278m. Underlying growth, excluding currency effects caused by the strong dollar, will be about 4 per cent, with the pharmaceuticals operations underperforming that figure. The small improvement at the pharmaceutical division is because sales of Tagamet, its anti-ulcer drug, are likely to be static. In addition, the benefits of the company's new drugs will not yet have worked their way through, while marketing and sales costs will be high. A quarterly dividend of about 4.2p per share is forecast compared with 3.75p last year. Albert Fisher, the foods group, is expected to report on Thursday a drop in pre-tax profits for the six months to end February to about Pounds 37m from Pounds 45m a year-earlier. The dividend could be raised marginally to 1.80p (1.75p). The stock has virtually halved over the past year to 72p, a drop the company called last December 'wholly unjustified'. A hot favourite in the 1980s bull market, the stock has been knocked by concerns over weakening markets for some of its products. Two particular worries are the extent of the slowdown in its North American food service operations and problems with its Dutch shellfish business. Wace, the pre-press printing group, will report on Wednesday a decline in profits after five years of spectacular growth. Pre-tax profits will be around Pounds 16m-Pounds 18m for 1991 against Pounds 26.5m in 1990 and a mere Pounds 640,000 back in 1986. The fall reflects recession in the printing business, not any circumstances connected to the dramatic resignation January 31 of John Clegg, the young entrepreneur who built up the company. The Department of Trade and Industry is investigating potentially unlawful dealing in shares of two companies Wace acquired or considered acquiring. He denies any involvement.</p>

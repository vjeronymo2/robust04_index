			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Bao Lei (0545 7191): "Changes in </F> Current Outlook on Family Values"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The phenomena of "losing  sight" of family moral values and changes in family moral  outlook are primarily expressed as follows:    First, it is reflected in the norms of marital relations,  where the emotional content and spiritual and cultural content  in marital relationships appear to be increasing, and more and  more are becoming the leading factors in deciding whether or not  to establish marital relations. But at present the majority of  people still take a solid and stable marriage based on a partner  who "has good moral character, is capable, is easy to get along  with on a daily basis, and is able to remain devoted until the  end" as the ideal; at the same time, a utilitarian marriage  involving grovelling for money is looked at as sacrificing the  happiness of the parties to the marriage, while feudal marriages  in which an individual's humanity is destroyed to further family  interests is looked on as having a tendency to raise eyebrows,  through such methods as having repeated marriages and accepting  mistresses, transnational marriages, arranged and mercenary  marriages and abduction and selling of women; in terms of  marriage choices, people have even more "individual freedoms,"  and the society has gradually adopted a more understanding  attitude towards varied marital choices, while "freedom of  divorce" is becoming a reality.    [passage omitted] Second, it is reflected in the norms of  the  relations between the two sexes, where the new concept sees a  sincere, equal, happy, and harmonious sexual life between  husband and wife as increasing the affection between a man and  woman and strengthening the biological and physiological basis  of marital relations, sexual scientific knowledge has gone from  being shackled to being widely disseminated, and the quality of  sexual life between men and women has been increased;  consciousness of female sexual rights has gradually been  awakened; the sexual rights of the elderly have achieved a  certain degree of respect, and the need for love of those bereft  of a spouse in later years is gradually receiving the  understanding of children and support from public opinion; the  serious effect of the feudal concept of chastity is weakening,  and when it comes to female victims of rape and women who have  made sexually-related mistakes, people are gradually changing to  be more tolerant and helpful. People are also gradually adopting  a tolerant attitude towards premarital sexual activity and  extra-marital sexual activity; at the same time, for business  and educational circles, the Western trends towards "sexual  revolution," and sexual liberation," have had an effect that  cannot be underrated on the younger generation, and have to a  certain degree rocked the existing marital family system. Such  phenomena as living together, trial marriages, third  participants, and pregnancies outside of marriage are occurring;  and there has been a resurgence of prostitution, which had been  stamped out after the founding of New China. The phenomenon has  day by day gotten more serious and more open, venereal disease  is spreading, while cases of people with AIDS and people  carrying the HIV virus are appearing on the mainland.    [passage omitted] Third, it is reflected in the norms for  relations between husband and wife, and relations between  husband and wife with an equality based on a cooperative  division of labor are gradually coming to the fore; however, in  large numbers of worker families from rural and township  enterprises, relations between husband and wife characterized by  the not fully equal equation "the man rules outside, the woman  rules inside" still exists to a large degree; among the group of  newly rich people, there exists a "rich ladies social stratum"  in which the wife or mistress is totally dependent on the  husband, while in some poor regions, through various types of  buying and selling of marriages or abductions, the wife becomes  the husband's "child bearing tool" and "family slave," and loses  her personal freedom.    Fourth, it is reflected in the norms of intergenerational  relations. Equal and democratic intergenerational relations are  gradually replacing the feudal patriarchal relationships between  principal and subordinate, and for parents and children, senior  family members and the younger generation, a good deal of the  familial ties and bonds are democratic and equal relations of  mutual respect, mutual love and mutual assistance based on  respect for individual autonomy, and with a general trend  towards independence of the branches of the household of the  children's generation and the parents' household, and various  types of independent relations between the childrens' household  and the parents' household, creating various "family networks"  encompassing the childrens' household and the parents'  household, and a trend towards simplification of household  structure, and household relations; an increase in the number of  nuclear households; however, the influence of the feudal  patriarchal family system still exists, and in recent years  feudal patriarchal clan strength has reared its head; in a  relatively large number of independent childrens' households,  the "disease of thorough spoiling," that is, taking the  grandchild as the center of all things, has fostered a situation  where only sons and daughters occupy a paramount and lofty  special position within the family, so much so that the  phenomenon of prolonged childhood has emerged; after children  reach adulthood, they are unwilling to support themselves, and  still rely on their parents to provide them shelter, find them  jobs, handle marriage matters, raise grandchildren, and in rural  areas the phenomenon of childrens' household reliance on, and  expropriation of parents' households exists to a large extent;  some senior citizens, particularly rural elderly people, have  been ill-treated by children, and children are unwilling to take  care of the old. That a "white haired wave" will soon break on  China's shores is a social problem that China must focus on.</p>

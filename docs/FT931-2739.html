			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / People: Non-executive directors - WH Smith Michael Orr (above left), former head of investment banking at Merrill Lynch Europe, and Martin Taylor (right), chief executive and chairman-designate of Courtaulds Textiles, have joined the board of WH Smith, bringing the number of non-executive directors to eight. Stanley Honeyman, a chartered surveyor, retired last October. Taylor, 40, who has forged a reputation as one of the better managers of his generation, says the attraction for him is 'to get closer to the way a retailer thinks'. A former journalist with the Financial Times, he says that at the moment he knows 'about as much (about the sector) as the FT retailing correspondent'. He adds that WH Smith presents an unusual opportunity in so far as there is 'no possible conflict of interest'. Courtaulds would be suppliers to or in direct competition with the bulk of major retailing companies. Orr, 55, was a senior director of SG Warburg before becoming finance director of Grand Metropolitan in 1981. In 1987, he left for Merrill Lynch, where he stayed for three years. He is now collecting an assortment of non-executive positions - he is chairman of Molins and on the board of Granada, Marston, Thompson &amp; Evershed and Sketchley. WH Smith was last week relegated from the FT-SE 100 index, its share price hit by heavy losses at its DIY joint venture Do-It-All as well as by concerns, unfounded in the event, that the budget would contain an announcement about VAT being extended to published matter.</p>

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Bristol-Myers forecast depresses drug shares SHARES in Bristol-Myers Squibb, the world's third largest pharmaceuticals company, plunged by about 10 per cent yesterday, after the US group warned of only a 'mid-single digit' earnings advance in the second quarter and of sales growth totalling less than 5 per cent. The company blamed inventory reduction by wholesalers. However, analysts said Bristol-Myers had also been affected by increasingly high levels of discounting imposed by managed healthcare groups. These groups, often containing insurance companies, have been insisting on lower prices for drugs. The warning hit other drugs company stocks on both sides of the Atlantic. By the close in New York, Schering-Plough was down Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 50 3/8 , Merck fell Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 49 5/8 , Pfizer was Dollars 3 1/4 lower at Dollars 71 1/2 , and Upjohn lost 1 at Dollars 34 5/8 . Bristol-Myers itself shed Dollars 7 1/4 at Dollars 66 1/2 . In London, Glaxo fell from a high yesterday of 796p before closing at 770 1/2 p, down 5p on the day. SmithKline Beecham fell from a high of 941p to 924p, and Wellcome fell from a high of 981p to 971p, both down 1p on the day. Pharmaceuticals companies have been warning for some time about increased discounting in the US. One UK-based group complained Wall Street analysts were only just recognising the extent of the present pricing environment. In addition to discounts to managed groups, companies have been forced to offer rebates to Medicaid. Last year SmithKline Beecham paid back Dollars 50m (Pounds 28m), while Glaxo paid Dollars 55m during the first half of this year. In a formal statement released before the stock market opened, Mr Michael Autera, Bristol-Myer's chief financial officer, said that wholesalers' stocks of the company's pharmaceutical products were 'being reduced to lower levels than previously anticipated - in some instances below historical norms'. Bristol-Myers' first-quarter revenue growth - only 2 per cent - had already disappointed analysts. When the results were released, this was blamed on heavy 'pre-buying' of drug products last autumn, ahead of anticipated prescription drug price increases. Wall Street pundits had, however, expected sales growth to pick up in the second quarter. Yesterday, Mr Autera said that Bristol-Myers Squibb believed that the 'correction' in wholesalers' stocks had now run its course. But he warned that the company could not be sure how low stocks would be taken, or when sales would again reflect 'underlying levels of prescribing and use of its pharmaceutical products'.</p>

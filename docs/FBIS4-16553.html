			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Kondrashov] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, 16 Apr -- Today the Russian side blocked  new NATO air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions in the Gorazde  region.    An ITAR-TASS correspondent has learned from well-informed  sources that in the first half of today U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher telephoned Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev and told him that NATO aircraft were preparing to carry  out strikes against Serbs firing on Gorazde.    Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian president's special  representative, who was in Pale, a Bosnian Serb-controlled  suburb of Sarajevo, was informed of the content of the  conversation between Christopher and Kozyrev.    Following his contacts with the Bosnian Serb leadership and  UN forces command, V. Churkin announced that Serb shelling of  Gorazde was not an issue. Only four mortar explosions had been  recorded in the town, and UN observers were unable to determine  precisely which side had fired them.    In addition, General Ratko Mladic, the Serb Army commander,  has assured V. Churkin that Serb forces do not intend to storm  Gorazde or bring artillery fire to bear on the town.    Information received from the Russian president's special  representative was forwarded to W. Christopher, after which the  order for NATO air strikes on Serb positions near Gorazde was  rescinded, the abovementioned sources said.</p>

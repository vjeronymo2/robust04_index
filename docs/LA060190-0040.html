			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REYNOLDS MAY GO FROM CAL STATE TO TOP JOB AT CUNY  </P> <P> W. Ann Reynolds, who was forced to resign recently as chancellor of the  California State University, is the front-runner to head an even more  politically troubled education system -- the City University of New York.  </P> <P> According to well-placed sources in New York, Reynolds' problems in California  over secret pay raises and a bad relationship with legislators have not hurt  her chances to become chancellor of CUNY. Her record in helping to boost  minority enrollment at Cal State impressed officials at CUNY, where about 65%  of the students are black or Latino.  </P> <P> Members of the CUNY committee searching for a new chancellor are said to have  ranked Reynolds first among three finalists. The final selection of a new  chancellor by CUNY's governing board may be announced today, officials said.  </P> <P> CUNY leaders view Reynolds as the sacrificial lamb in the Cal State pay  controversy and believe that the Cal State trustees "left her in the lurch"  after privately approving the large raises for Reynolds and other executives,  said an official of the faculty union in New York. "She also made a good  personal impression," the official said of Reynolds' interviews in New York.  </P> <P> Reynolds, who is said to be recovering at her Bel-Air home from recent knee  surgery, declined to comment on her status as a finalist for the CUNY job,  according to a Cal State spokesman. The other two finalists are reported to be  Roderic B. Park, vice chancellor of UC Berkeley, who was passed over a few  months ago in the selection of a new head of the Berkeley campus, and Robert L.  Hess, president of Brooklyn College in the CUNY system.  </P> <P> With 195,000 students, CUNY is the third-largest higher education system in the  nation, after the state university system in New York and Cal State. Among  CUNY's 20 units are such nationally known institutions as Hunter College and  John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan and lesser known schools in  Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island. Its current chancellor, Joseph  S. Murphy, has held the job eight years and intends to return to teaching once  a successor takes over.  </P> <P> Some observers think that a move from Cal State to CUNY would be like going  from the frying pan into the fire.  </P> <P> Because of state and city budget crunches in New York, the CUNY faces a painful  round of cuts. A CUNY chancellor has to find a safe path through New York state  and city politics, which make California lawmaking look like a polite tea  party. Also, CUNY is beset by racial tension, most recently shown in the  takeover of campus buildings last week by minority students demanding more  black and Latino professors and a minority chancellor.  </P> <P> Reynolds is white, but being among very few women to achieve her status in  higher education may help her chances at CUNY, the sources said. Reynolds also  is a finalist in the running for chancellor of the West Virginia University  system.  </P> <P> A zoologist, Reynolds was second in command at Ohio State University before  becoming Cal State Chancellor in 1982. Her tenure as head of the 20-campus Cal  State system brought expansion and improvement in academic standards but also  criticism over what some called Reynolds' dictatorial style.  </P> <P> Her forced resignation was announced April 20 as a result of the controversial  21% to 43% salary increases arranged in secret last year by Cal State trustees  and Reynolds. Faced with an angry faculty and Legislature, trustees later  claimed to have been misled about the raises. Reynolds' clout slipped when it  was revealed that she previously had promised legislators that any pay raise  decisions would be made in public.  </P> <P> Reynolds originally planned to remain at Cal State through October but the  trustees two weeks ago put her on immediate vacation through July 31 when her  resignation takes effect. Cal State Hayward President Ellis E. McCune was named  acting chancellor.  </P></p>

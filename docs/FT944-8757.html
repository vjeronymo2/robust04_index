			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Technology: Cleaner nooks and crannies In Edwardian England, the streets were swept clean by the likes of Eliza Doolittle's father. In modern-day Japan, the job is done by large trucks equipped with water hoses and brooms that roam the streets at night. But for the nooks and crannies which the heavy-duty cleaner trucks miss, Banzai, a Japanese manufacturer of automobile and leisure equipment maintenance machinery, has produced a powerful vacuum cleaner for use on the streets. The Field Vacuum Cleaner has suction strength of 13cu m per minute. It sucks up everything from dead leaves to empty bottles, cans, water and sludge. It reaches under park benches and into corners of pavements and removes mud from the gutters. The company started exporting the cleaner to France three years ago, where it is used to clean the debris stuck in the grooves of railway tracks, and to clear dog mess from the pavements of Paris. The company started to sell in Japan after sales in France took off, and Banzai says it is now selling around 60 machines a month. Buyers in Japan include companies that clean parks and office blocks, while golf driving ranges and tennis courts use it to retrieve players' balls. The 70kg machine runs on a gasoline engine. The 3m hose, which weighs 3kg to 4kg, is supported by a rod extending from the cleaner. The refuse box inside the cleaner, which holds 120 litres, detaches from the machine for emptying. Banzai warns that while the machine is suitable for cleaning small areas that are hard to reach, it is inadequate for efficient vacuuming of wide surfaces. In Japan, the cleaner costs Y780,000 (Pounds 4,936).</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In regard to further interpretation of section 109(a)(3) of the Act concerning SDA's that have the highest rates of unemployment for an extended period of time and the highest poverty rates, the Department is not expanding on this criterion and is leaving the interpretation of this section to each Governor, as provided in the Conference Committee Report on the Amendments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Insurance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A few commenters responded to the provisions of &sect;627.415. A few other commenters on &sect;627.435, Allowable costs and cost principles, suggested that &sect;627.435 should include provisions for allowing the costs of contributions to reserves for self-insurance to be specifically allowed in that section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After considering these comments, paragraph (c) of &sect;627.415 of the interim final rule is removed and the substance of the second sentence concerning contributions to a reserve for a self-insurance program is moved to &sect;627.435(h). The first sentence of this paragraph (c) basically repeated the provisions of &sect;627.315(b), Benefits and working conditions, and is, therefore, unnecessary in this provision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A few commenters were concerned about the scope of insurance coverage required by the rule. Some asked whether the rule required them to provide insurance coverage for work-related activities or for all training. One thought that the regulation required ``no fault'' coverage that could be satisfied through an ordinary comprehensive liability policy. Section 627.415 does not address the scope of insurance coverage. Section 627.315(b) requires worker's compensation or similar insurance coverage for work-related training activities. States and SDA's/SSG's should provide such coverage as they deem prudent and as are in accordance with their normal insurance procedures, both in terms of the types of risks covered and the method of coverage (self-insurance or purchase of insurance policies). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Procurement. Section 627.420 sets forth the procurement requirements for titles I, II, and III of JTPA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters thought that the procurement portion of the interim final regulations is an example of overregulation, while others believed that the regulations did not go far enough. In response to the comments concerning overregulation, the Department notes that section 164(a)(3) of the Act requires the Secretary to take into consideration the OMB circulars and that these regulations actually represent a pared-down version of the OMB Circulars. As such, they represent less federal regulation than is applied to other Federal grant programs. In response to the comments concerning underregulation, the Department does not agree. The requirements that are established should help maximize competition, ensure fiscal accountability, and prevent fraud and abuse in JTPA programs. The Department believes that the final regulation represents a reasonable balance between providing guidance on the issues on which the Secretary is required to set minimum requirements under section 164(a)(3) of the Act and recognizing the prerogatives of the Governors to develop their own procurement rules, which also is recognized in that provision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although at the Federal level there are rules for when to use contracts, grants and cooperative agreements, these rules are not applicable to the JTPA. As a result, what one State calls a contract, another State might call a grant. In order to avoid confusion in these regulations, the following terms are being used: ``Award'' or ``agreement'' means a contract, grant, subcontract, subgrant or other type of legal instrument; ``awardee'' means any one of the entities receiving the award (e.g., contractors, grantees). There was concern expressed over whether buying certain supplies, like floppy disks, at office supply stores and other similar businesses constitutes an award. Through these regulations, an upper limit for small purchases (which can be lowered, but not raised, by the Governor's procurement standards) is established. No further breakdowns are delineated in the regulations. The Governor can, through the State procurement standards, establish other thresholds for the purchasing of consumable materials with credit cards and such, and not require a formalized award process (e.g., competition or cost/price analysis) or document. As an example, the current Federal ceiling is $2,500 per consumable item. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 627.420(a) reiterates the requirement established through the Amendments that the Governor establish procurement standards to ensure fiscal accountability and prevent fraud and abuse in JTPA programs. This section further requires the State and local levels to follow procurement policies and procedures used for non-Federal funds, with some caveats, and reiterates the non-duplication requirement contained in section 107(b) of the Act. A small number of commenters were concerned that the requirement that the State and local levels follow their own procurement policies and procedures used for non-Federal funds would result in awards always being made to the lowest bidder without other considerations, such as performance. State and local rules are to be followed as long as they comply with the minimum requirements of the procurement section. One of the requirements for the selection of vendors and subrecipients (discussed below) is that the awarding agency make a determination of demonstrated performance prior to award. If, as a result of this determination, it is apparent that the lowest bidder cannot perform the work at an acceptable level of quality, SDA's should not make an award to that bidder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A few commenters were concerned that the nonduplication requirement of &sect;627.420(a)(5) would make it difficult for SDA's to select service providers. This requirement reflects the provisions of section 107(b) of the Act and is necessary to maximize the use of JTPA funds. One of the initial steps in any JTPA procurement should be a determination concerning whether or not procuring such services (whether competitively or through sole source) would be a duplication. The determination of non-duplication need not be exhaustive; it may take into account such things as the cost of the existing services, waiting lists, the effectiveness of the services to be provided, and the likelihood of achieving performance goals. Although there may be entities in the geographic area which provide the required services, these entities may not provide the necessary customized training or may not be able to provide these services in a timely manner. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters felt that the vendor/subrecipient distinction (see the definitions sections of the preamble and the regulations) found in other parts of the regulations was not clear in this section. This section is intended to apply to all awards and, for the purposes of this section, the same rules apply to the procurement of awards to both vendors and subrecipients. Thus, the vendor/subrecipient distinction is not treated in this section as it is in other provisions of the regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

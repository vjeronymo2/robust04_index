			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: IDV takes stake in Hungarian distributor INTERNATIONAL Distillers &amp; Vintners, the Grand Metropolitan drinks company, is buying a 25 per cent stake in Zwack Unicum, Hungary's leading spirits producer and distributor. The acquisition price was not disclosed but the Hungarian group plans to raise between Pounds 8m and Pounds 9m from a public offer of a further 25 per cent shareholding. Mr Colin Gordon, president of IDV Europe, said yesterday that the deal was 'an important step in IDV's strategy for expansion in eastern Europe. It strengthens our distribution base in Hungary . . . a market with great potential for IDV's portfolio of international brands.' IDV established a local organisation in Hungary two years ago to manage the distribution of its brands, including Smirnoff vodka and J&amp;B whisky, Zwack Unicum, which is owned by Mr Peter Zwack and Mr Emil Underberg, has annual turnover of Pounds 75m and accounts for nearly half the Hungarian spirits market. Mr Zwack was one of the first Hungarian businessmen to return home as the communist regime collapsed in 1989. He fled the country in 1948 when the family drinks business was seized by the state, taking with him the secret recipe for Unicum, a distillation of herbs and spices which his family had introduced in 1790 and developed into the country's most popular drink. Production of the brand was resumed in 1990. It has sales of half a million cases a year and is exported to Japan and several European markets</p>

			<p>Mosque   <F P=102>   NC2703130394 Paris AFP in English 1238 GMT 27 Mar 94 </F> <F P=103> NC2703130394 </F> <F P=104>  Paris AFP </F> <F P=105>  English </F> BFN     [Text] Cairo, March 27 (AFP) -- Egyptian doctors said  Sunday the victims of the Hebron mosque massacre were hit by  three types of bullets proving Jewish settler Baruch Goldstein  had not acted alone.    The team of doctors, who visited Hebron shortly after last  month's massacre, told the Egyptian daily AL-AHRAM ``three types  of bullets and splinters were extracted'' from the bodies of the  wounded.    ``That proves the massacre was not carried out by one  person,'' they told the paper.    The Israeli army has insisted Goldstein acted alone when he  opened fire on February 25 in the mosque killing 30 Arab  worshippers.    Israeli ballistics experts have said that all those wounded  and killed were hit by bullets from a Galil short-barrelled gun.    But witnesses at the official inquiry into the massacre have  testified that they saw another armed settler with Goldstein,  and that two soldiers also fired at people and not just in the  air as the army has maintained.    One 12-year-old boy told the inquiry that copper splinters  were taken from his back, lending weight to claims that a  grenade was used.    A separate PLO inquiry recently concluded that at least two  soldiers had shot at Moslems at prayer in the West Bank mosque.    The official Israeli inquiry is still hearing evidence.</p>

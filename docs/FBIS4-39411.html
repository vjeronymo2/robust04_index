			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Razin report under "Our Commentary" rubric: "Major </F> Reforms at the Starting Gate"]    [Text] Only bankruptcies will be able to do away with the  nonpayments crisis. This is the radical conclusion arrived at  by Yeltsin, having signed the edict "On the Sale of State Debtor  Enterprises."    Will this edict work? There are no particular doubts about  this, insofar as the bankruptcy mechanism, which is in the hands  of Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee for the Management of  State Property] and which, in point of fact, represents the last  chance for Chubays and the entire Gaydar wing to triumph in the  extremely difficult battle for real reforms in the economy, has  been thought out precisely enough.    In line with the edict, debtor enterprises, having admitted  bankruptcy, transfer to the Federal Administration for  Insolvency Affairs under Goskomimushchestvo. In doing so, the  question of dismissing the enterprise manager as being unsuited  to the post occupied by him is fundamentally resolved.    Such a severe measure will, undoubtedly, discourage  directors  from "dragging their feet" on privatization, selling off plant  property, awarding themselves huge salaries while the enterprise  heads for complete collapse, and senselessly forcing up prices  for their own output by including therein unbelievably inflated  outlays. Taking the big picture, there is no nonpayments  problem in our economy -- there is the problem of the  inefficient state sector bequeathed to us from the communist  past, and which, owing to political machinations, has yet to be  eradicated once and for all. Now, it seems, the time has come  to untie the hands of the reformists completely.    Such a drastic turnabout in the president's fairly cautious  and flexible strategy in economic reform is attributable to at  least three important circumstances: First, Russian industry is  charging full steam ahead toward the Ukrainian version of total  collapse. Second, the voucher-based privatization and the  titanic efforts made by Chubays were not, for all that, in vain  -- there are now so many joint-stock enterprises that  market-oriented directors with the skill to stay afloat under  the new conditions have begun to outnumber antimarket ones, who  can quite simply be ousted now -- and not just from their jobs,  but from the political arena too. Third, the "goundwork" of  capitalist reform -- the stage of the primary accumulation of  capital -- is nearing an end in Russia. Enormous sums of money  deposited in commercial banks are ready to pour into our  industrial sector, but on the basis of private business. The  presidential edict is opening these financial floodgates, and,  to all appearances, a new era which should soon enter the stage  of industrial boom is beginning in the economy.</p>

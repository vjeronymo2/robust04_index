			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / World Economy and Business Review (7): Fiscal rhetoric versus reality - Why the IMF is chiding the G7 / Public Spending and Debt Communique after communique from the Group of Seven leading industrial countries has paid lip service to the cause of fiscal consolidation. But it is naive to read leaders' lips. Action matters far more. In April, for example, the G7 finance ministers and heads of government, meeting in Washington, underlined 'the need to reduce fiscal deficits in all countries with large budgetary imbalances through credible medium-term consolidation strategies. This is important,' they went on, 'both for countries with long-lasting fiscal imbalances and for countries experiencing exceptional adjustment challenges.' The IMF was more direct. In its World Economic Outlook of May 1992 it recalled the 'consensus reached among industrial countries at the beginning of the 1980s that medium-term objectives were best served by adhering to anti-inflationary monetary policies, by reducing fiscal deficits (preferably by restrictions on government spending rather than tax increases) and by eliminating structural rigidities. 'Lack of success in this regard is,' complained the IMF, 'particularly evident in the US and Italy, which both missed the opportunity to consolidate their budgetary positions during the long period of sustained growth in the 1980s. More recently, two countries that were relatively successful . . . , namely Germany and . . . the UK, have experienced a shift from fiscal balance (Germany) or budget surplus (the UK) to substantial actual and projected fiscal imbalances.' The IMF is entitled to wag its finger. According to OECD estimates, there has been structural and not merely cyclical deterioration in the general government budget balances of most OECD countries (see chart). But this pattern must be set against the rather more favourable trends in public finance during the 1980s. First, the growth of public spending was brought under control. Between 1970 and 1980 the share of government outlays in the GDP of the G7 countries rose from 32.3 per cent to 38.4 per cent. In OECD Europe it rose more sharply, from 36.6 per cent to 46.0 per cent. These trends could not continue forever. In the 1980s, they did not. Between 1980 and 1989, the share of government outlays in GDP remained essentially unchanged in the G7 and rose only slightly, from 46 per cent to 47.6 per cent, in OECD Europe. Second, fiscal deficits improved. For the G7 the general government financial deficit reached a peak of 4.3 per cent of GDP in 1983, falling to 0.9 per cent in 1989, before bouncing back a little, to 1.6 per cent, in 1990. The pattern for the OECD as a whole was similar. Finally, although fiscal deficits did not shrink fast enough to prevent the overall burden of net public debt from rising in the 1980s, that increase was not dramatic. Between 1983 and 1991, the ratio of net public debt to GDP rose from 28.4 to 32.0 per cent in the G7 and from 35.3 to 41.3 per cent in Europe. But there were a few dramatic deteriorations: Italy's debt burden rose from 68.8 per cent of GDP in 1983 to 99.6 per cent in 1991, Canada's rose from 22.9 to 48.3 per cent and that of the US rose from 24.1 to 36.3 per cent. But Japan and the UK reduced their fiscal debt burdens. Mixed success in the 1980s, followed by back-sliding during the slow down is the reality behind the rhetoric of fiscal consolidation. What then are the prospects for the fairly immediate future? The US is likely to contribute little to consolidation in the near future, whoever is elected president. Meanwhile, Japan has just committed itself to a breath-taking piece of anti-consolidation. The Y10,700bn (Dollars 86m) fiscal package announced at the end of August is the largest emergency package in Japanese history, even as a percentage of gross national product. Meanwhile, Europe remains rhetorically wedded to the orthodoxy of the 1980s. Thus EC ministers emphasised at their meeting in Bath early this month 'the importance of early and full implementation of strict convergence programmes.' That would mean severe pain in several member states, according to the OECD's latest Economic Outlook. Implementation of the Maastricht criteria for fiscal convergence - a 3 per cent target for the overall deficit of general government and a 60 per cent target for the ratio of public debt to GDP - could force substantial absolute reductions in public expenditure on Italy, Belgium and Greece. A leaked report from the IMF says that the belt-tightening required to meet the Maastricht criteria would slow growth across the EC by 0.4 to 0.8 percentage points a year between 1993 and 1996. Whether the Maastricht treaty is ratified or not, fiscal consolidation is likely to be less than advertised in Europe, at least without a spontaneous recovery in economic activity. Fiscal austerity remains the slogan. The reality is, and will remain, rather different.</p>

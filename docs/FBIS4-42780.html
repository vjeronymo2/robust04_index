			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Dino Frescobaldi: "Our Soldiers to Bosnia?"] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Antonio Martino's first action was  to demand a greater international role for Italy. What might  the substance of this greater role be? We know that Italy is  making at least two demands. The first is that our country be  considered for one of the permanent seats when the reform of the  UN Security Council comes under discussion. In view of our  current international image, it is unfortunately likely that  this demand will remain no more than a pious wish.    However, there seem to be better hopes for the other demand,  namely, that Italy participate in the special "contact group"  established by the major powers, which is supposed to find a  solution to the Bosnian conflict and which is meeting in  Switzerland. But here too there are some reservations to be  noted. It is certainly illogical that our country is not a  member of that group, in view of our proximity, our interests in  the area in question, and also the fact that the NATO aircraft  deployed in operations there take off from Italian bases.    So there may be good reasons for supporting the Italian  Government's viewpoint, especially since there is now plenty of  talk about using Italian troops as "blue helmets" in that  theater of war. Hitherto the United Nations rejected this  possibility for two reasons. The first was that, in the case of  Italy and the former Yugoslavia, the two countries shared a  border. However, two new states -- Slovenia and Croatia -- have  now occupied the space between us and Bosnia, so at least on  paper this reason against an Italian presence on the battle  front seems no longer to exist. However, there remains the  other, and more compelling, reason against deploying Italian  blue helmets. Italy was one of the occupiers during the last  war, so that unfavorable opinions among the local populations  might act against it.    However, the United Nations desperately needs not only  troops  but also men to carry out its peace mission. This is why, in  the interview that he granted us a while ago, Secretary General  Butrus- Ghali said: "Of course, in those territories there  could be dangers to the Italian troops stemming from the past,  as, for that matter, would be the case with the Turks, but the  greatest danger that we have to face now is that we have  insufficient UN forces."    However, recently other factors have emerged that could  jeopardize any Italian policy directed toward our disputatious  neighbors to the east. Is it conceivable that Italian troops  could take part in the peace mission in the former Yugoslavia  when there are people in our country who want to challenge the  territorial order that was one of the painful consequences of  the war that we lost?    Fortunately Minister Martino made a point of stressing that,  despite the intention to reconsider some aspects of the  implementation of existing agreements, there is no intention on  Italy's part of revising existing borders. The fact remains that  those who are talking about a revision of borders occupy  prominent positions within a movement that now has  representatives in the government itself. It is they who are  jeopardizing our initiatives in the international field. The  man who allowed himself to get so carried away as to talk about  the "Italian-ness" not only of Istria and Fiume [Rijeka] but  also of Dalmatia is the sanguine Deputy Tremaglia, who holds the  chairmanship of the e Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber  of Deputies, albeit by a single vote. So even within the  majority there are those who are undermining the foreign  minister's comforting reassurances.    This is in fact the problem which, though it mainly concerns  the Balkan issue, obstructs the greater role that the foreign  minister is demanding for our country. It is unnecessary to  recall the climate of exacerbated nationalism into which the  entire Balkan world could plunge. It may be that the Yugoslav  tragedy is just the first chapter in a process that threatens to  spread to other lands and that the countries with a greater  sense of responsibility, including Italy, should strive to halt,  first and foremost by avoiding any kind of demonstration that  could inflame people's feelings.    Those acquainted with the opposite shore of the Adriatic  know  that it is always necessary to draw a distinction. Italy's  influence was strong even in the immediate postwar years, which  were marked by sharp political disputes. At that time, not only  the literature and movies of the new Italy, but also its songs  and products as a whole held a prevalent position. It is  tempting to say that our culture caused people to forget the sad  times of war and the occupation and that a kind of victory was  won over adverse events. But all it took was a few  demonstrations by some politically insignificant groups  displaying revanchist intentions to prompt sharp accusations  against Italy and the Italian people. It is as though we were  witnessing a conditioned reflex response having the power to  unite everyone, irrespective of their differences. This was  confirmed a few days ago when the Croatian leader, Tudjman, took  advantage of a few remarks by some Italian figures to express  heated opinions in public in excessive and furious language.    Minister Martino is right to consider it unacceptable that  Italy is absent from a forum in which the future of a region so  closely bound to us is discussed. But he must guard against  those who are in practice sabotaging his efforts to gain  credibility. Only if he does so can he gain more credibility  and be better heeded.</p>

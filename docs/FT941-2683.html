			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / BBC journalists to hold Acas talks The NUJ journalists union has agreed to talks at Acas, the conciliation service, in its dispute with the BBC over the introduction of multi-skilling. It has postponed plans for a strike on March 28 timed to coincide with the launch of Radio 5 Live, the 24-hour news and sport station. The union said last night that it was not ruling out strike action in the future if the Acas talks achieved nothing.</p>

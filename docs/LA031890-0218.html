			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THIS 'SOUTH' WON'T RISE AGAIN  </P> <P> One of the biggest disappointments for so many of us was to discover that the  miniseries "North and South" was not being continued. The potential for an  immensely romantic and historically significant series created around the Civil  War era and the nation's recovery would have advertisers beating down the  network's doors!  </P> <P> Kathleen Fitzgerald, Thousand Oaks  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BEHEMOTH FROM BEVERLY HILLS ANGERS BRENTWOOD NEIGHBORS  </P> <P> She calls it the Nightmare on Wellesley Street. It came to her neighborhood  like a bad dream, without warning. In the middle of a September night. In more  than one segment.  </P> <P> Amelia Warwick said she must face the "monstrosity" daily in her South  Brentwood neighborhood, and she and other horrified homeowners want to send it  back where it came from.  </P> <P> The object of their scorn is a boxy duplex moved west from Beverly Hills and  planted at 832 Wellesley St., which is actually an avenue that ends at Montana  Avenue, across the street from the Brentwood Country Club boundary.  </P> <P> The offending structure covers 94% of its lot in a neighborhood in which most  homes occupy about 25% of the property. The duplex is tall enough to dwarf the  surrounding bungalows and will have an apartment-like stairway running  diagonally across the front of the building.  </P> <P> Although the behemoth from Beverly Hills took most of the neighbors by  surprise, its cross-town move was approved by the city Department of Building  and Safety as befitting the neighborhood.  </P> <P> An effort by the South Brentwood Homeowners Assn. to have the permit revoked by  the Building and Safety Commission was denied Tuesday on a 3-2 vote.  </P> <P> "I don't know what else these people want from us," developer Arnie Corlin,  co-owner of the duplex, told the commission. Corlin said he viewed the  building, built in the late '30s on Camden Drive in Beverly Hills, as an asset  to the area.  </P> <P> It will get a new front and be tastefully painted and landscaped, he said.  Ultimately, Corlin said in an interview, he and a partner hope to sell the two  units as condominiums.  </P> <P> About 40 residents trekked downtown to City Hall to protest the granting of the  permit, with their councilman, Marvin Braude, leading the charge. The  commission received 86 letters opposing the relocated building.  </P> <P> The appeal was based on a provision of the law that requires a relocated  building to conform to its new location as to size, architecture and design.  "This is a gross deviation from the neighborhood standards," Braude argued to  the commission.  </P> <P> Resident Robert Breech noted that at 6,200 square feet, the duplex has twice  the square footage of the largest dwelling on the street, where the majority of  houses are in the range of 1,000 to 1,500 square feet.  </P> <P> Breech said the rectangular design of the building was disparagingly called a  "dingbat" by architects. "Cars literally slow in their tracks to observe it,"  he said. "It should be lifted up and taken out."  </P> <P> Residents were not forewarned that the building would be arriving because no  public notice is required when a building is relocated, according to department  officials.  </P> <P> Developer Corlin said he talked to some neighbors before moving the duplex, but  some of them claim that he misrepresented the building. Attorney and homeowner  Sheldon Jaffe said after the hearing that his wife and another neighbor were  told the day before the duplex was moved that they "were moving in the most  beautiful Spanish duplex ever seen in Beverly Hills."  </P> <P> A building and safety inspector approved the project, using guidelines in the  ordinance that require surveying buildings within 1,000 feet of the site.  Because there are large buildings a few blocks away on Montana in an area zoned  for apartments, the inspector found the duplex suitable for the area.  </P> <P> To the neighbors, it sticks out like a sore thumb. The neighborhood, south of  Montana and north of Wilshire Boulevard, between Bundy Drive and Wellesley  Avenue, is filled for the most part with small houses of various designs and  vintage. They are set back from the street with atypically large front yards,  giving the area an expansive, green look.  </P> <P> There are a few other visible signs that the neighborhood has been discovered.  Remodeling projects are under way, and a few large homes dot the area. But the  relocated building galvanized the residents, said Ellie Pelcyger. "The  obscenity of this one just upset everyone."  </P> <P> Pelcyger, a member of the homeowners' appeal committee, said members are  reviewing their next step and may file suit. "If building and safety won't  enforce the law, we're investigating who will," she said.  </P> <P> But Warren O'Brien, who heads the department, told the commissioners after the  vote that the problem was the ordinance itself, which requires an inspector to  take into account buildings within 1,000 feet, even though they may be on a  major street zoned for large buildings.  </P> <P> Although commissioners expressed the hope that Corlin would work with  homeowners to mitigate their objections, the climate does not seem favorable.  Corlin said that he keeps finding nasty notes and other unspecified mischief in  his building each day and that his workers are being harassed by passers-by.  </P> <P> Residents accused Corlin of lying on his application for a permit. Jaffe told  the commissioners that the developer had understated the size of the building.  </P> <P> Corlin said any misstatement was unintentional and had been corrected.  </P></p>

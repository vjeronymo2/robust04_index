			<p>BFN     [Text] Lieutenant Governor Mitsuki Tomon of the Okinawa  Prefectural Government is now in Tokyo for an exchange of  greetings with officials in government ministries and agencies  upon the assumption of her post. In connection with the crash  of an F-15 fighter that was taking off from Kadena Air Base, the  lieutenant governor visited the headquarters of U.S. Forces  Japan [USFJ] in Yokota on the morning of 6 April. During a  meeting with officers of the command, the lieutenant governor  stated: "The U.S. military aircraft crashed near fields in  which farming has been tacitly approved and near the Southeast  Botanical Garden, which at the time had many tourists visiting  it. Had one thing gone wrong, the crash could have resulted a  terrible disaster involving Okinawans. We regret the occurrence  of such a crash." She also asked that the command conduct a  thorough investigation into the cause of the crash, that it  report its results to the Okinawa Prefectural Government, and  that it operate U.S. military bases safely and take measures to  prevent a recurrence of the crash.    After deciding that "it is effective to make a request  directly to the USFJ command," the Okinawa Prefectural  Government asked the lieutenant governor to visit the command.  The lieutenant governor is now coordinating a visit to the U.S.  Embassy in Tokyo to make the same request. Okinawa Prefectural  Governor Ota, who has considered visiting Tokyo, will fly to  Tokyo on 7 April. During his stay in Tokyo, he intends to ask  the Foreign Ministry, the Defense Agency, the Defense Facilities  Administration Agency, and other related government ministries  and agencies to request the USFJ to investigate the cause of the  crash.    Lieutenant Governor Tomon told officers of the U.S. command:  "A total of 111 crashes involving U.S. military aircraft have  occurred since Okinawa reverted to Japan, and of the crashes, 12  involved F-15 fighters. In the past year, four crashes  occurred, and F-18 Hornet fighters assigned to Kadena Air Base  collided in the air over Mike-Mike [as published] waters in  December." In this way, the lieutenant government cited a  series of crashes which had taken place on Okinawa.</p>

Airports for civilian use in seven local cities have been  expanded, rebuilt or renovated, with original soil runways  replaced by cement ones, advanced lightning equipment installed  and other basic facilities greatly improved.    Renovated airports in Huhhot and Hailar can now accommodate  Boeing-737 and MD-82 airplanes day and night.    Along with the improvement of airport conditions, the Inner  Mongolia subsidiary of Air China has also brought in BAE-146 and  Boeing-737 jets to replace older and smaller airliners.    The increased number of airplanes of varying sizes has  greatly enlarged total turnover of air transportation in Inner  Mongolia with today's 15 airline routes of 20,000 kilometers  long, linking the autonomous region with nine large domestic  cities, Hong Kong and Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia.    This new air corridor over the endless grasslands and Gobi  Desert in northern China has contributed a lot and will  contribute more to local economic prosperity.</p>

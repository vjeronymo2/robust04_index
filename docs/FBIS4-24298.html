			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town June 28 SAPA -- The South African National  Defence Force [SANDF] had made contingency plans for armed  intervention in Lesotho and was waiting to be given  instructions, minister of defence Mr Joe Modise said on Tuesday  [28 June]. He told a press conference that the SANDF had  contingency plans for all southern African flashpoints in case  it was required to move in.    There had been increasing concern among the Frontline States  over events in Lesotho, where dissident police and army factions  have been responsible for continuing armed disruption and  killings.    Earlier this month President Nelson Mandela expressed fears  that the unrest could have en effect on South Africa.</p>

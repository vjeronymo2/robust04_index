			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Fifteen wounded by shelling in Sarajevo Fifteen people were reported wounded by shelling in Bosnia's capital, Sarajevo, yesterday, as a top UN official warned that Bosnia's citizens were facing a further year of misery, writes Laura Silber. Mr Tony Land, of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said: 'There's no logistic, no humanitarian reason why anyone in this country should be hungry or cold. It is completely political and military.' With little hope the war would end soon, he told reporters in Sarajevo it was significantly harder to supply the besieged capital than a year ago. Food was held up in areas held by Serbs and Croats 'and people are hungry'. Bosnian radio reported a surge in fighting between Croat and government forces in the southern city of Mostar. President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia has said his forces will intervene if Moslem troops continue attacks.</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Probe fuels row over Berlusconi coalition: Confrontation with judiciary unsettles Italian stock and bond markets The future of Italy's right-wing coalition was thrown into question yesterday with Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, at the centre of an escalating confrontation between the government and the judiciary. The heightening of the conflict followed an outspoken interview with Mr Saverio Borrelli, the Milan chief public prosecutor. Mr Borrelli gave a blunt warning that anti-corruption investigations were closing in around the prime minister, although in a later statement he denied that a warrant was pending for Mr Berlusconi in relation to inquiries into Telepiu, the TV channel 10 per cent owned by the Italian premier. In his interview Mr Borrelli also accused Mr Alfredo Biondi, the justice minister, of mis-conduct as a defence lawyer. Mr Biondi then offered his resignation, which was unanimously rejected at a special meeting of the cabinet. Mr Biondi later withdrew his resignation. Throughout a day of rapid events, political tensions mounted and prompted scuffles outside the prime minister's office in Rome. Demonstrators who had arrived to oppose cuts in pensions turned their attention to protests against Mr Berlusconi's continued presence as prime minister. Financial markets reacted nervously. The lira fell at one stage to 1,018 against the D-Mark, compared with 1,005 the previous day. Government bonds slipped to one of their lowest quotations of the year and on the Milan bourse the index fell 2.5 per cent. The interview with Mr Borrelli in Corriere della Sera prompted an indignant response from the government. Mr Giuliano Ferrara, the chief spokesman and minister for parliamentary relations accused the judge of using 'Mafia-style tactics' and said he planned legal action to discipline Mr Borrelli. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro discussed the crisis with Mr Berlusconi at a special morning meeting. The talks with the president were themselves coloured by a row between the head of state and Mr Berlusconi over the presentation of the 1995 budget last Friday. President Scalfaro publicly chided the government for submitting 400 pages of budget text for signature only 15 minutes before the midnight deadline. In the interview, Mr Borrelli was asked about government attacks on Milan's anti-corruption magistrates the previous day. Mr Berlusconi had accused them of distorting the path of justice to pursue a political vendetta against him and his Fininvest business empire. 'There is no point hiding things,' Mr Borrelli said. 'It is true we are at a crucial turning point. What has already appeared in the newspapers about Telepiu shows clearly we risk touching business and politics right at the top.' In 1990 Mr Berlusconi was obliged under anti-trust laws to divest 90 per cent of his stake in Telepiu in 60 days. Magistrates are investigating whether he retained secret control through friendly shareholders.

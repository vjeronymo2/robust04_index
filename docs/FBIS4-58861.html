			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] On the same day when the Algerian people are  commemorating the painful May massacres, over 20 national  associations and organizations have called for staging marches  throughout various provinces of the homeland supporting the  national dialogue and rejecting violence and extremism.    These marches are supported by many political parties, in  the  forefront of which are the National Liberation Front [FLN], the  Rally for Culture and Democracy, the Islamic Ennahda Movement,  and the Islamic Society Movement, HAMAS.    Amidst tight security measures, the march began after a  delay  of about one hour. The radio team is with us live:    [Unidentified correspondent] Yes, Djamila, the march  dispersed a short time ago--about 15 minutes ago--after having  lasted for about two hours to cross the distance between 1 May  Square and Martyrs Square. The start of the march at the  scheduled time, at 1000, was delayed in order to allow  participants to leave their offices. The early time and the  tight security requirements were the reasons for the delay.  [passage omitted]    This was evident from the fact that after the reading out of  the statement that crowned the march--15 minutes  ago--participants kept flowing into Martyrs Square. The march  passed calmly and quietly, broken only by the occasional  trilling cries of joy from the women.    Alongside the members of the march preparatory committee and  representatives of 20 associations, two political figures were  present. They were Abdelhamid Mehri, secretary general of the  FLN, and Mahfouz Nahnah, leader of the HAMAS Movement.    The banners that were raised were agreed upon, among them:  "No to Violence, Yes to Dialogue"; "No to Extremism"; "No to  Exclusion, Yes to Meeting". A large banner carrying the slogan  of the national reconciliation was at the front of the march.    The number of participants in the march is not known  precisely. The observations were conflicting. Some of the  organizers expressed satisfaction, claiming that the number of  the participants was 100,000 persons. Some observers, among  them journalists, noted that the number did not exceed 30,000 or  40,000 persons. The official estimates might resolve this issue.    A statement, which was a message addressed to the president  of the state, was read out at the end of the march. The  statement stressed that the initiative was an expression of  civilized behavior to open a new chapter in which all the sons  of the homeland meet. The initiative is also an expression to  reject violence, reject one-upmanship--regardless of the  slogans--and reject the solutions that contradict national  constant and firm principles.    The statement also expressed support for the president of  the  state in his endeavors for national reconciliation through  comprehensive and deep dialogue.    This was a general report about the march. From the street  where the march took place, here is a report from colleague  Ahmad Khaida:    [Khaida] Mohamed, this march--which some participants  considered to be a march of hope and others a march of a new era  for Algeria--has stirred various reactions. Some of those  interviewed said that, from a historical point of view, the  march is a symbol and an example. One of them said that the 1  May Square is a symbol of work, and the Martyr Square is a  symbol of martyrdom. [passage omitted]    We also remind you that some of the parties rejected  participating in the march. Among these was the Socialist  Forces Front, which said the march was not in harmony with the  democratic principles of the party. The Party of Algerian  Renewal said such initiatives would only intensify the tension.  The Ettahadi Movement said that those for reconciliation and  dialogue, as they called them, pave the way in front of what the  Movement called fundamentalists, and would constitute a mount  from which they could pounce on the government. The Algerian  General Workers Union barred its unionists from participating in  the march. [passage omitted]</p>

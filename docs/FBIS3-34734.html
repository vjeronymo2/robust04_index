			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani in Azadi </F> Square, Tehran, on 11 February -- recorded]    [Text] May God keep you. May God protect you dear ones,  you brave Islamic community. Thank you very much for your  kindness and good words. To calm the crowd, let us all chant a  slogan in honor of the Prophet.    In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. It is  truly a shame that our dear Imam [Khomeyni] and martyrs cannot  be with us today to see this splendid scene of the extensive  presence of the Islamic ummah in Freedom Square. Of course,  their blessed spirits are with us and they can witness this  glorious gathering, these enthusiastic sentiments and this  historical epic.    I can see in the surrounding areas, in all the streets  leading up to this square -- as far as the eye can see, there  are crowds hastening and rushing toward the square, chanting  slogans, although they know they will not arrive in time for the  ceremony. They keep coming, however, just to say, we are here  just as always. I would like to thank them most humbly and I  would like to praise their intelligence, awareness, loyalty and  sincerity.    Undoubtedly, today, on 22 Bahman, beginning the 16th year of  this glorious revolution's life, hundreds of millions of eyes  are gazing at this spot from throughout the world and, tonight,  hundreds of millions of people will sit around their television  sets to see images of this splendid gathering and to renew, once  again, their hopes in the future of Islam's revolution and to  revitalize themselves for greater action and jihad. And our  enemies are watching the streets of Tehran with anxiety and with  the false hope that, with the passage of time, our people will  become alienated from the revolution or indifferent to it. God  willing, they will take this hope to their graves.    The people can sense the presence of the revolution in their  lives with all their existence and this tangible sense that they  have of the effects of the revolution will not allow them to  forget it, even though the new generation does not have any  memory of the past and cannot compare the post-revolution  society with the pre-revolution one. However, it has heard from  others and from history and it knows. And, even if it does not  know about the past, it can compare its own society with other  societies. They can compare this society where the names of  heaven, the Koran and the lofty commandments of Islam fill the  air with their perfume with those other societies where  blasphemy, atheism, apathy, and secular systems invite the  people to be immoral and unjust, to discriminate, to submit to  sensual pleasures and ungodly ways. The new generation, too, is  suitably equipped to make this comparison, assessment and  judgement.    Sixteen years ago our nation which had gathered in this very  Azadi Square and streets leading to the cemetery and waited to  see its imam had not seen the present days. This is the main  difference between the young generation then and the young  generation now. At that time they looked to the future and  today they see the manifestations of the divine promises. Many  of the manifestations of dualism, oppression, corruption, and  tyranny which ruled over our society have gone. The  manifestations that had turned everywhere, the television,  radio, school, university, seaside, street, movie theater,  theater, newspapers and magazines to centers of vice, lust and  corruption of the youth. All things were contaminated with the  corrupt western culture. But wherever they look today they see  the Koran, Islam, call to justice, propagation of virtues and  prohibition of vice, prayers and justice.    The furthest we go from the capital and move into the heart  of villages and the border regions, the affects of the  revolution are better felt. There they know that all services  once used only in the capital and several large cities are now  provided to all parts of the country. Schools, electricity,  drinking water, roads for transport, telephone and post are  being provided to distant villages and places in the deserts in  the same fashion that that they are provided for the cities.  They see that the country's means are being used in the more  distant places for development and construction. In the past  few days people have heard that 1,600 development projects in  deprived areas and thousands of more development projects across  the country have started operations. The radio and television  and the press have reported on some of these but the people who  live in those areas feel their effect. The further we go from  the capital, the people are happier, fresher, more hopeful, more  participant, and more loyal to the revolution.    With such background and realities the news of imperialism  is  wasting its time uselessly. The more they propagate the less  they achieve. The more they seek to blackmail through  propaganda the less the result. In fact on the contrary, the  false propaganda reminds the people of the world -- who might  gradually forget the revolution if left to themselves -- to  study our revolution and thus we add to the supporters of the  revolution every day across the world, despite all the dreadful  propaganda. They have left no accusation and lie. For years  they accused us of terrorism but the world does not believe it.  The people across the world can see the hands involved in  terrorism. People know the victims of international terrorism.  In Iran people have seen and buried enough victims of terrorism  and today continue to visit the grave of their martyrs for  prayers. How could they believe the American accusations that  Iranians are terrorists and support terrorists in the world.    They accuse Iran of violating human rights. But their own  hands are in the the people's blood up to their elbows and their  whole being is involved with usurping human rights. Bosnia,  Palestine, Somalia, and other places are witness to this claim  of ours. If today they raise any issue regarding social justice  and global peace, the people of the world will not believe them  when they witness the Bosnia-Herzegovina case. But the people  of the world see that truly the Islamic Republic declares that  we are ready to despatch 10,000 soldiers -- who will take their  lives in their hands -- to Bosnia at our won expense so as to  establish peace and consolidate security but they do not let us  in because they know we will be supporting righteousness and  peace over there, which is something that they do not seek.    The claim of human rights violation against Iran falls on  deaf ears among nations; although the media and mercenary news  agencies propagate such claims. That fails to have any effect  on our nation. All their propaganda arrows have hit granite.  They have begun an extensive propaganda onslaught so that they  might make our nation despair about the future and become  discouraged. But even there the palpable effects of the  revolution do not allow them to succeed. They embark on economic  sanctions, put pressure on our income resources. They wish to  damage us -- at the expense of their own friends -- by making  oil prices plummet. But tomorrow they will see that even those  actions will bring about a reverse result; something that is  quite palpable today. The world will notice that such words are  no longer of any effect.    In these 15 years -- and specifically in its First  Development Plan -- the Iranian nation succeeded in carrying out  infrastructural work in such a way that the oil price fall can  no longer inflict any general damage to this country and or to  the revolution since plans have been made to replace oil revenue  by various means. At one time we needed to sell oil and import  goods for all our consumer requirements so that our people could  live. But those days have now passed. Today our factories take  the main part of their raw materials -- from steel, copper,  lead, and zinc to aluminum -- from what we produce ourselves.  And our other factories take the main part of their  requirements from our own petrochemicals. And our laborers  today work with indigenous, Iranian and national materials. Our  specialist forces have taken the place of foreign advisors and  experts to such an extent that in no arena does our nation feel  the need for any foreign expert force. And if there is a special  case there are adequate numbers of those who would take a wage,  work, and take orders. The Iranian factories do not need to  make use of arrogant forces.    More than 90 percent of the country's consumer goods are  being made in our own factories and workshops. Our nation, our  farmers, our cattleowners, our poulterers, and our fishermen  have been able to meet the society's required food supply by  their own efforts and with the aid of their system and  government. And export a great deal as well.    They thought that, with all the machinery in our possession,  we would be dependent on spare parts. With the extensive  measures that were taken in relation to making and designing  spare parts inside the country, according to a very firm policy,  during the past five years, today, we do not need to import any  spare parts for a great deal of our industrial equipment.    Our universities are rapidly supplying our required work  force. The dependence of our communications on foreign resources  has been reduced to a very small amount.    They can indulge in as much propaganda as they like to  dishearten our people, but our people can see how things are for  themselves. They saw how their regime pursued two very  difficult programs at the same time: one, economic adjustment,  and, two, economic development; giving priority to  infrastructural and cultural tasks. They saw how it travelled  this path with success. They can also see how our own neighbors  are having so many difficulties in carrying out their policies  of economic adjustment and of changing their structures.    Can this have any reason other than that our people are  present on the stage, are vigilant, are aware, support their  regime, endure the problems that result from this revolution  treading along its difficult path by itself, obey the eminent  leader of their revolution [Khamene'i], are loyal to the path of  their eminent late imam, value the blood shed by their martyrs  and draw inspiration from the dear families of martyrs, those  missing in action, the war disabled and the former POWs and from  the proud POWs and war disabled themselevs, who are the torches  guiding this country. And the hizbollah forces throughout the  country, in villages, towns, factories, schools, universities,  offices -- everyone can see among themselves everywhere these  intelligent, dear and determined supporters of the revolution.    They can see the armed forces [crowd interrupts chanting  slogans] -- thank you for your good words and sentiments. They  see the Armed Forces, the Revolution Guards' Corps, the proud  Mobilization forces, the Law Enforcement Forces and the other  sectors at the service and in great support of the revolution.  This great body is participating in all villages and cities  across the country. Everywhere you will see something similar to  the Azadi square where intelligent and enlightened people have  come to express their loyalty, strength, and steadfastness.  Reports I have received since this morning indicate that across  the country people are using their time, effort, and voice at  the service of the revolution and Islam today. Your  participation will make the faltering tongues of the world  arrogance stutter even more for sometime and will shut them up.  And even if they scream and yell it will only hit a mountain  that will return it to them. I sincerely thank your honors and  the dear students who carried out such a sweet song so well in  this great square and all those who organized and managed the  good programs for the Ten Days of Dawn celebrations. May God  keep you. God willing we will meet again in the other venues of  the revolution. May God's blessings and peace be upon you.</p>

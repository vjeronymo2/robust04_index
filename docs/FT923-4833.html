			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Positive response to currency plan AND with one bound he was free] The innovative foreign currency borrowing plan announced yesterday by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, achieved more than its primary goal of strengthening the pound. It also boosted UK equities, the gilt edged and money markets and the dollar. Mr Lamont has put his money where his mouth is by making clear the Ecu10bn borrowing in foreign currencies will be converted into sterling through the foreign exchange market in addition to any normal market intervention. Some Ecu5bn will be borrowed in D-Marks - some in the next few days, the rest by the end of this month - and sold for pounds. The British government has borrowed foreign currencies on many occasions before to strengthen its gold and currency reserves. But this is the first large borrowing in D-Marks for many years and the first occasion in which the government has committed itself to converting the proceeds into sterling. The effect has been to create a demand for the pound and to underline the government's commitment to sterling's DM2.95 parity in the European exchange rate mechanism. Mr Lamont now has a very real incentive not to devalue the pound in the European Monetary System, because that would raise the cost of servicing and paying back the debt. As the markets responded positively to the British government's decision to tie the pound more closely to the D-Mark, officials were hopeful the UK may be able to avoid a damaging rise in bank base rates from their current 10 per cent level in the event of a French No vote in the September 20 referendum on the Maastricht treaty. The borrowing programme is also intended to strengthen Britain's defences against a further slide in the US dollar and a consequent appreciation of the D-Mark. With President Bush's fortunes uncertain ahead of the US election in November, the Treasury and Bank of England are aware the US could order a further cut in official short-term interest rates, despite their being an already wide 6.75 percentage points below equivalent German rates. The sterling proceeds of the Ecu10bn borrowing programme will be used to help finance the public sector borrowing requirement, which in this financial year is expected to overshoot the government's Pounds 28bn target. But the size of the borrowing - equivalent to Pounds 7.27bn - reflected the UK authorities' assessment of what would impress foreign exchange markets and does not reflect any official estimate of the likely borrowing overshoot. Governments are normally wary of borrowing large sums of money abroad. It is a measure often associated with the lax finances of 'banana republics'. But the Treasury and Bank reasoned yesterday's plan was to deal with an external problem created by the upward pressures on the D-Mark and the dollar weakness that had left the pound unfairly caught in the crossfire. According to officials, the borrowing plan is acceptable when seen in the context of the UK's firm to tight monetary stance. The plan was hatched by the chancellor, senior Treasury officials and monetary experts at the Bank, headed by Mr Eddie George, the deputy governor, as sterling's position on the foreign exchange markets deteriorated recently. It is hoped the measure could even prove a good deal for the British tax payer, if, as expected, the borrowed funds will be converted into sterling while the pound is weak in the ERM and paid back when it is stronger. As they contemplated yesterday's measures, officials could only think of one serious downside risk - that the Treasury would lose in the event of a collapse of the ERM or a devaluation of the pound. But these contingencies, as Mr Lamont has repeatedly underlined this summer, form no part of government economic policy.</p>

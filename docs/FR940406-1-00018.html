OSM has identified four alternatives that the combined PED/EIS would evaluate as described in the supplementary information of this notice. OSM requests that other agencies and the public submit written comments or statements on the need for an EIS on the petition and the scope of the issues which should be analyzed in the combined document. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments must be received by 5 p.m. (EDT), May 18, 1994.

L. 95&hyph;87). The petition was amended on February 22, 1994, and deemed administratively complete and accepted for processing on March 15, 1994. A subsequent amendment with exhibits was received on March 16, 1994. The petition as accepted is a 26 page document with 100 pages of exhibits and an amendment. An additional 18 pages were received as part of a second amendment after the determination of completeness. The Federal Program for Tennessee, as administered by OSM, applies to all surface coal mining operations in Tennessee including the processing of lands unsuitable for mining petitions (49 FR 38874, October 1, 1984). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The petition area occupies approximately 3,780 acres of the Little Yellow Creek watershed in Claiborne County, from the headwaters to the Tennessee State line and includes portions of Fern Lake. The petition boundary runs essentially from the Tennessee State line at Kentucky Corner on Cumberland Mountain in a southwest direction along the crest of Cumberland Mountain to a point at the watershed divide between Tackett Creek and Little Yellow Creek. The petition boundary then crosses from Cumberland Mountain to the crest of Mingo Mountain across this watershed divide and proceeds in a northeasterly direction until it intercepts the Kentucky/Tennessee State line. The boundary follows the State line to the east back to Kentucky Corner. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The major allegations of the petition can be summarized as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Surface coal mining operations will affect fragile lands in which the surface coal mining operations could result in significant damage to important scientific or aesthetic values or natural systems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Surface coal mining operations will affect land in which the surface coal mining operations could result in a substantial loss or reduction in the long-range availability of water supplies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Surface coal mining operations would be incompatible with local land use plans of the Cumberland Gap National Historical Park. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 21 Apr -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev today expressed the hope that neither the petty  provocations of the Moslems, the criminal artillery shelling of  civilian targets in Gorazde, nor the threat of the unleashing of  an air war in Bosnia will wreck the talks in Belgrade planned  for 22 April between the UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi and the  Serb leaders Slobodan Milosevic and Radovan Karadzic.    Russia, he noted in a conversation with an ITAR-TASS  correspondent, has done a great deal and is prepared to continue  its efforts to establish a lasting interaction between the  Serbian side and the UN in the hope of settling the situation  around Gorazde and strengthening the safety zones. It is  important to move without delay toward a comprehensive reduction  in all hostilities in Bosnia-Herzegovina, a draft of which has  already been prepared through the joint efforts of Vitaliy  Churkin and Charles Redman, the co-chairmen of Russia and the  United States.    I hope, the minister stressed, that the Serbian President S.  Milosevic will this time be successful in putting into practice  the policy that was agreed upon during the course of our  conversation with him during the night of 16-17 April, because  it is precisely this which meets the interests of the Serbs and  their traditional relations with Russia.</p>

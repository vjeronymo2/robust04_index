			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by President Nelson Mandela on the SAPA PR </F> Wire Service on 24 June]    [Text] The minister of defence, Mr Joe Modise, has made  representations to me about the need for additional senior  personnel to run his ministry.    Taking into consideration the important role of the South  African National Defence Force and the challenges it faces with  regard to the vital process of integrating the different armed  forces, the request was acceded to.    I am therefore pleased to announce the decision to appoint  Ronald Kasrils as deputy minister of defence for the Republic of  South Africa.    Mr Kasrils has acquired experience in military affairs as a  leading officer of Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC  military wing]. His experience, expertise and skills enabled him  to play an important role in the defence sub-council of the  Transitional Executive Council. I am confident that he will do  the same in his new role as deputy minister of defence.    [Signed] Nelson Mandela    President</p>

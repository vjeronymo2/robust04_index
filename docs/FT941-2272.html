			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Business and the Law: Analysts wary of tighter net - Robert Rice looks at the impact of expanded insider dealing regulations The quashing last month of the insider dealing conviction of Mr Thorold Mackie, a Scottish investment analyst, has done little to calm the nerves of the UK securities industry about the new insider dealing laws which came into force at the beginning of March. His conviction in 1992 sent shock waves through the securities industry. To many Mr Mackie's prosecution seemed little more than a heavy handed attempt to punish a respected analyst for doing his job well. Events leading to the conviction involved Mr Mackie, who worked for Edinburgh stockbrokers Bell Lawrie White, learning from Mr Peter Runciman, chairman of waste disposal company Shanks McEwan, that things were not going well at the company. Mr Mackie subsequently advised his clients to sell short. Soon afterwards Shanks McEwan issued a profits warning. The shares sold by Mr Mackie's clients realised Pounds 1.4m more than they would have done after the warning was issued. Mr Runciman gave evidence at Mr Mackie's trial that he had told Mr Mackie that the company was about to issue a profits warning. Mr Mackie maintained that he had merely said there would be little by way of growth in earnings per share during the current half year. But his ordeal also served as a sharp reminder to the investment community of what the new law had in store. The drive to create open and fair markets by widening the scope of the UK's insider dealing laws appeared to threaten irreversible change to the traditional relationship between investment analysts and the corporate sector. Since the Mackie trial many analysts will now only talk to companies in pairs so that corroboration of what was said is possible if required. And it has become increasingly common for analysts to begin meetings with company chairmen by begging them not to tell them anything which may make them an insider. In spite of Mr Mackie's subsequent acquittal the investment community remains wary and there is little sign of them relaxing their guard while the full impact of the new laws remain uncertain. Their concerns were on display in Edinburgh last week at a seminar organised by the Securities Institute. Mr Frank Doran and Ms Kathleen Stewart of Scottish solicitors McGrigor Donald attempted to calm nerves by pointing out that despite the wider ambit of the new regime many of the principles of the old law still applied. The new laws make it an offence to deal in securities or encourage another to do so when in possession of inside information, or to disclose inside information other than in the proper performance of a job. Their scope has expanded in three respects: the securities covered; the markets regulated; and the geographical area of the offence. Dealing now includes any off-market deal made through a professional intermediary as well as those on a recognised stock exchange. Securities has a wider meaning and will include debt securities, depositary receipts, options and futures. The offences now cover markets in 19 European countries and extend to any investments made through intermediaries, and disclosure or encouragement made to persons in the UK from anywhere in the world. Inside information is defined as specific price-sensitive information relating to particular securities which have not been made public. The 1993 Criminal Justice Act provides that it will be judged price-sensitive when, if made public, it would be likely to have 'a significant effect' on the price of any securities. There is no longer any requirement for a connection between the insider and the company to which the information relates, but the individual must have obtained the information from an inside source. There are a number of general defences: the insider had no expectation of any profit, or the avoidance of any loss would result from dealing on the basis of the information; the insider reasonably believed that no parties to the transaction would be prejudiced by not having the information; and the insider would have done the same thing even without inside information. There are also specific defences for market makers acting in good faith; persons acting reasonably on market information; and those acting in conformity with the price stabilisation rules in the 1986 Financial Services Act. Part of the problem faced by the financial community in interpreting the new law over the coming months is the lack of any precedent. Since insider dealing laws were first introduced in the UK in 1980 there have been just 32 prosecutions and 15 convictions, of which 9 pleaded guilty leaving only 6 convictions resulting from contested cases. As Mr Neil Davidson QC pointed out six cases under a previous regime are not much of a guide as to the likely impact of the new law. Companies fear the new law will interfere with normal contacts with investment analysts. Mr Brian Fidler, finance director of Christian Salvesen, told the seminar that if the net result of the new regime was that companies stopped talking to analysts it would be a big step backwards in the drive to create more perfect markets. His views were echoed by Mr Adrian Fitzgerald, director of equity research for NatWest Securities in Edinburgh. The new laws could seriously threaten valid lines of communication between analysts and companies, he said. If the effect of the was that analysts would be forced to tell companies 'please don't tell me anything which may help me to make a better value judgment' then there was a serious danger of information and communications becoming sterile. He said the regulations would lead to less efficient markets with securities incorrectly priced; more speculative comment; more volatile securities prices; and an increase in profits warnings under stock exchange guidelines on dissemination of price-sensitive information. But there are more specific concerns. Mr Fitzgerald said it would often be unclear whether information had been made public or not. This meant that when analysts wanted to use information but were unsure whether it was public they would have to consult a compliance officer and possibly lawyers. There is also concern about what is and what is not price-sensitive information and what constitutes 'significant impact' on the price of securities. To many in the City significant means movement of 10 per cent or more. But Mr Fitzgerald said there was 'little logic in a law which says here is a grey line, step over it and you commit an offence, stay behind it and you are OK'. He added that if 'significant' was judged by an arbitrary movement in share prices you could end up with odd and unfair results. A fund manager who got it right and made Pounds 150,000 would escape prosecution if the shares moved only 3 per cent, whereas an individual who got it wrong and shares moved 10 per cent could face prosecution even if only Pounds 100 profit was made. In addition to these concerns, many believe that the only people to benefit from the new law will be lawyers. But until precedents have been established analysts and fund managers should bear in mind that even the best legal advice cannot guarantee whether conduct remains within or outside the law. Their only real comfort is as Mr Doran pointed out: 'The Act was not created to punish people who are acting innocently.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Camaguey correspondent Lucilo Tejera] </F>   [Text] In Camaguey, Nelson Torres, member of the Politburo  and sugar industry minister, has issued a call to those  participating in the current sugar harvest to make a greater  effort during this phase of the harvest. April is very important  to the objective of increasing the quantities of raw product  produced, and May must be the month in which operations are  concluded, although a number of mills may continue to grind in  June, said Torres during an analysis of the harvest in Camaguey,  Las Tunas, and Holguin.    He stressed that a greater effort is necessary on the days  when there is activity, and pointed out that it would be a good  idea to increase the direct transportation of cane from the  fields where it is being harvested to the mills. He also called  attention to the fact that it is indispensable to apply  alternatives at each place to reduce dependency on electric  power provided by the national system, because during recent  working days, collection centers were affected by interruptions  in electric service.    During the analysis meeting, which was presided over by  Carlos Lage, member of the Politburo and secretary of the  executive committee of the Council of Ministers, it was reported  that Las Tunas obtained the best results in principal indicators  during the period 1-10 April, pushing Camaguey into second  place. Camaguey had been in first place.</p>

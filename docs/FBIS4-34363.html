			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] New York, 17 Jun (AFP-NA) -- Emilio Cardenas,  Argentina's ambassador to the United Nations, said on 17 June  that Argentina has expressed its "total support" for the French  humanitarian military operation in Rwanda to put an end to the  killing of civilians in that African country, but it will not  participate in the operation with troops.    "The French mission has humanitarian characteristics and for  that reason it is supported by Argentina," Cardenas said after a  UN Security Council consultation meeting.    The ambassador did not rule out, however, his country's  participation with a logistics contribution. Cardenas explained  that Argentina could not send troops because it has reached the  "practical ceiling" with its participation in UN peacekeeping  operations.    Regarding the logistics support, "the only thing we can do  is  move the hospital operating in Mozambique with the commitment  that it will stay in Rwanda only after 15 November. We could  consider moving the hospital to Rwanda, but only after that  date," Cardenas added. [passage omitted]</p>

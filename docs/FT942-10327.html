			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Arts: Falling over England There is one minor surprise in Falling Over England. Harry Cowper, the man who has risen from sub-lieutenant to captain during six years in Egypt, wants to go into politics when he comes back from the second world war. He chooses the Tory Party, not Labour. In the event, his wife declines to let him stand since she does not want to live in Tintagel, even for the odd weekend, nor in London either. So the political ambition has turned out to be something of a red herring. It has merely served to establish Cowper as a bit of a bounder: anti-foreigner, mildly corrupt, pro-public school and generally refusing to grow up. Julian Mitchell, the author, seems reluctant to grow up, too. Falling Over England is the sort of play that should have stopped being written around the mid-1960s. It has three periods: 1945 and the end of the war, 1956 - the year of Suez, and the present day. Suez is dominant. Cowper's 20-year-old son, Matt, leaves the country rather than respond to the call to enrol as a paratrooper during the Suez campaign. The father dies of a mixture of drink and incomprehension. By the present day, the same Matt is having problems with his own son, Tom, who has unleashed a load pigs onto the M4 in the interests of animal rights. His Oxford career may be jeopardised. The message is that English family life, in its rather unpleasant way, goes on: tea in the garden, the move from mild idealism in youth to mild reaction in middle age. As Matt, now Matthew puts it: 'When I was Tom's age I thought there'd be no public schools by now. Or private medicine. Or dukes with millions of acres . . . I thought people could be educated to a higher standard. Nothing's happened.' The only change is a debate in the Cowper family on whether the next generation might possibly go to a state school: there is a passing reference to someone reading law at Durham. All the characters are stereotypes except the daughter Sarah, who has a kind of independence in her painting and journalism, but seldom steps far out of the family line. The aim cannot be satire because the characters are not strong enough; nor is it affection since most of them are so unattractive and Falling Over England is certainly not comedy - more old-fashioned soap. James Laurenson plays the elder Cowper. Matthew Francis directs. Greenwich Theatre. (081) 858 7755</p>

			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Road to China is mapped across Laos: The opportunities and worries arising from better transport links UNTIL recently, the single biggest foreign exchange earner for the Laotian government was the sale to airline companies of permission to fly over the country. Now a bridge is being built across the Mekong River from Thailand that will eventually allow people to drive through Laos all the way to China. Government officials in Vientiane, the Laotian capital, are anxious to prevent the country from becoming a bypass on the route between south-east Asia and China, or what one foreign resident referred to as an 'Indochina truck stop'. But western and Asian diplomats in the city say Laos could benefit greatly from improved transport links with its neighbours. Today, the country's largest income derives from the sale of hydroelectric power to Thailand and trade with Thailand is an essential and growing sector of the economy. The government expects this trade to continue to expand, particularly after the Mekong River bridge linking the two countries is completed. The bridge, which is being financed by a USDollars 30m (Pounds 20.1m) grant from the Australian government, is scheduled to open in April next year. The Thailand-Laos Friendship Bridge is the first stage in a grand scheme to link Thailand by road with China, Burma and Vietnam. The idea is to upgrade existing north-south and east-west routes through Laos to ease the flow of goods between south-east Asia, Vietnam, Burma and China. Laotian officials are cautious about the scheme, which they say could seriously damage the domestic economy if it allows Chinese goods to flood the country. Industrial development has been slow in Laos and domestic producers are in no position to compete with cheap Chinese imports. It will be some time before the Thailand-China highway will be a reality, but work has already started on a road to carry Laotian goods to the Vietnamese coast for export. Thailand's ambassador to Vientiane, Mr Nikhom Tantemsapya, said Laos should benefit greatly from better transport. 'If Laos can turn itself into an effective middleman, it could really reap some profit,' he said. He said the people of Laos should be wary of too much foreign influence, not only from Thailand but also from the other four countries which border this land-locked nation: Burma, China, Vietnam and Cambodia. 'Laos is a small country and has every right to fear people might come in and exploit their resources; but it should not be limited only to Thailand,' he said. Meanwhile, Thai traders are becoming increasingly active in the Laotian capital, taking advantage of the economic reforms instituted in the late 1980s when Laos abandoned a commitment to a centrally planned socialist economy. For now, it is largely a one-way trade and Laos's annual exports are still worth less than half its imports. Thailand is also the biggest foreign investor in the country, with investments worth Dollars 160m - at least 40 per cent of the total. All eight of the new banks being built in Vientiane are Thai-owned and there is a general sense on the streets of the capital that Thai influence is pervasive. In Vientiane and the other towns along the Laotian side of the Mekong River, most radios and TVs are tuned to the Thai channels broadcast from the other bank. Cafes and shops play Thai pop music and there is a growing number of signs written in Thai. Western diplomats say the Laotian government is well aware of the need to control the flood of Thai economic and cultural influences. They also say the government's economic reforms have been a great success so far and that the domestic economy is developing along sound lines. Gross domestic product grew by 7 per cent in 1992 and is expected to expand at about the same rate until the mid-1990s. The agricultural sector contributes almost 60 per cent of GDP but industry and the service sector are also growing steadily. In June the International Monetary Fund backed the government's economic reform programme with a Dollars 50m loan under its enhanced structural adjustment facility. Outside the capital, though, little is changing for the 85 per cent of Laotians who still live by subsistence farming. Officially, Laos is one of the five poorest countries in the world with a per capita GDP of just over Dollars 200 a year. However, western diplomats say these statistics disguise a growing rural economy where trade is mostly done by barter and does not show up in official figures. Nobody suggests Laos is a wealthy country but the diplomats say few people are living in poverty since the government's economic reforms allowed them greater access to a market economy.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LAOS: KEY INDICATORS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                            1991         1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Real GDP growth %                           4.0          7.0 Per capita GDP (current dollar)             217          232 Consumer price inflation:   Per cent change (end of year)            10.4          6.0 Trade (Dollars m):   Exports                                  96.6        132.7   Imports                                 227.9        265.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: Laotian government, IMF, World Bank, Asian Development Bank, UN Development Programme, embassy estimates  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

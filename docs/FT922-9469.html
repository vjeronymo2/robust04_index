			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / GEC joins battle for Pounds 2bn deal: Three vie for helicopter order THE GEC group joined the US helicopter manufacturer, Bell Helicopter Textron, yesterday to compete for a Pounds 2bn contract to supply anti-tank helicopters to the British Army. The agreement between GEC and Bell brings a third leading contender to the contest, which is expected to be the biggest in UK arms procurement between now and the end of the century. The others are Westland, the UK helicopter maker, in collaboration with McDonnell Douglas of the US, and British Aerospace in association with the Franco-German Eurocopter consortium. The Ministry of Defence plans to invite formal tenders in October and to place a contract in June 1994. That would initially involve 12 helicopters, but the purchase is expected to total about 125. The contract, to replace the Westland Lynx helicopter now in service, would include weapons, ground equipment, training and support. GEC and Bell are offering a variant of Bell's AH1W Super Cobra, derived from the Huey Cobra and developed for use in the Vietnam war in the 1960s. The UK version, the Cobra Venom, would feature GEC electronics. GEC Avionics would lead the project. Westland has already reached agreement with McDonnell Douglas for a UK-assembled version of the AH64 Apache. BAe is preparing to lead a rival bid by the Franco-German Tiger helicopter, which is still under development. GEC's entry into the contest is part of a strategy aimed at securing a leading place for the group in prime contractorship for whole defence programmes. Last year GEC failed in a joint bid with BAe for a Pounds 1.5bn contract to manage the supply of EH101 Merlin helicopters to the Royal Navy. The British Army has indicated a strong preference for the Apache because of its impressive fire power. A recent report by US Congressional investigators, however, raised questions as to how reliably the helicopter performed in the Gulf campaign.</p>

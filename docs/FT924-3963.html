			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / US approves use of Imigran GLAXO, Europe's largest drugs group, yesterday said the US Food and Drug Administration had issued a letter of approval for its migraine treatment Imigran. The success of Imigran is vital to Glaxo. The drug is one of three potential blockbusters being launched by the company to offset the expected decline in earnings when the patents on Zantac, the world's best-selling drug, expire during the mid-1990s. Brokers UBS Phillips &amp; Drew estimate the drug should generate American sales of Pounds 550m by 1996 and worldwide sales of Pounds 1.05bn. The US is the world's largest market. Analysts had been concerned about the delay in approval following an FDA advisory committee recommendation in November 1991. There have been concerns about cardiovascular side-effects. Glaxo said it had received a letter notifying it that Imigran, known in the US as Imitrex, would be given final approval once certain conditions had been satisfied. These included agreeing the wording of the packaging insert and prescribing information. Glaxo said discussions with the FDA were under way. It could not predict when the drug might be launched. The approval is for the injectible version of the drug. An application for the oral version has been deposited. Imigran had sales of Pounds 43m in the year to June 30. It has been launched in 22 countries. The company refused to give details of the drug's US price. Glaxo's pricing policy for Imigran has been heavily criticised by European ministries of health. The company had long-running discussions with the French ministry of social affairs which initially proved unwilling to agree the prices for Imigran required by Glaxo. The group has been anxious to achieve a uniform price throughout Europe to prevent parallel importing from low-price countries to those with higher prices. The US price of Imigran will be politically sensitive, given the increasing criticism of pharmaceuticals pricing. Merck, the largest US drugs group, recently surprised the industry and won political applause by setting an unusually low price for Proscar, its breakthrough treatment for enlarged prostates. However, sales of Proscar have subsequently disappointed analysts.</p>

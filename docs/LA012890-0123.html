			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OFF-THE-WALL STREET  </P> <P> (Reviewer) John Rothchild's point, "You could almost make a case that Wall  Street has been ignored in literature," is well taken and amusingly argued  ("Rascal Money," Book Review, Jan. 7). Rothchild carefully limits himself to  "important novels," so perhaps he may be forgiven for not mentioning the work  of John D. Macdonald.  </P> <P> To mention only one of many Macdonald books that turned on money issues, the  Travis McGee mystery "Pale Gray for Guilt" explored a real estate syndication  scam and a stock manipulation in the development of its plot.  </P> <P> Macdonald earned a Harvard MBA, as I understand. And he certainly didn't limit  himself to "baseball, fishing, adolescence and being Jewish" in his choice of  interesting subjects.  </P> <P> I'll mention this, too. Two years ago, my agent put me in touch with a book  packager who asked me to prepare a proposal for a series of mysteries to be  called "Wall Street Undercover." Nothing came of it -- the packager didn't have  his ducks all in a row, as the Wall Streeters might say -- but I can vouch that  the interest in Wall Street fiction is out there.  </P> <P> LAWRENCE HENRY  </P> <P> BEVERLY HILLS  </P></p>

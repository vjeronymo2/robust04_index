			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Letter: Subsidies contrary to free market Sir, Whatever happened to Wandsworth Borough Council's espousal of free markets? 'In a Nutshell' (Management, April 28) described the locum personnel service, Q-Tab, funded jointly by the council and Aztec. I first heard of this venture in March and wrote to the then leader of the council, Sir Paul Beresford, asking him to explain the rationale behind the use of public money to subsidise a service already provided in the private sector. I am an independent personnel consultant offering a broad range of services to small and medium-sized organisations not having their own personnel functions. Not only do I and other entrepreneurs like me have to face this grossly unfair, publicly-subsidised competition, but that competition receives free advertising in the Financial Times. Your article makes it clear that Q-Tel is seen as a pilot which may be expanded and replicated by other Tecs and councils. I should like to think that these bodies will pause to think very carefully about the possible unintended consequences of their doubtless well intentioned actions. I do not relish the prospect of seeing the taxes I pay used to deprive me of my livelihood. No, I did not receive an explanation, or an acknowledgement, from Sir Paul.

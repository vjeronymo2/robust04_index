			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Bluebird Toys shares rise 30p Shares in Bluebird Toys rose 30p to 850p yesterday as Mr Torquil Norman, chairman, told the annual meeting that pre-tax profits for the first half to June 30 would not be less than Pounds 6.5m compared with Pounds 1.99m last time. Trading to date had been well ahead of the same period a year ago in both its home and overseas markets. The two main ranges, Polly Pocket and Mighty Max, continued to grow strongly - particularly in the US. The company expects to declare an interim dividend of 8p, equivalent to 2p per share after the share split due to take effect on May 23. Mr Norman told the meeting that he was looking for a record year - pre-tax profits for 1993 amounted to Pounds 9.8m. He added that Bluebird would move to a full listing in the first half of June.</p>

			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> BALTIC REPUBLICS SEEK OLYMPIC SLOT  </P> <P> The Baltic republics of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania hope to achieve partial  Olympic recognition by the 1992 Games and total sports freedom after that, the  Latvian sports minister said today.  </P> <P> The three republics, which had independent Olympic committees from the  mid-1920s until 1940, now supply athletes to Soviet national teams.  </P> <P> Latvia and its Baltic neighbors went to the Soviet sports committee in Moscow  last December seeking autonomy and were rejected, Sports Minister Daumants  Znatnajs said through an interpreter. But they returned a month ago and were  told such a move would be considered.  </P> <P> Znatnajs said he hopes that as a first step, Baltic competitors will have the  name of their republic written beside the familiar CCCP (the Cyrillic letters  meaning USSR) on jerseys at the 1992 Olympics. He also said the republics want  to march under their own flags in opening and closing ceremonies.  </P></p>

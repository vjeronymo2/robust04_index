			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Competition): A winning choice The choice of the name Fledgling for the new FT-SE-A share index is the result of a competition among FT readers. The winner is Basil Scott, a 70-year-old retired accountant who lives in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire. Scott was one of seven readers who chose the name Fledgling in the form (singular) and spelling (not Fledgeling) deemed most appropriate by the panel of judges. His entry was the first pulled out of the hat in a tie-breaker and his prize is three magnums of pink champagne. The competition produced 1,500 entries and more than 600 different names were submitted, ranging from the amusing (Pink Dwarf, Dolly Mixtures), to the oddball (Amoeba, Anthill and Maggot), and the conservative and worthy (Microcap). There were also plays on letters (Mice - Minor Company Equities and Mopsi - Minor Organisations Prices Share Index). Many of the names were drawn from nature: Acorn, Bantam, Bambi, Bronco, Chrysalis, Cubs, Cygnet, Grubs, Minnow, Sapling, Sprats, Smolt and Tadpole. The index, to be launched on January 3, will cover companies too small to be included in the FT-SE Actuaries All-Share Index, which covers more than 98 per cent of UK stocks. The competition was judged by a three-member team from the organisations which sponsor the FT-SE Actuaries series of indices: the Financial Times, the London Stock Exchange and the Institute and the Faculty of Actuaries. The judges were concerned that the name for the index should reflect the character of an index composed of very small companies and be consistent with, but distinct from, the existing FT-SE-A share indices. They also felt the name should, ideally, reflect both the potential and risks of investing in very small companies, which do not necessarily turn from little acorns into mighty oaks. They decided that Fledgling - which implies vulnerability as well as possible growth - best met all of these criteria. The name also has the attraction of alliteration: the FT-SE-A (or 'Footsie') Fledgling index.</p>

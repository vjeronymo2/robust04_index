			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Davies plays down CBI rift with Tories on Europe Talking heads: there are no differences between the government and the Confederation of British Industry on Europe, CBI director-general Mr Howard Davies (left with Mr David Hunt, employment secretary) said yesterday. He also renewed his calls to the European Commission not to destroy jobs through excessive regulation, Tony Jackson writes. Mr Davies told the CBI that early coverage had focused on supposed conflicts over Europe. 'But there is in fact no substantial point at issue between the CBI and the British government on current policies towards the European Community in general, or economic and monetary union in particular.' Mr Davies said the argument over wage levels and social costs in Europe had become unduly polarised. 'There are those who argue that our salvation lies in tight cost control, in wage discipline, flexible labour markets and reduced social and regulatory burdens on business,' he said. Opposed to that were those who believed that Europe could not be the lowest-cost producer, so had to concentrate on training, investment and innovation. In fact, he said, Europe had to pursue both objectives at once. Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, backed the second objective in a speech to the conference. However, Mr Davies said, the speech had contained for the first time an admission by Mr Delors that high non-wage costs caused unemployment. Mr Davies repeated his appeal to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, who addressed the conference on Monday, not to raise taxes sharply in the forthcoming Budget. 'The chancellor, I hope, left with a very clear idea of what we want and don't want,' he said. 'We don't want large tax increases to brake the recovery. We want tight spending control and some encouragement for investment, particularly by small firms.'</p>

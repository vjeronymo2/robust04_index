			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (4): New teeth for the watchdogs - Finance THE TRANSFORMATION OF THREADNEEDLE STREET by James Fishman Carolina Academic Press, 316 pages THE OLD order already seems a world consigned to prehistory. In fact it is less than six years since the City of London's Big Bang swept the system of jobbers and independent stock brokers aside. However, that is time enough for the academic perspective to be drawn. This lucid but detailed study is a useful contribution to understanding the change, which is especially timely in view of the current debate about the future of the Securities and Investments Board. It is helped perhaps by the fact that the author, James Fishman, a law professor at Pace University, is an American. He therefore has the objectivity of an outsider, even if this comes with a tendency to promote US solutions such, for example, as his central recommendation that the SIB should become more like the SEC. At the heart of the debate over financial regulation has been the need to draw a balance between a statutory or rule-based approach and self-regulation by the industry itself. A mixture of the two is evident on both sides of the Atlantic, but the US tilts more towards the former, the UK to the latter. A drawback of the statutory approach is that it gives the lawyers a field day and quickly expands into a bureaucratic tyranny. Self-regulation by industry practitioners is more flexible but there is the risk of regulatory capture where the supervisory body simply ends up defending the interests of the industry it is trying to control. There must thus be some questions about its effectiveness. Self-regulation seemed an obvious choice to the City as Big Bang approached. Not only was this the tradition under which it had worked for a long time. There was also the desire, after the Labour government of the 1970s, to keep the government at arm's length. But the mistake of the SIB under its first chairman, Sir Kenneth Berrill, was to be too heavy-handed. Its first rule book covered 430 pages and weighed 4lb. To its horror the City discovered it was becoming subject to the kind of rule-based regulation it had sought to avoid. Under its second chairman, Sir David Walker, the SIB retreated the original concept of general principles, leaving more specific rules to be developed by the specialist self-regulatory organisations. The UK system of regulation has also played a useful role in preventing abuse through its authorisation process, which weeds out unsuitable entrants to the market. Yet the system remains flawed in several respects. It involves a cumbersome network of overlapping responsibilities. Financial institutions face a high cost of compliance because they may have to deal with several different regulatory organisations. Some of these have proved extraordinarily weak and prone to regulatory capture. IMRO, which covers fund management, was criticised for not spotting the Maxwell pension frauds. FIMBRA's responsibility for retail insurance broking left it weakened by compensation payments. The most glaring defect, though, has been failure to enforce the rules. Indeed, the Blue Arrow affair came as a particularly nasty blow to the concept of self-regulation, because the scandal enveloped institutions such as National Westminster and Phillips and Drew which were at the centre of the financial establishment. The author is rightly sceptical of the contribution to enforcement made by the Department of Trade and Industry, which he says is pervaded by a passive bureaucratic approach. Similarly the serious Fraud Office is 'just another layer in the enforcement bureaucracy.' He regards the SIB as an institution of more potential. It could be strengthened and turned into a statutorily-based commission, not an arm of government. Its main role would be to investigate and enforce, while the Bank of England should have oversight over investor protection. Were these changes to occur, the SIB would become more like the US SEC, which Fishman admires because it is better co-ordinated than the UK regulators and attracts high-calibre staff. This goes rather further than the recent Large Report, which came too late for coverage in the book. Mr Andrew Large, head of the SIB, also wants to beef up the SIB, but he sees it more as a supervisor of the existing SROs. That system should become more effective if those covering the retail market were merged into one, stronger entity. Mr Fishman's solution would require new legislation. Mr Large shies away from that, although he has proposed the introduction of plea-bargaining, which exists in the US alongside the availability of the civil penalties that makes the SEC's enforcement task much easier. Were it to be introduced in the London market any budding British Boeskys would really have to watch out.</p>

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Observer: Port in a storm Presumably, the British government was too occupied with explaining away last week's terrible unemployment figures to notice that one of its oldest lame ducks - the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company - has made a startling recovery and is beginning to behave like a glamour stock. Its profits and dividend rose by a quarter last year and cargo volumes were up by 12 per cent. With results like these, it's hard to imagine there's a recession on and even harder to imagine that this company spent almost two decades in the government's intensive care unit. Today, its shares are selling on 18 times fully taxed earnings and are trading at a premium to the market. It is even talking of buying a rival port on the east coast.</p>

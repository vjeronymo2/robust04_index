			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE NEARING VOTES ON WHETHER TO OUST TWO IMPEACHED U.S. JUDGES  </P> <P> Walter L. Nixon whiles away the days in a minimum security jail in New Orleans,  the only federal judge in prison and only the second in history to be convicted  of a felony while serving on the bench.  </P> <P> The Mississippi jurist still draws his $89,500-a-year government salary --  totaling more than $300,000 since his 1984 conviction for perjury. Only by  impeachment can a federal judge be stripped of his lifetime tenure and salary,  and years can pass while both houses of Congress conduct lengthy  investigations, hold hearings and finally vote.  </P> <P> The vote on Nixon will come up soon -- not long before he is due to be paroled.  But, first, Congress will deal with the case of Florida Judge Alcee L.  Hastings, the other federal judge now undergoing impeachment proceedings, on a  perjury charge. It has taken six years to reach a final vote on whether to oust  Hastings, a decision scheduled for the end of this month.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cost Exceeds $1 Million  </P> <P> The Hastings and Nixon cases have spurred efforts to find a way to speed up the  process. Critics point out that, in just the last six months, two dozen  senators and a parade of lawyers and Senate staff members have given time to  the two impeachment proceedings. The cost so far, not including the federal  judges' salaries, has been more than $1 million.  </P> <P> "The system is awkward and doesn't function well as we enter the 1990s and the  21st Century," said Rep. Robert W. Kastenmeier (D-Wis.). "It might have worked  at the beginning of the republic . . . but it doesn't work really well any  more."  </P> <P> Raoul Berger, a retired legal historian at Harvard, said that the impeachment  process diverts Congress from its legislative work. "The savings and loan  crisis is much more important than throwing out a judge," he said. "There's got  to be an easier way to do it."  </P> <P> Berger has long advocated removal, after review, for conduct that violates the  Constitution's dictate that judicial tenure is conditional on "good behavior."  </P> <P> Kastenmeier, who participated in the impeachment of U.S. Judge Harry E.  Claiborne of Nevada three years ago, has introduced a bill to establish a  commission to recommend ways to streamline the impeachment process.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Sen. Howell Heflin (D-Ala.) is pushing for a constitutional  amendment that would allow Congress to delegate much of the work of impeachment  to a panel of judges and lawyers, who would conduct the investigation and  trial. The system is modeled after one Heflin helped develop for state judges  in Alabama.  </P> <P> Either approach will face opposition from those who feel that a cumbersome,  complex removal process is a deliberate safeguard of judicial independence.  </P> <P> Article II of the Constitution stipulates "high crimes and misdemeanors" as  offenses for which Congress may impeach a President, vice president or federal  judge, and it requires that the House investigate and impeach (indict), after  which the Senate must try the case.  </P> <P> During the drafting of the Constitution, James Madison took exception to a  suggestion that impeachable offenses include "maladministration." He warned  that the inclusion of that offense would be tantamount to judges' serving at  the "pleasure of the Senate."  </P> <P> "It's a matter of considerable gravity to the whole government when one branch  of government removes another," said David O. Stewart, Judge Nixon's attorney.  </P> <P> "Tinkering with one part of our governmental structure is very risky business,"  added Stephen Burbank, a University of Pennsylvania law professor.  </P> <P> "We don't think it should be easy to impeach a federal judge," said David  Sellers, a spokesman for the federal court system. Sellers warned that changes  in the system could create as many problems as they solve and said that  tampering with lifetime tenure could open the door for political manipulation  of the bench.  </P> <P> No one denies that the present system, whatever its merit, is time-consuming.  The Hastings case is a textbook example.  </P> <P> A Florida jury acquitted Hastings in 1983 of charges that he conspired to  accept a bribe. But evidence suggested that Hastings might have lied under oath  during the investigation, and an impeachment process was started.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Evidence of Perjury  </P> <P> A panel of fellow judges investigated for more than three years before  concluding that there was enough evidence to try Hastings for perjury. The  issue then went before a House panel for investigation, debate and a vote. Then  it went to the full House, which voted 413 to 3 to try Hastings.  </P> <P> Over the summer, a Senate committee spent four weeks hearing the case. On Oct.  24, the whole Senate, in closed session, is scheduled to vote on whether  Hastings will be the sixth federal judge in history to be convicted by the  Senate.  </P> <P> Nixon, meanwhile, has been undergoing an identical series of hearings since a  jury in 1984 convicted him of two counts of perjury when he denied intervening  in a narcotics case involving the son of a business executive who had given him  good deals on oil investments. In May, the House voted, 417 to 0, for  impeachment. A Senate panel heard the case in early September, and the full  Senate is expected to vote on Nixon's case soon after Hasting's.  </P></p>

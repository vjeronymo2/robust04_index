			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 5 December, a relevant government official  revealed that North Korea and the United States have completely  reached an agreement on the principles for inspection of seven  nuclear-related facilities in North Korea by the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], on announcing the suspension of the  Team Spirit exercise, and on resumption of North-South dialogue  in a third round of high-level talks. The official added that  removing differences over minor issues was the only procedure  remaining.    The official said that the two sides differed on the title  for inspection of the North, but that the two sides agreed late  last year that "inspections will be carried out so that the  IAEA's safeguards measure in North Korea and its continuity are  ensured." Thus, he indicated that the only remaining point of  dispute was the venue for discussions between the IAEA and North  Korea on resumption of inspections.    Observers believe that North Korea may agree on sites other  than Pyongyang as the venue for discussion of resumption of  inspections.    Another government official said that "suspension of the  Team  Spirit exercise will also be announced when North Korea  officially expresses its will to accept inspection." He added  however, that the announcement of the suspension of the Team  Spirit exercise will be made with the proviso that IAEA  inspections should be carried out successfully and that the  exchange of special envoys of the North and the South should be  realized.</p>

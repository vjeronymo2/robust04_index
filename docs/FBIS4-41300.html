			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Yuriy Sizov and Vladimir </F> Malyshev]    [Text] Kerkyra June 23 TASS -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin declared on Thursday that an agreement on partnership  and cooperation between the Russian Federation and the European  Union belongs to major and significant events in the European  political life. Yeltsin spoke at a dinner given in honor of  heads of countries of the European Union and the Russian  president by the Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou.    "We have been led to an agreement which will be signed  tomorrow, by a sense of responsibility for the future of Europe  and a great desire to give our children a more peaceful, more  stable and free continent," he said. "This document opens new  possibilities for the construction of genuinely integral,  prosperous and safe Europe which plays an important positive  role in the world of the 21st Century," Yeltsin said.    "The main task now is to realise the agreement as soon as  possible and with the maximum result," the Russian president  said. "It is in the interests of both Russia and the European  Union - two largest political and economic centers of Europe,  two powerful trade and economic partners. We shall imminently  have to resolve problems which we have failed to resolve until  now," he pointed out.    Speaking about concrete tasks which will have to be resolved  in the near future, Yeltsin noted that it will be necessary to  give Russia an access to the European Investment Bank and begin  to unconditionally apply GATT norms and rules in mutual trade.  It is necessary to facilitate visa regime for Russian citizens  in EC countries, he added.    According to the Russian president, lifting restrictions on  Russian goods in the EC market is of tremendous importance for  the success of democratic transformations and market reforms in  Russia. In his opinion, "the agreement lays a good basis for  this." Yeltsin expressed confidence that the development of  large-scale cooperation with Russia will give considerable  advantages to states of the European Union. "This is a way to  stepping up economic activities, the solution of social problems  and primarily, the problem of unemployment," the Russian  president said.</p>

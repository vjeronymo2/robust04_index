			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Tube strike could cost Pounds 1.5m The 24-hour Tube strike, which started at 7.30 last night, could disrupt the travel of about 3.6m people and cost London Underground Pounds 1.5m in revenue. But the company urged the public to use the Tube as normal, saying that up to 60 per cent of the network should be operating today. London Underground is considering seeking damages from the RMT transport union for any income lost as a result of its members' actions. It said that only about 25 per cent of the 7,500 RMT workers on the Underground had backed disruption. It added: 'This strike has no mandate.' The company has decided not to mount a legal challenge over the ballot's validity although it has suggested that some staff did not receive ballot papers. The RMT executive decided to hold the strike after a three-hour meeting yesterday at which it discussed the legal position, given London Underground's allegation that the ballot had not been conducted fairly. The union is demanding at least a 4 per cent pay rise for its members although five other unions have settled for 2.5 per cent deals for their members working on the Tube. Mr Wilf Proudfoot, the RMT's assistant general secretary, said last night: 'I don't believe we are asking for anything that is unreasonable. We remain ready to resume negotiations at any time. I expect RMT members to give the strike call their total support.' The union executive has not announced any further strikes. Seven days' notice has to be given of any planned disruption.

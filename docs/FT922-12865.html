			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Michelin jumps 6.8 per cent as loss shrinks in 1991 BOURSES were generally firmer as Michelin's results gave a boost to Continental of Germany, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS concentrated on individual stocks, Michelin and TF1 in particular. The CAC-40 index closed 9.04 higher at 1,972.31, in heavy turnover of FFr3.2bn which reflected healthy domestic buying. Michelin jumped FFr11.60 or 6.8 per cent to FFr181.30 on 1.6m shares after reporting a better-than-expected result for 1991, during which net attributable loss fell to FFr699m from FFr4.81bn the previous year. The tyre manufacturer also said it needed to have a capital increase but did not say when. Dealers said the new shares were likely to be issued between FFr180 and FFr200 which would put a limit on the share's upside. Several blocks of shares amounting to 1.6 per cent of the television company TF1's share capital were put through the market yesterday. The stock rose FFr5.90 to FFr428.90 with 826,487 shares traded. Dealers said Mr Bernard Tapie, the new urban affairs minister, was the likely seller. Alcatel, which gave a presentation in London yesterday morning, added FFr14 to FFr633 on buying ahead of its issue of ADSs. L'Oreal closed FFr10 up at FFr845 before announcing 1991 results at the top end of expectations, as well as a 20 per cent increase in the dividend. LVMH fell another FFr82 or 1.9 per cent to FFr4,291 on continued concerns about its slowdown in sales in Japan. FRANKFURT saw strong activity in the car sector after reports that prospects for 1992 sales had improved. The DAX index closed up 4.79 at 1,732.53 and the FAZ index, calculated at midsession, rose 0.29 to 707.12. Turnover fell to DM4.4bn from DM4.8bn. County NatWest has reduced its 1992 forecast to a fall of 4 per cent in German car registrations from 12 per cent previously. Sales in the first quarter sales have been strong and it expects a rise in the second half to beat a VAT increase. Among car stocks, Volkswagen was up DM1.70 to DM370.70 while BMW advanced DM2 to DM582.50. Daimler rose to a year's high of DM785.80 before falling back on news that the European Commission was to seek repayment of DM33.8m in state aid received for the purchase of a site in Berlin. Its shares closed DM2.30 firmer at DM781.50. Continental put on 3.4 per cent after positive news from rival tyremakers Michelin of France and Goodyear of the US. Both companies reported improved prospects for 1992. Continental closed up DM8.60 at DM263.00 Siemens was actively traded following a buy note from Deutsche Bank which forecast that Earnings Per Share will rise in 1993 to DM53 from an estimated DM45 this year and DM43 in 1991. Siemens advanced DM4.60 to DM684.20, but off an intraday high of DM686. Altana, which said that it expects a 6 per cent increase in group sales in 1992, gained DM7 to DM700. MILAN drifted lower ahead of the close of the April trading account today. Dealers said that a rise in interest rates by some banks dampened the market. The Comit index fell 1.63 to 499.16 in turnover estimated at less than Monday's L66.6bn. Dealers said that 80 per cent of the monthly call options were abandoned on Monday so there was little selling pressure yesterday. Generali and Mediobanca were the day's few gainers. Generali added L90 to L28,800, while Mediobanca, which revealed that it now held a 12.8 per cent stake in the insurer, gained L60 to L13,300. Trading in Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura was suspended twice because of an order imbalance on the sell side following news that the bank's non-performing loans had risen 6.2 per cent to L802bn. But the stock finally closed at L4,650, down just L100, as friendly parties came to its defence. The Consob was due to meet yesterday to discuss additions to the screen-based trading system. Another 25 stocks are expected to be listed by July. ZURICH rose in quiet trade with gains in the chemical sector helped by the stronger dollar. The SMI index advanced 13.2 to 1,853.8. Roche certificates put on SFr40 to SFr3,150 and Ciba-Geigy registered shares were up SFr10 at SFr3,460. Georg Fischer bearers rose SFr15 to SFr965 after the group announced a 11 per cent rise in first quarter sales and said that it planned further cost-cutting measures in 1992. AMSTERDAM rose slightly with little news to excite interest. The CBS Tendency Index closed up 0.6 at 125.5 in turnover of Fl 439m. Amev, which reports 1991 earnings today, gained 60 cents to Fl 56. BRUSSELS closed higher, as the Bel-20 index rose 5.50 to 1,184.21. Petrofina gained BFr25 to BFr10.500.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - APR 14  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10 am   11 am   12 pm    1 pm    2 pm    3 pm     close 1155.95  1155.63 1157.42 1156.89  1156.65 1156.31 1157.71  1157.52  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Day's High  1158.07    Day's Low  1155.22  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Apr 13    Apr 10   Apr 9     Apr 8     Apr 7 1153.23   1155.74  1140.98   1143.45   1156.82  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

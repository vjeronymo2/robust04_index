			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian cotton estimate cut India's officially-sponsored Cotton Advisory Board has estimated the country's 1993-94 (September/August) crop at 12.1m bales (170kg each), compared with the previous year's 14m, according to traders, reports Reuters from Bombay. Meeting on the eve of the new season, the CAB did not give reasons for the lower crop but traders said the shortfall, occurring mainly in the northern states of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan, was caused by floods and pests. East India Cotton Association president Mr CH Mirani said the CAB estimates were lower than the 12.3m anticipated by trade associations. The world cotton production estimates for 1994-95 had been raised slightly to 19.01m tonnes, from an end-July figure of 18.849m, the Liverpool-based industry publication Cotton Outlook said. The figure reflected a rise in the US estimate to 4.106m tonnes from 4.002m a month earlier. China's projected output remained at 4.3m tonnes, with India's and Pakistan's unchanged at 2.295m and 1.7m tonnes respectively. The Australian crop estimate was down to 341,000 tonnes from 386,000 because of drought.</p>

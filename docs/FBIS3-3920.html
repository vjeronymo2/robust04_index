This  justifies the establishment of a second batch of nuclear power  stations in Guangdong, Fujian and Zhejiang provinces as being  relatively safe, member of the National Committee of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference and Director of the  State Seismological Bureau Mr. Fang Zhangshun said in an  interview with this agency.    The southern area of Fujian, Guangdong and Hainan suffered  from fewer earthquakes than North China and Taiwan even though  they are situated on a seismic belt and quakes measuring more  than seven on the Richter scale have rocked Quanzhou in Fujian  and Xiongzhou in Hainan on several occasions in the distant  past. Quakes which have hit southeast China have mostly been of  small magnitude and of short duration.    The selection of sites for the setting up of nuclear power  stations is in line with international practice and the  geological structure of potential sites. A nuclear power  station must be seated directly in bedrock, meaning no  establishment of a nuclear power station within a radius of five  kilometres of an active fault. Anti-quake facilities for nuclear  power stations are constructed with reference to the greatest  precautions to cope with the biggest quake which could possibly  occur within a period of some 10,000 years. The standard in the  Mainland is much higher than that in Japan and Taiwan where  nuclear power stations are mushrooming.    China will spend ten years on safety assessment and  anti-quake work on its major nuclear power station projects,  according to Mr. Fang. A quake measuring six on the Richter  scale will not be likely to cause great damage or casualties in  economically-developed areas after a period of ten years.    The second nuclear power station in Guangdong will also  probably be built at Daya Bay while a third one is likely to be  located at Yangjiang, another city in Guangdong. A nuclear  power station in Fujian will be constructed either in Huian  County or Changle County while a second nuclear power plant in  Zhejiang will be most likely situated at Sanmen. Jiangxi,  Shandong and Hainan are now working towards the establishment of  nuclear power stations, having feasibility studies already  passed.</p>

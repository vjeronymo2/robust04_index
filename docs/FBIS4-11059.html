			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Today President Alberto Fujimori confirmed the  murder of indigenous Ashaninkas in Quilla and Masamari by a  Shining Path [SL] column.    He also denied that the Army had bombed SL strongholds in  the  Huanuco jungle, or that his government had reached an agreement  with the SL leadership sentenced to life imprisonment.    The chief of state also disclosed that he has reached a  preliminary agreement with the IMF to earmark $875 million  obtained from the privatization process for social expenditures.    Fujimori made this announcement during a working visit to  Huancayo.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] President Fujimori  dedicated another two schools in Huancayo, built by Concode  [expansion unknown]. [passage omitted]    During a meeting with the media Fujimori announced that $875  million obtained from the privatization process will be  earmarked for social expenditures, as part of a preliminary  agreement with the IMF within the framework of the letter of  intent.    [Fujimori] According to this agreement reached with the IMF,  we will be able to use the resources obtained from the  privatization process as an advance on the financial aid we may  obtain in the coming months, the coming year, from the World  Bank and the IDB.    [Reporter] Fujimori also confirmed the murder by SL members  of indigenous Ashaninkas in the towns of Quilla and Masamari.    [Fujimori] The number of dead seems to have increased, and  this is very regrettable. The Army has surrounded the SL  members near the Ene River near the town of Quiteni. I also  want to categorically deny a press report that the Army used  helicopters to bomb the terrorists. This is not true, nor is it  true that I have held a dialogue with [SL leader Osman] Morote.  What the president has done is to show that Morote and his  supporters are being held in highly secure prisons. [end  recording]</p>

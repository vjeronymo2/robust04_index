			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LAWSUIT ACCUSES ESCONDIDO OFFICERS OF THEFT  </P> <P> An Escondido couple sued the Escondido Police Department Wednesday, charging  officers with stealing $2,500 and a $700 watch during a fruitless 6 1/2-hour  search of their home for narcotics.  </P> <P> Edgar Maloney, 64, and his wife, Johanna, 61, said Officers Barry Sweeney,  Ralph Grapoli and Glen Kirkpatrick raided their home on April 21, 1989, armed  with a search warrant and looking for drugs. No drugs were found and no charges  were filed against the Maloneys, but the officers seized about $13,000 in cash  and a watch belonging to Mrs. Maloney.  </P> <P> According to the lawsuit filed in Vista Superior Court, $2,500 that Sweeney  allegedly took from the couple's son, Bryan, and the watch taken from Mrs.  Maloney are still missing.  </P> <P> The officers did not give the family an inventory of the items taken from the  house, said the lawsuit. The suit also alleged that, when the Maloneys were  allowed to retrieve some items taken from their home, Escondido officers  refused to sign a receipt for the items.  </P> <P> The lawsuit called the search illegal and malicious and also names Chief  Vincent Jimno and the city as defendants. Jimno and other Escondido police  officials did not return phone calls. In an interview with The Times last year,  Edgar Maloney said he and his wife were entertaining two couples on the day of  the raid. He said he was suddenly confronted in a hallway of his home by two  strangers pointing guns at him. The men did not identify themselves as  narcotics officers right away, Maloney said.  </P> <P> The lawsuit comes in the wake of three active investigations of Sweeney by  different law enforcement agencies. The San Diego County district attorney and  FBI are investigating allegations of wrongdoing by Sweeney and other Escondido  police officers that have been made by several people. The allegations range  from stealing to lying and planting evidence.  </P> <P> In addition, Escondido police officials said last week that the district  attorney's office recommended that Escondido conduct an internal investigation  of Sweeney. In a telephone interview last week, Sweeney declined to comment on  the investigations on the advice of his attorney.  </P> <P> Maloney said he has an auto dealer's license. He said the cash seized at his  home came from the sale of a car and a truck, and a deposit placed on another  car days before the search warrant was served on his home. Last month, the  Escondido City Council rejected a claim submitted by the Maloneys, a precursor  to Wednesday's lawsuit.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the HWIR rule for contaminated media is being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed on a different schedule than the LDR rules, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes (and is supported by many commenters) that it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate to address the issue of setting treatment standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for soils within the broader framework of the HWIR rule, since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such treatment requirements are expected to be an integral part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of that rule. In addition, EPA believes that the contained-in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policy is one of the key issues that must be addressed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of a comprehensive regulatory framework for management of contaminated media.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the meantime, hazardous soils are generally subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the LDR treatment standards that apply to the hazardous wastes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with which the soils are contaminated, including those addressed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in today's rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency has stated a presumption, however, that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment standards for as-generated wastes are generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inappropriate or unachievable for soils contaminated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous wastes, within the meaning of 40 CFR 268.44(a) (see 55  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FR 8759&hyph;60, March 8, 1990). It has been the Agency's experience  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that contaminated soils are significantly different in their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatability characteristics from the wastes that have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluated in establishing the BDAT standards, and thus, will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally qualify for a treatability variance under 40 CFR 268.44. For guidance on treatability variances for soils, see the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA Fact Sheet entitled ``Regional Guide: Issuing Site-Specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Treatability Variances for Contaminated Soils and Debris from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Land Disposal Restrictions (OSWER Publication 9839.3&hyph;08FS). For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RCRA actions, the Regional Administrator was delegated the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority to deny or grant these variances in a non-rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure under 40 CFR 268.44(h) on April 22, 1991. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variances may be granted by State agencies in States authorized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for &sect;268.44. Variance authority for CERCLA actions is discussed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in LDR Guides 6A (revised Sept. 1990) and 6B (OSWER 9347.3&hyph;06FS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 9347.3&hyph;06BFS).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As previously noted, EPA chose not to develop separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment standards for soils in this rulemaking, and currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plans to address treatment standards for contaminated soils in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the context of the Hazardous Waste Identification Rule (HWIR) for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contaminated media, which is currently under development. If,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, the HWIR Contaminated Media rule does not sufficiently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address treatment standards for contaminated soils in a timely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manner, the Agency may promulgate such standards in a separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking. Information on the HWIR Contaminated Media rule may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be obtained by contacting Carolyn Loomis, at (703) 308&hyph;8626.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Until LDR standards specific to soils are promulgated, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that treatability variances will generally be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate when hazardous soils are managed as part of site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remediation activities. The Agency recognizes, however, that in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some cases obtaining a treatability variance as provided under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;268.44 could cause delays in implementing remedial actions. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency is currently considering whether changes to the existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variance or authorization procedures should be made as a means of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expediting cleanup actions that are conducted under RCRA or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal or State authorities, or other cleanups initiated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible parties. Such changes, if necessary, will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressed in a future rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Summary of Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Treatment Standards for Newly Identified Organic Toxicity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Characteristic (TC) Wastes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On March 29, 1990, EPA promulgated a rule that identified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organic constituents (in addition to existing EP metals and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pesticide constituents) and levels at which a waste is considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous based on the characteristic of toxicity (55 FR 11798).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because these wastes were identified as hazardous after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enactment date of HSWA in 1984, they are ``newly identified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes'' for purposes of the LDR program. Included are wastes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified with the codes D018 through D043 based on the toxicity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP), i.e., TC wastes. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is establishing treatment standards for each of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituents if they are managed in systems other than those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulated under the Clean Water Act (CWA), those engaging in CWA-equivalent treatment prior to land disposal, and those injected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into Class I deep injection wells regulated under the Safe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Drinking Water Act (SDWA). (For an explanation of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualifications, see the May 24, 1993 Interim Final Rule (58 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 29860).) In addition, because wastes exhibiting the toxicity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristic (TC) can contain treatable levels of other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous constituents, EPA is establishing treatment standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the underlying hazardous constituents, as defined in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 268.2(i). These rules are consistent with the court's opinion in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Chemical Waste Management <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  EPA, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  976 F.2d 2, 17&hyph;8 (D.C. Cir.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1992), cert. denied 113 U.S. 1961 (1993), which held that all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous constituents in characteristic wastes must meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels of performance satisfying the requirements in RCRA 3004(m)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before land disposal, and that treatment standards cannot be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieved by dilution (provided, of course, that treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards are not established below the level at which threats to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> human health and the environment are minimized).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Prohibition of Dilution of High TOC Ignitable and of TC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pesticide Wastes Injected Into Class I Deep Wells  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its ruling on the Third Third LDR Rule, the D.C. Circuit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Court of Appeals remanded the portion of the Agency's rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowing treatment standards for characteristic wastes to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieved by dilution. The Agency is continuing to develop a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory response to implement the court's ruling. As part of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that response, EPA is today requiring that hazardous constituents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in two types of characteristic wastes, high total organic carbon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (TOC) ignitable liquids (D001), and halogenated pesticide wastes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that exhibit the toxicity characteristic (D012&hyph;D017), be fully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treated before those wastes are disposed unless the wastes are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposed in an injection well that has a no-migration variance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency believes that treatment of these particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastestreams is warranted. (See Section VIII_Deep Well  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Injection Issues for further discussion.) The D001 wastes are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ignitable with potentially high concentrations of hazardous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituents, and the pesticide wastes contain particularly toxic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituents. Further, the organics in D001 high TOC liquids can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be recovered, destroyed, or used as a fuel and occur in only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small volumes so that segregation and treatment should not prove  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficult.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Treatment Standards for Newly Listed Wastes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has promulgated a number of hazardous waste listings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since the enactment of HSWA in 1984, referred to as ``newly listed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes'' under the LDR program. This rule describes the treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologies (recycling is a type of treatment) identified as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BDAT for several of these newly listed wastes, and establishes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment standards based on these BDATs. Newly listed wastes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in today's rule are K141&hyph;K145, K147&hyph;K148, and K149&hyph;K151 (coke by-product production wastes and chlorotoluene wastes)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (see 40 CFR 261.32 for a description of these wastes). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

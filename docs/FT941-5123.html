			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Candover Investments optimistic on prospects Candover Investments, an investment trust specialising in management buy-outs, increased net assets per share by 16 per cent in 1993 but pre-tax profits fell by 19 per cent to Pounds 3.3m. Mr Roger Brooke, chairman, said that although 1993 had been 'a relatively quiet year, both for investments and realisations' there had been several encouraging new developments towards the year-end 'which should herald a period of greater activity.' In particular, he said, the profits of many of Candover's investee companies had benefited sufficiently from the improved economic environment to enable them to plan a listing for their shares this year or next. About eight portfolio companies are currently planning flotations which, if completed successfully, could lead to a strong uplift in Candover's net asset value. Net assets rose by 16 per cent to Pounds 69.4m (Pounds 59.8m) while net assets per share rose to 310p compared with 267p at the end of 1992 - a smaller increase than the 23 per cent gain in the FT-SE-A All-Share Index. However, net assets have shown compound growth of 21 per cent in the nine years since Candover was listed. The FT-SE-A All-Share Index has risen 12 per cent a year over the same period. The decline in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 4.1m in 1992, was due partly to the impact of lower interest rates, which reduced the return on Candover's cash balances. The company had cash of Pounds 22.6m at the year end. In addition the group earned fewer financing fees. In a quiet year for transactions Candover, together with its funds under management, invested in two larger buy-outs - Gardner Merchant and Economic Insurance - three smaller buy-outs and a number of follow-up investments in portfolio companies. The main realisation during the year was the flotation of Motor World in February 1993. Since the year-end Midland Independent Newspapers has also applied for a listing. Fully diluted earnings per share fell by 24.4 per cent to 10.33p (13.67p) but, because of the 'good prospects for further growth of both assets and profits,' the final dividend is being increased by 8.5 per cent to 7.05p (6.5p) making a total of 11p (10.25p). The shares closed up 2p at 337p.</p>

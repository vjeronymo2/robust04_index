			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILL BOYARSKY: EXPLOITING PROP. 73 LOOPHOLES  </P> <P> If this primary election illustrates anything, it's that money still dominates  the political process, despite all the laws attempting to limit the corrupting  influence of campaign contributions.  </P> <P> Perhaps you recall that in 1988, California voters approved something called  Proposition 73, restricting contributions to $1,000 a donor. It was the latest  of many political reform laws that have been enacted, amid high hopes, since  the Watergate scandals.  </P> <P> The new law imposed limits on every election in the state, from governor down  to city council. This is important to Los Angeles County, where running for one  of the five supervisorial seats in huge districts is often more expensive than  many U.S. Senate campaigns.  </P> <P> For the most part, supervisorial campaigns are financed by businesses dependent  on county regulation, mostly those involved with real estate development.  Contributions of $5,000 or $10,000 from a single business were not unusual in  the days before Proposition 73. Donations of that size come dangerously close  to vote-buying, and Proposition 73 was supposed to eliminate that evil.  </P> <P> Despite good intentions, all the laws have had weaknesses. Watching the current  county supervisorial election, the loopholes in the latest effort become  obvious.  </P> <P> For example, hotshot lobbyist Arthur K. Snyder, a former Los Angeles city  councilman, threw a fund-raiser for Sarah Flores, who's running for the 1st  District seat of retiring Supervisor Pete Schabarum. The district covers the  San Gabriel Valley and southeastern Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> Snyder is a power. His experience, knowledge of intricate government procedures  and friendships with well-placed city officials have helped him win approval  for big projects. Money also helps -- not his, especially, but money he raises.  </P> <P> Because of his clout, fellow lobbyists and developers don't like to cross him.  They fear a vengeful Snyder putting roadblocks in the way of their  developments. That adds up to a high acceptance rate when Snyder sends out  invitations to fund-raisers.  </P> <P> It certainly helped the Flores campaign. Flores' campaign manager, Ron Smith,  told me the event brought in $7,000. If Flores wins, Snyder will be remembered  in her camp as the man who came up with $7,000 when it was needed. While  Proposition 73 limited Snyder to $1,000, he gets credit for seven times as  much. That's quite a loophole.  </P> <P> Another demonstration of how large contributions can be assembled by a single  person despite the laws came Wednesday night in an unlikely place -- the  corporate headquarters of In-N-Out Burger in Baldwin Park, in the industrial  heart of the San Gabriel Valley. It was the scene of a $500-a-person  fund-raiser for Superior Court Judge Greg O'Brien, probably the best-financed  candidate in the 1st District race and Flores' main rival.  </P> <P> The host, Rich Snyder, president of In-N-Out Burger, provided the meal -- the  house specialty, naturally, along with salads and desserts. The political punch  was provided by Supervisor Schabarum. Both get credit for this one.  </P> <P> Schabarum is supporting O'Brien. Members of the Schabarum political team are  working on the O'Brien campaign. Most important, Schabarum is raising money for  O'Brien.  </P> <P> The supervisor is a prodigious political fund-raiser. His fund-raising pool is  full of people doing business with the county in one way or another. While  reports for the current campaign will not be available until next week, I think  it's safe to assume that he's soliciting money from that familiar pool.  </P> <P> You might make the same assumption about Flores' supervisorial supporters, Dana  and Antonovich, both of whom are rounding up financial support for her  campaign. Their contribution lists also are loaded with names of people  dependent on the County Hall of Administration.  </P> <P> The temptation for candidates to push hard for contributions is tremendous. The  best way to communicate with voters is through mailed advertising. And that's  expensive.  </P> <P> Ron Smith, Flores' campaign manager, said it costs $100,000 for a single  mailing. O'Brien has already sent out two. Former Rep. Jim Lloyd, the third  strong candidate, is in danger of being left behind because he can't match  O'Brien and Flores in fund-raising.  </P> <P> I know many of the contributors simply think O'Brien, Flores or another  candidate is best for the job. That's why they give. I talked to several such  people at the O'Brien fund-raiser. But the rest, unfortunately, have been drawn  into it by the high-pressure political strong-arm tactics that have been left  untouched by political reform laws.  </P></p>

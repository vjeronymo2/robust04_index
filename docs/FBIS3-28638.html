On one hand, the meeting with China could broaden South  Korea's participation in the modernization of its  telecommunications network while that with the U.S. could signal  the beginning of pressure for greater domestic market opening.    Communications Ministry officials said one of the critical  aspects of the meetings is that they are both being held on  foreign soil, tomorrow and Thursday and Thursday and Friday in  Beijing and Washington respectively.    The officials said yesterday that the working level meeting  with China will place primary emphasis on the trial operation of  Korean-made TDX-10 (time division exchange-10) switching systems  in China.    China's Ministry of Telecommunications and Posts has yet to  approve the testing of the TDX systems in the modernization of  their telecommunications network and the meeting is expected to  iron out outstanding issues, the officials said.    The Chinese telecommunications market represents one of the  most lucrative in the world and a number of Korean companies are  already operating there in joint ventures to produce switching  machines.    Led by No Hui-to, the ministry's director of  telecommunications promotion, the meeting is mainly a follow up  on last year's ministerial meetings in Beijing and Seoul and  will also include talks on the agenda for the next high level  meeting.    Among other issues to be put on the table in Beijing later  this week are the scope and timing for joint research and  conditions for engaging in joint investments, the officials  explained.    In Washington, the primary concern will be on examining the  two countries' conformance to the record of understanding (ROU)  concluded in February 1992 which outlined the liberalization of  the Korean market to American companies.    As a direct result of the stipulations of the ROU, AT&amp;T  qualified to bid in the government's open procurement bidding  last August and took home over 17 percent of the switching  systems to be installed this year.    The meeting, the fourth to be held since the conclusion of  the ROU, will be represented by Yim Chong-sin, head of the  ministry's telecommunications cooperation commission, and Peter  Collins, deputy assistant U.S. trade representative.    The ministry officials said the basic purpose of the meeting  is to evaluate the extent to which the two sides have been  abiding by the contents of the ROU but could prove to be a forum  for the U.S. to exert pressure for further and accelerated  opening of the Korean market.    In the previous meeting in Seoul last October, the U.S.  representatives expressed strong interested in the participation  of U.S. companies in the lucrative second cellular telephone  project, the license for which is due to be awarded sometime in  the first half of this year.</p>

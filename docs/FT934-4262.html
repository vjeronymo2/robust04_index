			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / International Company News: French banks to take leading roles in Euro Disney debt talks The Euro Disney banks have formed an official steering committee to represent them in the negotiations towards an emergency financial restructuring package for the ailing leisure group. The committee, which includes 11 of the 60 international banks that own Euro Disney's FFr20.3bn (Dollars 3.45bn) net debt, plans next week to meet representatives of Euro Disney and Walt Disney, its US parent company, in order to begin discussions over the restructuring. The formation of the steering committee should enable the restructuring negotiations to get under way. 'This is going to be a very tense, complicated affair,' said one of the members. 'The sooner we start talking to Disney in earnest the better.' Banque Nationale de Paris and Banque Indosuez, the French banks, will take leading roles in the steering committee. BNP is the head of the 1989 banking syndicate that provided loans to Euro Disney to finance the construction of the Euro Disneyland theme park. Indosuez led a second syndicate in 1991 which lent money to build the park's hotels. The other French banks on the steering committee are Credit Agricole and Credit National. Caisse des Depots, the state-controlled French financial institution will also be involved, although it is negotiating independently with the Disney camp over the terms of its FFr4.8bn fixed interest rate loans. JP Morgan and Citibank, the powerful US banking groups, are also represented on the committee: as are Deutsche Bank of Germany, Barclays and National Westminster of the UK and LTCB of Japan. Walt Disney, advised by Lazards in New York, last month laid out its case to the creditor banks at a special meeting in Paris. It hopes to halve Euro Disney's debt to around FFr10bn by persuading the banks to exchange part of their loans for equity and by staging a rights issue. However, the banks are anxious to ensure that Walt Disney will play its part in alleviating the financial strain on Euro Disney, which is advised by SG Warburg in London. The steering committee is next week expected to table proposals for Disney to reduce its royalty entitlement from Euro Disney.</p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Observer: Here's to you The tone of the debate on the future of British television between John Cleese, the comic actor and maker of classic management training films, and Gerry Robinson, the new chief executive of Granada, has risen a notch or two. When Cleese heard that Robinson had fired David Plowright, chairman of Granada Television, he fired off a very rude fax. Robinson penned a polite reply. Now Cleese has counter-attacked again 'in a slightly less abusive way'. 'You win your franchise as a result of the 'quality threshold' against rivals who bid four times as much. With the franchise nice and safe, you get rid of the man whose reputation for quality was largely responsible for your winning the franchise, and then start dismantling the team that delivered the programmes,' says Cleese. Then he goes and ruins his case by wishing Robinson 'fairly good wishes pending further developments'.</p>

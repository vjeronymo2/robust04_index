			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Italy shaken by further cabinet resignations THE FUTURE of Italy's shaky seven-month-old government was plunged into doubt yesterday after the resignation of the finance minister, Mr Giovanni Goria, and the health minister, Mr Francesco De Lorenzo. Opposition politicians called for the immediate resignation of Mr Giuliano Amato as prime minister and his replacement by an apolitical figure to lead an administration until new elections based on a reformed voting system. Yesterday's resignations follow the decision earlier this month by Mr Claudio Martelli, the former justice minister, to step down. Mr Martelli has been advised by Milan magistrates that he is under investigation in connection with illegal political funding. Last night, Mr Amato was locked in talks with senior representatives of the political groupings that form his four-party coalition amid considerable uncertainty whether the government would survive or be allowed to collapse. Tension mounted throughout the day as magistrates in Milan, Rome, Naples and Asti ordered a wave of arrests of politicians and businessmen as part of the crackdown on political corruption. The atmosphere grew increasingly charged at what should have been a routine address by Mr Amato to the Senate, the upper house of parliament. The corridors of the parliament building were already echoing to growing rumours of impending arrests and resignations. Then first Mr Goria, followed by Mr De Lorenzo, announced their resignation. Mr De Lorenzo's 89-year-old father was yesterday morning placed under house arrest in a separate investigation into illegal political kickbacks. Mr De Lorenzo was told he was under investigation in connection with a Naples votes-for-jobs scandal. Mr Goria is allegedly involved in unspecified corruption relating to the construction of a hospital in his constituency. The tense political climate had an immediate effect on the lira, which fell to L957 against the D-Mark. The currency, which has been under growing pressure as political uncertainties mounted this week, has never sunk so low, apart from a brief spell after last year's decision to leave the exchange rate mechanism. While Mr De Lorenzo's resignation did not come as a surprise, that of Mr Goria was less expected. Both moves are linked to the growing anti-corruption wave sweeping Italy, which has led to numerous politicians being investigated and hundreds of arrests. Tension in the government, which is made up of Mr Amato's Socialist party, the Christian Democrats and the Liberals and Social Democrats, had been rising this week. This followed growing doubts about the chances of a successful reshuffle to broaden its base and allow other parties into the coalition. The loss of two senior ministers could represent the coup de grace for Mr Amato. However, some observers believe party leaders may let the government survive, pending approval of new electoral laws, which could lead to new elections and a more representative administration. While Mr Goria, a former prime minister and treasury minister, has not been under recent judicial investigation, he has been embroiled in a long-running investigation into a 1976 affair involving the local savings bank in his Asti constituency. More recently, leading local Christian Democrats have been investigated by magistrates over allegations of political kickbacks, allegedly totalling L7.5bn, on the construction of a local hospital. Yesterday, magistrates made further arrests of politicians in Asti. In his resignation letter to Mr Amato, Mr Goria said he could 'not tolerate suffering accusations which were unjust, unfounded and unreasoned, without the ability to defend himself'. Mr De Lorenzo's resignation followed Thursday's vote by the parliamentary committee on immunity to approve a request by Naples magistrates to lift his immunity as an MP.

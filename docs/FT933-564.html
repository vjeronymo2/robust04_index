			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (4): The amorous accountant / Industry ACCOUNTANCY'S FAULTY SUMS by Keron Bhattacharya Macmillan, Pounds 25 BEYOND THE BOTTOM LINE by Alan Warner Gower Pounds 19.50 Phil turned to Christine as she started explaining how to value the company. But he found it hard to concentrate on the numbers as he remembered the time they spent together in London . . . Well, even though you and I might consider the answer obvious, your high-fallutin' accountant has another way of dealing with the figures which he manages to justify, oh yes. IF THERE IS one trap that two new accountancy textbooks manage to avoid, it is a conventional or boring approach to their subject. Accountancy's Faulty Sums, by Keron Bhattacharya, a business consultant, is a guide to the basics of external financial reporting and internal management accounting. He touches on many interesting and topical issues, including the favourite of the year, the creative accounting devices used to flatter profits or conceal liabilities. He also provides an introduction into theories such as Activity Based Costing. Probably the greatest strength of the book lies in its examples. Some draw on well-known corporate events to illustrate a point, such as the problems at Cray Electronics and Atlantic Computers. Others come from Bhattacharya's own experiences. He talks about the accountant at one company he was helping to sell who valued stock based on budgeted expenditures devised a year previously at a time of high inflation, substantially swelling losses. He mentions another company he was closing as an illustration of poor cash control. He at first planned to pay all creditors, but then decided to write and ask them if they had any claims. About 90 per cent wrote back to say they did not, so he kept it. The style of writing and the degree of detailed analysis is a rather more awkward point. The chatty approach may appeal to some, but others will consider it a little too irritatingly long-winded, unstructured and full of waffle. He refers to Pacioli, the man credited with inventing double-entry bookkeeping, as 'that old codger from Venice 500 years ago'. A little more research and re-writing would have been worth the investment. Beyond the Bottom Line is written rather more racily. Alan Warner, a management training consultant, uses the highly original approach of a romantic business novel to teach the rudiments of management finance. Phil Moorley works for Chapman Foods in New York, becoming president shortly after a takeover bid from Universal, his previous employer. Christine Goodhart is the management consultant he hires to help him understand the accounting issues. But Phil is also middle-aged and insecure. Christine is blonde and beautiful. They had something of a fling in Britain in the past, or so we gather in numerous references to Warner's previous book, The Bottom Line, published in 1988. Will Phil remain loyal to his wife, or once more succumb to Christine's charms? Will he ever get to grips with the jargon of the takeover and defend Chapman against Universal? All we can hope is that Warner's understanding of management accounting is somewhat better than his rather crude characterisations. However, Beyond the Bottom Line is certainly a readable way to wade through financial issues pegged to real examples in a practical way.</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Lobo restored in Guatemala GUATEMALA'S constitutional court has temporarily reinstated Mr Jose Lobo Dubon as president of Congress after he was ousted in a rebellion against his authority by a group of deputies on Sunday. The court's decision, made on Tuesday night, reinstates Mr Lobo pending a definitive ruling expected within two weeks. The move does not appear to have reduced tension between the two rival groups in Congress squabbling over how they should purge the institution of corrupt members. Congress's limited credibility with the public has plummeted since the crisis began. Pressure to purge Congress came after President Ramiro de Leon Carpio last month called for the resignation of all 116 members in an effort to rid the country's institutions of corruption. Opponents of Mr Lobo, a Christian Democrat, have said they will sue him after a congressmen was allegedly hit with a pistol butt on Monday night in a scuffle with his security guards. Mr Lobo says he will sue Mr Arturo Soto, promoted by the rebel deputies as president in his stead.</p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Nymex to forge link with Sydney exchange The New York Mercantile Exchange and the Sydney Futures Exchange have announced a link that will allow Australian futures traders to trade New York's popular oil and energy contracts through an electronic hook-up at non-member rates. The agreement will put the Nymex's west Texas benchmark intermediate crude futures and options contracts into the Asian time zone for the first time. The electronic link is expected to be operational by September 1995. The announcement may overshadow a mutual offset agreement being discussed by London's International Petroleum Exchange and another large Asian trading centre, the Singapore International Monetary Exchange. 'The SFE wants to establish itself as a major commodity exchange in the region,' said Mr Hosking, chief executive of the SFE. 'This is just a beginning.' He said the agreement would not affect a long-term feasibility study his exchange is conducting with the Chicago Board of Trade to share trading in government bond futures.</p>

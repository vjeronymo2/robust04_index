			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / City fears impact on market from selective data release A controversy has broken out in the City over price-sensitive economic statistics amid claims that their selective release is leading to market leaks. The privately compiled figures - the monthly UK purchasing managers' index - are distributed to fee-paying subscribers hours ahead of the general market. Although City analysts protest that the system is adding to market volatility, the Chartered Institute for Purchasing and Supply, which produces the index, rejects the criticisms and insists on its right to release the figures early to its customers. The issue has become more controversial in recent weeks because the survey, which questions almost 300 purchasing managers about business trends, has become increasingly market-sensitive. A leak of the data last month, for example, had a significant impact on bond markets. Yesterday's data also contributed to a small, temporary dip in the gilts market, analysts said, although the impact was quickly reversed. The data showed that purchasing managers had reported substantial price rises in August, fuelling market fears that the rapid pace of economic growth might be creating manufacturing bottlenecks. Mr Michael Waterson, chairman of the NTC research group, which collects the data for the PMI, admitted yesterday that there had been 'one or two mistakes' in the release of the data in the past. However, he pointed out that modifications were introduced into the distribution system yesterday, with institutions that paid the highest Pounds 395 annual subscription fee now receiving the data only four hours ahead of the rest of the market news services. Under the previous system, some analysts had been receiving the data up to two days in advance. 'Nobody has a God-given right to information. We are not trying to blackmail people - we are just asking for a few hundred pounds for a survey that costs several thousands to produce,' Mr Waterson said, adding that the survey was still losing money to produce. Nevertheless, the system continued to provoke criticism in the City yesterday, with some analysts arguing that the delayed release of the index was exaggerating the impact of the data, not least because other main economic indicators are released through the market news services at a set time. Mr Robin Aspinall, economist at brokers Panmure Gordon, said: 'The main value of the index for me is just that people in the markets are talking about it four hours ahead of the release.' Meanwhile, a City fund manager, who previously had been receiving the data early, said: 'Releasing the data early does create problems with inside information - we have not been sure in the past how far we should use it.' Nevertheless, the stock exchange said the issue did not appear to be breaking regulations. Supply bottlenecks, Page 12</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Excerpts] Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic arrived  in our country after the arrival in Tehran of the Bosnian deputy  prime minister. In an interview with correspondents upon  arrival, he said: If a confederation plan for Bosnia and Croatia  fails to succeed, the international community will pay a heavy  price. [passage omitted]    The Islamic Republic of Iran, which recently has hosted  prominent Bosnian and Croatian authorities, not only gives  prominence to mutual economic, communications, and political  ties with Bosnia and Croatia, but also endeavors to play the  role of a mediator to bond the two countries of Bosnia and  Croatia and, through bringing their stances closer together, to  pave the way for the creation of stable and peaceful relations  in the Balkans. [passage omitted]    The role played by Iran, as the closest ally and a supporter  of the oppressed Bosnian nation, in resolving the Balkan crisis  through efforts aimed at establishing a confederation of Bosnia  and Croatia -- a plan that was approved by the Bosnian  parliament three months ago -- has gained further prominence and  is indicative of the realization of Iran's spiritual and  diplomatic influence by its guests from the Balkans. That is  why the Croatian prime minister has called on Iran to stop the  recurrence of clashes, which stem from misunderstanding between  the Croats and the Muslims, and to support the confederation  plan.    Apart from the Bosnian issues, the Croatian prime minister  will also hold talks with our country's officials on relations  between Tehran and Zagreb. Those ties will include trade  exchanges and economic and communications cooperation.  Significant outcome is expected from the talks in that respect.</p>

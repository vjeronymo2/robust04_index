			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marat Zubko: "Norwegians Remove Rubles From </F> Circulation"]    [Text] Helsinki -- A large consignment of new coins  totaling 22 million rubles [R] is on its way from the Svalbard  Islands in the Arctic Ocean to Russia to be melted down! This  money was minted on the islands specially for the Russian  citizens working there.    Norwegian sovereignty over the archipelago was established  under the Svalbard Treaty (still known as the Paris treaty) of  1920, but all the countries which signed it, and they now number  40, received the right to conduct their own economic activity  there. Representatives of a number of Russian organizations work  on the islands, the largest of which is reckoned to be the  Arktikugol Trust.    Some time ago the Arktikugol Trust, whose head office is in  Moscow, introduced its own coins into circulation in  denominations of R10, R25, R50, and R100 at the Barentsburg and  Pyramiden mines on Svalbard. But the Norwegian authorities  reacted extremely negatively to this move.    Since the words "Russian Federation" were stamped on the  coins, Odd Blomdal, the Norwegian governor of the islands,  thought that Moscow was thereby encroaching on Norwegian  sovereignty over Svalbard. Representatives of the Russian  embassy in Oslo were summoned to the Norwegian Foreign Ministry,  where they heard an expression of dissatisfaction at the  Arktikugol Trust's action. After that, as I was told at the  embassy, the money was taken out of circulation at Barentsburg  and Pyramiden.    I phoned Barentsburg on Svalbard, where I spoke to Aleksandr  Sokolov, director of the Arktikugol mine, and asked him to  explain the reason for the introduction of the new coins.    "Inflation, of course," he replied. "Whereas before our  local internal commodity turnover amounted to R400,000 a  quarter, now it is running at 20 million a month."    [Zubko] What currency was in circulation at the mines  before?    [Sokolov] We had tokens in denominations from R1 to R25 and  our own coins minted in the fifties. Incidentally, this is a  real find for numismatists.    [Zubko] How are you getting by now, bearing in mind that the  old money supply is inadequate and you are withdrawing the new  one?    [Sokolov] We were in a difficult position. Commodity  exchange and all workers' and employees' purchases have to be  made on order forms to the official departments, which tripled  the chore! But we are collecting up the coins and will send  them to Moscow, where they will decide what to do with them....</p>

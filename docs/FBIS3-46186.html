			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Liu </F> Zhenying (0491 2182 5391) and XINHUA reporter He Ping (0149  1627)]    [Text] Beijing, 26 Jan (XINHUA) -- Addressing a national  conference on propaganda and ideological work today, Li Peng,  member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee  Political Bureau and Premier of the State Council, pointed out:  The development of the domestic and international situation has  created very good conditions for strengthening our propaganda  and ideological work, and has set still higher requirements on  it. Proceeding from the overall interest of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics, party committees and governments  at all levels should strengthen their leadership over propaganda  and ideological work to promote the prosperity and development  of propaganda and cultural work.    Comrade Li Peng's speech consists of four parts: 1) The  international situation and the conduct of China's foreign  affairs; 2) China's economic growth; 3) the reform of the  country's economic structures; and 4) the hopes for propaganda  and ideological work.    In his speech Li Peng said: The important speech made by  Comrade Jiang Zemin at the beginning of the meeting profoundly  expounded the status and role of our propaganda and ideological  work in the new period, and explicitly defined the fundamental  policy and major tasks for this work. All departments on the  propaganda and ideological front should conscientiously carry  out the guidelines of Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech in order to  do their work more efficiently.    Concerning the international situation and the conduct of  China's foreign affairs, Li Peng pointed out: The current  international situation is complex and still undergoing a  profound change. The trend toward multipolarization of the  world pattern is developing at rapid pace. Economic  invigoration has become the universal desire of the world's  nations, and economic priorities are becoming a major factor  affecting the development of international relations. In many  regional hot spots conflicts have been resolved or reduced. This  is the positive side of the development of the international  situation. However, we should also be aware that hegemony and  power politics still exist, that in some regions armed conflicts  and turbulence are still continuing, unpredictable factors are  increasing instead of decreasing, the economic gap between North  and South is widening, and many developing countries are facing  more difficulties. All this shows there is still no peace in  the world. In short, the two major problems of peace and  development have not been resolved. Li Peng said: Compared  with other regions of the world, the Asian region, particularly  the east Asian region, is relatively stable politically. In  particular, there is sustained economic growth, a rapid  development in trade and investment, and a strong momentum in  regional cooperation in these regions.    Li Peng pointed out: By pursuing an independent foreign  policy of peace, our country has made major progress in  relations with other countries. The official meeting between  President Jiang Zemin and President Clinton last November was  not only conducive to the improvement and development of  Sino-U.S. relations but has also had a positive impact on the  situation in the Asia-Pacific region and in the world as a  whole. We are in favor of striving to move, as soon as  possible, Sino-U.S. relations onto the track of normal  development in the spirit of "increasing trust, reducing  trouble, strengthening cooperation, and refraining from  confrontation." He said: On the whole, there has been an  improvement and development in our country's relations with  Western Europe. The visit to China by German Chancellor Kohl  indicates that Sino-German relations have entered a new  development stage. The upcoming visit to our country by French  Prime Minister Balladur indicates the normalization of  Sino-French relations. Because China pursues a policy of good-  neighborliness and friendship, its surrounding environment has  witnessed one of the best periods since its founding. Our  friendly relations and cooperation with the developing countries  have been further strengthened.    Li Peng pointed out: This year there will be new changew and  adjustments in international relations. The international  situation as a whole will still be favorable to our country. In  the new year, we should continue to pursue an independent  foreign policy of peace, refrain from drawing a line of  demarcation on the basis of difference or sameness in social  systems and ideology, and develop friendly relations and  cooperation with all countries on the basis of the five  principles of peaceful coexistence, so as to create a favorable  external environment for our country's modernization drive.    On economic development, Li Peng said: Our country is in a  period of development rarely seen in history. Comrade Xiaoping  pointed out: "The key to seizing Opportunities to develop  ourselves lies in developing the economy." Because the current  international environment is quite favorable and domestic  conditions are right, it is entirely possible for us to strive  to achieve sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the  national economy for a fairly long time to come. He pointed  out: Reform and opening up have installed great vitality into  economic development. Actively advancing reform aimed at  establishing a socialist market economic structure in accordance  with the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee will  provide an institutional guarantee of economic development.  Moreover, our country's political stability, national unity, and  social progress have also created social and political  conditions that are conducive to sustained, rapid, and healthy  economic development.    Li Peng said: In arranging economic work, we should consider  the overall situation, correctly analyze and follow the  situation, recognize favorable conditions while paying attention  to unfavorable factors, actively pursue development according to  our abilities, and make every effort to maintain an active but  safe development speed. He pointed out: Improving economic  efficiency and achieving the unity of speed and efficiency are  our country's important principle of economic development. To  raise efficiency, we should work hard in various fields, such as  optimizing the economic structure, promoting technological  progress, and improving operations and management. In actively  promoting the change of operating mechanisms in enterprises, all  types of enterprises should conscientiously strengthen  operations and management, tighten internal discipline, and view  these two tasks as long-term, basic work and carry them out in  real earnest.    Li Peng pointed out: The principles for this year's economic  work are: To fully implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC  National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee, take an important step in reform toward  establishing a socialist market economic structure, open wider  to the outside world, tighten and improve macroeconomic  regulation and control, vigorously readjust the economic  structure, promote technological progress, improve economic  efficiency, and maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy  development of the national economy. We should stress work in  three areas -- comprehensively developing the rural economy,  efficiently running state-owned large and medium enterprises,  and tightening and improving macroeconomic regulation and  control.    On reform of the economic structure, Li Peng said: The main  aspects of this year's reform of the economic structure can be  summarized in three areas: 1) We should make organizational  efforts to introduce and implement various major reform measures  to establish a sound macroeconomic regulatory and control  system, placing emphasis on reform of the financial, taxation,  and banking systems. 2) We should advance price reform actively  but steadily. We should assume a very prudent attitude and fully  consider the extent to which the state, enterprises, and people  can afford, in order to maintain social stability. 3)  Establishing a modern enterprise system suited to socialist  market economic development is the direction in which reform of  our country's state-owned enterprises should proceed.  Enterprise reform should be conducive to enhancing the vitality  of state-owned enterprises, preserving and increasing the value  of state-owned assets, and maintaining social stability.    Li Peng said: This year's reform and development tasks are  quite heavy. We should correctly handle the relationship  between reform, development, and stability. Economic  development is the focus of all our work, reform is a powerful  motive force behind social and economic development, and  stability is an indispensable condition for reform and  development. We should actively advance reform while adopting a  prudent approach. We should seize Opportunities to achieve  substantial progress in important areas, promote overall reform  on that basis, and integrate all aspects of reform into a whole.    Speaking of propaganda and ideological work, Li Peng said:  Propaganda and ideological work is our party's political  advantage. The progress of revolution and construction is  inseparable from the support and guarantee of propaganda and  ideological work. The propaganda and ideological front has  played an important role in reform, opening up, and  modernization over the past 15 years. The propaganda and  ideological front has earnestly implemented the guidelines of  the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of  the 14th CPC Central Committee, publicized Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, and done a great deal of work in encouraging  the entire party and people across the country to study Volume 3  of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping"; in carrying out  education on patriotism, collectivism, and socialism; in  publicizing and reporting on reform, opening up, and economic  construction; in intensifying external propaganda work; and in  enriching people's cultural lives. All in all, the guiding  thought for propaganda and ideological work is clear, and public  opinion is being properly guided.    Li Peng expressed the hope that comrades on the propaganda  and ideological front would continue to provide proper guidance  over public opinion and better serve reform, opening up, and  modernization. We should make every effort to ensure that our  propaganda and reporting are complete, objective and accurate;  we should guard against one-sidedness. In carrying out  propaganda and ideological work, we must proceed from the  fundamental interests of the party and state, and  conscientiously remain at one with the party Central Committee  politically. He said: All departments engaged in propaganda  and ideological work should persistently emancipate their minds  and seek truth from facts, earnestly sum up their experiences in  light of their own characteristics, carry out work creatively,  and actively explore new methods for carrying out propaganda and  ideological work under socialist market economic conditions. We  should assiduously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics, study the party  and state's principles and policies, acquire socialist market  economic know-how, and gain and master professional knowledge  pertaining to our specialized fields. We should not only  acquire book knowledge but should also learn in practice, from  the masses, and from society.    Li Peng pointed out: In recent years, our country's external  propaganda departments have done a great deal of work and  achieved some results. To open wider to the outside world, we  should better carry out external propaganda work so that the  rest of the world will understand China.    Li Peng said: Government departments at all levels should  attach importance and lend support to propaganda and ideological  work, provide cadres engaged in such work with the necessary  working conditions, and actively help them solve practical  problems. We should be willing to spend some money in this  respect and choose to economize in other areas, so that the  conditions on the propaganda front will improve gradually and  our propaganda work will become more fruitful. He emphasized:  As propaganda and ideological work goes, we shoulder a glorious  mission and heavy responsibilities for the socialist  modernization drive. I believe that this conference will surely  create a new situation in propaganda and ideological work.    Leading comrades Zhu Rongji, Ding Guangen, Li Lanqing, Li  Tieying, Qian Qichen, Wei Jianxing, Wen Jiabao, and Ren Jianxin  attended the conference, which was chaired by Ding Guangen.</p>

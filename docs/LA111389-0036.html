			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> EUROPEAN COMMUNITY SUMMIT IS PROPOSED  </P> <P> Former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing called Sunday for an extraordinary  European Community summit so that Europeans can assess events in East Germany  before they are discussed at next month's U.S.-Soviet summit.  </P> <P> "It is unacceptable that the first analysis of events be a matter for the  Americans and Soviets and not Europeans," Giscard d'Estaing said.  </P> <P> He urged President Francois Mitterrand to convoke such a summit "rapidly" so  that its conclusions could be conveyed to President Bush and Soviet President  Mikhail S. Gorbachev when they meet in the Mediterranean next month.  </P></p>

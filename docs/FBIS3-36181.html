If peace is to be maintained, all countries must equally be  involved, he told Interfax on Wednesday [2 February].    "Although it is a good document politically, said Grachev,  the Defence Ministry's response to NATO's new plan is rather  cautious."    Grachev is concerned at the fact that all former Warsaw Pact  nations and the Baltic states were seeing the plan as an  intermediary stage towards full NATO membership.    "If the Partnership for Peace plan will gradually drag those  states into the North Atlantic Alliance without consent or  consultations with Russia, we will not support it," he said.    In the minister's view, NATO's enlargement poses a certain  threat to Russian security.    Grachev says the PP [Partnership for Peace] plan provides  for  coordinated effort by NATO and other countries, Russia included,  over "an interim period following the break up of the Warsaw  Pact." Until European political structures emerge, all states  must cooperate to defuse tensions in the continent, particularly  in the former Yugoslavia, he said.</p>

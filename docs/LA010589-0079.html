			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: COUNTY;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT PLAN OPPOSED  </P> <P> The County Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to strongly oppose a pending Los  Angeles development plan that would block the use of three Westside canyons as  a regional landfill.  </P> <P> The board, on a 3-1 vote, directed its staff to argue at City Council hearings  against a provision in the proposed Mulholland Scenic Parkway Specific Plan  that prohibits development of Mission, Rustic and Sullivan canyons for garbage  disposal.  </P> <P> The directive appears contrary to positions taken last May by three of the five  supervisors -- Deane Dana, Mike Antonovich and Ed Edelman. They either opposed  a landfill in the canyons or said they would consider it only as a last resort  to solve long-range garbage disposal problems.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Edelman cast the dissenting vote, saying that Los Angeles, which  would have to approve the landfill, has consistently opposed it. "To ask the  city to permit a landfill there . . . seems a waste of time," he said.  </P> <P> Dana would say only that his opposition to the landfill has not changed, but  that his vote figures into behind-the-scenes negotiations between the county  and the city over where new landfills will be placed.  </P> <P> Sources close to the negotiations said the supervisors want to keep the  possibility of using the canyons as a landfill alive as a bargaining chip with  the city.  </P> <P> The canyon area is one of six locations that sanitation experts say are  technically best suited to be garbage dumps. Four of the others are on the  northern rim of the San Fernando Valley or near Santa Clarita. The fifth is in  Griffith Park.  </P></p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Water pollution reports double REPORTS OF water pollution in England and Wales more than doubled in the 1980s, according to the National Rivers Authority. Statistics issued by the authority yesterday showed that there were 28,143 reports in 1990, up from 12,600 in 1981. The biggest increase was in the Northumbria region, where reports rose 57 per cent between 1988 and 1990. The authority cautioned that the lack of early data made it difficult to trends hard to assess trends, but it said that there was no question that the number of reports had risen. The largest category of reports concerned oil and sewage spills, with each accounting for just over 20 per cent. The authority pointed out that only a very small proportion of the reported incidents - 658 in 1990 - could be classed as 'major', involving extensive fish deaths or the temporary closure of a public water intake.</p>

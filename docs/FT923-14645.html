			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / International Company News: Nachi-Fujikoshi reverses forecast to Y2bn loss NACHI-FUJIKOSHI, a leading Japanese maker of bearings and cutting tools, yesterday forecast a pre-tax loss of Y2bn (Dollars 16m) for the year ended November 1992, reversing a previously forecast profit of Y2bn because of slower demand from the car industry and losses on securities holdings. The company has revised its sales forecast from Y160bn to Y141bn, against Y167bn last year, and expects that sales for the first half to the end of May will total Y71.2bn, compared with Y84.3bn for the same period last year. Like most other Japanese suppliers of machine tools and components, Nachi-Fujikoshi has been under pressure from the deeper-than-expected downturn and the slower-than-expected recovery in sectors such as the car industry. But, as with many other companies, Nachi-Fujikoshi has been unable to turn to the stock market for help, as it has in the past. Instead of cashing in unrealised gains on its stock holdings, Nachi is expected to report an appraisal loss of Y5.7bn for the first half. The loss on stock holdings is cited as the main cause of a Y6.5bn after-tax loss forecast for the six months, though the company hopes that it will break even over the year. However, Nachi-Fujikoshi indicated that the second-half improvement would come from the sale of securities and land holdings, which presumes a recovery in the weak stock and property markets.</p>

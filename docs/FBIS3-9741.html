"Our alliance with Solidarity is a fact, and there are no  conflicts between us on the economy," said Parys explaining that  both Solidarity and the centre-right wanted a sound economy,  honest privatisation and protection for the Polish consumer.    The conference met under the slogan "The Economy and  Society."    The "Secretariat of Centre-right Groupings" (SUC) was formed  on October 14 last year. It includes the Centre Alliance (PC),  the Polish Peasant Party Peasant Agreement (PSL-PL) the Movement  for the Republic of Poland (RDR) and the RTR. It has received  support from the Christian National Union (ZCHN), the Real  Politics Union (UPR) and Solidarity. The SUC is headed by  PSL-PL leader Gabriel Janowski.</p>

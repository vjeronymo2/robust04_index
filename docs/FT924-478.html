			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar's mini-rally continues THE DOLLAR continued its small pre-Christmas rally against the D-Mark yesterday, rising above the DM1.59 level but failing to break through to DM1.60, writes James Blitz. Once again, foreign exchange trading was extremely thin in the run-up to Christmas, and exchange rates were affected by the tiniest of flows. Market sentiment continued to be dominated by Tuesday's comments from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, that German inflation would be at 3 per cent by the end of next year. The boost that this gave to the dollar on Tuesday was compounded yesterday by data showing a 0.2 percentage-point rise in US personal income in November, and a 0.5 percentage-point increase in spending in the same month. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, said both data indicated that the US economic upturn, when it comes, will be consumer-led. The dollar closed in London at DM1.5945, up 80 pfennigs on the day. It finished New York trading at DM1.5952. The D-Mark had a weaker tone against the French franc, but closed unchanged at FFr3.411. Investors continue to think that the pressure on the French currency will return in the new year. Sterling was unable to profit from the easier tone to trading, partly due to the latest UK savings ratio figure. This rose to 12.3 per cent in the third quarter of 1992, against a revised 11.4 per cent in the second quarter, suggesting that consumer spending was likely to remain limited, and that the government might need to stimulate the economy further through more rate cuts. The pound slipped  3/4 pfennig to finish at DM2.4350. It was 1 1/4 cents weaker in terms of the dollar at Dollars 1.5265, also the closing rate in New York. Movements in most currencies in the new year will depend on whether the Bundesbank eases policy. Mr MacKinnon of Citibank believes the pressures on the German central bank will soon be overwhelming. German GDP, in his view, is set to fall next year by as much as 1 per cent, threatening the German economy with depression. Miss Alison Cottrell, an economist at Midland Global Markets in London, agrees. In her view, this week's lower figure for German M3 money growth, which showed an annualised 9.3 per cent rise in the year to November, is an over-estimate of the real figure. She believes that the amount of money in circulation in November will have been boosted by the heavy liquidation of German assets into cash to avoid a heavy tax on interest-bearing deposits due to be introduced next month.</p>

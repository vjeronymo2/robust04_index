			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Small Business Burden <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The collection of information by the Section 3 Reporting Form involves recipients, contractors, and subcontractors receiving Federal financial assistance for housing and community development programs covered by Section 3. To minimize the burden, the Department has attempted to provide clear guidance on the required information collection. This guidance will prevent the recipient from collecting and submitting unnecessary or duplicative information. The Section 3 regulations apply to any Public and Indian Housing programs that receive: (1) Development assistance pursuant to Section 5 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937; (2) operating assistance pursuant to Section 9 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937; or (3) modernization grants pursuant to Section 14 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937. The regulations also apply to other housing and community development assistance expended for: (1) housing rehabilitation (including reduction and abatement of lead-based paint hazards); (2) housing construction; (3) other public construction projects; and (4) housing and community development assistance for which the HUD share of the project cost (as defined in &sect;135.5) for such activity exceeds $100,000, or the amount of any subcontract awarded in connection with the covered activity exceeds $50,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recipients and contractors subject to Section 3 requirements must maintain appropriate documentation to establish that, at a minimum, a good faith effort was made to provide economic opportunities resulting from financial assistance for housing and community development programs to low- and very low-income residents. Each recipient who receives Section 3 covered assistance from HUD shall submit to the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity an annual report in such form and with such information as the Assistant Secretary may request, for the purpose of determining the results of Section 3 activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These results are used to assess the impact of the law, to target monitoring and compliance reviews, and to prepare reports to Congress. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A Section 3 complaint may be filed by an individual representing the interests of a small business. The information required on the Section 3 Complaint Form, is the same type of information voluntarily provided by a person representing an individual. Complainants are individuals or businesses who chose to submit this form to HUD, and by electing to do so, are required to only submit it once. No reporting of any kind is required, nor are respondents remunerated by HUD for this effort. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Reporting Cycle <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Section 3 Reporting Form information will be collected annually. The report may be submitted on the same cycle as the performance report required by the program under which Section 3 covered assistance is provided. Where a performance report is not required, the Section 3 report is due to the local HUD (Category A) Office within ten (10) days after the end of the reporting period indicated in Block 8 of form HUD&hyph;60002 or at the completion of the project if sooner. Also, an annual reporting cycle will assist HUD in meeting its reporting requirements under Section 808(e)(6) of the Fair Housing Act, Section 561 of the HCDA of 1987 and Section 916 of the HCDA of 1992. This report also will assist the Department in evaluating and managing program performance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Section 3 Complaint Form mandates no specific requirements with respect to the frequency of collection of information. The Section 3 Compliant Form is made available to the public for use by individuals or businesses who wish to file a Section 3 compliant with HUD. Complaints are individuals who chose to submit this form to HUD, and by electing to do so, are required to only submit it once. No remunerated by HUD for this effort. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Consistency With 5 CFR 1320.6 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Use of the Section 3 Reporting Form is consistent with 24 CFR part 1320.6. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Use of the Section 3 Complaint Form is consistent with 24 CFR part 1320.6. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Outside Consultation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to statutory requirements, staff from the Departments of Labor and Commerce, and the Small Business Administration have been contacted regarding the Section 3 Reporting Form. The attached Section 3 Reporting Form_Economic Opportunities for Low- and Very Low-Income Persons, Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, has been developed by the Section 3 Compliance Division for collecting Section 3 data. Form HUD&hyph;2516 is modified to collect Section 3 contracting data from public and Indian housing programs and all community development programs except those administered by States. Form HUD&hyph;60002 is designed to collect Section 3 contracting data from all other Section 3 covered programs and to collect training and employment data on all Section 3 covered programs. These data collection forms are the only instruments that collect Section 3 employment, training and contracting information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No one was consulted outside the Department with respect to the Section 3 Complaint Form. The instructions are specific, and the information provided by the complainant is unique on each form. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> 10. Confidentiality <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> An assurance of confidentiality is not applicable to the Section 3 Reporting Form. The form will be filed with HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. The Privacy Act of 1974 and OMB Circular A&hyph;108 are not applicable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All information collected by the Section 3 Complaint Form complies with the Privacy Act of 1974 and OMB Circular A&hyph;108, ``Responsibilities for Maintenance of Records About Individuals by Federal Agencies''. Each respondent is apprised of the filing of a Section 3 Complaint against them. However, information obtained during the investigation is held in confidence and may not be divulged while the investigation is in progress. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> 11. Sensitive Questions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Section 3 Reporting Form reporting requirements do not contain sensitive questions. The information requested deals with the results of the recipient's good faith efforts to provide opportunities for lower income residents to receive job training and employment and for local businesses to receive contracts in connection with HUD assisted programs. Data is cumulative and personal identifying information is not included. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Section 3 Complaint Form does not request information of a sensitive nature such as sexual behavior and attitudes, religious beliefs and other matters that are commonly considered private. Section 3 is racially neutral and as such the complaint form does not request information regarding the complainants' race, color, sex, or national origin because these areas are not protected classes or issues which determine beneficiaries of Section 3. The information provided on this complaint form is given voluntarily and provides the basis for HUD's investigation of the complaint to determine if the allegations of noncompliance are valid. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

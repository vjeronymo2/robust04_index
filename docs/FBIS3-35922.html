			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Presenter Nato Oniani] Good morning, friends.  As always on Monday, we present to you a traditional radio  interview with Eduard Shevardnadze, chairman of parliament and  head of state.    Batono Eduard, in connection with President Yeltsin's visit  [to Georgia on 3 and 4 February], you said the following: This  is the most important event in the hundreds of years of history  of relations between Russia and Georgia. Before, Russia's  Soviet leaders would be visiting a periphery, while today the  leader of one of the world's greatest countries is coming to an  independent country. The president of a friendly neighboring  country is visiting us as equal partners. What are the grounds  for such a statement? Is it a Russian foreign policy as regards  Georgia? Is it that the world is different today? Or is it  Georgia's status, the fact that Georgia is, at least de jure, an  independent state?    [Shevardnadze] Thank you. Good morning. The grounds for  what I stated are in the law which has not yet been passed, but  which will become the rule of life on our planet at the end of  the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st. What is  unacceptable for and incompatible with the new rules of  cohabitation, the new principles -- I mean former Yugoslavia,  the former Soviet Union, including Abkhazia, Samachablo [South  Ossetia], and some others...[pauses] In my opinion this is an  anomaly, a vestige of the old reactionary and obsolete thinking  and practice.    The epoch of violence, the epoch of the rule of arms as they  say, must end, and I am sure it will end. The next century must  be a century of universal ideals taking root. The foundation of  this is now being laid. We can see and feel that that time is  coming. However, these new relations have to be built. The new  century, the new order, this new construction consists of bricks  and [word indistinct]. One of such bricks is the new relations  between Russia and Georgia. These new relations should heal our  sores, be it Abkhazia, the Georgian-Ossetian conflict, economic  hardship, or something else which accompanies the birth of an  independent country. The birth process is painful by itself. I  am sure that these pains will go away and a new time will come.    Speaking in general and without going into detail, this is  how I see relations between Russia and Georgia and their  prospects. These are my hopes.    One more thing. I think that such an approach to these  problems and issues -- the building of relations among the  countries of the former Soviet Union on the model of relations  between Russia and Georgia, and enshrined in the documents we  are now preparing -- is in Russia's interests. Not only  Georgia's own interests are involved in this but also Russia's  interests. One can talk about Russia's new role at this complex  and tense time on our planet.    [Oniani] Such relations must develop between Georgia and  Russia. However, the most important subject of discussion at  present, during these talks, will be the problem of Abkhazia. I  will remind the listeners about something you said last week.  Georgia has a lot to say [at the Russo-Georgian summit]. We  need a lot which cannot be solved without Russia. First of all,  this relates to Abkhazia.    On 10 February the Georgian refugees are to return,  initially  to Gali rayon. Who can give guarantees to the population of  Abkhazia, the refugees, especially in the light of recent events  in the Kodori gorge?    [Shevardnadze] Speaking about the old Soviet space, in  relation to Georgia in particular, we must pay attention to the  fact that a new model for settling conflicts is emerging -- a UN  effort combined with a Russian peace mission. I do not want to  explain this in detail because everybody can see what we are  dealing with. Such an approach will be important for the modern  world, for Georgia and maybe for other countries as well.    The UN potential is limited at present. Everybody can see  this. My experience tells me that the UN is simply unable to  cope with all conflicts. Realistically speaking, I think that  in the example of our conflict the UN can act as a facilitator  in settling the conflict. It can deal with issues relating to  the creation of a legal foundation.    [Oniani] So, in general, it could be a mediator but not a  doer.    [Shevardnadze] Becoming a doer is a difficult process. Today  a UN Security Council meeting is to be held. I know  approximately what kind of resolution the Security Council will  adopt. This again will not be a direct participation in  settling and solving the conflict. Therefore, I think that  combining the UN potential and Russia's new role and approach --  a model which is to be tested on our example -- is rather  promising. I attach a certain degree of hope and optimism to  that.    As for the return from 10 February, it is difficult to talk  about it now because, speaking of real guarantees, the results  of the talks between Russia and Georgia should produce such  guarantees. That is because, physically and practically, UN  forces will not have time to enter the area [before the 10  February deadline].    I understand people who feel that we should start to return  [to Abkhazia] from 10 February. I think it is right to look at  the issue this way.    [Oniani] Your statements regarding new relations between  Russia and Georgia must have irritated the Abkhazian side. I  remind you of their recent statements. They gave a negative  assessment of Russia's role. The Abkhazian authorities are  irritated by new Georgian-Russian relations; for example,  Yeltsin's visit to Georgia. In their opinion, Russia is biased  in our favor in its involvement in Abkhazia. Are there any  grounds to justify this? Can one say that this is a result of  steps taken by Georgian diplomacy?    [Shevardnadze] I do not think that we can speak now about  our  successful steps. You know that a lot has irritated us in this  conflict. A lot has been said. However, irritation is a bad  symptom when one speaks about high-level politics, big national  interests, be it Abkhazian, Georgian, or Russian interests.  Therefore, we must all reconcile ourselves to the fact that  there are certain principles which should be obeyed by all  nations, large and small.    [Oniani] Batono Eduard, last week you met representatives  of law enforcement bodies. Among other things, the meeting  heard that it is necessary to finally establish and make public  who is behind the gangs which have been arrested. It was also  said at the meeting that the state apparatus would be examined  for drug addiction. You said that you could be the first to  take a blood test. There is talk that many persons were  arrested but later released, and that these measures stop at a  certain level.    [Shevardnadze] I was more specific in my address which was  broadcast. Now I would put it this way. Every week and day of  our life has its own features. Last week we summed up the  results of the state of emergency, discussing what the state of  emergency gives us in practice. I would say that despite  everyday difficulties the results are impressive. I will list  some results. The situation in the west [of Georgia] has  improved. There are no words to describe this. Perhaps it can  be said that we extinguished an incipient inferno of civil war.  Work at the Security and Interior Ministries has changed. In  practice, one can talk about a completely new approach toward  work at these power ministries. Their improved style of work is  aimed at meeting current demands. A campaign against the  criminal world and the mafiosi has been launched. A tax system  has been created. There is also much more which was mentioned  at the meeting.    When I said that the whole truth must be said and a spade  must be called a spade, I meant that unless this happened, the  process of establishing order would be painful and long. This  must happen by all means. I am not in favor of punishing  everyone and sending everyone to prison.    [Oniani] Assessments must be made.    [Shevardnadze] Assessments must be made and people should  know the truth about everyone. [Words indistinct] That I will  be the first to take a blood test. I meant that drug addiction  is a scourge of modern times, which threatens the country and  future generation with an explosion. An anti-drug campaign  should be initiated by the state. People who do not have the  moral right to do it should not lead a struggle against drug  addiction. Therefore, state organizations and power ministries,  such as the Interior, Defense, Security Ministries, and so on,  must be purged of such elements. When I say purged, I do not  mean that these people should be cast out on to the street.  Some of them should be treated, while others should be given  assistance as soon as possible. However, such cleansing is  certainly necessary.    I do know about the legal aspects of such a matter. Some  people may regard the blood test as a human rights violation.  Some people may be unwilling to take a test. That is why I  decided -- I think no one has any doubt that I am not afraid of  taking a blood test [Shevardnadze laughs] -- that this process  should start with me and the head of state's office. My office  will be told about it today and I think that this work will be  completed today or tomorrow.    [Oniani] You mentioned your meeting with law enforcement  bodies. It is common knowledge that good order and economic  performance are interlinked. As soon as there are even small  signs of stabilization, the country will be able to breathe more  easily. However, the inflation of the coupon is continuing at a  terrible pace. At a parliament meeting, the prime minister  requested 10 days for a program aimed at strengthening the  coupon.    Two options are suggested. The first one is to leave the  coupon as a sole legal form of tender. The second option is to  introduce an alternative currency. What do you think will save  the Georgian coupon today? To what extent will the coupon be  supported with the notorious 200 million [currency not  specified], which, in the former premier's opinion -- I am sorry  to say this -- you have concealed?    [Shevardnadze] We are dealing with the most serious question  here. I would like again to remind our listeners, our citizens,  that when, at the Cabinet of Minister's proposal, a decision was  made to introduce the coupon, I immediately said that the coupon  would lose its value. Nothing else could have happened.  Perhaps this process was speeded up by a bad credit policy or  some other subjective factors, but sooner or later this process  would have started anyway. Those who consider the coupon issue  separately from economic matters are wrong and are not familiar  with the subject.    There are also suggestions that it is time to think about  the  lari, and that perhaps the lari can help us. Neither the lari  nor any other new currency will save the country unless the  economy starts to improve.    This is one of the reasons why I think that President  Yeltsin's visit, during which many economic treaties are to be  signed, will be an historic event. In addition to what has  already been done to strengthen our economic ties, this will be  one of the ways to adopt [word indistinct] as soon as possible.  If ties are quickly restored and if new ties are established,  the economy will be revitalized, which will allow the coupon to  become stronger and will allow us to think about a new currency,  the lari.    The second option is to obtain large credits. If we receive  say, 200 million or 300 million [currency not specified] --  which to be honest is not much -- it will still not be enough to  revitalize the economy and strengthen the coupon, for which at  least $1 billion is needed. However, even $100 million or $200  million could help us to a certain extent.    I have not taken the allegations [by Sigua] seriously. Some  materials have already been published in the SAKARTVELOS  RESPUBLIKA. I want to say now with total honesty that the public  should know everything. What are we dealing with? It was a  very important letter from the International Monetary Fund  which, although it did not contain assurances, gave Georgia  prospects for receiving a certain amount of credit and economic  assistance. This letter was concealed. It was concealed from  us. How did a copy of it end up with Prime Minister Tengiz  Sigua? The original is said to have been lost. Meanwhile, he  kept a copy of it at home. He was prime minister twice. Would  he keep copies of all documents at home? I believe that our  citizens should think about it.    There was another letter. The first letter has been  published in the press and I demand that the second letter be  published as well -- the one which I (?referred) to Roman  Gotsiridze [former Georgian deputy premier in charge of economic  reform], asking him to study it urgently and to put forward his  proposals. He has left the Cabinet and [words indistinct].    [Oniani] Excuse me, Batono Eduard, let me ask you to return  to the notorious letter which Tengiz Sigua spoke about. Did he  ever tell you that this letter existed, and was he ever  interested in hearing your opinion about it. Has there ever  been any conversation between you two about it?    [Shevardnadze] My morals do not allow me respond to an  allegation with a counter-allegation. However, let us take into  account my correspondence with and my requests to the IMF  regarding credits. How did we get the 70 million ECU [European  Currency Unit] credit from the European Community? How many  personal requests and appeals have I made? These include my  letters to the G-7 which, I would say, man would not be able to  read without tears in the eyes, and which were full of pleas for  help; my visit to Germany, as a result of which we received 30  million German marks [DM] as an interest-free long-term credit  and DM20 million in humanitarian assistance; my requests to the  Turkish leadership, which gave us 50 million dollars [not  further specified] in credit, and much more. Could a man who  has travelled the world begging for a few pennies in credit have  left such a promising (?letter) unnoticed?    I think that it is very good that the press has reacted to  this, but there is still more to be established. The letter  should be published. I wonder why Mr. Gotsiridze did not act  [words indistinct].    I am not saying this in order to settle scores [words  indistinct] but to explain that if we are able to get more  loans, credits, and assistance, then the coupon may become  stronger more quickly. If there is no assistance -- I will be  able to speak about it in more detail after my visit to  Washington, during which I will meet the Monetary Fund and  others -- then it will be a more painful process which will  solely be linked with revitilizing and improving the economy.    [Oniani] Batono Eduard, last week saw the creation of a  youth  organization within the Citizens' Union of Georgia. What is the  significance of this event? Has the Citizens' Union split up?    [Shevardnadze] No, it has not. [passage omitted] Why should  the creation of a youth organization within the Citizens' Union  surprise anybody? I know that some people say that the  Citizens' Union has created a version of the Komsomol, [word  indistinct] organization, and so on. They do not know the  history of international movements.

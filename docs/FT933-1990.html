			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / International Company News: Auditors to settle NZ case PARTNERS in Ernst and Young, the international auditors, have agreed to pay NZDollars 37.5m (USDollars 20.7m) to settle a long standing case brought by investors in Registered Securities which went bankrupt in 1988, writes Terry Hall in Wellington. The settlement means that more than 6,000 investors will receive an extra 30 cents in the dollar payment. This will give them around 80 cents for each dollar they had invested. Registered Securities went out of business owing NZDollars 97.8m. The auditors reported in April 1988, only three months before the collapse, that the company's accounts had been properly maintained and were in order. A case against the auditing firm was due to begin next week, seeking NZDollars 140m in damages. Mr Richard Waddel, spokesman for Ernst and Young, said his firm did not accept liability.</p>

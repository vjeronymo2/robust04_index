			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR MORTGAGE;  </P> <P> FIGURING OUT MATH OF ACCELERATED PAYMENTS  </P> <P> QUESTION: In a recent column about accelerating principal payments on a  mortgage for five years, you made much of the fact that, after that time, the  family that had accelerated walked off with far more equity than did the other  family that didn't accelerate.  </P> <P> What you didn't mention, though, was that the seller who did not accelerate  had, during the five years mentioned, the use of the money, and assuming it was  invested where the money earning a rate of interest equal to the interest rate  on the mortgage, in this case 10%, he would come out exactly the same.  </P> <P> While his equity in the home would be less, he would have an equal amount of  equity somewhere else and, in addition, he would have liquidity, which the  first party would not have. You also failed to indicate that while interest  payments would be lower, so would the tax deductions.  </P> <P> ANSWER: Ah, yes, here we go again on the old high-leverage/low-leverage  merry-go-round.  </P> <P> Should we pay as little in down payment on a house as possible and keep the  monthly payments to a minimum, or should we make a large down payment and  accelerate principal payments as much as possible to build up a large equity  and sharply reduce the interest being paid the lender?  </P> <P> And the argument against acceleration is that the money not used for this  acceleration can be invested more profitably in something that more than  offsets the savings in interest.  </P> <P> It always makes for a lively debate, and while I have always been pretty noisy  in advocating fast acceleration it's also true that I'm not enough of a  computer whiz to prove my contention in hard figures.  </P> <P> Quite recently, however, an ally has appeared in the form of Colorado-based  management consultant, M. Joseph Lockerd who has a fascinating book in the  works entitled: "The Myth of the Mortgage Tax Advantage: Spending a Dollar to  Save a Dime."  </P> <P> Lockerd has run the invest-versus-acceleration question off in virtually every  conceivable way on his computer. The conclusion: Except in a handful of  freakish situations, mortgage-principal acceleration is a far better investment  than anything else available to the layman. The intervening lack of liquidity  notwithstanding.  </P> <P> It's a study that takes clearly into account both the reduction in  mortgage-interest deductibility that one incurs in accelerating a payoff, but  also the tax consequences of those investments that are made with the money  that would otherwise go into acceleration.  </P> <P> One frequently overlooked point: By accelerating the payoff of a 30-year  mortgage down to 10 or 15 years, the homeowner has a mortgage-free 15 or 20  years ahead of him in which to further compound his investment program. To an  extent that that his invest-in-something-else counterpart -- still burdened  with his monthly mortgage payments -- can't begin to approach.  </P> <P> Time-Share and Taxes: Is Interest Deductible?  </P> <P> Q: Recently, my wife and a friend each purchased a one-half ownership in a  time-share in Mexico. The total contract balance is $5,000 and they plan to  occupy the unit for 30 days every year. My question: Can the interest on the  contract be fully deducted, the same as mortgage interest, or is it treated as  ordinary personal interest and subject to being phased out?  </P> <P> A: Depends on a couple of tricky things, the Internal Revenue Service tells me.  For one thing, to be deductible in the same way that mortgage interest is, it  has to be a "deeded" time-share -- one in which you are actually buying your  share of the property and can rent it, sell it or pass it on to your heirs.  </P> <P> If it's a non-deeded time-share, however, all you're buying is a "right to use"  the unit for X number of years, after which it reverts to the developer -- and  the interest isn't deductible.  </P> <P> The other fly in the ointment is that if you already have one "vacation home"  somewhere on which you are deducting the mortgage interest, then that's it --  the time-share won't qualify.  </P> <P> I might add, too, that most if not all Mexican time-shares with which I am  familiar are strictly non-deeded. Mexican law prohibits conventional land  ownership by foreigners along its coast line -- which is where most time-  shares are located.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> KRONOS IN MULTIMEDIA PREMIERE  </P> <P> Trust the Kronos Quartet for the unusual. The veteran ensemble, which has been  reordering the way we think about string quartet performance for the better  part of two decades, has been moving in ever more theatrical directions.  </P> <P> Sunday the latest Kronos adventure into media mixing received its local  premiere at the Wadsworth Theater, courtesy of the UCLA Center for the  Performing Arts, one member of a commissioning sextet. A sculptural performance  shell based on the four elements, "Assembly Required" certainly could not  transmute musical lead into dramatic gold.  </P> <P> On the other hand, it did not debase the four works it sheltered Sunday.  Alessandro Moruzzi's design, moodily lit by Jack Carpenter, proved surprisingly  neutral in impact.  </P> <P> Most effective was the Fire installment, framing Donald Crockett's "Array."  There was nothing particularly stirring in the dull glow emanating from four  burners on tripods, but the projection of the players' shadows on screens -- an  idea at least as old as "Fantasia" -- proved evocative of flickering energy.  </P> <P> Most trivial was the final Air segment, in which fluorescent squiggles dangled  from poles behind the ensemble. There is much in the textures and  quasi-aleatoric spirit of Lutoslawski's Quartet to suggest air, but Moruzzi's  devices seemed more suggestive of glowing bats in a low-budget fun house than  any mystical experience.  </P> <P> For Water, Moruzzi had Kronos place funnels of water over a plexiglass  container, with shadows of the filling tank again projected behind the group.  Earth may have been most representative of the effort -- angular rods on which  non-functional gears spun intermittently, ultimately doing nothing -- but doing  it quite enigmatically.  </P> <P> Credits for the production listed Jan Kirsch as choreography and movement  coach, and she took bows with Moruzzi. Her contribution though, was invisible.  Dressed in black, like stage hands, Kronos put together the sculptural  components as a solemn, well-practiced but dramatically and technically  unexceptional ritual.  </P> <P> Musically, the Kronos performance proved typically rapt, though coarsely  amplified, with a steady hum that could be heard in quiet moments throughout  the concert.  </P> <P> "Array," the program's most traditional work in materials and construction,  thrived in the Fire environment. Crockett's vigorous, skillfully controlled  motivic manipulations elicited taut, focused playing.  </P> <P> There is nothing noticeably watery about "Pano da Costa" by Jon Hassell, and if  the dripping of the water in Moruzzi's design was meant to be audible, that  failed completely. Instead, "Pano da Costa" is an extended exercise in haunting  neo-ethnic bravura, a sort of village tone poem enlisting the rhythmic aid of  caxixi, instruments that sound like maracas.  </P> <P> John Zorn's "Cat O' Nine Tails" is a sonic crazy quilt of bursts of scratchy  instrumental competition, varied quotations and pop parodies that seems little  more than a "Name That Tune" ordeal. Its relationship to earth was not  immediately apparent, though it made a relevant connection to Moruzzi's  contraption idly spinning its wheels.  </P> <P> Lutoslawski's expressive, intuitively directed Quartet deserves better than  Moruzzi's luminescent curlicues, but it could hardly get a stronger performance  than the Kronos account. "Assembly Required" may not have been worth the  effort, but the concert lurking within was a characteristically bold adventure.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Prisons Department says American teenager  Michael Fay is in good condition and the cane marks on him are  clean and almost dried. Fay was caned four times on Thursday for  vandalism.    In a statement today, the Prisons Department said Fay walked  back on his own to his cell after the caning, saying that he  wanted to act like a man. He shook the caner's hand and smiled  when he went back to his cell.    The department gave this account in response to allegations  made by Fay's father and lawyer reported by REUTERS News Agency.  Both George Fay and the lawyer, Theodore Simon, created an  account given to them by a U.S. consular official who visited  Michael Fay at Queenstown Remand Prison yesterday.    Mr. Fay was quoted as saying that his son stood throughout  the 45 minutes meeting, and an official removed his bandages.    Mr. Simon said that during the caning, blood ran down Fay's  legs. He said Fay was in the prison hospital ward. But the  Prisons Department said blood did not run down his legs although  there were a few drops on his buttocks during the caning.    Fay has also been in his prison cell throughout. He was not  bandaged and during the meeting he lifted a dressing [Word  indistinct] himself.    Fay told the consular official that although the caning cut  his skin, it was not as bad and horrifying as described in the  press. He asked the official to tell his mother not to worry  that he is fine and would not do stupid things to himself. Fay  also asked the official to tell his father to "shut up". He  repeated this request towards the end of the meeting during  which he was quite cheerful and in good spirits.    The Amercian official, Mr. John Coe, who met Michael Fay  yesterday could not be reached for comment.    A Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman also confirmed that  the ministry had summoned the U.S. counselor, Mr. Ralph Boyce  and consular official Mr. John Coe to express Singapore's  displeasure over the false report carried by REUTERS News Agency  quoting a U.S. diplomat and U.S. consular official.</p>

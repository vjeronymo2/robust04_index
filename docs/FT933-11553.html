			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Clinton in final budget blitz PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has begun a last-ditch lobbying effort to win support for his endangered budget package with a blitz of briefings and lunches for businessmen and journalists from key states. Special White House events have targeted Georgia, home of Senator Sam Nunn, one of the handful of Democrats who deserted the president on the budget's initial passage in the Senate. Also singled out is Texas, home of Congressman Charles Stenholm, leader of a rebellious bloc in the House of Representatives which is fighting the inclusion of an energy tax. Mr Clinton yesterday paraded 60 top business leaders who have signed up in support of his budget plan. They include Mr Lodwrick Cook, head of the Arco oil group, Mr Paul Allaire, chief executive of Xerox, Mr Dwayne Andreas, head of Archer Daniels Midland, Mr Rand Araskog, chairman of ITT, Mr Curtis Barnette, chief executive of Bethlehem Steel, and Mr Deryck Maughan, chief executive of Salomon Brothers. But for all the White House's efforts to portray the budget as a desperately needed change in direction, Congress has already tinkered with it so much that it has moved back heavily towards the status quo. Mr Clinton could never quite steel himself to cut some of the most obviously extravagant programmes, such as the space station or the super-conducting supercollider. But even some of the wholly outdated subsidy programmes, whose elimination took on symbolic importance in his election campaign last year, have come back from the dead. The single most specific spending cut in his economic programme was the ending of the subsidy for honey producers, which is expected to cost around Dollars 30m next year. Yet the Senate this week voted only to reduce the subsidy, which is supposed to ensure that the US has enough bees to pollinate valuable crops. Also, after taking a courageous stand on ending subsidies to preserve strategic supplies of mohair on Monday, the Senate changed its mind on Tuesday and voted to preserve the programme, which costs around Dollars 48m a year. These small changes add up to more than small change, and have made it much harder for budget negotiators to come up with a deal that still meets Mr Clinton's objective of cutting the federal budget deficit by Dollars 500bn from its projected path over the next five years. Mr Leon Panetta, the budget director, has been left wringing his hands and insisting that some form of energy tax - the most hotly contested element of the package - is essential in order to achieve Dollars 500bn of deficit reduction. Efforts are under way to craft some form of executive order that would cap future spending on entitlements such as pension and medical benefits, which could be enough to buy off the opposition of Democratic budget hawks. Nevertheless, administration officials and congressional leaders insist that they will reach agreement on a compromise budget in time for it to be voted through before the summer recess, scheduled for August 6.</p>

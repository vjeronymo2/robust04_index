			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by the Anhui Provincial Survey Group on Changes in </F> the Rural Labor Force: "An Important Strategic Task That Impacts  the Goal of Becoming Fairly Well-Off--A Survey and Some Thoughts  on the Shift in Anhui's Surplus Rural Labor"]    [Text] Editorial Note: In the latter half of  last year, leading comrades of the provincial party committee  organized a fairly large-scale study of the shift in the rural  labor force. We hereby publish an excerpt of the study report  and hope that the localities and various departments will pay  more attention to and spend more time exploring and studying  this issue.    Between July and October 1993, we revolved around the goal  of  elevating the rural areas to the relatively well-off level by  the end of the century and conducted a fairly large-scale,  province-wide survey and study of the shift in the surplus rural  labor force. The province organized three survey teams and  selected Feidong, Mongcheng, and Xiuning to be representative  counties in a prototypical survey, and at the same time, a  general survey was conducted in 15 province-run departments,  four prefectural cities, and 13 counties. Through this round of  survey and study, we have basically sorted out the province's  labor resource and its distribution, gained a thorough  understanding of the important strategic impact of the  accelerated shift in the surplus rural labor force on achieving  the goal of making the rural areas relatively well-off, and have  made a preliminary study of the basic approach and  countermeasures to speed up the shift of the labor force.  <H5>  I. Rural Socioeconomic Development's Natural Choice </H5>   Labor is the most active and the most important factor of  production. Given the conditions of a socialist market economy,  how to realize the optimal allocation of the rural labor  resource in accordance with the market mechanisms and law of  value and how to further liberate and develop the rural labor  force is an important issue for today and well into the distant  future. In particular, whether the large surplus rural labor  force can be successfully shifted is an important strategic task  that will determine whether the rural areas can beco me  relatively well-off by the end of the century.    To become relatively well-off, the rural areas have many  norms to satisfy, but the most fundamental is to substantially  increase the peasants' income. Anhui is a major agricultural  province. It has a total population of 58.17 million, 84.4  percent of which is rural population. It has 65 million mu in  total farm area, averaging 1.33 mu per capita. In 1992, the  province's rural population had a per capita net income of 575  yuan, and overall, everybody was basically well-fed and  clothed, and some peasants have begun to advance toward the goal  of becoming fairly well-off. This means Anhui's rural  socioeconomic development has entered a new phase, which is most  encouraging. But we should also realize sobermindedly that in  recent years, the planting industry's comparative profit has  been on the decline, and so increased agricultural production  has not been matched by higher agricultural income. The increase  in the peasants' income has been slow, and in some areas, it  has even stalled. In addition, because peasants in many  localities are heavily burdened, it has dampened their  production enthusiasm and has slowed their advance toward the  goal of becoming relatively well-off.    If we make an in-depth examination and analysis of the  reasons for the slow increase in peasant income, besides such  factors as the widening price scissors between industrial and  agricultural products and the lower comparative profit for  agriculture, especially for grains, cotto n, and oil, the most  important reasons are the slow readjustment of the rural  industrial structure, the improper distribution of labor  employment, and the wide gap between the input of labor resource  and material output. In 1992, nationwide, the nonagricultural  sector's contribution to the rural society's total output value  was 64.2 percent, and in some well-developed coastal provinces,  it exceeded 80 percent, but it was only 55 percent in Anhui  which had a rural labor force of 24.32 million--of which 19 .92  million, or 81.90 percent, were employed in agriculture, and  among those in agriculture, 93.6 percent were in the planting  business. By today's productive standard of an average of 6 mu  per worker, we needed approximately 11 million people, and  subtracting those who left through the development of township  enterprises and other channels, in 1992 we had a surplus rural  labor force of 4.92 million people, or one-fifth of the labor  force. Anhui's share of stalled agricultural labor force is  approximate ly 30 percentage points higher than that in the  economically well-developed coastal provinces. Anhui currently  is in a transition from the early stage of industrialization to  the mature stage, and compared to international standards, the  proportion of stalled agricultural labor force in other relevant  nations at this stage of development is generally below 70  percent [as published]. This means the shift in Anhui's rural  labor force is lagging far behind. The poor rural industrial  structure and the improper employment structure naturally affect  the income structure. In 1992, the per capita net income of  Anhui's peasants was 575 yuan. Specifically, those in the town  and township's secondary and tertiary industries had average  incomes of 142 yuan [as published], and they accounted for only  24.7 percent of the work force (national standard was 28.4  percent), while those in agriculture accounted for 75.3 percent  (57 percent for the nation), and among those in agriculture,  61.3 percent plant crops (compared to 36.8 percent nationwide).  Such income structure which is made up primarily of  agricultural, especially crop-planting, income not only slows  the rate of increase but faces market and natural risks. If we  fail to vigorously readjust the rural industrial structure,  accelerate the rural labor force's move to the nonagricultural  sector, and increase the output value and the employment shares  of the secondary and tertiary industries, a large rural labor  force will remain on the land which averages a little over a mu  per person, and no matter how we try to change the production  method, it will be difficult to increase income by much. Thus,  if we simply stake the "treasure" that can make us rich in  grain, cotton, and oil and put all of our hopes of becoming  relatively well-off into agriculture, or especially in the  planting industry, it will not work, and not only will it not be  safe, but it can actually be dangerous. In this sense, whether  Anhui's rural areas can become relatively well-off will, to a  large extent, be determined by how much of the surplus rural  labor force we can shift out.    In recent years, pressured by the rural surplus labor force  and pulled by the difference in comparative advantages among  different industries, the rural labor forces in many localities  have begun to move through channels such as agricultural  development, township enterprises, labor export, and entry to  small cities and towns and so on. By the end of 1992,  approximately 5.30 million people in the province have shifted  to the secondary and tertiary industries. Because Anhui's urban  industries and township enterprises are relatively small in  scope and limited in capacity at the present time, and because  the large- and medium-sized cities and the economically  well-developed localities have a big demand for labor, many  peasants have spontaneously and continuously left the yellow  earth which for generations and generations has been tilled and  planted, and they have flocked to some of the nation's large-  and medium-sized cities, especially in the economically  well-developed coastal regions to find work, creating a so  called "tidal wave of civilian workers." In 1992, the province  exported approximately 5 million workers (around 2 million on a  year-round basis). Gradually this shift is creating a trend that  rivals the absorption of the labor force by township  enterprises. This large-scale spontaneous shift of the rural  labor force heralds a major trend in socioeconomic development:  Regardless of whether a locality is importing or exporting  labor, it will clearly benefit economically and socially.  Overall, we can say that the current shift in the surplus rural  labor force is the product of a macroeconomic backdrop of the  transition from the old economic system to the new during which  the peasants' increased output is not matched by increased  income and the gaps between industry and agriculture, between  urban and rural areas, and among different regions are  constantly widening. It is a natural product driven by profit;  it is a natural trend as the labor force turns to face the  market, adapts to the market, goes after higher economic profit,  strives to realize its own value, and improves its overall  quality. It is a natural choice as the peasants make an  historical transition from being well-fed and clothed to being  comfortable and advance faster toward the goal of becoming  relatively well-off. We should also realize that surplus rural  labor will become an even more serious problem as agriculture  becomes increasingly mechanized, as scientific farming standard  rises, as farm area shrinks, and with the natural population  increase. It is estimated that by the year 2000, Anhui's total  rural labor force will be 28.13 million strong, with surplus  labor of approximately 11.50 million. If this huge army of  surplus labor cannot be effectively shifted, it not only will  jeopardize the goal of becoming relatively well-off, it can even  threaten social stability. This is an important  political-economic problem and a social problem that affects the  whole situation.  <H5>  Realistic Approach and Prospects for Accelerating the Shift </H5>   It is estimated that to achieve the goal of becoming  relatively well-off by the end of the year 2000, the peasants'  per capita income should top 1,700 yuan (at that year's prices).  If we analyze the relevant figures from other countries and  apply them here, by that time, the agricultural to  nonagricultural employment ratio for Anhui's rural labor force  should be adjusted from today's 7.3:2.7 to 3.6:6.4. That is, out  of the total labor force of 28.13 million, 10.03 million should  be in agriculture while 18.10 million should be in the  nonagricultural sector. These represent decrease and increase of  37 percent respectively based on 1992 figures, and only then can  we basically complete the historical mission of shifting 11.50  million surplus rural labor force. Judging by the current  conditions of the province's resources and economic development  and summing up the experiences and approaches of various  localities over the years, it is still possible to realize this  goal via different channels to speed up the shift of the surplus  rural labor force:    (1) Readjust agriculture's internal structure,  vigorously develop forestry, animal husbandry, sideline  production, and fishery, and encourage the surplus labor force  to go wider and deeper into agriculture. As a major  agricultural province, Anhui is rich in agricultural resources  and rural labor resource . Much can be said about how to develop  and utilize those agricultural resources and at the same time  properly tap the rural labor resource; there is huge potential.  Currently, the agricultural sector has a poor internal  employment structure: the labor force is concentrated primarily  in the planting industry, and within the planting industry, the  emphasis is on grain production. In 1992, province-wide, 18.65  million people were employed in the planting industry; only 1.27  million were employed in fore stry, animal husbandry, sideline  production, and fishery--they made up 6.4 percent of the work  force in the planting industry. Thus, for most localities in  Anhui, we must plant our foothold on the comprehensive  development of agricultural resources, and while stabilizing  grain production, we should use a two-prong approach of  expanding across the board and developing internally to  accelerate the rural labor force's shift from crop-planting to  forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery a  nd from simple grain planting to growing other cash crops. We  must expand forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and  fishery and the growing of cash crops, increase their share and  efficiency, and increase the peasants' income via several  channels. The province currently has 65 million mu of arable  land; 25 million is suitable for forest planting and 13.81  million mu for growing aquatic products. Their current  exploitation and utilization rate and production rates are  fairly low and therefore accelerating the development of  forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, fishery, and  cash crop productions will provide much potential for changing  agriculture's internal structure and the labor force's  employment structure. Initially, the ratio of labor force in the  planting industry to those in forestry, animal husbandry,  sideline production, and fishery and cash crops should be  adjusted from 93.6:6.4 to 79.8:20.2 by the year 2000, raising  the labor force in the latter group by 13.8 percent. Based on  the 1980 to 1992 figures where each percentage point increase in  the output value of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline  production, and fishery resulted in an increase in employment of  61,000 people, we need a work force of 2.18 million people,  890,000 more than in 1992. By developing "one superior and two  high" in agriculture, Anhui can achieve an average of one mu of  high efficiency cash-crop farm per peasant household, and based  on 2 mu of land per worker, this can accommodate 6.85 million  workers, and subtracting the 1.37 million workers needed in  conventional farming, we can absorb 5.48 million workers. Thus,  by readjusting agriculture's internal structure and increasing  the agricultural resource utilization rate, the province can  absorb more than 6.37 million of the rural labor force. This is  an effective way to move the surplus rural force which we should  not overlook.    (2) Optimize the rural industrial structure, vigorously  develop township enterprises, and promote the shift of the  surplus rural labor force to the non-agriculture sector.  Whether the peasants' per capita net income can reach the  relatively well-off level is determined to a large extent by the  optimization of the rural industrial structure. Looking at  Anhui's current situation, the rural industrial structure is  only a "well-fed and clothed" structure. In 1992, the  nonagricultural sector's share of the province's rural total  output was 8.9 percentage points below the national average.  This structure se riously hampers the increase in peasant income  and its advancement toward the goal of becoming relatively  well-off. In the next seven years or so, we have a very arduous  task in meeting the provincial party committee and provincial  government's standards for a comfortable rural life. We cannot  rely on agriculture alone. We must guide and organize the shift  of masses of peasant to the secondary and tertiary industries.  Practice in many localities has already proved that the  development of township enterpri ses should be the main focus of  attack if we want to increase the peasants' income and advance  faster toward the goal of becoming fairly well-off, and it is  also the main avenue for shifting the rural labor force. Between  1984 and 1991, the total output value of China's township  enterprises rose from 100 billion to 1.1 trillion, at a net  increase of 1 trillion yuan; total labor force employed by  township enterprises also rose to 100 million. This means for  every 10,000 yuan increase in the township ente rprises' output  value, we can employ one more worker. In 1992, Anhui's township  enterprises' output value was 58.8 billion yuan, and that year,  nearly 600,000 people were shifted, an increase of 12.3 percent  compared to the previous year. By the year 2000, Anhui's  township enterprises will employ 13.80 million people, a net  increase of 8.45 million compared to 1992; they will account for  49 percent of the total rural labor force. Of course, township  enterprises' rapid development is constrained by many factors;  fund problem is one of the main problems. Based on the  province's financial situation, working hard to raise money from  the masses, from enterprises themselves, through bank loans, and  via foreign investments, we can provide township enterprises  with an average of 5 billion yuan a year in development fund.  Based on the current figure that each additional person must be  outfitted with 5,000 yuan's worth of equipment, in the next  seven years, it is possible for township enterprises to absorb  another 8.45 million people.    (3) Actively develop a rural socialized service system  with emphasis on the civilian-run format, broaden employment  opportunities, and promote the surplus rural labor force's shift  to the tertiary industry. To develop a socialist market  economy, we must have a fully developed tertiary industry, and  the rural areas especially must set up a socialized service  system. In 1992, Anhui's tertiary industry accounted for 21.4  percent of the province's total output value; it e mployed 15  percent of the labor force--both were below the national average  levels. The rural area's tertiary industry is even weaker. Only  around 5 percent of the labor force is employed in the tertiary  industry. They are concentrated primarily in communications,  transportations, retail shops, and restaurants and other  businesses; few have anything to do directly with services  before, during, and after agricultural productions. In  particular, because circulation lags far behind production,  agricultur al and sideline products and township enterprise  products are stockpiled. To solve this problem, besides  producing hot-selling products, it is especially important to  enliven circulation services. We should emphasize building a  rural socialized service system that focuses on circulation.  Looking at years of practice, to set up and firmly establish a  service system truly capable of shouldering this responsibility,  we cannot rely on the government service organizations to do it  all; instead, we must continue to give play to the government  service organizations, but at the same time, we must actively  develop a very vigorous, civilian-run rural service system. So  called civilian-run rural service system is a kind of community  shareholding cooperative organization that is based on family  enterprises and is organized voluntarily by the peasants to  provide services before, during, and after agricultural  production. The basic mold is to make cooperatives its main  format, marketization its basic direction, modernization its  strong suit, and industrialization its general approach. It is  an effective means to adjust to the development of the  agricultural labor force and the shift in rural labor force  during the agricultural modernization process, and it opens up a  new way for the surplus rural labor force to shift from the  agricultural to the nonagricultural sector. This kind of  family-enterprise-based rural cooperative economic organization  turns separate agriculture, industry, and commerce management  into joint management; it changes the separate and solitary use  of important factors of production to optimized composite use;  it turns dispersed, low-efficiency use of resources into  properly-allocated, comprehensive use; it reduces the multiple  links and speeds up the slow circulation of agricultural  products; it turns a single family's productive force into a  combined community productive force, so that rural production  and management can make the historical change from "separate" to  "combined" and in turn promote the progress of the rural  productive forces and the modernization of agriculture. Looking  at initial practices, the civilian-run service system is playing  a very important role in promoting the readjustment of the rural  industrial structure and accelerating the development of the  rural economy, and meanwhile, it itself has a large capacity for  absorbing the surplus labor force. Its future is very promising,  and it should be vigorously developed.    (4) Reform the system of separation of to wn and  country, accelerate the process of turning villages into towns  and townships, and encourage the surplus rural labor force to  move to the small towns and townships. Urbanization is an  important norm gauging a country's or a region's level of  modernization. The establishment of the socialist market  economic system creates an important condition for smashing the  dual, city-versus-country, socioeconomic structure. We should  seize the opportunity, accelerate the development of the  nonagricultura l sector, and actively guide its regionalized  development, so that the masses of peasants will embark on the  rural urbanization road by leaving the land and the villages,  leaving the villages without entering the cities, or leaving the  villages to build new cities. Since reform and opening up,  Anhui's economy has undergone rapid development, but its  urbanization standards still lag behind. In 1992, of the  province's total population of 58.17 million, the cities and  towns claimed 8.73 million, or 15.1 pe rcent; agricultural  population claimed 49.44 million, or 84.9 percent. In 1992, the  province's GVIAO was 133.3 billion yuan, of which industries  contributed 72.4 percent and agriculture contributed only 27.6  percent. This structure serious hampers the unification of town  and country and the process of modernizing agriculture. It not  only makes it difficult to raise the peasants' income level or  realize the goal of becoming relatively well-off, but the  state's modernization process is also affected. It is  increasingly clear that shifting the rural labor force to the  towns and townships is an irreversible trend. The massive shift  of rural labor force in recent years is but a prelude to the  great future migration of peasants from the villages to the  cities and towns. For this reason, we must correctly gauge this  trend and actively promote the progress of urbanization.  Internationally, there are two ways to achieve urbanization:  centralized and decentralized. In general, for the  industrialization of the well-developed nations early on, they  chose the approach of expanding the large cities which brought a  rapid rate of urbanization, but it also brought economic and  social problems to the cities and caused agriculture to remain  stagnation and even shrink temporarily. Nations that began their  industrialization after World War II primarily took the  decentralized approach and focused more on rural  industrialization and the development of small cities and towns.  This latter approach is more appropriate for us. Currently,  Anhui's small cities and towns are spread out among the masses  of villages; they are the rural political, economic, and  cultural centers. In the wake of the development of the market  economy, small towns and townships, acting as bridges and links  between town and country, will shoulder the important  responsibility of absorbing and transforming the rural surplus  labor force. At the end of 1992, the province had 3,219 assorted  market towns with total population of 9.167 million. Each market  town had an average of fewer than 1,000 nonagricultural  population. They are small-scale, low-level towns with little  impact. Where people gather, towns flourish, and when towns  flourish, people tend to gather. If, on the average, each market  town doubles its nonagricultural personnel, we not only can  permanently shift more than 3 million rural workers but can  bring definite scale economy and cumulative effects to  industrial production and the tertiary industry in the small  towns and townships and impact and give impetus to the economic  development of the surrounding areas. To build small cities and  towns, we must insist on unified planning, proper layout,  raising funds in all directions, comprehensive development, and  the construction of other necessary facilities. First, we must  choose some central cities and towns that have good basic  conditions and good future prospects and develop them first, so  that they can play an exemplary role and bring along the others.  In terms of economic components, we must let the individual,  private, and shareholding cooperative economies develop freely.  In terms of industrial development, we should start out from the  small cities' and towns' own conditions, set priority, and  integrate the development of small industrial zones and markets.  We should emphasize the development of the construction  industry, the transportations and communications industries, the  real estate industry, and other service trades to strengthen the  overall function of the small cities an d towns. While  accelerating their development, we should also develop the  large- and medium-sized cities, so that they can be the source  of radiation and point of support to the small cities and towns.    (5) Set up an open labor market, expand labor export,  and encourage the surplus rural labor force to shift across  regional boundaries. In recent years, more and more of  Anhui's workers have gone outside of the region to work; the  number has reached 5 million. This trend of going outside of t  he region to work has been coined by the cadres and the masses  as "machine-less factory, counter-less shop, invisible technical  school, and credit-less bank." It not only has increased the  peasant's economic income but even more important is that it has  forged ties between town and country and enlivened the factors  of production, so that through this kind of labor export, many  peasants have gone to the economically well-developed cities and  regions not only to learn technologies but also to obtain  information and enhance their sense of commodity economy, and  more importantly, it has integrated the dual--town versus  country--economic structure into a single structure and has  created conditions for modernizing agriculture. Because of the  many limiting conditions, in the next seven years or longer, it  will be very difficult for Anhui to completely digest the  surplus rural labor force internally, and there will continue to  be big differences in economic development among the provinces.  Thus, labor export will continue to be an important way to  solve the surplus rural labor force problem. The trend of large  numbers of surplus workers going outside of the region to work  or do business will continue, and this trend will grow --  perhaps no fewer than 6 million people will move, which adds  another million people or more on top of today's labor export  figure. It is estimated that by the year 2000, there may be as  many as 2.2 million people working outside of the province  year-round. We should continue to advocate, encourage, and  support labor export. In particular, we should gradually set up  a labor market network that covers both town and country,  actively expand the organized export of labor, reduce the kind  of aimlessness typical of uncontrolled mobility, and promptly  solve the problems created by the shift in the labor force--such  as transportation, family planning, and public security--so as  to promote the healthy development of labor export.  <H5>  III. Provide Active Guidance and Give Impetus To </H5> Accelerating the Shift    Shift in the rural labor force not only involves the  peasants, agriculture, and the villages but also affects the  cities, industries, social life, and other aspects. It is a  social project of grand scale, and we must mobilize and organize  all sides to actively participate and work hard together in  order to effectively promote a quicker pace in shifting the  rural labor force. Today, the following problems urgently need  to be addressed:    One, we must further liberate our thinking, change old  concepts, and conscientiously strengthen organizational  leadership in working to shift the labor force. Because of the  old traditional concepts and decades of economic planning, many  cadres and the masses have come to believe that "peasants grow  crop, and the crop they grow is grain," that "cities build  factories, and villages engage in agriculture," and that "any  shift in the rural labor force will weaken the agricultural  base" and so on. They also embrace such small-scale peasant  economy co ncepts as finding satisfaction in being warm and  well-fed and being complacent with a little money, and these  ideas have influenced and obstructed the shift in the rural  labor force. Therefore, we must further liberate our thinking  and free ourselves from the bondage of these concepts. We should  have a "first-course procedure" to make the shift in the rural  labor force successful. In particular, in terms of guiding  ideology, the party committee and government leading comrades  should deepen and heighten their awareness from the strategic  high point that the goal of becoming relatively well-off, the  industrial structure, and the employment structure are a  "three-in-one" concept, and they should be diligent in guiding  and organizing the shift in the rural labor force. It is fair to  say that whether we can seize the historical opportunity before  us, take advantage of the situation, and accelerate the shift of  the surplus rural labor force are in essence an important  indication of whether the leaders at al l levels, especially the  key leaders in the prefectures, cities, and counties, are in  command of all aspects of the rural tasks, and they are also an  important test of the ideologies, concepts, leadership  standards, and the ability of the leading group. Party  committees and governments at all levels should put the shift of  rural labor force on the top of their agenda and keep in mind  the goal of becoming relatively well-off as well as local  conditions to promulgate programs, procedure, and measures for  shifting the rural labor force through the end of the century.  We must insist on suiting measures to local conditions and  provide different types of advice, choose the breakthrough  points and the main approaches properly, pay attention to the  typical effects, and give impetus to the task of moving the  labor force.    Two, we must deepen the reform process and promulgate and  perfect other policies to complement the reform. In the wake of  the establishment of the socialist market system, the policies  and s ystems promulgated under the planned economic system no  longer meet the needs of the new situation and can affect and  even obstruct the movement of the rural labor force and the  further liberation of the productive forces. In the spirit of  reform, we should promptly promulgate, perfect, and develop new  policies and system that are compatible with the market economy.  More problematic is, for example, the existing town and country  household control system and policy which seriously restrict the  proper cir culation of labor force between town and country,  obstruct fair competition, and hinder the processes of rural  industrialization and urbanization and should be actively  reformed in order to create the conditions to achieve fair  competition and proper circulation of the labor force. The  existing rural land management policy and system restrict the  movement and relative concentration of land. On the one hand  they affect the shift of the labor force to the nonagricultural  sector, and on the other hand, the y prevent the farming experts  from getting the amount of land they deserve in order to achieve  economies of scale. Therefore we should explore land management  system and policies that are compatible with the new situation  after we have stabilized and perfected the output-related  contract responsibility system. With regard to the rural area's  various specialized technical and management personnel, we  should consider the rural area's real conditions and make  professional skills and management standards th e primary bases  to formulate a unified set of standards for the rural  specialized technical and management positions, create an organ  to evaluate job titles and issue certificates, so that the  hiring units can refer to those standards. We should set up a  social security system and gradually provide collective-,  individual-, and privately-owned enterprise workers  comprehensive medical care, pension, job-related injury, and  unemployment insurance, so that the workers' basic needs and  legal rights and privileges are protected, so that they do not  have to worry about the future after moving to a different  sector. With respect to the industrial policy, we should  encourage and guide the spread of agricultural and sideline  product processing and parts and spares production from the  cities to the township enterprises and small cities and towns to  give full play to the superiority of the rural labor force and  local resources and promote the development of the town and the  country economies.    Three, we should accelerate the development of the labor  market and set up a network-type service system. Objectively,  the development of the market economy requires a perfect market  for factors of production. Similarly, a mobile labor force  requires a labor market, advice, information, training,  organization and other services. These in turn provide the  opportunity and condition for the rural labor force to achieve  free and proper circulation and to compete on equal footing.  Overall, Anhui's labor market is still in a naturally  dispersed, relatively immature stage. It has not formed a  regional market or a network of service systems, and as a  result, there is a lack of information and the channels are  clogged, so that labor circulation often tends to be aimless. It  is imperative that we set up a labor market system that is  compatible with the shift and employment of the rural labor  force. In this and next year, the province should focus on the  construction of prefectural, city, county, and key town and  township labo r markets and continuously expand, perfect, and  upgrade them to eventually form a network. By the end of the  century, we should have a fully equipped, well-informed, full  service, standardized, and guaranteed labor service network that  covers the province's every town and township and which links  tracks with the national and international labor markets. It  should basically shoulder the whole province's labor export  organizational responsibility. To accelerate the pace of labor  market construction, fund s should be gathered through multiple  channels at every level. In accordance with the principle of  "whoever makes the investments obtain ownership and reaps the  profit," we should mobilize and organize the state, collectives,  individuals, and the shareholding cooperatives to work together  and vigorously develop a team consisting of all types of labor  intermediary organizations and agents to form an open labor  market and its service system. We should also speed up market  legislation to standardize the la bor market activities and  diligently protect the workers' legal rights and privileges.    Four, we should set up a rural education system consisting  of  a "central program for three types of education" to improve the  overall quality of the rural labor force. In the wake of the  development of the productive forces, we are increasingly  demanding of the quality of the workers. The existing rural  education system is very incompatible with the need to raise the  worker's educational and technical qualities. T his is  manifested especially in the backward vocational and technical  education and adult education which restricts the mobility of  the labor force. For this reason, we must deepen the reform of  the rural education system and set up a new system consisting of  a "central program for three types of education"--basic  education, vocational and technical education, and adult  education. In other words, we must continue to focus on the  universal, 9-year, compulsory education system, but we should  also take the multi-level, multi-channel, and multi-format  approach to vigorously develop rural vocational-technical  education and adult education. Vocational-technical education  should be linked to the colleges and universities and scientific  research units at the higher level, maintain contact with  various trades and industries laterally, and impact the masses  of rural households below, so that the rural economic, science  and technology, and education departments' human, financial, and  material resources become one strong combined force. Adult  education should consist primarily of practical technical  education. The relevant departments and units at every level  should get organized to offer the rural labor force training for  different professions or of different types, so that every  worker at least have one or two special skills. We should strive  for a 1:1 ratio between polytechnic schools and regular junior  and senior high schools in the villages throughout the province  by the end of the century. For rural adul t education, we should  strive to build comprehensive training centers in the counties,  central schools in the villages and towns, and tutorials in the  administrative villages. At the same time, the middle and  elementary schools should offer manual labor courses, technical  course, and vocational elective courses, and we should  accelerate the education reform and school system reform to  separate out the students at the end of their junior high or  senior high school years and implement the "three-plus-one"  system (that is, upon graduating from junior or senior high,  students can enroll in a one-year, vocational-technical training  course) to provide some students with directional or preparatory  professional-technical education. The province, prefectures, and  counties should set up vocational-technical education and adult  education funds, provide paid services to get the development  rolling, and vigorously advocate, encourage, and support various  trades and industries, units, and individuals to open schools  and offer training courses of all types. Through the "three  kinds of education," we can accelerate the improvement in the  overall quality of the rural labor force and create the  conditions for the successful transfer of the labor force.</p>

			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Rough road to journey's end: The future of Abta is uncertain despite its record of success The 2,000 British travel industry managers converging on Majorca today for the 41st convention of the Association of British Travel Agents could be forgiven for interspersing their wining, dining and networking with a little self-congratulation. Abta's system of financial protection has ensured that no package tourist has lost money through the collapse of a travel company for nearly two decades. A Mori survey of package holidaymakers last year found that 91 per cent had heard of Abta. Despite this success, many attending the convention believe Abta needs radical change. Some of the largest tour operators and travel agents warn that if Abta does not become a much smaller and more focused organisation, they will leave. They argue that Abta represents too many, often conflicting, interests: aggrieved consumers; large mass-market tour operators; small operators selling specialised holidays; travel agents with 600 outlets, as well as those with only one. Mr Mike Grindrod, Abta president, says the association finds itself representing holidaymakers with complaints, while providing legal assistance to the companies against whom the complaints are directed. While some in the industry have voiced these concerns in the past, two recent developments have convinced many that Abta cannot continue as before. The first is the growth of the three largest travel companies - Thomson, Owners Abroad and Airtours. All have their own charter airlines. Thomson and Airtours own Lunn Poly and Pickfords Travel, two of the UK's largest travel agents' chains. Owners Abroad has links with travel agents Thomas Cook. Several executives with large companies believe they are so well known that their customers do not need the added reassurance of the Abta symbol on their brochures and in their offices. The second development is an EC directive which makes financial protection for package travellers a legal requirement, rather than a voluntary arrangement set up by groups such as Abta. All companies, whether Abta members or not, must now ensure customers can be repatriated or have their money refunded in the event of corporate collapse. However, the UK government's implementation of the directive, which came into effect this year, has been criticised for not providing sufficiently strong consumer protection. Companies which do not belong to Abta can make their own insurance arrangements if they wish. These will be policed by trading standards officers who, Abta says, do not have the experience to judge whether the insurance is sufficient. However imperfect the new rules are, Mr Grindrod believes they signal the end of a 28-year-old arrangement known as 'stabiliser', which meant that Abta tour operators could sell their holidays only through Abta travel agents. Travel agents, in turn, would only sell Abta members' holidays. In 1982, the Restrictive Practices Court ruled that 'stabiliser' was in the interest of consumers because all the companies involved subjected themselves to Abta's financial monitoring and had bonds to protect customers in the case of collapse. Mr Grindrod says because the new rules require all package travel companies, whether Abta members or not, to arrange financial protection for their customers, the courts are unlikely to allow 'stabiliser' to continue. Mr Noel Josephides, chairman of the Association of Independent Tour Operators (Aito), says: 'If tour operators want to sell holidays through a supermarket or an estate agent, there will be nothing to stop them.' Although the future of Abta will be the subject of intense discussion at the Majorca convention, no decision will be made until June, when members will vote on a proposal to streamline the association. If carried, Abta would cease to be a trade association attempting to reconcile its members' diverse aspirations. On policy issues, companies would be represented by more specialised associations, such as Aito, the National Association of Independent Travel Agents and the Tour Operators' Study Group, which represents large operators. Abta members would still have to have bonds to protect customers but, in most cases, these would be arranged through other travel organisations. Members would have to abide by Abta's code of conduct which, in some cases, would be more stringent than required by law. For example, Mr Grindrod says that while travel companies are not legally obliged to have insurance against claims of negligence brought by travellers, Abta will require its members to do so. Abta will still deal with consumer complaints. Opposition to the change comes largely from small travel agents. Mr Brian Cooke, managing director of Mersea Travel, with three shops in the south and east of England, wonders why members want to reduce the role of an organisation which is so well-known. 'A lot of subscription money has gone into building a symbol which is recognised around the world,' he says. A senior executive with a large travel group says that while the Abta symbol is valuable it is not worth the membership fees that companies have to pay. Annual subscriptions for the largest companies go up to Pounds 35,000. Membership fees of a reformed Abta are expected to be far lower. It is difficult to say which way the vote will go. If the reform proposal is defeated, some of the large members will probably resign. Mr Kevin Welsh, sales and marketing director of Pickfords Travel, says: 'Given what we pay under the existing model, we would have to question whether it's in our best interest to continue membership.' Mr Cooke accepts that defeat of the reform proposal could mean that only the smaller travel agents would remain. He believes Abta would then become an even more effective representative of smaller companies. Whatever the result of the June vote, the next convention will be that of a markedly different organisation.</p>

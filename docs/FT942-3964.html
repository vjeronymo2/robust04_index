			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Delors jobs plan wins backing Plans to promote flexibility in European labour markets which fall well short of British-style deregulation are spelt out in an internal European Commission progress report on last December's white paper on employment and competitiveness by Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president. The report was warmly welcomed at a meeting of the Commission last week and will form the basis of Mr Delors' contribution to the European Council meeting in Corfu this month. The report, written by the employment task force at the Commission's directorate general for social affairs, says the white paper has been judged useful in all member states but 'a fragmentary approach is still noticeable' and the need for 'collective action' has not yet been realised. It also argues the white paper strategy is a medium-term one and that progress at this stage must be judged in terms of 'trends and changes in political positions'. The paper is vague on the appropriate role for Brussels in promoting the goals of the white paper. Reflecting the more cautious approach to European-level employment legislation spelt out recently by Mr Padraig Flynn, the social affairs commissioner, the report says Brussels should encourage countries to 'pick and mix' elements of policy from different national systems. The paper welcomes progress made on the white paper recommendation to reduce non-wage labour costs and approves of the steps being taken in countries such as Spain to liberalise redundancy and dismissal legislation. But it stresses that labour market efficiency is to be sought not through a 'dilution' of the European model of social protection, but 'through the adaptation, rationalisation, and simplification of regulations, to establish a better balance between social protection, competitiveness and employment creation'. The paper says deregulation means different things in different countries. And in a coded dig at the British government, it says the burden of change should not be borne by the weakest in society, which is 'the easiest, but least acceptable, way of increasing access to jobs'. A similar tone is adopted in a discussion paper on European employment issues from the German government, which takes over the European Union presidency next month. The Germans stress the importance of greater flexibility in working hours but at the same time welcome the EU working-time directive - bitterly fought by Britain - as an 'important framework'. The German government, like the British, wants to promote part-time work, but the Germans' first priority in the employment field is to establish a European directive laying down minimum standards for part-timers. Germany has, however, failed to persuade the British government of the need for a directive which ensures that pay and conditions must be the same, pro rata, as that for full-timers. The European Commission progress report concludes by warning about a return to complacency on unemployment as economic growth picks up. It also chides member states for failing to come up with more local level job creation ideas and for failing to develop forms of 'top-up' state support which encourage people to take low-paid work.</p>

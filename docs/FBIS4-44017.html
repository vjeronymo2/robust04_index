			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Paris, June 24 (AFP) -- French combat troops  sent into Rwanda were on Friday [24 June] ordered to begin a  reconnaissance mission along Lake Kivu in western Rwanda and  towards the town of Gisenyi in the northwest, military sources  here said. [passage omitted]    Light patrols were due to leave Cyangugu, the first camp set  up by the French who arrived in Rwanda Thursday, bound  northwards along Lake Kivu towards the town of Kibuye. The area  is held by Rwandan government forces.    No details were given as to the numbers of men involved in  this operation nor whether it had begun.    French troops based in the Zairean town of Goma, Operation  Turquoise headquarters, are also due to cross the border Friday  towards the town of Gisenyi, the sources said [passage omitted].    French Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque said later  Friday that a centre would be set up next week in Goma to  coordinate with non-government organisations which are assisting  stricken Hutus and Tutsis.    The centre would "inform the mission command about the  whereabouts of the people under threat and on the kind of  humanitarian requirements," said spokesman Richard Duque.    France also planned to move relief supplies to the two  staging areas set up by the French forces in Goma and Bukavu, he  added.    But representatives of French humanitarian organisations  hesitated on Friday to join the French initiative, saying they  were torn between their desire to help the local population and  by the fear of being compromised by a military operation.</p>

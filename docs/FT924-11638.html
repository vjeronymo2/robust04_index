			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: 'Leeches' at the pit heads WHILE most of Britain regards the prospect of 30,000 redundant coal miners as a disgrace one segment of the population scents an opportunity. Commissioned sales agents of the life insurance and pensions industry are besieging coal fields trying to persuade soon-to-be redundant miners of the virtues of personal pensions, according to a miners' union. 'They heard the announcement and they thought Pandora's box had opened,' said David Prendergast, deputy vice president of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers. Prendergast said that at every pit named for closure, at least one insurance sales agent had planted himself on the premises to collar workers going in and out of the pits. 'We've had them banned from the colliery curtilage,' said Prendergast. He described the agents as 'leeches' and said the UDM had retained a financial adviser to urge redundant miners to remain in British Coal's pension scheme. Ironically, British Coal's pension scheme offers benefits and inflation-proofing above the national average. The Mineworkers Scheme offers annual increases to deferred pensions broadly in line with the retail price index up until retirement age and are index-linked while in payment. Also, the scheme offers widows and dependents benefits, unlike personal pensions. Paul Trickett, secretary to the Mineworkers Pension Scheme, said in the last two years, 23,000 members have opted out of the scheme taking pensions valued at Pounds 400m with them. 'We estimate that the insurance industry has earned Pounds 20m from redundant coal miners in the past two years,' he said. Anxiety that members are being urged to switch out of the scheme by sales agents in search of a commission cheque prompted the Mineworkers Scheme to retain actuaries Mercer Fraser. Mineworkers who request a transfer out of the scheme receive a fact sheet giving the merits of the scheme compared with a personal pension. John Betts of Mercer Fraser said that since September, many of those who had planned to transfer out have changed their minds. That, however, has irritated commissioned sales agents, some of whom have called Mercer Fraser to complain bitterly. 'They have threatened to report us to Lautro (the insurance regulator)' Betts said. The problem is that the sales pitch involves the display of a personal pension's projected earnings 20 to 30 years into the future. 'We send them a letter telling them that the high number might not be so much in 20 years time after the effects of inflation,' Betts said.</p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> HIGH-ENERGY DIESEL &amp; INJECTORS  </P> <P> If Bruce Springsteen retired, Bryan Adams never came back and John Cougar  Mellencamp went techno-pop, then Johnny Diesel &amp; the Injectors, who  headlined the Whisky on Tuesday, might really have a chance.  </P> <P> Diesel and his trio originated in Australia, but his Middle-American heartland  rock is closer to Peoria than Perth. With a sax man wailing on the side, Diesel  stormed through every Keith Richards chord and screaming guitar lead in the  rock 'n' roll handbook as he wailed about the torments of love. But the most  tension in the set was created by the 22-year-old Diesel's constantly breaking  strings and switching guitars. This kid is really heavy-handed.  </P> <P> In a sense, Diesel and the Injectors are a classic case of rock 'n' roll  journeyman ambition. It's an ambition that believes in a mythology whose real  adventure and challenge were sucked out of it when it became a cliched symbol  of rebellion. For bands of this ilk, it's not a matter of how predictable the  approach is, but how much energy they can infuse into those tired old formats.  In that respect, the energetic Diesel has fuel to burn. But if you're looking  for challenging twists or a sense of adventure, then this rock 'n' roll  status-quo show was running on empty.  </P> <P> Originality and innovation weren't the major concerns here. What really matters  is that Diesel is young and cute and resembles Johnny Depp. And who knows? Even  if he never quite reaches the heights of Bryan Cougar Springsteen, he could  always become as big as Charlie Sexton. RAIG LEE  </P></p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Delors to call for pact on new jobs THE president of the European Commission, Mr Jacques Delors, is expected to call today for a European-wide social pact between business and trade unions to bolster the EC's faltering competitiveness. Mr Delors will outline at a Brussels summit between European employers and trade unions his ideas on how to reconcile the EC's urgent need to improve job creation while preserving the welfare state The European Social Dialogue summit is viewed as an important step towards achieving a consensus on how to improve Europe's disappointing job creation record in relation to the US and Japan. But Mr Delors' call for a European-wide social pact may unleash criticism from the UK, which views with suspicion initiatives emanating from the European Commission and is intent on putting forward a 'British model' based on wage flexibility and labour market deregulation. Attitudes in London may harden as a result of remarks by Mr Delors to the EC's economic and social committee yesterday. Mr Delors said only a federal Europe could meet challenges such as the wars in former Yugoslavia and unemployment - reviving the controversy leading up to the signing of the Maastricht treaty in December 1991. Mr Delors later told Reuters that the speech was his response to Mr John Major's article in the Economist last week calling for the Community to stop edging towards greater centralisation. European trade union officials said yesterday that Mr Delors' notion of a European social pact - while still in outline - was likely to draw on ideas for improving job creation either agreed or under discussion among member states on the Continent. Mr Delors is said to admire the efforts to reach a political consensus in Italy, particularly over scrapping the scala mobile wage indexation system. Mr John Monks, general secretary of the UK's Trades Union Congress, said he was willing to discuss the possibility of EC-wide 'framework agreements' between employers and trade unions on issues such as employment, training, works councils and working time. 'Maybe there could be some trade-offs,' he said. He rejected suggestions that pan-European initiatives emanating from Brussels were outdated and clashed with the Maastricht treaty's emphasis on subsidiarity - the devolution of decision-making to the lowest possible national, regional or local level. The disagreement between Mr Major and Mr Delors indicates that a planned October 29 summit intended to relaunch the EC is certain to feature old, abiding divisions.</p>

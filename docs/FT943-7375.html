			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Big Mac chokes on Kassel takeaway tax It's been a difficult summer in Germany. First, 80kph speed limits were introduced temporarily on some of the country's speed-ridden Autobahns. Now, the price of the beloved Bratwurst could rise following a court decision allowing new taxes on fast food packaging. 'Here's comes the tax on Currywurst and Big Macs]' warned Bild Zeitung, Germany's biggest circulation newspaper. How exactly consumers will react is a matter for speculation. So far, only Kassel in central Germany is levying the tax which it introduced in July 1992, charging 50 pfennig on each synthetic plate and 20 pfennig on disposable cups. Two McDonalds restaurants and two makers of drinks dispensers promptly sued the Kassel authorities but last Friday the federal administrative court swept aside any doubts that the tax was legal. Normally sleepy Kassel has rarely hit the headlines so dramatically. The town hall switchboard is jammed and Mr Hans-Jurgen Schweinsberg, the municipal spokesman, says at least 750 people have rung asking for details about the new charge. McDonalds, which runs 535 restaurants in Germany, has vowed meanwhile that it will use every legal means to fight what its spokesman called 'this absurd tax' - including taking the case to the European Court. It warned that prices of some cheaper items could rise by a quarter and said it was doing everything possible to reduce waste through a corporate environmental programme which has been running since 1987. Since then napkins have shrunk by 18 per cent - saving 204 tonnes of paper annually - and hamburgers are now wrapped in paper which is 72 per cent recyclable. Kassel officials, who dreamt up the tax to reduce the city's annual 500m tonne rubbish mountain, are not impressed and claim it works better than Germany's complicated Duales System, a nationwide network which guarantees to recycle all packages and materials which carry the 'Green Spot'. Says Mr Schweinsberg: 'The Duales System is not much help if you want to reduce the amount of waste. All it does is provide you with a method to recycle it.' Kassel claims morover that bad habits are changing. Many snack stands now serve chips in ice cream cones and give customers their drinks in glasses for which they charge a deposit. Milk, often served in throw-away plastic containers, is now available in small jugs. Last year, the tax raised DM30,000 (Pounds 12,600) for Kassel. So far, this year, the figure is only DM5,000 - the best evidence, according to Mr Schweinsberg, that the mountain of fast food packaging is getting smaller. Another bonus for the town authorities is that the four companies which brought the action now owe about DM1m in unpaid back taxes.</p>

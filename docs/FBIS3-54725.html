			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As you know, the Abkhaz side on 30 December once  again breached the conditions of the Geneva agreement. More  than 100 armed Abkhazians entered the village of Ganmukhuri  which is situated on the other [west] side of the Inguri river.  In this connection, Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia left  for Zugdidi.    Our correspondent today got in touch with Givi Lominadze,  chairman of the interim committee for emergency situations in  west Georgia, and asked him to give us more detailed information  about the incident.    Unfortunately, after the fall of Sukhumi, the villages of  the  Zugdidi and Tsalenjikha areas -- Ganmukhuri, Taya, Pakhulani,  Muzhava, and others -- fell into the hands of the Abkhaz side.    After the republic's government troops entered Zugdidi,  Vakhtang Kobalia's letter asking Ardzinba to keep his promise  not to enter these villages was found in the desk of one of the  officials. As it emerged, the first copy of this letter was  sent to Ardzinba. We do not know how seriously Ardzinba took  Kobalia's request, but the fact remains that, as we have told  you above, on 30 December at noon about 100 Abkhazians entered  the village of Ganmukhuri. According to the local population,  they behaved correctly. The Abkhazians said that their move was  prompted by a report alleging that the Georgian side planned to  attack on 1 January.    It must also be said that some Georgian army formations  whose  job it was to guard these villages did not carry out the duties  delegated to them.    As a result of negotiations, the Abkhaz side left the  village.    As I have told you, Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia  left for Zugdidi, where he held a meeting and demanded that  certain army formations and their leaders treat their duty with  greater responsibility and guard villages to prevent such  instances in the future.    Batoni [honorific title] Givi Lominadze noted at the end of  the conversation that every measure is being taken to retain  peace and stability in the region.</p>

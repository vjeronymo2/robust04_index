			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: Two US rail groups plan to merge in Dollars 2.8bn deal Two of the biggest railroads in the US, the Burlington Northern and the Santa Fe Pacific, yesterday announced that they planned to merge in a deal worth Dollars 2.8bn. If allowed, the merger will create by far the biggest railroad in the US, joining two complementary networks spreading from the west coast to the midwest. It will be called the Burlington Northern Santa Fe. However, the deal faces an investigation by the Interstate Commerce Commission, a federal regulatory body which seven years ago ordered the unbundling of a merger between Santa Fe and Southern Pacific, another railroad in the same region, on the grounds that it was anti-competitive. The proposed deal will take the form of a takeover of Sante Fe Pacific by Burlington Northern, the bigger of the two companies. Santa Fe shareholders will receive 0.27 of a Burlington share for each Santa Fe share they hold, putting a value of Dollars 2.8bn on Santa Fe. In other respects, the deal looks like a true merger of two healthy and profitable companies. Burlington made net profits of Dollars 296m on turnover of Dollars 4.7bn last year, while Santa Fe made net profits of Dollars 338m on turnover of Dollars 2.7bn. Although passenger trains in the US are operated by the state-owned Amtrak, all the country's track infrastructure and freight trains are owned and operated by private sector railroad companies. Recently the freight railroads have enjoyed a surge in profitability caused by a combination of growth in the US economy, big increases in efficiency and productivity, and a lack of capacity in the road haulage industry resulting from driver shortages. West of the Mississippi, Burlington and Santa Fe are two of four big railroads. The others are Southern and Union Pacific. Burlington and Santa Fe said the proposed merger was not anti-competitive because their networks were complementary rather than competing, connecting with one another at the ends of their routes. The combined railroad would compete mainly with Union Pacific. The two companies said the merger would result in substantial cost savings though operational improvements, higher traffic densities and reduced administrative costs. Customers would benefit from being able to use a single railroad to reach a wider range of destinations, eliminating the costs and delays associated with interchanges.</p>

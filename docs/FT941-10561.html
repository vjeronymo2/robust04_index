			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Channel 4 chiefs may challenge 'safety net' levy Channel 4 yesterday served notice that it may try to re-negotiate its financial 'safety net'. This system will result in the channel paying Pounds 38.2m to the ITV companies for 1993. The safety net, which was spelt out in the 1990 Broadcasting Act, means that Channel 4 has to give to ITV 50 per cent of any advertising and sponsorship revenues earned above 14 per cent of all UK non-satellite revenues. A further 25 per cent goes into a reserve fund and Channel 4 can keep the rest. In return, if Channel 4 revenues fall below 14 per cent, the channel is compensated first out of the reserve fund and then directly by ITV. The mechanism, supported by Channel 4 at the time, was designed to help protect its minority-programme remit as it competed with ITV. Sir Michael Bishop, Channel 4 chairman, said his board accepted the principle of the funding formula but it was now providing 'a safety net and subsidy of considerable significance to the more enthusiastic bidders (those that bid high for their franchises) for new Channel 3 (ITV) licences'. Because of Channel 4's success last year, Carlton Television will get Pounds 5.6m, London Weekend Pounds 4.17m, Central - now controlled by Carlton - Pounds 5.65m, and Granada Pounds 4.08m. 'The continuing support of the board of Channel 4 for the principles of the funding formula will depend on the impact of any further revisions to the act or regulatory rules which may further disadvantage the competitive positioning of Channel 4,' Sir Michael said. Sir George Russell, chairman of the Independent Television Commission, which hands the money over to the ITV companies, conceded it appeared strange to 'pay your major competitor for your success'. But he added: 'The scheme also provides vital protection to the channel, with its special remit, in tougher years which may lie ahead.' The Radio Authority, the body that regulates commercial radio, yesterday launched a debate about what to do with new FM frequencies, which will be available from 1996. The frequencies are likely to be the last to come to commercial radio for the foreseeable future. Possibilities for the frequencies include a fourth national commercial radio service and a new local service for areas that already have a local commercial station.</p>

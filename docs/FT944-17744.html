			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Survey of The Principality of Liechtenstein (10): High-class family business / Profile of Bank In Liechtenstein (BIL-GT) It would be difficult to find a better business address in Liechtenstein than that of the BIL-GT group, formerly known as the Bank in Liechtenstein. The group is controlled, to the extent of 99.7 per cent of the voting capital, by the princely family through the Prince of Liechtenstein Foundation, although there is a public float of some 727,500 participation certificates. BIL-GT has grown very rapidly in the past decade to become a global asset management group of respectable rank, with SFr54bn in funds under management and total assets of SFr9.5bn. As recently as 1981, Bank in Liechtenstein was an insignificant financial institution with 150 employees, all of them in Liechtenstein. That was the year that Christian Norgren, a young Swedish banker, was hired by the princely family to build it up, particularly outside the principality. Over the next few years, there was a flurry of acquisitions, three in Germany, and one in each of the UK, Switzerland and the US, culminating in 1989 with the Pounds 91.5m takeover of GT Management, one of the leading UK fund management groups. Unfortunately, in the same year Mr Norgren was caught in an insider trading operation and left the group. Over the next three years, BIL had considerable difficulty integrating its big UK investment, as reflected both in sluggish income and equity price growth. Net income fell three per cent in 1992 to SFr81m. The BIL participation certificates tumbled from a high of SFr850 in 1989 to a low of SFr260 at the end of 1992. At the time, there were still four GT subsidiaries outside the UK and three BIL subsidiaries outside Liechtenstein and very little contact among them. 'There was a total lack of coordination,' a BIL executive admits today. In early 1993, the group considered selling GT, but eventually agreed to keep it, provided that directors from both sides would pursue a sensible integration. Prince Philipp, the reigning prince's younger brother and the group's chairman, became chief executive and an executive committee of six directors was established. Among the simpler changes was to have GT use BIL more and more as the group's bank, notably for foreign exchange, money market transactions and financing funds' leverage. 'A year ago, the bank got no deals from GT. Now it gets deals every day,' says Rene Ott, managing director of the bank. A more important strategic realignment put GT in charge of global institutional fund management and BIL in command of global private banking. Last year's group net profits soared 75 per cent to SFr141.3m, but Mr Ott says the result did not yet reflect the impact of the restructuring. Cost savings are beginning to be seen in the 1994 accounts and will become more apparent in the next couple of years, he says. In the first half of this year, in defiance of the general trend among Swiss banks, BIL raised its net income another hefty 40 per cent to SFr96.6m. It attributed this continuing progress mainly to its concentration on asset management. Commissions and fees account for about 70 per cent of its revenues while the more volatile trading business, which has hurt many other banks this year, represents only 8 per cent of total revenues. While the BIL group is large, it does not believe it has yet reached a sufficient size to achieve its goals. 'Our goal is to be one of the major privately owned international portfolio managers. We think we need to be managing at least SFr100bn,' Mr Ott says. As a result both GT and the bank are still expanding aggressively, using each other's infrastructure when possible. GT, which has traditionally been strong in the UK and the US, is opening offices in Madrid and Paris next year and strengthening its presence in Germany. The bank has just opened an information office in Luxembourg. This does not mean it is foresaking Liechtenstein, but the group has little opportunity for growth there. It also suspects that the principality will have difficulty maintaining its competitiveness as a tax haven over the longer term. Significant top level personnel changes have just been made. Mr Peter Stevens, chief executive of GT in London since the acquisition, is leaving the executive committee, although he will continue to chair the audit committee. Coincidentally, Mr Fritz Buhler, chairman, bank, is stepping down and will be succeeded by Hans Haumer, former chief executive of GiroCredit, the third largest Austrian bank.</p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Business Travel: Get on your bike - Smart Guide / Amsterdam What is the best area in which to stay? Definitely stay in the city centre. Amsterdam is compact, so even if your meeting is at one of the new office complexes on the outskirts, you'll be able to get there in 20 minutes or less by taxi. The ritziest hotel is the five-star Amstel, which attracts royalty, pop stars and the seriously wealthy. A single room costs Fl 650 (Pounds 241) a night, a double Fl 750. For those who want to be even closer to the main canals, popular choices for business folk are the Pulitzer, with single/double prices of Fl 395 and Fl 455, and the SAS Royal Hotel, at Fl 400/Fl 470. A smaller and more intimate hotel, one popular with repeat visitors and those on longer stays, is the Ambassade on the Herengracht canal, room prices Fl 225/Fl 275, suites Fl 365/Fl 390. Restaurants? Dinner is no problem. A stroll around any of the main hotels will yield a variety of restaurants. Lunch, however, is more of a struggle. There is no lunch culture to speak of, so even some of the best restaurants can be deserted and lifeless in the afternoon. One exception is Cafe Roux in The Grand, a luxurious hotel in what used to be the city hall. Brasserie Luden, on the Spui, a lively area of bars and restaurants, also attracts lunch-goers. Across the street is Kantjil, an Indonesian restaurant with an informal, modern interior but a traditional range of specialities, including rijstafel. If the weather is good (a not-too-frequent occurrence), try lunch in the garden of the Het Tuynhuys restaurant, in the street behind the flower market. The advantage of this Dutch aversion to lunching is that you won't need a reservation to get a table. Be warned that a lunch-time meeting at someone's office can mean a couple of cheese rolls, a glass of milk and an apple or banana. How about entertainment? Dutch bars open early, close late and come in many varieties. An Amsterdam institution is the bruin cafe, or brown pub, a result of wooden furnishings and years of cigarette-smoke. Try the Molenpad on the Prinsengracht canal if you want to combine 'brown' ambiance with good, informal food. The Spui is home to a number of packed bars and cafes, including Luxembourg and Hoppe. There is also a casino, located near the Leidseplein. Entry costs Fl 5. Identification is required (driver's licence or passport), and sports shoes are not allowed. Most nights there is something on at Amsterdam's famed Concertgebouw. Ticket prices are quite cheap, compared with London, Paris or New York, because of generous state support for the arts. Quirks of local business? The Dutch are punctual, straight-talking and relatively informal at the office. It is normal to be introduced to an executive's secretary or assistant before a meeting. Everyone, from the chairman to the chairman's secretary, will shake hands. When in doubt, proffer your hand in greeting. The Dutch are also family-orientated and protective of their free time. Breakfast or late-evening meetings are generally not appreciated. Suppose I have a spare day? The cities of Leiden, The Hague and Rotterdam are an hour or less away by train - all three are on the same rail line. The countryside is best explored by bicycle. Bikes can be hired by the hour or day at most train stations. The town of Castricum is a good starting point for exploring the dunes and sea defences of the North Sea coast. The compactness of the Netherlands is a boon to those in transit between flights at Schiphol airport. Holland Tours Schiphol (tel: Amsterdam 653-4745) has recently started tours lasting a couple of hours or even several days for transit passengers. They use six-seater luxury vans. A popular destination in April and May is expected to be the tulip fields and flower show at Keukenhof, about 20 minutes south of Schiphol.</p>

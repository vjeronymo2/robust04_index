			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Arts: Le Coq d'Or - Opera in concert It is odd of us to keep calling Rimsky-Korsakov's opera that, rather than The Golden Cockerel - especially when it is sung in Russian, as at the Barbican on Sunday. (Rimsky never heard it in any language, for he died before the irritable Moscow censors would allow it to be performed.) There, however, the mysterious Queen who arrives with the famous 'Hymn to the Sun' proved to hail from 'Shemaka', instead of the familiar old 'Shemakhan'. Along with the programme-book came the complete text in Edward Agate's rhyming, facetious English. Presumably that is the original flavour? The tale is at once surrealist-ludicrous, gory and obscurely moral, like many Russian products from Gogol to Bulgakov and beyond, and Rimsky set it in the accepted deadpan way: hardly any overt jokes, every scene composed at face value. Acts 2 and 3 begin respectively with a vista of deathly desolation and a scene of deep public anxiety, and the composer provided them with music as 'advanced' and disturbing as anything he wrote. Yet the prevailing tone is fairytale-exotic, wry but picturesque. In this concert-performance, Mstislav Rostropovich and the London Symphony preserved the ambiguous balance while revelling in Rimsky's opulent orchestral palette. Everything shone, whether in crackling brass or with an opalescent gleam, and the conductor paced the opera unerringly. He allowed himself several cuts in the score, with the happy result that he got through it in less than two hours (plus interval). Coq d'Or does have its inconsequent stretches, and without production-tricks to help them along we might grow weary of Rimsky's constant, unabashed recycling of a very few musical elements. The cast Rostropovich assembled, with principals who have sung for him already in other capitals, turned up trumps. For the bass anti-hero, dopey King Dodon, we had Bulat Mingelkiev from the Kirghiz and Kirov Operas: staunch, forthright, never admitting that he might be a comic character. Young Elena Brilova sang a fascinating Queen. There is more than a touch of Ileana Cotrubas about her timbre (bright, plucky, plaintive) and her manner (ditto), and no less intelligent calculation. In the other roles, all much smaller, Robin Leggate and Simon Keenlyside made clean impressions as the princely sons, dead before Act 2 begins, and David Wilson-Johnson was his reliable self as Dodon's surly General Polkan. The Danish contralto Mette Ejsing sang the royal housekeeper with imposing warmth and breadth; we shall surely hear much more of her. Rimsky wrote the sinister Astrologer at near-impossible heights, usually attempted in a character-squeak, but here we had a unique 'tenor altino' - the Philippine-American Noel Espiritu Velasco - who braved them with a kind of desperate urgency, eerily effective. Though the Cockerel itself gets no more to do than Strauss's Falcon in Die Frau ohne Schatten, but his/her/its warnings need to be just as telling. The young American soprano Colleen Gaetano was forceful, even strident: it worked. The London Choral Society were excellent as soldiers, handmaidens and townsfolk. Nonetheless, we owed this unexpectedly enchanting evening to Rostropovich above all. I was rude about some of his conducting in the Barbican's Prokofiev festival a few months ago, but he has Rimsky beautifully in hand. One couldn't have hoped for a performance more judicious, eager and alert.</p>

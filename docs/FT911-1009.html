			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Ulster talks delayed further over venue GLOOM about Northern Ireland's political future reached another low yesterday as stalemate continued over a logistical detail that has delayed 'round-table' talks between the province's main political parties. After a further 6 1/2 hours of bilateral meetings with Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, leaders of the main nationalist and unionist parties failed to reach agreement on the venue for the Irish government's entry into the talks process. The dispute underlines the deep-seated mistrust between the two communities in the province, whereby neither can afford to be seen as giving way first. Discussions, in effect, remain at the 'talks about talks' stage. So far, there is no indication that Mr Brooke has attempted to force a compromise on the participants - a location on the European mainland has been suggested. In spite of the secrecy surrounding the talks engineered by Mr Brooke, frustration is evident. 'Round table' talks were supposed to have taken place on Tuesday, raising questions about why the talks process was allowed to start without agreement on the logistics. Only nine weeks remain before the deadline for the completion of talks, with discussions on the highly complex subjects of devolution in the province and a new Anglo-Irish Agreement still to start. Much of the good will apparent before talks started has evaporated. Mr Brooke held two rounds of bilaterals yesterday with the four constitutional parties involved. The nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party is believed to have seen him on both occasions as full delegation. So too is the Alliance party, which draws support from both communities. Mr Brooke is thought to have seen the two unionist leaders - Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley - on their own. Mr Paisley is understood to be particularly anxious that the second strand of talks, involving the Dublin government, should be held in London. The Irish government wants the second phase of talks, which will discuss relations between south and north Ireland, to be held somewhere in Ireland. Any agreement on a venue struck with the constitutional parties in Belfast would have to be cleared with the Irish government.</p>

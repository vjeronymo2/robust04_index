			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Surrey councils set out reform plans Surrey district councils have announced plans to split the county into either five or six unitary authorities as part of the English local government review. The move follows the call by Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, for local authorities to negotiate mergers which should then be presented to the Local Government Commission. However, Surrey county council has not yet decided on a formal policy towards the review, and at present leans towards retaining the two-tier status quo. Under the district councils' proposals, Woking, Surrey Heath and Runnymede would merge to form one authority, and there would also be mergers of Guildford and Waverley; Elmbridge and Spelthorne; Tandridge, Reigate and Banstead, and of Mole Valley and Epsom and Ewell.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Jia Fenyong (6328 1164 0516)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 3 Mar (XINHUA) -- To implement  comprehensively and correctly the party's policy concerning the  freedom of religious belief and to effectively enforce the newly  promulgated laws on religion, the State Council Bureau of  Religious Affairs and FAZHI BAO [LEGAL NEWS DAILY] cosponsored a  forum on the "Provisions on Managing Foreign Nationals'  Religious Activities Within the Boundaries of the PRC" and  "Regulations on Managing places of Religious Activities" in  Beijing today.    In their speeches, the forum's participants expressed  unanimous support for the two religion-related laws promulgated  by the State Council, hailing the promulgation as a major step  in enacting laws on religious work and codifying the management  of religious affairs. Under the circumstances of reform and  opening up, more and more religious affairs related to  foreigners have cropped up in China. The "provisions" are  promulgated precisely to meet the pressing demand for revising  the legislation. The "provisions," which fully reflect the  Chinese Government's policy of respecting the freedom of  religious belief of foreign nationals in China, protect foreign  nationals' participation in normal religious activities as well  as their friendly contacts and cultural and academic exchanges  with religious circles in China. Meanwhile, the "provisions"  also effectively safeguard the Chinese Constitution's principle  that "religious bodies and religious affairs are not subject to  any foreign domination." The promulgation of the "regulations,"  which provide clear stipulations for protecting normal religious  activities and the lawful rights and interests of religious  places of religious activities, is a long-awaited event of  religious circles and is of great significance for conducting  various concrete religious activities in China. The forum  participants also offered many concrete suggestions and opinions  for implementing these two laws.    The forum was attended by officials from all national  religious organizations, including Zhao Puchu, Ding Guangxun, An  Shiwei, Zong Huaide, Li Yuhang, Jia Muyang, Gong Tangcang, Jin  Luxian, Fu Tieshan, Wan Yaobin, Ma Xian, and Liu Bonian; as well  as responsible comrades from the central departments concerned.  Zhang Shengzuo, director of the State Council's Bureau of  Religious Affairs, chaired the forum.</p>

			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONFIRMATION HEARINGS FOR JUDGE SOUTER  </P> <P> Like most Americans, I had never heard of Judge David Souter before his  nomination and, like most, I am concerned about issues which are likely to come  before the Supreme Court. But as I read of spokespersons from all sides of  those issues imploring the Judiciary Committee to reject the nominee for the  express reasons that he claims to have an open mind rather than a bias, I'm  concerned with the Senate's spending time listening to people who don't know  what a judge does for a living.  </P> <P> ERIC E.

			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SEXUAL DISORDER CAUSED AF PILOT'S BIGAMY, COURT TOLD  </P> <P> An Air Force pilot fighting bigamy charges in a court-martial suffered from a  sexual disorder that clouded his mind and led him to marry a British woman  suspected of spying, his lawyer argued Friday.  </P> <P> Capt. Neil Clark, 41, is accused of bigamy, immigration fraud and conduct  unbecoming of an officer for a brief entanglement with a woman who paid him  $2,000 to get married in a Reno wedding chapel so that she could remain in the  United States.  </P> <P> Five Air Force officers -- four men and a woman -- make up the court-martial  panel.  </P> <P> Clark, a 19-year Air Force veteran eligible to retire next year, stands to lose  his military pension and serve up to seven years in prison if convicted.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Signed Papers  </P> <P> His lawyer, Robert Rivkin, said in an interview before the court-martial that  Clark, who is married and has two children, acted irrationally in marrying  Margaret Vickerage. He said Clark never intended to defraud immigration  officials by signing papers to allow Vickerage, as his wife, to remain in the  United States.  </P> <P> Rivkin said Clark and Vickerage had a brief affair, and they ended up getting  married in a Reno wedding chapel last Nov. 25. The next morning, when Clark  awoke in a motel room after having sex with the woman, he voided the $2,000  check and left Vickerage in Reno, Rivkin said.  </P> <P> Clark married Vickerage because he suffered from a "sexual disorder" that made  him promiscuous, Rivkin said. His desire for Vickerage was so strong that he  suffered from a state of diminished mental capacity, the lawyer said.  </P> <P> Rivkin contends that Vickerage had been under surveillance as a suspected spy  by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations. He said Vickerage has lived  near several U.S. bases in England and the United States and gained extensive  knowledge of flight operations through romantic relationships with several Air  Force officers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Charged  </P> <P> Vickerage, 46, has not been charged with espionage and is not expected to be  called as a witness. She is now living in Nebraska.  </P> <P> Military officials have refused to discuss Rivkin's allegations about  espionage. Presiding Judge Col. Kenneth Randall refused to let Rivkin introduce  testimony about spying in Clark's trial, ruling that there was no basis for the  court to consider Air Force suspicions of Vickerage.  </P> <P> Clark piloted KC-135Q aircraft, which refueled the SR-71 spy plane. Rivkin said  Clark never provided classified information to Vickerage and fully cooperated  with Air Force investigators.  </P> <P> Rivkin said the case against Clark was "discriminatory and hypocritical"  because adultery is widespread in the Air Force.  </P></p>

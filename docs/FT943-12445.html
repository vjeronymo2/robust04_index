			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo Japanese government bonds are expected to be trapped in a range this week as technical factors are likely to prevent traders and investors from taking large positions. Although a spreading optimism over economic recovery and a rise in short-term interest rates due to active fundraising by banks resulted in a net loss in bond prices last week, the change in traded bond futures contracts next month from the September to December contracts have prevented a sell-off. Meanwhile, cautiousness of over-supply still prevails, and market participants will focus on a government offering, expected mid-week, of Y1,000bn in 10-year bonds to test the real strength of the market. In spite of previous concerns, last week's Y100bn Tokyo Electric Power straight bond issue and Y100bn offering by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone were well received by investors. Traders, however, said the corporate issues were priced attractively to draw buyers, and that it would be harder for investors to absorb a large government issue. Mr Katsuyuki Nawata, bond analyst at Sanwa Bank, says a coupon of around 4.4 per cent may attract institutional investors. He expects a range of 4.27 per cent to 4.45 per cent on the yield for the No 164 bond as long as economic data, released this week, do not betray market expectations.</p>

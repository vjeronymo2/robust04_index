			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Singapore Telecom rises 19.5% Singapore Telecom (ST), the island republic's partly privatised telecommunications and posts company, has announced pre-tax profits for the year ending March 31, 1994, of SDollars 1.55bn (Pounds 667m) a 19.5 per cent increase. Turnover increased 15.6 per cent to SDollars 3.19bn. The gross dividend was raised to 3 Singapore cents from 1.7 Singapore cents. The government floated about 11 per cent of ST last October, in Singapore's biggest ever privatisation. The company is the largest on the Singapore exchange with a market capitalisation that at one stage stood at SDollars 70bn - about 80 per cent of the market capitalisation of British Telecommunications. ST attributed the strong financial performance to economic growth in Singapore and its region and the introduction of new services. Singapore's economy grew 9.9 per cent in 1993 and 11 per cent in the first quarter of 1994. The international telephone sector was the largest contributor to group turnover making up nearly 50 per cent of total revenues and growing 13 per cent over the previous year. Mobile communications increased 36 per cent making it the fastest growing sector of ST's business and accounting for 16 per cent of overall revenue. There are now 6.2 subscribers for mobile phones per 100 inhabitants in Singapore. ST's directors said the group's results exceeded forecasts made in a prospectus issued before last year's flotation. They were confident that group turnover would continue to grow in tandem with the Singapore economy. Analysts said that while ST has become one of the world leaders in introducing new services, its future growth was limited by the small size of its domestic market. Singapore has a population of under three million. ST has recently been expanding aggressively overseas and joint ventures include projects in Japan, the UK, the Philippines and Norway. Despite its expertise in many areas, industry experts still question whether ST has the ability to compete with the world's larger established telecommunications companies.</p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / International Company News: Fiat sells seat-making unit Fiat, the Italian vehicles group, is taking another step to outsource more motor components with the Dollars 160m sale of its car seat-making activities to Lear Seating of the US. Under a preliminary deal announced yesterday, Lear will acquire Fiat's Italian-based Sepi seat-making subsidiary. Sepi will continue, under Lear's ownership, to supply Fiat's Italian car plants. However, Lear will also use the operations to supply markets in eastern Europe and Latin America. The deal is in line with a growing trend by leading car producers to concentrate on vehicle assembly, leaving many component supplies to independent producers, which can achieve greater economies of scale by supplying several other vehicle makers simultaneously. Two months ago, Fiat in effect disengaged itself from another important components sector, the constant velocity joints and driveshafts essential to all front-wheel-drive cars, in a deal with GKN, the UK industrial group. GKN agreed to invest Pounds 50m (Dollars 77.5m) in a joint venture with Fiat which will supply the Italian vehicle maker with drive-line components from a new factory near Florence. GKN holds 85 per cent and management control of the venture, which has taken over Fiat's own business which had been making the components. The Lear-Sepi and GKN ventures provide for non-Fiat customers to be supplied. Sepi had 1993 sales of about Dollars 350m and produced seats for more than 1m vehicles. It has about 1,800 employees. The Sepi agreement is subject to completion of a due-diligence review and other conditions. However, when completed the deal 'will increase our global market share and further strengthen our European position as well as allow us the opportunity to expand with Fiat in eastern Europe and South America,' said Mr Ken Way, Lear's chairman and chief executive.</p>

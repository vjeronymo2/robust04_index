			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Italian telecoms merger planned IRI, Italy's biggest state holding company, yesterday revealed plans to rationalise the telecommunications sector, starting with the merger of Sip and Italcable by the end of this year. Sip is Italy's main telecoms utility, while Italcable handles intercontinental traffic. Both companies are quoted. The union will be the first step towards grouping Italy's public sector telecoms activities, split between seven main companies, into a single concern. The new organisation, expected to be called Telecom Italia, should be operational by 1995-96. IRI's new management, facing a cash crisis, has identified telecoms, controlled by the Stet holding company, as an obvious privatisation candidate. Stet is issuing a L565bn Eurolira bond, convertible into Sip savings shares, in a further step towards privatisation. The deal could cut Stet's stake in Sip savings shares from 32 to 18 per cent. The government has set IRI a June 30 deadline to prepare rationalisation plans. IRI intends to start by merging the main providers of services, while keeping manufacturing and mobile telecoms apart. Telecom Italia will absorb Telespazio and Sirm, Stet's satellite and maritime communications subsidiaries. Telecom Italia will also comprise Iritel, formerly known as ASST, the unit responsible for domestic trunk communications and short-distance international calls. The future of Stet's equipment manufacturing (Italtel) and network service (Sirti) businesses is less clear. Stet has been looking for foreign investors in Italtel, in which AT&amp;T has a 20 per cent stake. The highly profitable mobile telecoms business, run by Sip, will be hived off into a separate company, in which Telecom Italia will retain a minority stake. Italy's government hopes to float about 20 per cent of the IMI financial services group and 30-35 per cent of the Ina state insurance company this year.</p>

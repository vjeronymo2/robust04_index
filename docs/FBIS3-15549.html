Speaking at a news conference devoted to the results of his  visit to the United States in New york City on Monday, Kravchuk  said that "we have discussed a whole spectrum of issues of  mutually beneficial cooperation in the economic and other  spheres. We held talks with the U.S. leadership as a democratic  and independent state. All this has been recorded in respective  American-Ukrainian documents, as well as statements made by  President (Bill) Clinton. The next step would be the  fulfillment by the Ukrainian side of all its obligations which  we have assumed."    "I would not link the success of the meeting with those  credits which the United States has promised to grant us. The  credits will not be able to provide for full economic recovery  of the country anyway. They may help only when the economic  mechanism begins working. But now we need U.S. investments and  technological assistance badly," Kravchuk said.</p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Alliance reveals DM9bn holdings ALLIANZ, Europe's largest insurance company, yesterday disclosed the biggest of its extensive holdings in German and foreign companies, showing a combined market value of DM8.9bn (Pounds 3.6bn) at the end of June. The Munich-based group, which has long had a reputation for secrecy, followed Daimler-Benz's decision to publish its accounts according to US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as part of its listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier this year German banks also moved to more open accounting. The holdings, disclosed at the shareholders' meeting in Munich, include: a 14.4 per cent stake in BASF, one the big-three German chemical companies; a 14.8 per cent stake in Linde, one of Germany's biggest insurance companies; a 12.8 per cent stake in RWE, the Dusseldorf-based utilities conglomerate; and a 12.1 per cent stake in Veba, the energy-based conglomerate. Allianz also disclosed a 16.9 per cent stake in the BHF Bank, one of Germany's most influential, and a 12 per cent stake in the Dusseldorf-based IKB Deutsche Industriebank. Disclosures were limited to stakes of 10 per cent or above. Allianz has already revealed a 22 per cent stake in Dresdner Bank, Germany's second biggest bank, and 20 per cent of the Bayerische Hypo-Bank, another large bank. It also owns 25 per cent of Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurance company. It is known that Allianz is the largest shareholder in Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, but as this holding did not appear on the list the holding is below 10 per cent, but worth several billion D-Marks. Allianz's disclosures shed light on an investment portfolio which was worth DM184bn at the end of last year at book value alone. The announcement pre-empted next year's changes in German securities markets law which will bring the disclosure requirement down from a threshold of 20 to 25 per cent to 5 per cent or less. Mr Henning Schulte-Noelle, chief executive, said premium income for the group in 1993 would rise 14 per cent to more than DM62bn. For the first six months premium income rose 21.5 per cent to DM33.3bn.</p>

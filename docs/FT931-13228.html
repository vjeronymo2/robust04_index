			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Letter: A freedom that invites objection Sir, Sir Bryan Hopkin and Sir Douglas Wass (Personal View, January 22) set out their opposition to the idea of an independent central bank for the UK in terms that one might expect from civil servants who resent the thought that power might be better exercised by independent professionals than by politicians. Their objections seem not to be that a central bank would not provide a stable monetary environment for business to work within. Instead they object to the idea that the setting of monetary policy by a group other than the government of the day would constrain that government in its activities in the fields of taxation, spending, borrowing and all the other areas in which governments like to become involved. Exactly. P W Bloomer, 1 Evelyn Road, Chiswick, London W4 5JL</p>

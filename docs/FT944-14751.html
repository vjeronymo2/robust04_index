			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Just not good enough The Conservatives are driving corruption down-market. The traditional British way of trading favours is camouflaged, subtle, delicate, unspoken, communicated via the old boy network, nudged along and winked through, understood but never admitted, modest, restricted to a small circle of villains who trust one another, above all manageable. The essence of it is a pretence that it never happens here. The Italians and latterly the French may be corrupt, we tell ourselves, but sleaze stops at Calais. This myth has enabled officials to protest that British standards of public life are the highest in the world, the envy of the universe, a model followed with difficulty even in the celestial kingdom. Mr David Hunt, the minister for open government, was saying that sort of thing yesterday, popping up on the airwaves every hour, wearing an expression perfected by purveyors of double glazing. Wide-eyed and innocent, he was apparently possessed of a touching expectation that he was convincing. He was not. Nor was Mr John Major when he uttered similar sentiments in the Commons. To be fair, the prime minister did not stand a chance. British corruption is getting out of hand. Mr Major himself is seen to be honest, but all around him the angels and seraphim of his Tory administration are falling. Down they flutter, wings torn or singed, into the abyss of resignation, sacking, disgrace. We need not list them. They have been punished enough. The Artful Dodger will not rise to the heights to which he aspires. The Outlaws have been banished. The honourable member for back-handers and his colleague, the ex-minister for nice little earners, have attracted the opprobrium they deserve. It is the imps who may still be sailing aloft singing hosannas and pretending to be perfect who should trouble Mr Major. He cannot know how many more miscreants will be found, or who they are. What concerns him is that the public perceives that there is something fishy about some members of his 15-year-old government. Just the other day 61 per cent of respondents to a Gallup poll in the Daily Telegraph agreed that the Tories 'give the impression of being very sleazy and disreputable'. What proportion does Mr Major imagine thinks like that this morning? The public has lost confidence in the probity of his party, and with reason. Recall the facts. Questionable traders have donated large sums to the Tories. Patronage is for sale, at a somewhat higher price than parliamentary questions. Yesterday Mr George Howarth, a Labour MP, published a table naming 157 business executives appointed to the boards of 100 quangos; all seem to have ties with companies that have contributed to Conservative funds. Ministers who have supervised the privatisation of state industries have become directors of the new firms, or moved to the banks that handled the sales. The most startling allegations have arisen from arms deals. Earlier this year, evidence given in public to Lord Justice Scott's inquiry into some of these was disquieting enough; his report could be more so. Ministers are dangerously complacent about this. One said privately last week that so much time had passed in the waiting that Scott had gone stale. We shall see. While officials reassure themselves, Mr Tony Blair seizes the moment. At question time yesterday, the new leader of the Labour party made three suggestions. The first - that no minister who has privatised a company should subsequently end up on its board - was rejected by the prime minister. The second - that 'a list of all members of quangos, their payments, their perks and any position with any political party' be published - was parried by Mr Major, who said his own studies were under way. The third - that 'the cash for questions inquiry now be broadened, be made deeper, be held in public and be made fully independent' was turned down on the ground that Parliament's committee on privileges had traditionally taken evidence in private. It would publish its report, which would be debated. None of this is good enough. The rules for ministerial behaviour, both in office and after leaving it, manifestly need tightening. Only an independent, open inquiry will be enough to meet the level of public suspicion aroused by the revelation that MPs have been paid to ask parliamentary questions. One junior minister resigned yesterday following allegations to that effect in The Guardian; a second, Mr Major informed the House, is suing the newspaper. That may bring the whole subject into court, a more open form of inquisition than Parliament's committee of privileges. As to quangos, we can wait and see what the government proposes to do. The prime minister should not dally. He would do well to recall the posture adopted by the sensible Mr Kenneth Clarke in analogous circumstances. When he became chancellor, the government's economic strategy, blown away on Black Wednesday, was in ruins. The markets had little confidence in the Tories' economic competence; the voters less. The priority, Mr Clarke determined, was to restore faith in Conservative prudence. Tax cuts could wait. If necessary, interest rates could be increased. What the chancellor called a period of good government was the best - the only - political strategy if the Conservatives were to avoid defeat at the next general election. By giving the Bank of England quasi-independent control over monetary policy, he locked the government in to his chosen course. Mr Major doubtless concurred. The parallel is clear. Public confidence in the probity of Conservatives will not be restored unless Mr Major demonstrates that he regards the establishment of clean government as an overriding medium-term priority. All his political actions should recognise this. He should have welcomed Mr Blair's proposals, and added a gloss of his own. The prime minister must take risks. He should place allegations of improper behaviour, or inquiries into new rules, before independent tribunals or committees. These must conduct their deliberations in the open. As Mr Paddy Ashdown said yesterday 'neither this House nor the people of this country are going to be satisfied with the result of inquiries held in secret'. Heaven knows what may emerge from public investigations but, as to that, it is too late for regrets.</p>

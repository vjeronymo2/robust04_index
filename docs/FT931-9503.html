			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / For whom the road tolls: Britain's government is seeking more ways to extract money from motorists Slowed to a crawl on a heavily congested motorway or fuming in a town-centre traffic jam, British motorists are likely to be incensed by the suggestion that they have had it too good for too long. But that is the message coming increasingly loudly from the government. Road users, it seems, are going to have to pay more for their dubious pleasure. Sometime this spring, the government confirmed this week, a green paper will propose new ways of extracting money from motorists: the introduction of tolls on trunk roads and motorways. The Department of Transport also hinted that this could be a first step towards the eventual privatisation of the trunk road and motorway network, raising fears that tolls could soar if ownership of the roads passed to private sector profiteers. If there were any doubts about the scope for a possible furore over these proposals, they would have been dispelled by events in Germany this week, when the country's ruling coalition coincidentally came up with similar plans for the German autobahn network. Such was the backlash from car owners, politicians and trade unions that the government was driven into ignominious retreat. No charges for the motorways had yet been agreed, it said, nor had any date for their implementation been set. In Britain, too, even before the publication of the government's green paper, the attacks have begun. Opposition parties say it is just a way of creaming off some extra funding from the hard-pressed motorist to help fill the country's yawning budget deficit; the Automobile Association says it will create a two-tier road network, leaving better-off drivers on the motorways and diverting worse-off ones on to unsuitable roads through towns and villages; and freight transport groups say higher road charges for goods traffic will weaken the competitiveness of British industry. Just what the government is proposing is still far from clear, but what it professes to be doing is getting the private sector to help meet Britain's growing demands for roads. While recession may have temporarily taken the heat out of the congestion crisis, road traffic is forecast to double by the year 2025, and the government cannot afford to meet the cost of accommodating the growth on its own. Inviting the private sector to build toll roads would seem an obvious solution. The trouble is, these only work where users have no cheap or easy alternative. In other European countries where they exist, such as France and Spain, they tend to work either because other routes are also tolled or because the free alternatives are impractical for drivers travelling long distances. In Britain, criss-crossed with trunk roads and motorways that are all toll-free, attempts to get private roads built have met with little success. Only one project, the Birmingham Northern Relief Road, has so far reached the planning stage - in this particular case because the motorway route for which it provides an alternative is saturated. The implications for Britain are clear. If the private sector is to build new toll roads, then tolls will have to be introduced on the public roads that compete with them, too. But yet to emerge is just where the toll revenues would go: to the exchequer, or to the Department of Transport to build more roads? One possible outcome is that the answer will be neither. Instead, the government may invite companies to bid for franchises to take over the operation of existing motorways and trunk roads, introduce tolls on them, and use the cash generated to fund the construction of extra lanes or new roads running parallel to them. That would effectively mean the privatisation of the trunk road and motorway network. It is too early to say precisely what this would mean for road users. The toll roads would be easy to use - technology already in existence would debit charges electronically from devices in motorists' vehicles on entering and leaving the roads, so there would be no need for dozens of toll booths at entrances and exits. The tolls would push up motorists' costs - but if better and less congested roads were the result, the charges could be outweighed by savings in users' time. So what is there to object to in such a plan? As in Germany, the main factor is the overwhelming sense of injustice among British motorists who feel they are already paying far more for the roads than they should. According to the Automobile Association, road users pay two and a half times as much in motoring taxation each year as the government spends on building and maintaining the roads. If that money were ploughed back into roads, the AA argues, there would be no need for tolls. So how can the introduction of new charges be justified? One answer is to say that it is not so much a matter of justification as of expediency. The Treasury does not acknowledge a link between the money it collects from road users and the money it spends on roads: that, it says, would be like arguing that the money collected in cigarette tax should be spent on the production of tobacco. Instead, it sees road users as a convenient source of revenue; and, quite separately, it sees the Pounds 2bn-a-year roads programme as an unwelcome burden on the exchequer. And yet, given the likely controversy over the toll road issue, it is worth taking a look at the AA's case - not least since the public transport lobby claims, equally vociferously, that motorists are getting a cheap ride on the roads and ought to be paying more. The easier side of the equation is the government's annual revenue from road users. According to Department of Transport statistics, fuel tax from cars and goods vehicles currently totals Pounds 11.47bn a year and vehicle excise duty Pounds 3.23bn. That makes Pounds 14.7bn. The AA also adds in more than Pounds 4bn collected from car drivers in value added tax: but there seems little justification for this, because VAT is a uniform tax applying to nearly all goods and services. (It should be noted, though, that public transport is exempt.) On the cost side, Department of Transport figures tell us that capi tal spending on roads is running at Pounds 2.87bn a year, and this is the figure the AA uses. But it is the wrong number: what we need to know is how much the capital invested in the roads has cost the government to obtain. For this we turn to Professor David Newbery, director of the Department of Applied Economics at Cambridge University, whose back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest a total capital value for the whole road network of around Pounds 90bn. Applying to that the government's discount rate of 8 per cent yields an annual cost of Pounds 7.2bn - a rough but serviceable figure, and one considerably higher than the government's annual capital spend. The Department of Transport provides the next two figures: Pounds 3.21bn a year for road maintenance and Pounds 420m for police and traffic warden services. Adding those to the cost of capital makes Pounds 10.83bn, still well short of the money collected in tax. And that is the end of the list, as far as the department is concerned. Yet still absent from it is any consideration for the cost to society of accidents, pollution, congestion, noise and nuisance. This is controversial ground because it is impossible to put a precise figure on these costs. But it is worth making the attempt because ignoring them distorts the market for road transport. According to economic theory, a socially efficient market is one which distributes resources according to the wishes and needs of the community, and a necessary condition of such a market is that the price of a good is equal to its marginal social cost. This cost must include not only the cost borne by the individual, but the cost which the individual imposes on society by consuming it. In the case of roads, the only social cost for which a figure is available is the one for accidents, estimated by the Department of Transport at Pounds 6.1bn. But that figure includes debatable calculations on matters such as the value of a human life, and the AA prefers to add in only a small sum to take account of direct costs to the hospital and ambulance services. Environmental costs are even more debatable. It can be argued, for example, that these are already reflected in the high prices being paid by vehicle owners for anti-pollution measures such as catalytic converters in the purchase price of their cars. But Prof Newbery says studies in the US suggest that estimates for environmental damage tend to come out at roughly 10 per cent of other road costs, so it is possible to add in this factor. The effect is to take the total figure for road use costs to Pounds 18.6bn - some Pounds 3.9bn more than road users pay. This is not intended to be an accurate figure: some of its components may be too generous, others too mean. But it shows that it is possible to arrive at a conclusion very different from the AA's and the Department of Transport's: that, far from paying too much for their roads, Britain's vehicle owners may be paying 20 per cent too little. If this were true, the consequences could be far reaching. The public transport lobby argues that railways are at a competitive disadvantage with roads because road users do not pay their full costs. Neither do railways, the road lobby could say: trains do environmental damage, too. But if the government's green paper attempts to quantify the full economic and social costs of the road network, and compares them with those of the railways, the long-term effect could be a significant shift in the pricing structure in favour of rail. Then again, it is salutary to remember that toll roads are nothing new: they were widespread in 18th-century Britain. But when the first turnpikes were introduced in the late 17th century, they were accompanied by riots and mass destruction. Given the government's current antipathy towards any decision that smacks of controversy, it might think twice before risking another row on the roads.  -----------------------------------------------------------------                    THE REAL COST OF MOTORING?  ----------------------------------------------------------------- 1991 (poundsbn)             Cost    Revenue Cost of capital              7.2    Fuel tax                 11.5 Maintenance                  3.2    Vehicle excise duty       3.2 Policing                     0.4    Total                    14.7 Accidents                    6.1 Environmental costs          1.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Total                       18.6    Net deficit               3.9  -----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

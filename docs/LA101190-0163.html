			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL OKS BUILDING CAP OF 1,400 UNITS  </P> <P> The Glendale City Council gave unanimous approval Tuesday to a building cap  ordinance aimed at slowing the pace of housing construction.  </P> <P> Under the ordinance, the city will issue no more than 1,400 building permits  annually for new houses, apartments and condominiums.  </P> <P> Among these, 700 permits will be earmarked for affordable housing, and the  other 700 will go to build houses that can be sold or rented at prevailing  market rates.  </P> <P> The building cap is one of several growth-control measures developed by the  city to curb a construction boom in multiple-family housing. The council placed  a moratorium on new apartments and condominiums two years ago, saying they were  contributing to traffic congestion and school crowding.  </P> <P> The cap on building permits will take effect in 30 days, but no permits will be  issued until the moratorium is lifted.  </P> <P> The moratorium is expected to be lifted after the council approves other  growth-control measures, including citywide zoning changes that will cut the  number of new units that can be built on each lot. The downzoning proposal is  scheduled to be considered by the council Oct. 30.  </P></p>

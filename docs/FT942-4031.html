			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Kleinwort issue goes sour - A look at the 85,000 investors who face a dilemma If you were one of the 85,000 people who subscribed for shares in the Kleinwort European Privatisation investment trust (Kepit) earlier this year, you should soon be receiving a demand for the second 50p instalment. The shares were offered in February on a part-paid basis with half the 100p share price due then and half on August 1. Some people seem to have thought this was a good opportunity to subscribe for shares cheaply, sell them for a profit in the first few weeks of trading, and never have to stump up the rest of the share price. Unfortunately, it did not quite work out that way. Unless you were very quick off the mark, you would never have made a profit. The performance of Kepit shares has been disappointing. They stand at 30.5p, an apparent fall of almost 40 per cent since the launch. If you add in the value of the warrants included as a sweetener, the fall is still steep: a package of five shares and one warrant, for which investors have so far paid 250p, is now worth 181p - down 27.6 per cent. Even if you assume that the extra 50p payment will add a full 50p to the share price, that is still a fall of 13.8 per cent. (The FT-SE 100 has fallen 11.4 per cent over the same period). The net asset value per 50p share has fallen to 41p. Kepit's rival, the Mercury European Privatisation trust, which was fully-paid from the start, has done marginally better. Five shares and a warrant cost investors 500p and are now worth 448p, down 10.4 per cent. The latest net asset value per 100p share is 95.4p, roughly back to where it was on the first day of trading. Disgruntled shareholders, who may feel reluctant to part with more for Kepit shares, have little room for manoeuvre. Their choice is simple: sell before mid-July (when the shares start trading as fully-paid) and take a loss, or keep the shares and pay the second instalment in the hope that, by holding on long enough, the trust will come good. Refusal to pay will lead only to forfeiting the shares. Pep investors face an added complication. The first instalment paid in February counts towards the 1993/4 Pep allowance, but, unless you paid sufficient cash into your Pep before the tax year-end to cover the second instalment, the second half will use your 1994/5 Pep allowance, even if you did not use all of last year's. Alternatively, to cover the cost of the second instalment on the remaining shares, you could sell some of the part-paid shares and/or warrants held in the 1993/4 Pep without eating into this year's Pep allowance. But anyone who applied for the maximum of 6,000 Pepable shares probably was allocated 1,890. You would have to sell about 1,040, and all 378 warrants attached to them, to make enough to cover the payment due on the remaining 850 shares. Losses within Peps cannot be offset against gains elsewhere for tax purposes. Industry observers were speculating until recently that Kleinwort might do better to cancel the cash call and carry on with a more manageable trust of half the size. But this option was ruled out. The most obvious explanation, apart from loss of face, is that intermediaries received 3 per cent commission on the full share price back in February. If the second instalment were not paid they would, effectively, have received an unacceptably high 6 per cent commission.</p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Aid sought as locusts spread AT LEAST Dollars 6m (Pounds 4m) is needed urgently in donor aid to prevent a new plague of desert locusts which could spread across Africa, the Middle East and south-west Asia, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said yesterday. Rain in the Sahel countries and monsoons in Asia were encouraging rapid breeding by the locusts, which now constituted 'a major threat to food crops and food security', said Mr Edouard Saouma, FAO director-general. Swarms had been reported throughout east Africa and the Sahel, said the Rome-based FAO. Last month they also spread from Yemen towards Oman in the Gulf and eastwards to Pakistan and India. Mr Saouma said the international community had responded generously but more aid was needed. 'This is the greatest threat since the last plague of 1988,' when millions of dollars of damage was done to African crops, said Mr Keith Cressman, FAO locust reporting and forecasting officer.</p>

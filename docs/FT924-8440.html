			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Major optimistic on Gatt outcome A NEW agreement on the further liberalisation of world trade should be concluded 'in a matter of weeks at the outside,' Mr John Major, the prime minister, told the Commons yesterday. He reaffirmed that as holder of the presidency of the European Community, Britain was pressing for the early re-opening of the Gatt (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) negotiations. Mr Major said he hoped the EC and the US would quickly resolve their farm trade dispute and the remaining aspects of the so-called Uruguay round ought to be speedily determined. In a clear reference to the difficulties caused by France he insisted that a Gatt agreement was the first priority for international economies and 'no persons, no single country should be permitted to stand in the way of it'. Sir Peter Hordern, Tory MP for Horsham, urged the prime minister to ensure that the drive for an agreement was not frustrated by Mr Mitterrand, the French president, or Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. The prime minister acknowledged that the consequences of failure to conclude a new Gatt round were 'too profound to contemplate'. He stressed: 'I cannot myself accept that it is impossible to reach an agreement that will be acceptable to the EC and the US, and that the moment agreement is reached the Gatt round can be concluded in Geneva without further delay'. The prime minister refused to be drawn on whether an increase in national insurance contributions will feature in the Autumn Statement. Mr Tom Cox, Labour MP for Tooting, said such an increase would be 'another broken election promise from an already totally disgraced and devalued prime minister'.</p>

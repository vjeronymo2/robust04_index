			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Observer: Underground A missing piece has been returned to the French corporate chess-board. Francis Lorentz, hero of many battles at state-owned computer- maker Bull, has found a new job. Now 50, the tenacious mountaineering Alsatian has been chosen as the boss of the RATP, the troubled Parisian metro network. Six months ago, Lorentz was booted out of loss-making Bull after having clashed with former Prime Minister Edith Cresson over whether to allow the Japanese electronics group NEC to take a minority stake in Bull. Although he won the NEC battle, it made him enemies in the public administration and scarcely strengthened his job security. It's as well that Lorentz likes a challenge because that is precisely what he will get at the RATP, not least in negotiations over metro drivers' working conditions. They were the bone of contention behind last month's resignation of ex-chairman Christian Blanc, after drivers' strikes forced millions of Parisians to walk home through spectacular traffic jams.</p>

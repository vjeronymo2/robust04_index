			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A small bomb shattered the window of a York, England, bookstore owned by the  publisher of Salman Rushdie's controversial novel "The Satanic Verses," and  bombs were found at three of the publisher's stores in other towns, police  said. The bomb at the Viking Penguin bookstore in the northern city of York  caused no injuries and only slight damage. Police said that bombs at  Peterborough, in central England, and Guildford, in the south, were defused.  Another, in the Midlands city of Nottingham, was blown up by army bomb disposal  experts after the area around the shop was evacuated. Muslims around the world  have accused Rusdhie of blaspheming Islam in the book, and Iran has called for  his death.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Li Zhiming (2621 1807 2494): "Comrade Shi </F> Wanpeng (4258 8001 7720) Talks About the Current Economic  Situation and Key Points of Work"]    [Text] Recently, the  State Economic and Trade Commission's Deputy Chairman Comrade  Shi Wanpeng was visited and interviewed by this publication and  talked about the current economic situation.    Shi Wanpeng believes that in 1993 the overall movement of  the  economy was in a good direction, and this was primarily  manifested in the following:    Industrial production grew rapidly. In 1993 for the country  as a whole the village level and above village level total  industrial output value was 3.5074 trillion yuan, an increase of  23.6 percent in comparison to the previous year, was greatest  increase in the 15-year period since reform and opening. Of this  total, the increase for state-owned industry was 8.9 percent,  light industry increased 22.3 percent, and heavy industry was up  24.8 percent. In addition, there was a new increase in  production of a set of major industrial products related to the  national economy and the people's livelihood.    Industrial product sales were brisk, and the production and  marketing rate increased. For the year as a whole, the  industrial product marketing rate reached 96.4 percent, an  increase of 0.9 percent over the previous year. The industrial  product marketing rate from November on showed a marked  acceleration, and in December the production and marketing rate  reached 109.86 percent.    Urban and rural markets were thriving and active. For the  year as a whole, the total retail value of commodities in the  society increased by 23.6 percent, and in December the increase  was 35.3 percent. Rural markets rose relatively quickly, and the  difference in the expansion of rural and urban markets for the  first half of the year of 10.4 percent dropped for the year as a  whole to 6.4 percent.    The situation involving a shortage of enterprise funds was  ameliorated. From September 1993 on, the industrial operating  funds and loans showed a marked increase. From September to  December the total new increase in industrial operating funds  and loans reached 97.5 billion yuan, while for the whole year  the new increases in the industrial operating funds and loans  reached 139.8 billion yuan.    Grain market prices have basically been controlled. At the  end of last year, a situation of price rises emerged in some  areas in the grain market. The State Council in a timely manner  took measures involving the utilization of state grain reserves  to stabilize prices, and at present grain market prices have  basically been controlled.    In talking about the trends of current economic movement,  Comrade Shi believes that due to some new conditions that have  emerged since last November, the current economic environment is  not hospitable. This is primarily manifested in:    The market price situation is grim, though trends for  reversing this are gaining strength. In 1993, the retail price  inflation in the society as a whole from March on doubled, and  for the year as a whole was predicted to increase roughly 13  percent. City and rural prices had the same level of increase,  and the rural price expansion for the year as a whole was  predicted to reached 12.5 percent; household living expense  price expansion reached 14.5 percent, among which for 35 big  cities the increase reached 19.6 percent.    The scale of fixed capital investment was too large, and had  an irrational structure. In 1993, fixed capital investment was  able to reach 1.2 trillion yuan, of which state-owned units  investment increased more than 60 percent; the total scale of  investment involving projects under construction totalled 3.3  trillion yuan, a four fold increased over the previous year, and  the proportion of closing year end unfinished projects reached  57.6 percent. The investment structure was not rational to a  great extent, and the proportion of investment in basic industry  dropped from the first half of the year, at 42.9 percent, down  to 36.9 percent, while the proportion of extended investment  increased from 34.1 percent to 38.6 percent, there was a high  level of consumption, and a great number of leading consumption  projects.    Industrial production for December of last year increased at  an above normal rate. That month, the national village and above  village level industrial production from the high base level of  32.2 percent of the same month the previous year increased by  29.8 percent, or the second highest rate of growth after the  30.2 percent increase of June, while the monthly chain index  increase reached 18.2 percent, a more than 10 percentage point  increase over the normal annual increase. This above normal  increase could give new life to the contradiction of the  shortage of funds.    Increases in mutual arrears among enterprises. According to  Industrial Bank statistics for 40,000 enterprises, at the end of  November 1993, debt owed funds were 341.2 billion yuan, an  increase from earlier in the year of 178.7 billion yuan; while  credit funds were 289.8 billion yuan, an increase of 70.5  billion yuan from early in the year.    The import of some major commodities exceeds planning by a  considerable degree. Among the most prominent of these are steel  products, and petroleum products, while car imports also exceed  planned targets by a substantial margin.    Rail transport is still constrained. In 1993, the volume of  goods transported by railroad was 1.567 billion tons, only a 2.9  increase from the previous year. In 1994, the shortage situation  for the volume of goods transported by rail will not markedly  improve, particularly due to the spring transport time delays,  which will have a major impact on the transport of goods by rail.    When it comes to the new situation currently emerging for  the  movement of the economy, Comrade Shi believes that it is  necessary to treat controlling the scale of fixed capital  investment and price increases as the major tasks to grapple  with, and continue to strengthen and improve macro adjustment,  while steadily realizing an increase in the people's economy in  the process of readjustment.    1. Strengthen guidance towards citizens' psychological  expectations and social consumption. It is necessary to  gradually deepen dissemination of the contents of reforms  dealing with foreign currency and the tax system, and strengthen  guidance of the media, actively launch some directed propaganda,  to increase the understanding of reform of enterprises and broad  numbers of people, remove doubts, and avoid blind action.    2. Strict control and active guidance of fixed capital  investments. When it comes to investment it is necessary to  strictly achieve planning sufficient funding, and not leave  gaps. First, there is strict control of new launching of  construction projects; second, this involves not permitting the  use of operating funds for loans to make investments; third,  this involves the fact that new construction projects must plan  for a sufficient cushion in operating funds, and those that are  insufficient should not be permitted to start work; fourth, this  involves the need to devise a way to fill the gap in funds for  newly completed and operating projects in 1993-1994; fifth, this  involves directing investment and effectively guiding it towards  increasing the society's supply, and improving the production  structure. This is the key to having the new macro regulation  obtain new results.    3. In accordance with market conditions, at present it is  necessary to increase the national special reserves of products  such as grains, edible oils, meats, sugar, and cotton, and for  existing reserve stores to conduct an inventory and checks to  find out what resources are available, and make accounts of  materials tally up.    4. Strengthen management of the import and export of primary  commodities. It is necessary as rapidly as possible to  investigate and promote measures for increasing product exports,  and at the same time it is necessary to properly handle import  regulations for major commodities and goods and materials, such  as steel products, oil, and cars.    5. Serious financial policies and strengthening of financial  management. When it comes to the issue of mutual debt between  enterprises, it is recommended that some provinces and cities or  industry be chosen for deepening of investigation and finding  out about the situation, and researching methods for resolving  issues, and preventing the recurrence of prolonged debt.    Comrade Shi Wanpeng stressed that this year is a year when  the degree of strength of the implementation of various reform  measures will be comparatively large, and properly handling the  immediate macro regulation, improving the production structure,  and increasing the society's effective supply are the key to  smoothly implementing the policy of "grasping opportunity,  deepening reform, promoting development, and maintaining  stability," and should draw the sufficient attention of  government at all levels and of responsible economic departments.    At the conclusion of the interview, Comrade Shi expressed  his  hope that the "Economic Work Newsletter" would progressively  develop its characteristics such as its broad readership, large  volume of policy information, and its high level of  authoritativeness, while properly handling its propaganda work  in the economic field, truly becoming an intimate friend of  enterprises and responsible economic departments at all levels.</p>

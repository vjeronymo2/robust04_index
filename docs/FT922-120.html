			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Hopewell Holdings issues covered warrants MR GORDON WU, the principal shareholder of Hopewell Holdings, the Hong Kong property and infrastructure developer, has issued covered warrants over nearly 9.5 per cent of the company to relieve his personal debts. The warrants, over 400m Hopewell shares, were issued at a strike price of HKDollars 1.50 and initially raised Dollars HK578m (USDollars 74.76m). They can be converted for either shares or cash at HKDollars 5.8 after two years. The warrants have been placed with institutions. Hopewell shares ended the day at HKDollars 5.60. Smart Best, a personal company of Mr Wu, said proceeds of the warrants will be used to reduce Mr Wu's personal borrowings arising from him subscribing to a one-for-one rights issue in June last year. That raised Dollars HK5.5bn of which Mr Wu personally funded 47 per cent. Since then his personal control of Hopewell has fallen to 43 per cent following the issue of 400m shares to investors in May which raised HKDollars 2bn. If the warrants are exercised Mr Wu will receive an additional Dollars HK2.3bn, but would see his control of the company fall to 33.5 per cent.</p>

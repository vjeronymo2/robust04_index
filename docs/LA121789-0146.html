I'd like to pass on a few.  </P> <P> Did you know that most decals and stickers on windows can be removed by putting  vinegar on them? Paint a few coats on, let soak for a few minutes and the  stickers will wash off easily.  </P> <P> My husband's lunch box started getting a terrible odor, so I dampened a piece  of bread with vinegar and put it in the lunch box overnight. I washed it the  next morning and was surprised to see how fresh-smelling it was.  </P> <P> One more thing I did with vinegar was remove new deodorant stains from my  husband's shirts. All I did was rub the area before washing them. I'm so happy  with it I always keep a gallon handy.  </P> <P>  -- M. B., Rochester, N.Y.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: I have a shelf full of cookbooks and always had a tough time  remembering which one contained that scrumptious recipe I discovered six months  ago. Now I have an address book on the shelf with my cookbooks and use it as a  directory. I list my favorite recipes in alphabetical order and note the name  of the cookbook it's in and the page number.  </P> <P>  -- BEVERLY, Dallas  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Your hints have saved me lots of money and now I'd like to share  one. When your celery gets wilted and limp, don't throw it away. Just put the  stalks in cold water and they will crisp up again. Use right away or keep in  the fridge for a day or two.  </P> <P> If there's too much to use this way, don't throw it out. Dice it up and cook it  in a little water until it's just tender. Cool, divide it into small amounts  and freeze. It's great to have on hand for soups and casseroles.  </P> <P>  -- HAZEL, Aberdeen, S.D.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: We keep a magnetic note pad on the refrigerator. The pads with  the magnet attached are very expensive, so after buying one I pulled the magnet  off the cardboard and glued it on a regular note pad. I've now used the same  magnet for over a year and saved quite a few pennies.  </P> <P>  -- LIZ, Ohio  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: Pot holders sure get dirty quickly in my home. It seems they are  always in the washing machine.  </P> <P> A friend suggested the following to me. When taking the pot holders out of the  dryer, spray them liberally with a fabric protector and then use them. They  stay cleaner a lot longer.  </P> <P>  -- BETSY, Las Vegas  </P></p>

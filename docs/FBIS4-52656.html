			<p>BFN     [Text] A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry answered  a question put by KCNA reporter on 11 May on the U.S. efforts to  force the Arab countries to lift their economic sanctions  against Israel. His answers are as follows:    Making frequent visits to Mideast countries in late April  and  early May, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher put  pressure on Arab countries to withdraw their economic sanctions  against Israel.    However, a number of Arab countries are expressing their  opposition and discontent [pulman] by maintaining the position  of not withdrawing sanctions until the issues concerning the  Mideast are comprehensively resolved.    We cannot but wonder about the United States' actions of  trying to lift sanctions against Israel. It is no secret that  Israel possesses nuclear weapons. The United States is trying  to get economic sanctions on Israel, which threatens peace in  the Middle East with nuclear weapons, lifted. However, the  United States is blaring that sanctions will be taken against  our country which has no nuclear weapons in actuality. This is  a reversal of logic and an undisguised application of a double  standard in international relations.    This contradictory act [mosunjogin haengwi] of the United  States makes it plain that the nuclear issue over which it is  raising a hue and cry is a fictitious invention for the sinister  political aim of isolating and crushing [korip apsal haryonun]  our republic.    The United States must not apply a double standard to the  solution of international issues including the nuclear issue.    The world people should approach the unjust act of the  United  States which is trying to impose its unilateral assertion on  others, ignoring the stand of the parties concerned, and styling  itself as international policemen with high vigilance .</p>

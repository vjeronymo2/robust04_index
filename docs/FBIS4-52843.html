			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [By former Transportation Minister Shigeru Ito] </F>   [Text] Half a year has passed since I assumed duties as  minister in charge of transportation administration and I have  finally acquired a vague glimpse of a portion of my  responsibilities. As is widely known, the Ministry of Transport  is the largest licensing agency, handling 1,966 of the 11,000  licensing functions administered by the government. Recently,  this licensing authority has suddenly become the target of  criticism for its abusive nature and, in reality, is the subject  of a variety of problems.    "Conversion to a policy agency" is the earnest desire of the  Ministry of Transport, but adequate debate has not taken place  on how to implement such a change. The numerous licensing  functions symbolize the significance of bureaucratic ties to  industry and conversion to a policy agency involves the question  of how to relax direct and specific controls over industry and  convert to a system of indirect supervision.    Today, the Ministry of Transport has arrived at a juncture  where it must study methods of actively proposing policies and  regulations from a fresh perspective with a view to promoting  the internationalization and integration of Japan's  transportation systems, while nurturing the growth of the  recreation industry so that it is responsive to the needs of the  public. However, more than just a few aspects of today's  transportation administration obstruct the growth of industries  over which it exercises jurisdiction. The Ministry of Transport  has no future as long as it remains protective about the  benefits realized by the ministry in terms of such aspects. Now  is the time that specific proposals must be developed in terms  of what is necessary and what is not necessary for the growth of  traffic and transportation in Japan.  <H5>  Transportation Administration Reaches Stalemate </H5>   I believe this particular weakness is common to a varying  degree among other ministries and agencies, but the foundation  for today's administration, formed immediately following the end  of World War II, was designed primarily for addressing domestic  issues and must be categorized as being weak in handling today's  international issues. Transportation administration is not  compatible with today's transportation industry services  deployed on an international level, because government  administration was designed to address issues of protection and  guidance of the transportation industry in the domestic  environment. And, despite the fact that vertical administrative  services go beyond the framework of the past, I believe that the  absence of decisions concerning ministerial and agency handling  of such vast new areas has caused delays in administrative  responses to new problems.    Now, the question is, what are the basic issues which must  be  dealt with in the area of transportation administration? First,  greater efficiency and economies in Japan's transportation  industry must be attained by converting the current land, sea  and air traffic net into a three-way system of cooperative  relationships. Second, we must take positive measures responsive  to the issues of providing services on an international scale  and attain growth in the overall transportation system in Japan  with airlines playing a key role. And, third, we must evaluate  the new role to be played by tourism and recreation which serve  as a basis for bringing genuine affluence into the lifestyles of  Japan and the Japanese, relax regulations which pose obstacles  to such change and actively implement partial alliances with  other interested ministries and agencies and launch new  administrative services. In this article, I would like to engage  in a special discussion of the aviation issue.  <H5>  Construction of Regional Airports Completed </H5>   The aviation issue also entails international and domestic  issues. Japan lags in the handling of such issues. Specifically,  it has failed to fully address the issue of planning for  international hub airports.    Currently, air passengers in Japan total about 135 million a  year, of which 34.49 million are international passengers. It is  obvious that domestic passengers are large in number, but the  growth rate in international passengers is high and  international routes are expanding annually.    Airport administration in Japan in the past was focused  primarily on construction and maintenance of domestic airports.  This was because, after all, airplanes provide the best means of  traveling long distances, and a strong desire was expressed for  the establishment of airports in each prefecture. Airports are  essential to isolated islands and remote areas. And, efforts by  governors and elected politicians have resulted in the  construction of airports in almost all prefectures. Prefectures  without airports are currently limited to those surrounding  major metropolitan areas such as Kanagawa, Saitama, Gunma,  Yamanashi, Shizuoka, Mie, Gifu, Kyoto, and Shiga, because they  are located near international airports in nearby urban areas. I  believe we can say that domestic airports have been developed to  an essential level.    Currently, about 500 scheduled overseas flights are flown  out  of the 17 international airports located in Japan. There is no  need to mention that such international flights will increase in  the future. Of those international flights, 95 overseas cities  are covered by flights operating in and out of Narita and 107  overseas cities are covered by flights operating in and out of  Osaka and Nagoya. Currently, 63 percent of passengers destined  for overseas flights depart from Narita.  <H5>  60 Percent of Travelers Fly Via Seoul </H5>   However, the problem is that connections between Narita and  Japanese domestic airports are extremely bad. Presently,  connecting flights to domestic airports out of Narita are  limited to 12 daily. Because of this factor, many travelers must  spend two hours lugging their heavy baggage to move to Haneda  for connecting flights to their domestic destinations. This  situation has caused about 60 percent of travelers going to  overseas destinations from western Japan to depart via Seoul.  This situation, in turn, is a reflection of the fact that, of  the 17 international airports in Japan, all except Nagasaki have  scheduled connecting flights with Seoul and such flights now  total 49. If Seoul is used as a connecting point, transfers are  simple and enable use of air transportation to overseas areas  directly from an airport near one's residence. Narita is being  disregarded by the Japanese public itself.    Further, another crisis is approaching in the form of a  national effort by South Korea to build a huge international hub  airport on the outskirts of Seoul.    The project envisions the construction of a major airport  with a four-lane, 4,000-meter runway and 2,500-meter auxiliary  runway to provide for connections between long- and  short-distance international flights and domestic flights for  the convenience of travelers, increase the utilization rate of  aircraft, reduce costs and energy consumption, and contribute to  improvement of environmental factors, thus enabling South Korea  to successfully address the issue of modernization of the  aviation industry.    Logically, the international hub airport will be welcomed by  aviation firms and passengers alike. As already mentioned in  this article, in actuality, an international aviation network  has been established with Western Japan via the Seoul airport.    International carriers are currently engaged in fierce  competition. The three Japanese airlines are unprofitable at the  present time and U.S. and European firms are all facing  difficulties with only a few exceptions. International airlines  are desperately undertaking restructurings and reengineerings.  They are taking rapid action on measures such as reductions in  international routes, efficient use of aircraft, joint use of  maintenance facilities, energy conservation, reduction and  internationalization of flight crews, and curtailment of fringe  services.    Increases in international passengers or increased  popularity  of international flights has been accompanied by a logical  welcoming of lower passenger tariffs. Recently, we have  witnessed spreading acceptance of the concept that low fares are  the most valuable service extended to air travelers.    A common desire of airlines and international travelers is  the ability to use "international hub airports." As an example,  the concept would call for all U.S. airlines destined for Asia  to concentrate at Seoul and for flights beyond Seoul to be  handled by connecting Korean Airlines flights to airports in  other Asian countries. In reverse, the concept would provide for  concentration of passengers from Asian countries at Seoul,  movement to a U.S. hub airport and further travel to U.S.  destinations aboard domestic air carriers.    Moreover, this concept is already being launched with the  participation of Korean Airlines, United Airlines, and Aeroflot.  The future will probably witness the implementation of a variety  of programs by international air carriers. Present projections  indicate that the international hub concept will improve  aircraft use by 40 percent, enable a significant reduction in  fares, and improve the financial performance of air carriers.    Needless to say, South Korea will control the rights to use  Seoul Airport and will limit its use by Japanese airlines. That  will threaten the viability of Japanese airlines and may result  in the situation where "passenger airlines carrying the `sun'  symbol will disappear from Japanese skies."  <H5>  Issue of Grave Concern to Japan's Future </H5>   There is little political will to build an international hub  airport in Japan and, if the situation remains unchanged, Japan  will deprived of a key role in international aviation. Japan  faces options that will determine whether it can survive in the  international aviation industry.    Japan urgently needs to build an international hub airport  exceeding the scale of that planned for South Korea. I say  urgent because Seoul is proceeding with a plan which it intends  to implement beginning in 1997. And, aside from South Korea,  Beijing, Hong Kong, and Singapore are building major  international airports with a view to making them hubs for Asia.  This means that Japan lags behind all of these competing  concepts.    The issue of international airports is not restricted to a  question of what should be done in the area of aviation  administration. It is a major issue which will determine Japan's  future. Ours is an "information age" and if Japan should be  excluded from the principal international air routes, it will  mean that Japan will be excluded from progress in the  development of international information systems. Moreover, Asia  is an economic growth region commanding the attention of the  world. Lack of a hub airport will mean that the center of Asian  information systems will be located in a country other than  Japan. This issue is very important in terms of Japan's future.    In view of the foregoing discussion, Japan's policy of  emphasing regional airports is an anachronism. We have arrived  at a point where Japan's Transport Ministry bureaucrats must  shift course and place highest priority on the conduct of a  study to determine where the aviation industry should focus on  this age of internationalization.  <H5>  Conversion to a Bold Aviation Policy </H5>   Two new issues await evaluation. First, we must embark on  the  construction of an international hub airport. Second, the  project should be implemented with government funding. If the  situation is neglected, Japan will not be able to participate in  the progress occurring in terms of internationalization. Since  the movement of people and the flow of information move in  tandem, we must devise ways in which Japan serves as the center  of people movement.    The reason why airport construction fails to make progress  in  Japan is attributable to the very high land prices. Construction  costs are also high. It is difficult to acquire existing land  necessary for airports, and reclamation of tidal basins for  airport construction involves development costs. Even if an  airport is built, we must face noise pollution and social issues  associated with concentrations of people. Further, operation of  an international hub airport precludes the suspension of night  flights.    Further, one condition that must be satisfied relative to  international hub airports is the enhancement of provisions for  concentration of information systems. Accordingly, there is a  need to build a major airport near principal urban centers,  especially Tokyo. Recent proposals made by the Tokyo Chamber of  Commerce and Industry refer to such a concept. However, Tokyo  lacks surplus land that can be used for such a purpose. We can  visualize futuristic concepts such as building runways in Chiba  Prefecture and moving aircraft to Haneda via underwater tunnels,  but in terms of infrastructure and using existing services, we  should seek a viable concept in locating the airport near  Haneda, Yokohama, or Kawasaki in Tokyo Bay. Residents of Tokyo,  Kanagawa Prefecture, Kawasaki City, and Ota ward will probably  take issue with any such location, but it is indispensable that  a major international hub airport be built at an early date to  provide for Japan's future.    Needless to say, many issues await resolution. The air zone  issue is one of them. We now face the need to readjust flight  patterns in air zones around Tokyo with the U.S. Air Force and  the Self-Defense Forces. However, now that the confrontation  between East and West has been dissolved, this issue should be  relatively easy to solve. The noise pollution issue can probably  be resolved by building runways on reclaimed land located some  distance from the existing shores. Recently manufactured jumbo  passenger planes have engines that produce less noise, and those  with noisy engines can be subject to restrictions on night  flights. Access to the airport via freeways and railways in the  case of Haneda or Kawasaki can be placed underground. We will be  faced with the need to modify navigation routes for ships, but I  believe such modifications can be minimized. Moreover, a concept  linking Haneda and Kawasaki for use by international and  domestic flights to provide for an integrated international hub  airport would produce efficiencies that defy the imagination.    Such a concept would enable Tokyo to become a base for  linking the world and Asia in name and reality. Having  conceptualized a hub airport, the full-scale airport should  include a major four-lane runway and an auxiliary runway. The  airport can be considered for use as a base for operating the  information highway, to connect with new JR [Japan Railways]  trunk lines leading to various parts of Japan and for  development into a concept visualizing the development of a  comprehensive transportation and information center.  Fortunately, there is a new trunk line operations center near  Haneda which should facilitate linkage of Haneda and the new  trunk line.    Narita can be considered for use as a major base in handling  rapidly increasing local air flights and air movement of  high-technology products. Needless to say, Narita was plagued  with a long history of difficulties associated with its  construction and the Ministry of Transport's emotional ties  thereto can be understood, but if conversion of Narita to a hub  airport is difficult, it would be in the best interests of the  country to undergo a bold conversion of concepts and to  establish a new approach. In reality, Narita is in a remote  location and in this age when international travelers have  increased, use of Narita as an international airport translates  into a waste of time and resources of a magnitude that should  not be disregarded by Japan as a nation.  <H5>  Major Airport as a National Project </H5>   Another issue is that Japan should take up the airport issue  as a national project. Under the current "Special Program for  Airport Construction" system, the construction and maintenance  of airports are almost entirely treated as a cost to be  shouldered by airport users. The principle of user liability can  be allowed. The reason is that we should not provide for special  treatment of the aviation industry.    However, Japan's international airport landing and take-off  fees are excessively high on an international comparison basis  as they reflect the high land and construction costs. The fees  are becoming unbearable for air line companies, while most of  the high fees are shouldered by the passengers and translate  into higher fares for flights departing from Japan.    Some time ago, only a segment of the population used air  line  services. However, if we think of today's usage running at the  rate of 130 million individuals a year, I believe we should  alter the current accounting system that focuses on increasing  passenger fees to one which envisions the use of government  funds for the construction of airports. I believe we can treat  the construction of international hub airports as an exception  to provide such government funding. This is an issue which  should enjoy serious consideration by the government and  resolution through a high-level political decisions.  <H5>  Reduction in Landing Fees </H5>   Further, referring to landing fees, we must admit that  Japan's airport landing fees are the highest in the world. In  comparison to Haneda's 840,000 yen, fees at foreign airports  include 150,000 yen for New York's Kennedy Airport, 40,000 yen  for Los Angeles, 250,000 yen for Seoul, 520,000 yen for  Frankfurt (the highest in Europe), and only 90,000 yen for  London's Heathrow Airport. These conditions have imposed  difficulties on the operation of Japan's airlines and are one  cause for increasing costs for travelers. The take-off and  landing fees for the new Kansai Airport are also high and will  exceed 900,000 yen. Therefore, it is only a matter of time  before international airlines, which want to abandon Japan,  will, for example, leave Japan when the new international  airport in South Korea is completed.    The high take-off and landing fees have already become an  international issue. For example, there is a strong possibility  that this issue will be presented in the Japan-U.S. talks as an  item of economic friction. If the center of international air  routes shifts to another country, Japan will be the one to lose  out. This is why we must confront the problem directly as a  long-term strategic issue rather than as a matter of near-term  interests.    Now that internationalization has progressed to this point,  Japan should devote more government funds to the operation of  airports. Since the high take-off and landing fees are already  pose a major cost, if adequate repayment prospects can be  identified, provisional measures can be made to divert fiscal  investment and loan program funds and reduce landing fees to  levels used at Seoul Airport. I believe we have reached a stage  where government can cover certain aviation costs with public  funds or fiscal investment and loan program funds if air fares  are reduced about 10 percent. At a time when licensing fees are  being hiked across the board, if a policy reversal can lead to  lower fares in aviation, they may have a beneficial impact on  other public utility rates and inspire the initiation of  widespread rate cuts.    Presently, the aviation industry is most advanced in the  United States. The growth of the U.S. aviation industry can be  attributed to conditions which favored the growth of aviation  such as the availability of spacious lands enabling the  construction of airports and the spread of urban growth in  numerous regions throughout the country. However, there were  other reasons including the implementation of aviation  administration reform through deregulation of route and fare  structures in 1978. Such conditions led to aggressive management  efforts to include new airlines entering the market, routes  being established on an unregulated basis and cost reductions.  One of the basic reasons for the effectiveness of such  developments was that airports throughout the country had plenty  of extra capacity.    Even in Japan the construction of regional airports  exclusive  of international hub airports has been completed. The remaining  tasks include a fundamental change in aviation policies,  enhancement of the political status of aviation administration  and the establishment of a new integrated aviation  administration for the age of internationalization.</p>

			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. REPARATIONS TOO LATE FOR MANY INTERNEES  </P> <P> Forty-seven years ago, Edna Uraguchi was a housewife in Los Angeles. Then  suddenly, Army officers took her to a camp called Gila River in Arizona, and  she became a statistic -- one of 120,000 Americans of Japanese ancestry  interned during World War II.  </P> <P> Sunday, Uraguchi, now 76 and a retired barber, was one of 400 attending the  annual Day of Remembrance for those who were incarcerated.  </P> <P> This might have been a celebration of sorts, since former President Ronald  Reagan had signed a law last August for redress in the form of $20,000 payments  to those interned and a formal apology.  </P> <P> Instead, Uraguchi and others attending the event at Los Angeles Trade Technical  College in downtown Los Angeles said they felt frustration. The federal  government is not moving fast enough to implement reparations, they said, and  given the age of many of the internees, time is running out.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Many Have Died  </P> <P> About 1,200 of the estimated 60,000 surviving internees have died since the law  was signed, according to Robert Bratt, director of the Office of Redress  Administration in the U.S. Department of Justice, and one of the speakers  Sunday.  </P> <P> "Everybody says, 'Oh, you're going to get all that money,' " Uraguchi said.  "But I don't know if I'll be here that long."  </P> <P> So far President Bush has not made specific recommendations on the payments in  his budget proposal, Bratt said.  </P> <P> In his final budget, Reagan had requested an initial payment of $20 million --  enough to pay only 1,000 people -- to begin Oct. 1, 1989. Reagan did not ask  for funds to start making payments during this fiscal year, which runs up to  Sept. 30.  </P> <P> "We believe there is going to be no difference" between the Bush and Reagan  requests, Bratt said.  </P> <P> Former internees said the money -- a total of $1.2 billion to be paid out over  a 10-year period -- should come faster.  </P> <P> "A wrong has been recognized, but it has not been redressed," said Alan Nishio,  co-chair of the California-based National Coalition for Redress/Reparations,  the organizers of Sunday's program.  </P> <P> "It will not be redressed until those who have been wronged are compensated,"  added Nishio, a 43-year-old college administrator who was born at the Manzanar  internment camp in California's Owens Valley.  </P> <P> "The first generation are all in their 80s, 90s or even 100s," said Frank Emi,  a 70-year-old retired postal worker who was interned as a young man at a camp  called Heart Mountain in Wyoming. "Half of them will be gone by next year."  </P> <P> Jim Saito, a 66-year-old Westside resident, who was incarcerated at a camp in  Colorado, said he was "bitter" and felt that without prompt payment, the  redress bill "is a bunch of rhetoric. . . ."  </P> <P> "Remember the old saying, justice delayed is justice denied," he said.  </P> <P> During a candlelight commemoration part of the program, organizers hung  placards containing the names of 300 former internees from Southern California  who had died recently. Sunday was also the 47th anniversary of President  Franklin D. Roosevelt's order to authorize internment of Americans of Japanese  ancestry.  </P> <P> Bratt, a speaker along with Assistant U.S. Atty. Gen. James Turner and Rep.  Robert Matsui (D-Sacramento), said his office has so far confirmed the  identities of 45,000 internees through Social Security, motor vehicle or tax  records. A search is under way for several thousand others, who are believed to  be living in Japan or Canada, he added.  </P></p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Telspec ahead of forecast with Pounds 3.4m Telspec, the Kent-based manufacturer of advanced electronic telecommunications equipment, yesterday reported higher-than-expected pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.41m for 1993. The figure, which compared with Pounds 3.36m for 1992 and a forecast of not less than Pounds 3.3m set out in the flotation prospectus, reflected strong growth for the company's products in the UK. As expected, earnings per share emerged at 8.28p (7.13p). There is no dividend, although the group has indicated its intention to pay an interim dividend for the six months to end-June. Telspec's shares, which were placed with institutional investors at 160p in December, closed 3p higher at 283p yesterday valuing the group at Pounds 88.8m. A decline in turnover to Pounds 17.6m (Pounds 18.2m) reflected the anticipated fall in sales by the group's Telspec Australia subsidiary to Telecom Australia. Telspec expected the economic recovery in Australia to lead to higher order levels this year. In December the group won a Pounds 7m contract to supply equipment to Deutsche Telekom. It has also entered into a joint venture agreement to manufacture its products in Slovakia and has won an initial Pounds 3.5m order from Slovak Telecom. Since flotation Telspec has significantly expanded its marketing efforts resulting in an expanded order book of Pounds 31m. However, the group cautioned that the market for its products remained competitive and that this was likely to lead to some pressure on margins in some product areas. Pre-tax profits for 1993 were boosted by net interest receipts of Pounds 44,000, against previous net interest costs of Pounds 109,000, and by Pounds 199,000 (Pounds 95,000) in government grants. Commenting on the results Mr Frank Hackett-Jones, chairman, said the successful flotation in December had marked a significant milestone, 'setting the stage for strong growth in years to come. 'Our international customer base has been successfully expanded and overall demand for Telspec's products has risen to record levels,' he said.</p>

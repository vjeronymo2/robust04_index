			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STRETCHING IT, JUST A BIT;  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND'S 600 LIMOUSINE FIRMS TAKE IT TO THE STREETS -- AND THE (LEGAL) LIMIT  -- IN PLEASING THE WHIMS OF CLIENTS.  </P> <P> They call the limousine trade a service business, which means that on any given  day a limousine driver may be asked to paint his car purple and cruise the city  dodging teen-agers who are trying to smooch his right fender.  </P> <P> That job was given to Fleetwood Limousine Ltd. a couple of years ago when pop  star Prince wanted to lease a limo for three months to publicize his "Purple  Rain" album. When fans couldn't get through the tinted windows to Prince, "they  figured kissing the car was the next best thing," says Alan Shanedling,  president of the Westwood firm.  </P> <P> Accommodating the wildest of whims is all in a day's work for the 600 or so  companies of Southern California's thriving limousine industry. To earn their  customary $35 to $60 a hour, drivers must transport their passengers, swaddle  them in luxury and fulfill whatever curious desires may seize them.  </P> <P> With its entertainment industry, weather and love of conspicuous  self-indulgence, Southern California has always been a hospitable environment  for the long sedan. But while it's an easy business to enter, operators say  it's also easy to go bust, particularly if you can't satisfy customers'  exacting demands for service.  </P> <P> And customers will ask for almost anything. A client of Afflair Wide Body  Limousine Service once showed up with a bearskin rug and an overflowing  champagne bucket and asked sheepishly whether the partition behind the  chauffeur would guarantee the passengers' privacy. The customer's plan, it  turned out, was to recreate a torrid love scene that took place in a limousine  in the movie "No Way Out."  </P> <P> "Basically, we'll do anything the customer asks, so long as it isn't illegal,"  says Jim Phillips, owner of the Brea company, who had no objection to what the  customer wanted.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Event Dictates Color  </P> <P> A driver for Dreams Unlimited Limousine Service in Los Alamitos was once paid  to propose marriage to a woman. On instructions from her fiance, the driver met  the woman at work, read a romantic poem of proposal and spirited her to the  airport, where she flew to San Francisco for an evening with her future  husband.  </P> <P> Another Dreams Unlimited customer paid to have a limousine carry her boyfriend  around Southern California on an elaborate treasure hunt. She kept the hunt  going for eight hours with a series of clues that led to destinations where the  boyfriend found gifts and other clues.  </P> <P> White may be the color of choice for limousines in Southern California, but  some occasions bring a run in requests for other colors. If the Dodgers are in  the playoffs or World Series, there will be a run on requests for royal blue  sedans; concerts by the rock group Pink Floyd inevitably bring a flurry of  orders for pink.  </P> <P> Most of the limousine operators' earnings come from ferrying customers to  airports, handling corporate traffic and special events. The most important of  those occasions are proms, weddings, bar mitzvahs and funerals.  </P> <P> The prom season is the biggest money maker for most small operators, a time  when some can jack up their rates to $125 an hour because demand far outstrips  the supply of cars. More typically, for an eight-passenger car an operator will  charge $65 an hour, with an eight-hour minimum and a required 15% tip.  </P> <P> But earning this premium fee requires hard work and much diplomacy. Drivers  often get caught in the middle between parents, who want the drivers to act as  chaperons, and the teens, who want them to look the other way as they go  drinking, hang out of the limo's sun roof and generally make the night as wild  as they have dreamed it would be.  </P> <P> While most teens follow the rules, operators tell horror stories of how  youthful high spirits brought them ripped seat covers, broken TVs, scratched  finishes and run-ins with the police. In popular prom-night cruising terrain,  such as Newport Beach, police set up roadway checkpoints to keep an eye on the  limousines and other traffic.  </P> <P> For the operator, "it's the best night of the year, and the worst night," said  Marshall Clayton, owner of Dreams Unlimited Limousines.  </P> <P> The one- and two-car operators who are often so dependent on prom night make up  most of the industry in Southern California. Only half a dozen limousine  companies in the area have more than 20 cars, estimates Fleetwood's Shanedling,  who is vice president of the Limousine Owners Assn. of Southern California.  </P> <P> The history of Clayton's business says a lot about the risks of the enterprise.  In the 4 1/2 years since he founded Dreams Unlimited, he has bought out small  limousine companies named Windsor, Caberet, Affluent and Unique.  </P> <P> "A lot of people get into the business thinking they can count on their friends  to give them business," Clayton said. "They find out all their friends want it  for free."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Expensive Overhead  </P> <P> The operators also quickly find out about the heavy expenses that they must  carry if they want to operate legally.  </P> <P> In addition to prices that now run about $40,000 to $60,000 for a new Lincoln  Town Car or Cadillac stretch limousine, insurance can cost $8,000 to $10,000  per car each year. Public Utilities Commission licensing fees run 0.75% of an  operator's gross.  </P> <P> "Put this stuff together, and it's a killer," said Harold Berkman, president of  Music Express of Burbank, which specializes in show business clientele.  </P> <P> More than one-third of operators simply don't pay those costs, a maneuver that  allows them to charge $4 to $8 less an hour than legal competitors, according  to Shanedling. Such "bandit" drivers are understandably a major gripe of legal  operators.  </P> <P> This year, Los Angeles City Attorney James K. Hahn, in a campaign against  illegal limousines, sued four companies for failing to have insurance and  licenses, and other violations. Three have agreed to pay fines to settle the  suits.  </P> <P> Also important for the business are the show business awards ceremonies,  including the Oscars, Emmys and Grammys. The Oscars, for example, provide an  evening's work for about 800 limousines; by comparison, President Bush's  inauguration fielded 150 limousines.  </P> <P> But these glamorous occasions are also a source of frustration for many small  operators, since the movie studios use their leverage as big customers to drive  down rates for the limos that will carry their biggest stars.  </P> <P> "My observation is, sometimes the biggest stars ride around in the crummiest  looking cars," sniffed operator Phillips.  </P></p>

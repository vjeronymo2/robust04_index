			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Man in the News: Survivor's techniques - Martin Sorrell Mr Martin Sorrell's continued tenure as chief executive of WPP Group, the marketing company, is seen by many in the industry as proof that there is life after death. If one refinancing in 1991, due to burgeoning debt, could be put down to bad luck, a second the following year must look like carelessness. In most other industries the price for avoiding receivership would have been the chief executive's head. Yet Mr Sorrell remained at the helm of WPP while it restructured its borrowings. And earlier this week he announced that half year pre-tax profits to the end of June had jumped from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 24.1m. While Mr Sorrell is the first to admit that WPP is not yet out of the woods  -it still has borrowings of about Pounds 350m - he can finally see light at the end of the tunnel. 'And thankfully,' he adds, 'there is no train coming the wrong way.' The 48-year-old entrepreneur has avoided the fate of others who allowed borrowings to get out of hand, partly because creative people are the main assets of an advertising agency. But his financial acumen, more than his talent as a copywriter, may have impressed the syndicate of 28 banks which helped keep his empire intact. Many in the US agencies Mr Sorrell controls loathe him for the fierce financial controls he has imposed, including salary cuts. His survival also owed much to what one friend described as 'the sheer brute force of his negotiating tactics, which wore the bankers down'. Those who negotiated with Mr Sorrell over the past few years describe him variously as 'determined', 'desperate to succeed' and 'infuriatingly obstinate'. According to Mr Sorrell he was 'no hired hand' that could just walk out when things got difficult. 'I had an enormous amount of emotional involvement; it was my baby and I wanted it to succeed.' Mr Sorrell says the bankers were 'sensible enough to understand that to dispose of businesses would not have helped cash flow in the long term'. As an only child, Mr Sorrell admits to being used to getting his own way. His father, who was chief executive of a radio electrical company, gave him a taste for business. He read economics at Cambridge and went to Harvard Business School. Part of his studying was to examine the case of Mr Mark McCormack, the US lawyer who managed the affairs of sports stars and celebrities. Not content with studying him, Mr Sorrell ensured that he met him in person. The two got on well, and after his first job working for Glendinning Associates of Connecticut, a small agency, Mr Sorrell was offered a job with Mr McCormack when he opened a London office in 1969. He moved into a London flat below that of Mr James Gulliver, then running Fine Fare, the supermarket group, and looking for a personal financial adviser. Mr Sorrell got the job and became one of the original shareholders when Mr Gulliver started James Gulliver Associates, which later became the Argyll Group. Mr Gulliver took a small stake in the advertising company which became Saatchi and Saatchi. Mr Sorrell found himself giving the Saatchi brothers corporate financial advice and by 1977 he became their group financial director. The Saatchis and Mr Gulliver had started from scratch and by 1985 Mr Sorrell was ready to emulate them. 'I began to have my male menopause at 40 and I decided it was time to do something on my own.' With about Pounds 200,000, half of which he borrowed, he bought an interest in a small engineering company called Wire and Plastic Products, which made wire baskets. The object was to gain control of a small quoted company that could be used as a vehicle for acquiring other businesses. In 1987, the famous New York-quoted advertising agency of J Walter Thompson was suffering a lack of strategic direction, losing money and big clients such as Burger King. WPP bought it for Dollars 525m (Pounds 354.7m). Two years later, in a contested bid, Mr Sorrell bought Ogilvy &amp; Mather for Dollars 864m. 'With hindsight we paid too much for Ogilvy &amp; Mather,' admits Mr Sorrell. By 1990, the advertising industry was going into recession and WPP's revenues began to fall. A year later, the company was refinanced but its difficulties mounted and WPP failed to make scheduled dividend payments. That triggered a legal clause giving full voting power to owners of preference shares who found themselves with 78 per cent of the company's voting rights - forcing a second refinancing. WPP's bankers do not disagree with Mr Sorrell's view that the deal proved satisfactory from their viewpoint. In the second refinancing the banks wrote off Dollars 275m of debt in exchange for 250m new shares, priced at an average 54p each. Yesterday the shares closed at 96p. If most of the banks have been placated the same cannot be said of all institutional shareholders. Some are angry that Mr Sorrell was given a five-year contract in 1989, which they regard as too long. Postel, the UK's largest pension fund, has written to Mr Gordon Stevens, WPP's chairman, to complain. Mr Sorrell says his terms and conditions were fixed at the behest of some US institutions and points out that he waived Pounds 111,000 of his Pounds 510,000 salary this year . At the same time, not all of WPP's investors are convinced that shareholder interests are best served in the long term by keeping the company together. WPP's recovery over the past year was based mainly on good performances from the group's US agencies. Revenues at J Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &amp; Mather rose by 6 per cent and 4 per cent respectively. Neither is represented on WPP's board, prompting the questions about whether the agencies should be run separately. Mr Sorrell says he is sure that keeping WPP's subsidiaries under a holding company has the effect of increasing total revenues. If WPP is to remain as one group, Mr Sorrell will have to prove that he can keep profits rising and convince his backers that his financial prowess remains indispensable.</p>

			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / A corporate titan forged from plastic: American Express's chief executive The impending resignation of Mr Jim Robinson as chief executive of American Express may come to be seen as yet another symbol of the almost fin de siecle atmosphere of post-1980s Wall Street. Few US corporate titans - and even fewer US companies - so symbolised the heady times of the last decade as did Mr Robinson and American Express. A mythology grew up around the socially ambitious Mr Robinson and his wife, a prominent public relations partner of one of President George Bush's former re-election campaign advisers. Both Mr Robinson and the company prospered mightily during most of the 1980s, as consumer spending rose steadily and the American Express card earned hefty fees as a prestige product. Mr Robinson in turn portrayed himself as a grand strategist who added to the group's traditional card and travellers cheque products an array of sister businesses that included stockbroking and investment banking (Shearson Lehman Hutton), private and commercial banking (Mr Edmond Safra's Trade Development Bank) and, for a time, even the cable television business (Warner Amex Cable). His deal-making included a failed attempt to acquire Walt Disney. American Express's diversification brought more problems than benefits and the group's fortunes remain more than ever tied to its core businesses. The cable television venture was sold in 1985, just before it became profitable. Shearson Lehman suffered large losses a couple of years ago and Mr Robinson forced out Mr Peter Cohen, the firm's chairman. And Mr Safra and American Express went through a costly divorce, culminating in a humbling 1989 apology by Mr Robinson when it emerged that American Express employees had engaged in a smear campaign against Mr Safra. More recently American Express has suffered conflicts with rebellious retailers and heavy losses in its Optima credit card business. Earlier this year Mr Robinson acknowledged the need to bolster capital and reduce staff. Some 6,500 employees have been made redundant in the 1991-92 period, with related restructuring charges totalling Dollars 607m (Pounds 390m). The last third-quarter results from the company showed a Dollars 205m loss. Perhaps the biggest problem Mr Robinson faced was that the American Express card used to be a high-priced product aimed at an affluent market. Now the card has lost much of its lustre and is facing stiff competition from banks and non-banks. Mr John Keefe, an analyst and veteran Robinson-watcher, yesterday summed up the problem: 'American Express succeeded and grew as a premium priced product, but by the end of the 1980s premium pricing was no longer what the market wanted. The market wanted value, not prestige. Yet American Express clung to its premium pricing and customers no longer wanted it.' A handful of books highly critical of Mr Robinson's management appeared earlier this year and the man once known as the 'Teflon' chairman found himself under fire on Wall Street. One American Express executive said recently that the company lost touch with the market. 'We became arrogant, insensitive and profoundly stuck in our ways, with a huge, inflexible bureaucracy that was very hard to move.' Yesterday, in an interview with the FT, Mr Robinson conceded that this description of American Express was accurate. 'I think it's an appropriate characterisation,' he said. He stressed that he had said as much in an unusually contrite letter to shareholders last March. In that letter he wrote: 'For years we were able to remain above the fray of credit card competition. But bank card issuers have turned their sights on our primary markets - the affluent households and travel and entertainment spenders.' Yesterday Mr Robinson denied strongly that he was being pushed out of his job and insisted he had never wished to serve more than 15 years as chief executive. He said he was keen to continue working on the group's recovery plans. He said he wished his 15-year tenure to be remembered as: 'Total quality management.' Unfortunately for Mr Robinson, that is not how most on Wall Street perceive his record. Although he is credited by some as a man of vision, most analysts feel that in retrospect Mr Robinson presided over an ad hoc series of opportunistic acquisitions that ultimately produced an unwieldy conglomerate. Its costs and capacity proved excessive once the boom years of the 1980s were replaced by the austerity of the 1990s. As for management, Mr Robinson broke with several top executives, including Mr Sandy Weill, who left as president in 1985 to take over as chairman of Primerica, the financial services group, and Mr Lou Gerstner, the talented president who left in 1989 to become chairman of RJR Nabisco. It was only in July 1991, after criticism from Wall Street that the president's post had been vacant for two years, that Mr Robinson named Mr Harvey Golub, his heir apparent, to the job. The truth is that Mr Robinson has become increasingly embattled at American Express in recent months. There is only one other top US financial executive whose tenure has been the subject of as much speculation - Mr John Reed, the chairman of Citicorp who appears now to be correcting that bank's problems by bolstering capital and cutting overheads. American Express has clearly been trying to change its culture, but few expect a speedy improvement in profitability. For the first nine months of 1992 net income was Dollars 380m, down from Dollars 551m in the same period of last year. Optima is not expected to return to the black before next year and competition in the card market has become tougher than ever. 'This is really another bill to be paid for the 1980s,' said Mr Keefe, commenting on Mr Robinson's plans to resign next year as chief executive. In a letter to American Express employees, Mr Robinson said yesterday he planned to spend more of his remaining time working on 'the next phase' at Shearson Lehman with Mr Howard Clark, the former American Express chief financial officer who was sent to Shearson as chairman in 1990. Many think that American Express may eventually seek to divest itself of Shearson Lehman, although Mr Robinson said in his letter that the goal was to bring the subsidiary to the point where it could improve its credit rating with a strong capital base. His letter to staff had the tone of a man looking backward, as he thanked the workforce 'for the tremendous effort so many of you have made during the past year'. Part of his personal objective, Mr Robinson wrote yesterday, 'is to ensure a smooth passing of the leadership baton as we move ahead'.</p>

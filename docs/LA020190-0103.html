			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> QUAKE-HAZARD BUILDINGS TARGETED;  </P> <P> SAFETY: COMMUNITIES HAVE LISTED STRUCTURES MOST AT RISK IN TEMBLORS. BUT OWNERS  ARE WORRYING ABOUT FINDING THE FUNDS TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS.  </P> <P> City building inspector Brent Miller has driven through Huntington Park's  shopping district hundreds of times, never noticing the danger.  </P> <P> It was not until he started compiling a list of unreinforced masonry buildings  for the state Seismic Safety Commission that he realized many of the businesses  in the bustling downtown area are "time bombs waiting to explode."  </P> <P> Freshly painted or stuccoed buildings that look new from the street reveal a  drastically different picture when inspected from the back alleys. Building  after building along Pacific Boulevard is constructed of brick held together by  60-year-old mortar.  </P> <P> "The bomb is ticking right now," Miller said to a visitor recently as he  pointed out a crack zigzagging up the back wall of a popular clothing store.  "All it needs is the right combination of explosives: A 5.0 or greater  earthquake and a busy shopping day."  </P> <P> Huntington Park has 120 unreinforced masonry buildings, more than any other  city in the area except Long Beach. The city of 50,000, founded in the early  1920s, has been lucky, somehow escaping serious damage in past temblors. But  who knows when its luck will run out.  </P> <P> The state Seismic Safety Commission does not want to take any more chances. On  Jan. 1, all cities in California were required under a 1986 state law to submit  a list of unreinforced commercial and residential dwellings with more than four  units. Communities also were required to prepare an ordinance that would make  buildings less dangerous in an earthquake.  </P> <P> All Southeast-Long Beach area cities, except for Bell, which claims it does not  have the staff to identify the hazardous buildings, complied with the state  law. Nearly 1,000 unreinforced masonry building were identified, 650 of them in  Long Beach alone.  </P> <P> Many cities in the area are refining their earthquake safety ordinances and  searching for ways to help building owners make costly improvements on the  hazardous structures, identified as the kind most likely to crumble in a  temblor.  </P> <P> During an earthquake, the mortar in an unreinforced masonry building turns to  dust. The roof and walls fall so quickly that people in or near the buildings  have little time to escape, Miller said. In a powerful quake, the bricks can  actually be catapulted across the street.  </P> <P> Strengthening brick buildings with steel bars and beams "buys time" in a  temblor, Miller said.  </P> <P> "It (retrofitting) is not necessarily going to save the building," Miller said.  "But it's going to give people about 20 minutes to get out."  </P> <P> Scores of unreinforced masonry buildings in the Uptown Whittier area cracked  and collapsed in the Oct. 1, 1987, temblor, which measured a magnitude of 5.9.  There were more than 60 unreinforced masonry buildings before the quake, city  officials estimate. Only 15 remain today. According to city officials, the main  reason no one in the Uptown area was crushed to death by falling debris is  because the temblor occurred at about 7:40 a.m., before businesses were open.  </P> <P> 'Almost Like Rubble'  </P> <P> Dick Stollenwerk, a Long Beach civil engineer, calls unreinforced buildings  "accidents waiting to happen."  </P> <P> "They are almost like a pile of rubble stacked in an orderly fashion,"  Stollenwerk said.  </P> <P> Many buildings in the Los Angeles area were made of unreinforced masonry at the  time of the Long Beach earthquake in 1933. After the deadly temblor, which  killed 115 people and caused about $40-million damage, building techniques were  quickly modified to include steel reinforcements. In cities established after  1933, unreinforced masonry buildings are prohibited.  </P> <P> Long Beach in 1971 was the first to adopt an ordinance requiring that all  structures built before 1934 and not constructed of wood be reinforced to  withstand earthquakes. In 1981, Los Angeles adopted a less stringent ordinance,  which requires all but single-family homes built of unreinforced masonry to be  upgraded.  </P> <P> Ed Hensley, a spokesman for the state Seismic Safety Commission, said of the  366 cities and counties affected by the state law, about 90 have given the  state an inventory of their unreinforced masonry buildings and adopted  mitigation programs to reduced earthquake hazards. Sixty-five other cities  reported that they have no unreinforced masonry buildings, Hensley said.  </P> <P> In the Southeast-Long Beach area, eight cities, including Huntington Park, have  adopted mitigation ordinances. Nine cities are exempt from establishing an  ordinance, because they do not have unreinforced masonry buildings.  </P> <P> The remaining seven cities, except for Bell, have told the state that they are  in the process of adopting mitigation programs. Pat West, the deputy city  manager in Paramount, said an independent consulting company is still trying to  identify the hazardous buildings.  </P> <P> John Bramble, the city manager of Bell, said his city simply cannot afford to  hire inspectors to find the hazardous buildings, a common argument in many of  the cities that have failed to comply with the state law.  </P> <P> "It's not cheap," Bramble said. "We've had so many changes in staff . . . and  have lost our building inspectors. Because of budget cuts we have not been able  to hire (new inspectors)."  </P> <P> Currently the state is trying to find a way to penalize cities and counties  that do not comply with the law. But right now the state Seismic Safety  Commission has no enforcement power. It is up to the cities to comply or not,  Hensley said.  </P> <P> Overall, few cities have blatantly "thumbed their noses" at the state, Hensley  said. Many of those that have missed the deadline have told the state Seismic  Safety Commission that they will meet the requirements, they just need more  time, he said.  </P> <P> Cities that have complied with the law are formulating earthquake safety  ordinances similar to those used in Los Angeles and Los Angeles County, Hensley  said.  </P> <P> The ordinances differ in the amount of time given owners to either upgrade or  demolish. For example, in Huntington Park, which passed its earthquake safety  ordinance in December, 1988, owners are given about four years to make the  required improvements. Several buildings have already been upgraded, and  improvements are starting on a few others, Miller said. In Whittier, city  officials are considering giving building owners up to seven years to make the  improvements. Los Angeles allows building owners about three years to comply  with the ordinance.  </P> <P> In most cases, if the improvements are not made, the buildings are closed or  torn down.  </P> <P> Bolts, Rods Used  </P> <P> Unreinforced buildings usually are strengthened by bolting the roof, walls and  floor together and running steal rods through the walls. The cost can range  from $15 to $20 per square foot.  </P> <P> Although the state has set aside money for residential improvements, few funds  are available for strengthening commercial structures. Most commercial building  owners will have to obtain loans at the market interest rates from their banks,  unless cities are able to find alternate funding.  </P> <P> In Whittier, several building owners who survived the Oct. 1, 1987, earthquake  said it might have been better if they had lost their buildings in the powerful  temblor, when low-interest federal loans and grants were available to rebuild.  </P> <P> "People are scared," one building owner in Whittier said recently. "We don't  want it (seismic retrofitting) to hurt too much."  </P> <P> Long Beach wants to purchase bonds, allowing building owners to borrow money at  a 30-year fixed-interest rate to take some of the sting out of financing the  improvements,  </P> <P> Some building owners in Long Beach are calling the city's proposal a "godsend."  </P> <P> "A lot of the buildings in the city are owned by senior citizens who can't get  loans (from banks) with their fixed incomes," said Jack Finkelstein, who owns  several buildings in the downtown area. "It (the bond issue) relieves the  burden."  </P> <P> Long Beach is the only city in the area that has come up with a financial  assistance package.  </P> <P> "It's a shame," said Gene Rosecrans, a banker who recently spoke at a meeting  of Huntington Park building owners. "There is just nothing available  financially to help these people."  </P> <P> Edwin Hayek, a Huntington Park building owner, said he is paying for $155,000  in improvements out of his own pocket.  </P> <P> "The city should offer low-percentage loans," Hayek said. "It would be nice,  especially since they are requiring this of us."  </P> <P> UNREINFORCED MASONRY BUILDINGS  </P> <P> City: Number  </P> <P> Artesia: 4  </P> <P> Bell *: n/a  </P> <P> Bell Gardens: 0  </P> <P> Bellflower: 50  </P> <P> Cerritos: 0  </P> <P> Commerce *: 9  </P> <P> Compton *: 18  </P> <P> Cudahy: 0  </P> <P> Downey *: 6  </P> <P> Hawaiian Gardens: 0  </P> <P> Huntington Park: 120  </P> <P> La Habra Heights: 0  </P> <P> La Mirada: 0  </P> <P> Lakewood: 0  </P> <P> Long Beach: 650  </P> <P> Lynwood *: 15  </P> <P> Maywood: 25  </P> <P> Montebello: 20  </P> <P> Norwalk: 12  </P> <P> Paramount *: n/a  </P> <P> Pico Rivera *: 7  </P> <P> Santa Fe Springs: 0  </P> <P> Signal Hill: 0  </P> <P> South Gate: 40  </P> <P> Whittier *: 15  </P> <P> Total: 991  </P> <P> *Cities that have not yet adopted an ordinance to reduce the hazards of  unreinforced masonry buildings.  </P> <P> Source: The state Seismic Safety Commission  </P> <P> </P> <P> AREA BUILDINGS NEEDING UPGRADE  </P> <P> There are nearly 1,000 unreinforced masonry buildings in the Southeast and Long  Beach areas, according to the state Seismic Safety Commission.

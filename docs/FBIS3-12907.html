The PLO had announced in a statement made by  President Yasir 'Arafat that there will be no return to the  negotiations before the Security Council issues a resolution  guaranteeing the Palestinian civilians' protection and the  disarming of the settlers.    Nasir al-Qudwah answered questions we posed to him during a  conversation conducted via satellite link tonight.    [Begin recording] [Al-Qudwah] As far we are concerned, we  are  doing our utmost to ensure that a Security Council resolution is  adopted as soon as possible. Later today there will be a  meeting of the representatives of the Arab group and the Islamic  group with the same aim, namely to ensure that the Security  Council acts swiftly to adopt a resolution. I still have no  information and therefore cannot be sure of the exact time when  this will happen. We hope it will occur very soon, if not today  then tomorrow, God willing.    ['Awn] Mr. al-Qudwah, the Palestinians are demanding that  the  Security Council adopt a resolution providing for the protection  of the Palestinians and disarming the settlers before the  negotiations are resumed, as Mr. 'Arafat declared. What are the  attitudes of the Security Council members to this Palestinian  demand?    [Al-Qudwah] True, this is part of the Palestinian demands  that we submitted at the start and to which we still totally  adhere. The Security Council members are generally supportive  of our demands, which they regard as just. Regrettably there  were disagreements from the start with the U.S. delegation. We  tried, however, through some hard negotiating last week, to find  solutions acceptable to both parties. We have had some success  but have not yet agreed on a final text.    ['Awn] Mr. al-Qudwah, Dr. Nabil Sha'th spoke of a tentative  U.S. approval of an international presence in the occupied  territories. Why is a resolution being delayed, then?    [Al-Qudwah] There are still some points on which we did not  reach agreement in our discussions with the U.S. delegation.  These points include Jerusalem's legal status as part of the  occupied Palestinian territory. This is a matter on which we  can make no concessions whatsoever. Another point is the  mechanism by which the implementation of the resolution will be  followed up. As for the issue of international protection, we  have succeeded in generally agreeing on the wording. In  accordance with this, the United States has agreed to an  international presence in the occupied Palestinian territories.  [end recording]    MBC Television posed a question to Israel's representative  at  the United Nations Gad Ya'aqobi about Israel's reasons for  hindering the adoption of a Security Council resolution on the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, particularly after it failed to  protect the worshipers.    [Begin Ya'aqobi recording] We strongly support the Security  Council meeting and a swift resolution because we believe that  this issue must be dealt with and finished with so that the  negotiations can be resumed and a decision made to implement the  two parties' agreements, including the Cairo Agreement. [end  recording]    Ya'aqobi affirmed that Israel does not oppose any steps to  protect the Palestinians, but he said he believes that the  quickest way to provide this protection is by resuming the  negotiations so that a Palestinian police force can be  established to carry out its tasks in cooperation with the  Israeli forces, as he put it. He repeated that Israel has  accepted the principle of an international presence in the  occupied territories and noted that this phrase will be included  in the resolution which the Security Council will issue. He  stated, however, that Israel will not agree to renegotiating the  Declaration of Principles and the Cairo agreement, warning that  this would only hinder the talks and obstruct the implementation  of the agreements.</p>

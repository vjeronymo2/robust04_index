			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Attack on business tax breaks: US labour secretary queries an estimated Dollars 111bn of subsidies Mr Robert Reich, the secretary of labour, yesterday called on the new conservative political majority in Congress to attack tax breaks for business and end 'corporate welfare as we know it'. Mr Reich suggested the savings from cutting direct assistance to companies could be used to help the economy create more high-wage American jobs. In a speech on economic and social policy which he stressed represented his personal perspective, Mr Reich ascribed Democratic losses in the mid-term elections to 'the revolt of the anxious middle class'. Other factors might have been in play, but 'never underestimate the political potency of a declining paycheck.' 'Better fiscal management,' he said, 'cannot reverse the long-term decline of America's middle class,' a comment which could be viewed as a criticism of the Clinton administration's emphasis to date on reducing the federal budget deficit. But Mr Reich was more the loyalist in his dissection of the current Republican agenda of deep tax cuts and the evisceration of the social safety nets. Noting that the deficits accumulated under the two previous Republican presidents now ate up 28 cents of every tax dollar, he urged: 'Let's not whip up another toxic economic potion - a pinch of Laffer, a dash of Darman, the eye of a Newt - that all of us will pay for in the morning.' Mr Reich argued that the administration's policies had moved in the right direction in the last 22 months but still only constituted 'a bare beginning.' Instead of incrementalism, 'let's accelerate the agenda of reform; streamline and consolidate the current clutter of adult education and job retraining programmes and pull the plug on those that don't work.' Warming to one of his familiar themes, but incorporating some Republican adages, Mr Reich said 'instead of feeding bureaucracies - federal and state  -let's channel resources directly into the pockets of ordinary Americans.' The Progressive Policy Institute, a moderate Democratic think-tank, had recently identified special tax breaks for particular industries and agriculture currently worth in excess of Dollars 111bn over a five-year period. He invited conservative institutions to provide 'their own examples of business subsidies that don't make sense.' 'Since we are committed to moving the disadvantaged from welfare to work, why not target corporate welfare as well and use the savings to help all Americans get better work?' Meanwhile more details of Republican proposals sharply to reduce individual welfare entitlements continue to leak out. One version, likely to be introduced in the House in January, would end automatic eligibility for welfare, set an annual limit on all federal welfare spending and would replace longstanding food stamps, child-nutrition and school lunch programmes with block grants for states to administer as they wished.</p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> UNDERSEA PRINCESS;  </P> <P> ARTIFICIAL REEF: A DOCKSIDE RESTAURANT FOR YEARS, THE LINER CAPSIZED LAST  OCTOBER. IT IS BEING REFLOATED AND HAULED OFFSHORE TO BE SCUTTLED.  </P> <P> After two weeks of underwater patching and welding on the capsized Princess  Louise in Los Angeles Harbor, salvage workers are nearly ready to refloat the  once-elegant passenger ship and dockside restaurant.  </P> <P> But once raised, the ship that mysteriously sank last October will make only  one last, short voyage before it is consigned to Davy Jones' locker. Workers  plan to tow the 300-foot vessel out of the harbor, perhaps as soon as early  today, and scuttle it a mile off Point Vicente to create an artificial reef.  </P> <P> In an unusual procedure, the salvagers are pumping air into the ship's hull in  an effort to refloat it upside-down. Using welds and quick-drying plastic,  workers have been laboring to make the ship's underside and main deck airtight.  Since Saturday, the crew has been pumping air into the hull.  </P> <P> Workers also have cleared the lower half of the ship of all ballast, or weight,  and expect that the ship will roll upside-down when it is pulled into deeper  water at high tide, said Willem B. Boelman, owner of TriNav Shipping, one of  two Vancouver, Canada-based companies engineering the $1-million salvage  operation.  </P> <P> "This has been a very challenging and interesting operation," Boelman said. "We  may have T-shirts made up saying 'I Survived the Salvage of the Princess  Louise.' "  </P> <P> After years as a popular floating restaurant moored beneath the Vincent Thomas  Bridge, the Princess Louise fell on hard times in 1988 and was repossessed by  the Bank of San Pedro. The ship, which the bank hoped to sell, was undergoing  repairs at the Southwest Marine shipyard on Terminal Island when it began  listing and abruptly sank last Oct. 30. Salvage workers said this week they  still don't know what caused the ship to founder.  </P> <P> Some workers on the ship Tuesday said climbing in and around the doomed  Princess left them with an eerie, otherworldly sensation.  </P> <P> "I came down in here right after it went over," said Mike McKeown, yard manager  for Southwest Marine. "It was really weird, like the 'Poseidon Adventure,' " he  said, referring to a book and 1972 movie about a capsized ocean liner.  </P> <P> The 67-year-old ship, which once plied the seas between Vancouver, Canada, and  Puget Sound and spent nearly 20 years as a floating restaurant in Los Angeles  Harbor, has lain half-submerged on its side since it sank. Although most of the  vessel had been sealed off to help refloat it, workers Tuesday were still  climbing down into the main bar and restaurant salon plugging newly developed  air leaks.  </P> <P> The floral carpeting in the main bar now smells of mildew, broken glasses  sparkle beneath green water, and the mahogany woodwork is overgrown with algae.  A mannequin's head -- tossed into a water-filled hallway by a salvage worker  with a morbid sense of humor -- stares back through a porthole.  </P> <P> If the Princess makes it to its destination on the sea bottom off the Palos  Verdes Peninsula, many more divers will have the chance to pay their last  respects.  </P> <P> "I understand a number of dive clubs have already scheduled trips out there,"  said John Grant, a marine biologist with the state Fish and Game Department.  </P> <P> Local diving clubs and sport fishermen have long lobbied for creation of a reef  in the area because it would attract fish, Grant said. Fish and Game officials  already held the necessary permits to scuttle a ship when Grant decided to  pursue the Princess Louise last winter, he said.  </P> <P> "It is a pretty boat," Grant said. "We thought, 'What a shame to melt it down.'  There was not enough money to restore it, so we thought, why not use it for  something people can benefit from?"  </P></p>

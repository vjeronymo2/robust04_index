			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Books: Vengeance exposed - PD James rises to a creative challenge / Fiction ORIGINAL SIN by PD James Faber Pounds 14.99, 432 pages The sin at the heart of PD James' new novel is a callous act of betrayal committed many years ago, before most of her characters were born. It is a book in which she reveals an almost Oedipal sense of the inescapability of the past, while remaining too complex a moralist to endorse notions of pre-destination or determinism. The epic tragedy which unfolds in Original Sin is a warning against vengeance, whose blind rhetoric is exposed at the end of the novel as a destructive force beyond the control of those who unleash it. Lives are lost, careers destroyed, because of one character's literal acting out of an Old Testament view of justice as a means of enforcing equality of suffering. That a detective novel should be discussed in these terms is an apparent vindication of James's argument that the form is flexible enough to contain the moral subtlety and fine writing more usually associated with literary fiction. At the same time, it has to be said that few authors who write this type of fiction come anywhere near approaching James's degree of accomplishment. In her case, the boundaries of the genre appear to act both as a comfortable framework and a creative challenge. Original Sin slyly replays some of the cliches of Golden Age detective fiction, from a closed circle of suspects - the partners in an ailing publishing house based in a mock-Venetian palazzo on the Thames - to a locked-room mystery which only gradually-reveals its fictional and historic antecedents. James has always revelled in plots of startling intricacy which she manages to unfold without intruding her authorial presence. In Original Sin she writes cinematically, beginning with a series of brief, vivid scenes in which a temporary secretary arrives at the Peverell Press and observes not just its architectural magnificence but the discontents among the staff. The company's chairman has recently died (of old age, unlike the deaths which swiftly follow) and been succeeded by Gerard Etienne, the ruthless son of his French business partner. Gerard is planning sweeping changes, among them the sale of the palazzo, ironically named Innocent House, to a property developer. Shortly after a bad-tempered board meeting he is found dead in a poky upstairs office, his corpse garishly presented: half-clothed and with a draught-excluder in the shape of a snake (known in the company as Hissing Sid) wound round his neck, its head jammed into his mouth. The image is grotesque, pantomimic, yet without in any way undoing the horror of the scene. Later in the book, when another victim is shown struggling and failing to escape the gruesome death planned by the same killer, James's contribution to detective fiction becomes clear. Where Agatha Christie or Dorothy L Sayers or John Dickson Carr used violent death as a device, the enabling act which set the plot in motion, James aims for an emotional authenticity which restores its chilling, unforgiving finality. Murder for her is an outrage, a rent in the social fabric which the forces of law and order - represented in this novel by her Scotland Yard detective Adam Dalgliesh and his assistants - struggle not so much to mend as to limit. In Original Sin, the impossibility of the task comes close to overwhelming them, producing a black, bitter finale which casts a baleful light on the conventional romance acted out by two of the surviving characters. James's finest novel to date, Original Sin exposes the harsh fallibility of human vengeance in a world where the ideal of divine justice, though attractive to Dalgliesh - and I suspect, his creator - may also prove illusory.</p>

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Warning over BES outlays SEVERAL new business expansion scheme companies were launched this week. Meanwhile, Flexit, which is sponsored by Richard Ellis Venture Consultants, sold out very quickly. But John Spiers of BESt Investment warns that people who pay top-rate tax on only a small part of their incomes may be putting too much into non-recourse schemes. Basic-rate taxpayers lose if they take money after six months. New schemes this week include: The Shannon Companies Sponsored by British Linen Bank, these will buy repossessed properties from Bank of Ireland Home Mortgages. Non-recourse loans of 75p per Pounds 1 invested are available after six months, while the return after five years is Pounds 1.07 per Pounds 1 invested originally. Artesian Select Not to be confused with 'guaranteed' schemes, this is the latest in a long series of companies which buy properties, or building sites, in London and aim to make a profit from rental yield and capital growth after five years. There is no guarantee, but there is also no upper limit on the return. House the Homeless of London (Spring 1993 Issue) Sponsored by Downing Corporate Finance, this is the latest scheme to buy properties for the Peabody Trust, which will pay Pounds 1.15 for every Pounds 1 share at the end of five years. There is no independent bank guarantee so the offer depends on Peabody, which has properties with an open market vacant possession value of Pounds 825m. Kerrington MaxiGrowth Like Artesian, this is the latest in a series of non-guaranteed companies which will aim to profit from high rental yields in London. London and Home Counties Repossessions Sponsored by Close Brothers, this aims to profit from cheap repossessed properties. The sponsors hope to obtain rental guarantees from colleges and housing associations.</p>

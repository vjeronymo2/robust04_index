			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: European recession hits Cascades THE EUROPEAN recession and problems with the boxboard operations brought a third-quarter loss for Cascades, the international packaging products and fine paper group. It posted a net deficit of CDollars 3.2m, or nine cents a share after preferred dividends, against profit of CDollars 1.3m, or two cents a share, a year earlier. Sales advanced to CDollars 400m, from CDollars 217m a year earlier, and included 59 per cent-owned Cascades Paperboard and 73 per cent-owned Rolland. For the first nine months of 1993 the net loss was CDollars 4.3m, or 17 cents a share, against profits of CDollars 13.6m, or 25 cents, on sales of CDollars 1.23bn, compared with CDollars 643m. Most packaging operations in North America and Europe were profitable, but European boxboard markets were weak. The Duffel plant in Belgium made a CDollars 12.7m loss in the nine months after shutdown costs. Only the packing unit remains open. Cascades has sold its western Canada assets held through Cascades Paperboard, raising more than CDollars 200m for debt reduction in that unit. The holding company has redeemed USDollars 23.8m of subordinated notes and long-term debt has declined to CDollars 29m.</p>

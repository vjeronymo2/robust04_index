(CEI) or Joseph Carabetta is the managing general partner. The request for the waiver is required because an audit report issued by the Regional Inspector General for Audit on March 5, 1993, cited CEI for the improper diversion of funds from project accounts and/or the nonpayment of section 236 Excess Income totalling approximately $7.5 million from 40 properties, including the 26 for which the Plans of Action have been filed. The subject regulation prohibits approval of any Plan of Action so long as audit findings are outstanding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reason Waived:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The mortgagors propose to resolve the audit findings by repaying the diverted funds out of equity proceeds distributed as incentives pursuant to Plans of Action approved under the Emergency Low-Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 (ELIHPA). Your office has also proposed a penalty in the amount of $3 million in lieu of pursuing civil money penalties or affirmative litigation for double damages. Further, your office proposes to collect the full amount of the diverted funds and the penalty from the proceeds of the approved Plans of Action  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in toto  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> before the mortgagors may distribute any proceeds to the partnerships. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This office approves the waiver request on the following conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Mortgagor Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All diversions and unpaid section 236 Excess Income, plus interest accruing at the Treasury Bill rate from the date of the audit report, will be paid back to the project accounts or to the Department as appropriate from equity distributed pursuant to approved Plans of Action. All diversions must be restored and all unpaid Excess income must be repaid prior to the mortgagor retaining any of the equity for distribution to any of the partnerships. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CEI will agree to pay $4,010,000, which represents $5,000 per audit violation for 802 violations. The full amount of the payment must be remitted to the Department prior to the mortgagor retaining any equity distribution from approved Plans of Action to any of the partnerships. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All diversions repaid to the project account may be used to meet accounts payable to unaffiliated vendors. After all such obligations have been discharged, the balance of the funds will be deposited into the Reserve for Replacement escrow account with the mortgagee. The funds may not be used to pay obligations due affiliated or identity-of-interest vendors, capital advances made by any partnership or partner, deposited into the Residual Receipts escrow account or to pay accrued, unpaid distributions to any partnership. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The mortgagors will agree to apply for section 241(f) equity loans within five (5) working days of final approval of ELIHPA Plans of Action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The mortgagors will agree to maintain the properties in good physical condition for the term of the use agreement executed as a condition for receiving incentives pursuant to an approved ELIHPA Plan of Action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The mortgagors will agree to submit all required reports timely.

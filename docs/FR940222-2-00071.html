These services will support ProPAC's evaluation and monitoring of Medicare's Prospective Payment System (PPS) for inpatient care and other Medicare facility-related payment policies. A single contractor is being sought to provide these services under a time-and-materials contract for a period of one year with options to extend the contract for up to two additional years. RFP 02&hyph;94&hyph;ProPAC will be issued on or about March 7, 1994. Interested sources must submit a written request to the address below for a copy of this RFP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Roles and Responsibilities of ProPAC <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ProPAC was created in the same legislation that enacted Medicare's prospective payment system for hospital inpatient care. ProPAC's responsibilities include analyzing payment policies for all facility services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries. Congress also has asked ProPAC to examine and report on the Medicaid program, and on broader issues regarding the effectiveness and quality of health care delivery in the Untied States. ProPAC writes reports on various aspects of health care reform, such as issues relating to expanding the PPS system to all payers, and on issues pertaining to implementing a global budget for health care service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Criteria for Proposals <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants are requested to submit proposals to provide computer programming support services in support of ProPAC's intramural research activities (database development and empirical analyses) in the general areas defined above. Work completed under this contract will be on an as-required basis and shall be performed upon the issuance of task requests by ProPAC's Project Officer and designated staff of the Commission. The following provides a basic outline of what should be included in a formal proposal: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

Special attention should be paid to describing how the Contractor will meet ProPAC's peak work loads. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Technical approach, including a description of the offeror's technical approach that is specific, detailed and complete enough to clearly and fully demonstrate that the offeror thoroughly understands the intent of the Statement of Work, together with proposed approaches. It is recognized that all the technical factors cannot be detailed in advance, but the technical proposal must be sufficient as to how it is proposed to comply with the applicable Statement of Work, including a full explanation of the techniques and procedures you propose to follow. This discussion will describe the offeror's previous experience with editing and manipulating Medicare Part A and Part B provider-level and patient-level files, including a discussion of problems encountered and how these problems were dealt with. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ProPAC currently uses the computer facilities of the House Information Systems (HIS), U.S. House of Representatives. HIS provides ProPAC with on-line and batch processing computer services using an IBM 9021&hyph;620, four-way multiprocessor, operating under Multiple Virtual Storage, Enterprise System (MVS/ES). The Contractor shall be able to carry out the programming tasks defined in this statement of work using these facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Contractor shall expect that during the term of the contract there will be special projects that will require the use of special programs, hardware, and data. These projects will also require that the Contractor transfer data across hardware platforms. The Contractor will be required to respond to changing priorities as the Commission adjust its analytic agenda. The types of tasks to be performed by the Contractor under the contract are summarized as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Database development.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Contractor shall provide programming services supporting file establishment, testing, and documentation of new data sets. These data sets include, but are not limited to: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) patient record data files_for example, PATBILL, MEDPAR (for hospital, SNF, and HHA patients), BMAD Beneficiary files, and National Claims History files; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA facility data files_for example, Medicare Cost Reports (for PPS and excluded hospitals, SNFs, HHAs, and dialysis facilities), BMAD Provider file and Provider of Service (POS) files; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual and Panel surveys of hospitals; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other patient and provider data files_for example, California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development Disclosure Reports for hospitals or skilled nursing facilities; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Geographic data files_for example, geographic information system spatial databases (including state and county boundary files and roadway networks) and socio-economic databases (such as the Area Resource File). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Data base development activities include copying tapes and creating HIS (disk or cartridge) files, comparing file documentation with actual file structure (and updating documentation where necessary), editing files, and preparing descriptive statistics (on file variables to check variable ranges, etc.).

			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> An explosion ruptured a Soviet gas pipeline near the border with Romania hours  before a similar accident killed hundreds of people aboard two trains 1,300  miles to the east, a Soviet newspaper reported. The daily Sotsialisticheskaya  Industria, quoting a railways ministry official, said a blast similar to the  one that engulfed two trains in the Ural Mountains -- leaving an estimated 462  people dead or missing -- occurred Saturday in the republic of Moldavia. "The  explosion occurred 500 yards from the rail line and interrupted traffic on the  international line. This time, fortunately, there were no casualties." It gave  no further details.  </P></p>

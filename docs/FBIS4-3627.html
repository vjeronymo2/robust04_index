			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Letter From Beijing" by Bao Xin (7637 0207): "The Chinese </F> Government Shows Concern for the Stability of the Ranks of Hong  Kong Civil Servants"]    [Text] Dear brother:    At its sixth meeting held in Beijing recently, the political  affairs sub-group of the Hong Kong Preliminary Working Committee  [PWC] discussed the issue of stabilizing the ranks of Hong Kong  civil servants. The meeting was held in a very lively  atmosphere. Both mainland and Hong Kong members unanimously  praised Hong Kong civil servants' contributions to society.    However, with the approach of 1 July 1997, the stability and  morale of the ranks of Hong Kong civil servants have become an  issue of general concern. At the meeting, PWC members answered  one by one the questions Hong Kong civil servants are concerned  and worried about, from ruling out the possibility of "a  complete turnover" and the possibility of "squaring accounts"  with Hong Kong civil servants after 1997, to guaranteeing that  the pay, allowances, fringe benefits, and service conditions of  civil servants after 1997 will not be lower than the original  standards. Based on the law, their every sentence is fair and  reasonable. For this reason, I am sure that, after reading the  written replies of the political affairs sub-group of the PWC,  the civil servants, who have various misgivings due to a lack of  understanding of Chinese Government policy toward Hong Kong  civil servants and the relevant provisions of the Basic Law,  will remove their doubts and strengthen their resolve to stay in  Hong Kong to serve the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region  [SAR] Government and the people of Hong Kong beyond 1997.    As far as I know, the Chinese Government has always attached  importance to the stability of the ranks of Hong Kong civil  servants and regards this as an important aspect of ensuring a  stable transition for Hong Kong. Take as an example the  retention of expatriate civil servants. Taking into account the  characteristics of Hong Kong as an international metropolis and  the present composition of civil servants, not only will the  Chinese Government not reject expatriate civil servants but, on  the contrary, adopt an attitude of enthusiastic welcome.  According to the relevant provisions of the Basic Law, all  expatriate civil servants who formerly worked in various  departments of the Hong Kong Government will be retained after  1997 and, with the exception of a small number of posts  equivalent to those held by directorate-level officials, posts  can be taken up by people of foreign nationalities. British and  other foreign citizens can also be employed as advisers to  various government departments. This represents a striking  contrast to the British policy of discriminating against local  Chinese during its colonial rule in Hong Kong over the past 100  years and more. As another example, some years ago, for fear  that they would not be able to get full pension after 1997, some  civil servants called for setting up a pension fund. The Basic  Law has provided a legal guarantee for Hong Kong civil servants  to receive a pension after 1997, stipulating that the Hong Kong  SAR shall pay the pension, remuneration, allowances, and fringe  benefits to them or their family members at a level not lower  than the original standard and, judging from the current  financial situation and economic prospects in Hong Kong, there  should not be any problems in paying the civil servants'  pension. However, the Chinese Government still has expressed  understanding of and support for the civil servants' call to set  up a pension fund. It has urged the British side through the  Sino-British Joint Liaison Group to adopt positive and effective  measures to this end. This is truly a case of "thinking and  sharing the concerns of civil servants."    You may have heard about the "Beijing course" held at  Qinghua  University for Hong Kong civil servants. Set up last July at  the request of the Hong Kong Government, the course has been  successfully run twice, each time attended by about 20 people.  Many more classes will reportedly be held this year. The civil  servants attending the course not only made considerable  progress in their practical capability to speak Mandarin and  write Chinese but, through on-the-spot inspection in different  provinces and cities, also had a better understanding of the  institutional setup, operations, and relevant systems of the  Chinese Government, China's national conditions, the life of the  people on the mainland, and even the conditions and customs in  various localities. The course has been run with the firm  support and assistance of the relevant departments of the  Chinese Government. Public media in Hong Kong praises the  Chinese Government for doing a good, practical thing for the  steady transition of Hong Kong civil servants in 1997 and for  increasing their confidence.    Conversely, what sincerity has the British side shown and  what has it done to maintain the stability of the ranks of Hong  Kong civil servants and to make a stable transition? Almost  simultaneously with the PWC political affairs sub-group  discussion in Beijing on the question of civil servants, senior  Hong Kong Government officials let on that the British Hong Kong  Government had worked out a list of principal officials that  would work beyond 1997 and hoped to consult with the Chinese  side. The true intention of this move is quite obvious.  According to the provisions of the Sino-British Joint  Declaration and the Basic Law, the principal officials of the  Hong Kong SAR Government are to be nominated by the chief  executive of the Hong Kong SAR and submitted to the central  people's government for appointments. How can the British Hong  Kong Government make arrangements for a group of people and then  bargain with the Chinese side for them?    However, I believe that the great majority of civil servants  in Hong Kong will work contentedly at their posts and attend to  their own duties after 1997 as they do today. The overall image  of high quality and efficiency that so distinguishes Hong Kong  civil servants is sure to be continuously preserved.    Yours,    [Signed] Bao Xin    [Dated] April 1994</p>

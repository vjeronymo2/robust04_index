			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A TRADE HULLABALOO THAT NEED NOT BE  </P> <P> Too often we see problems of perception and wounded feelings surface in the  U.S.-Japan relationship. On issue after issue, Americans have come away from a  negotiation believing they have reached a firm accord guaranteeing finite  results conditioned by their own practices. The Japanese, on the other hand,  possess a more flexible view. They feel what they have committed themselves to  is a diligent effort to reach mutually desired goals. Later, when either the  schedule or the numerical target is not quite reached, a hullabaloo breaks out.  Americans profess outrage; Japanese feel bashed. Too often a clash of this kind  has erupted as cultural and business practice differences arise to put the  parties at odds. Many scars linger.  </P> <P> Not everyone appreciates the efforts made by Japan's electronics industry since  the 1986 U.S.-Japan semiconductor agreement. Significant advances have been  made and the prospect for sustained growth of U.S. sales in Japan enhanced. In  1988 alone, U.S. producers increased their sales to Japan by 55%. And the  growth rate of foreign semiconductor sales to Japan far exceeded the growth of  the Japanese semiconductor market as a whole.  </P> <P> Despite these advances, the U.S. electronics industry is disgruntled. Its  expectations have not been met. As a result, accusations have been hurled  across the Pacific. This, of course, is not the first time misunderstandings  have plagued an agreement between our two countries.  </P> <P> The agreement established a target for imports of American semiconductor  products. But the ink was hardly dry before clamor erupted. The Americans felt  that the Japanese were committed to specific goals within specific timetables.  The Japanese interpretation was that the commitment was to goals within a less  rigid time period. So we now have on our hands another awkward dispute between  friends.  </P> <P> By now, our past experience in such negotiations should condition both sides to  recognize that the party across the table brings with them a profoundly  differing perspective. Expectations should be adjusted accordingly. By now, we  should understand that even after a solemn agreement has been worked out  laboriously and in good faith, disputes over interpretation are almost  inevitable. Before either nation cries "foul," there should be careful  consideration of both nations' differing traditions, standards and business  practices.  </P> <P> The two countries have a complex relationship. On the surface much seems  serene. Japanese products do well in American markets. America finds Japan a  reliable ally. But beneath the surface a sense of unease prevails and grows.  Polls show that Americans see Japanese economic practices as unfair. The  Japanese in turn blame faulty American policies for our disputes.  </P> <P> Although the United States and Japan obviously have a wealth of common  interests, we continue to suffer from recurrent fallout brought about by our  wildly dissimilar cultures.  </P> <P> When faced with an alien culture, suspicion of motives finds fertile soil in  which to grow. Prudence dictates that this suspicion must not be permitted to  fester.  </P> <P> We can point to one positive feature that characterizes the electronics  industry in both countries. In contrast to previous years, the Japanese and the  American industriesnow deal directly with each other, rather than through  respective government organizations.  </P> <P> This kind of cooperative effort at international problem-solving has much to  commend it. It is well for Japanese electronics manufacturers to bring their  capabilities and needs to the attention of their American counterparts and to  seek to induce American companies to design products marketable in Japan. At  the same time, Americans must be assured that the often elusive Japanese market  is open.  </P> <P> We should all be encouraged by Japanese efforts to promote the current ongoing  dialogue between U.S. suppliers and Japanese users. The recent seminar  sponsored for this purpose by the Japanese electronic industry in the heart of  California's Silicon Valley is a particularly conspicuous example of this  outreach.  </P> <P> Although many Americans have questioned Japanese intentions in this matter, a  calmer appraisal would recognize that it is now actually in Japan's  self-interest to increase imports, including imports of foreign semiconductors.  Japan has acknowledged that it must expand its own consumer demand. To meet  this demand, a new high level of goods from overseas is starting to flow in.  Given time, this will substantially increase U.S. semiconductor exports and  will serve to integrate American suppliers into Japan's economic system.  Meanwhile, a bit of patience is wise counsel.  </P></p>

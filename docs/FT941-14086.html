			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: Kimberley-Clark ends year back in the black Kimberley-Clark, the US paper products company best known for its Huggies disposable nappies and Kleenex tissues, said higher sales volumes and lower costs helped turn last year's fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 55.8m into a net profit of Dollars 141.6m this time. The previous year's figure was hit by restructuring costs that reduced earnings by Dollars 172m, but the company said net income would still have been up by 22 per cent if that charge was excluded from the comparison. Earnings per share were 88 cents compared with last year's loss of 35 cents. For the full year, net income rose from Dollars 135m to Dollars 510.9m and earnings per share rose from 84 cents to Dollars 3.18.</p>

			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL ALTERS ZONING TO SAVE TRAILER PARK  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to thwart plans to shut  down the 27-unit Woodley Trailer Lodge in Van Nuys and replace the mobile home  park with a commercial development.  </P> <P> The move was initiated by Councilman Joel Wachs to prevent developer Yechezkel  Lehavi from scrapping the trailer park, evicting its tenants and building a  commercial or industrial project on the site.  </P> <P> By adopting the Wachs proposal, the council changed the zoning of Lehavi's  property from manufacturing to residential-mobile home park.  </P> <P> The one-acre parcel, the site of a mobile home park since 1948, is surrounded  by industrial properties, including a machine shop and a plastics manufacturing  company.  </P> <P> A city Planning Department hearing examiner earlier had recommended disapproval  of the Wachs plan. Not only is the mobile home park incompatible with the  adjoining industrial sites, but it is also highly vulnerable to noise from the  nearby Van Nuys Airport because mobile homes are "nearly impossible to  soundproof," the hearing examiner warned.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Dessert recipes collected for 18 years by acclaimed pastry chef Lindsey Shere  were stolen by a burglar, who slipped into Shere's Berkeley home and made off  with her purse containing a notebook. The book included recipes for ice creams,  sorbets, brioches and the secret of green walnut liqueur, a feature of Shere's  Chez Panisse Restaurant. "I feel a little numb," Shere said, in offering an  unspecified reward for return of the recipes with no questions asked.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OCC and ICC will replace the existing Mutual Agency Agreement between OCC and ICC with a proposed Agreement for Cross-Netting Foreign Currency Settlements (``Cross-Netting Agreement''). The proposed Cross-Netting Agreement, which is based on the Mutual Agency Agreement, has been drafted by OCC and ICC to implement the above-described rule changes. Specifically, the Cross-Netting Agreement provides: (1) That OCC and ICC will furnish a form notice by which a joint clearing member may elect to cross-net its OCC and ICC obligations and which will provide that only OCC will effect the cross-netted settlements; (2) that OCC agrees to act as agent for ICC in effecting cross-netted settlements with a joint clearing member; (3) that neither OCC nor ICC will change its rules relating to the margining and settling of foreign currency obligations without the consent of the other; and (4) the settlement, default, indemnity, and termination procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the Cross-Netting Agreement, the settlement and default procedures will remain unchanged except that only OCC will be authorized to effect the cross-netting settlements. Likewise, the terms of indemnity between OCC and ICC will remain unchanged except for the fact that OCC will no longer indemnify ICC for actions taken by ICC as agent for OCC in effecting cross-netting settlements. Finally, the terms for terminating the Cross-Netting Agreement will remain unchanged except that the notice requirement between the two parties will be shortened from ninety days to thirty days. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OCC and ICC state the proposed rule changes are consistent with the Act and in particular with section 17A of the Act <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  in that the rule changes neither adversely affect the safeguarding of securities or funds in the custody or control of OCC or ICC or for which they are responsible nor significantly affect the rights or obligations of OCC, ICC, or those joint clearing members that have elected cross-netting. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1 (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

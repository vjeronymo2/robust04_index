			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / US housing starts increase A 7 per cent increase in US housing starts between October and November, reported yesterday, provided fresh evidence of buoyant economic growth despite repeated efforts by the Federal Reserve to curb demand by raising interest rates. Fed policymakers meet again next Tuesday and could decide to raise short-term rates by a further half point to 6 per cent. Most Wall Street analysts, however, expect the Fed to delay its next move until the New Year partly because of jitters in bond markets following the Orange County bankruptcy. By late January the Fed would also be able to assess whether unexpectedly strong consumer spending in November had carried over into the Christmas period. The housing figures surprised analysts, many of whom were looking for an increase of only about 2 per cent. Forecasters generally had assumed a 5 per cent fall in starts in October signalled a period of more sluggish home building following increases in mortgage rates.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For gas cooktops, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that thermostatically controlled gas burners are not effective at controlling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature. The sensing element which is designed to make contact with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooking vessel will not allow effective control if the cooking utensil has an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uneven bottom in the area where it is to be ``sensed.'' In addition, since the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electric sensing element will retain heat due to its mass, reaction times  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could be delayed, thus allowing wide swings in the thermostatically selected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature. The DOE test procedure also cannot measure the effect of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thermostatically controlled burners. (Association of Home Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers, No. 61A at 54, 55.) The Association of Home Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers stated that the performance of reflective surfaces is degraded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significantly from reaction to cooking vapors, burnt-on spillovers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cleaning with abrasive pads. To maintain reflective surfaces it would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to replace these expensive units periodically. The Association of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Home Appliance Manufacturers felt that the energy savings from reflective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surfaces are very small. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 61A at 56, 57.) With regard to insulation, the Association of Home Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers stated it is occasionally used in gas cooktops where there are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surface temperature problems on the surrounding structures. The insulation is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attached outside of the burner box. Any other placement would impair utility,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because the space underneath the countertop cooktop unit (that is designed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fit in drawers) would become significantly reduced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers also felt that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> energy savings from insulation is very small. (Association of Home Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers, No. 61A at 56, 57.) In its comments regarding product classes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, though it suggested that both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conventional and sealed burners be considered as one class, stated that it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorrect to assume that sealed burners are more efficient than conventional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burners. Sealed burners obtain all of their secondary air from above the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooktop, which requires that either the grate height be raised or the burner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be derated in order for it to be as efficient as conventional burners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 47, 48.) The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated that radiant burners should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be considered as a product class rather than a design option and went on to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state several problems with these burner types. Since radiant burners use a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> powered pre-mix burner, carbon monoxide control is more critical, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burner flame can only be varied by 30 percent. Test work performed by the Gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Research Institute with the American Gas Association Laboratories on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prototypes has revealed that low burner rate is difficult to maintain. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> means that current prototypes would not meet American National Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Institute standards. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that burner efficiency might be no better than conventional burners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 49&hyph;51.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department took into account all sources of available data when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining the cost and energy savings from thermostatically controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burners, reflective surfaces, and sealed burners. Sources of data included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, manufacturers, suppliers, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published papers and reports. Lack of any available data regarding catalytic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burners, high efficiency electronic controllers, and insulation prevented the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department from analyzing these design options. The Department agrees with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers' comments regarding radiant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas burners. Because there is no prototype that works satisfactorily, it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not possible to determine if this design option is technologically feasible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For electric open coil cooktops, the Association of Home Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers stated that the contact conductance of open coil elements cannot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be significantly improved. Manufacturers have worked together to improve the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flatness of this element type, and have produced an element that is doing an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excellent job. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 57,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 58.) The reflective surface and insulation design options cause the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problems for electric open coil cooktops as for gas burners. See comments,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supra, for gas cooktops. (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 61A at 58.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

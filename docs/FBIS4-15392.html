			<p>BFN     [Text] Commenting on his decision to leave the Russia's  Choice faction to journalists on Thursday, deputy of the State  Duma Gennadiy Burbulis noted that this is "not a departure from  the democratic movement in general, but a breakthrough to the  social and professional environment which needs most active and  concrete support today."    Announcing his resignation from the faction on Thursday,  Burbulis explained his step by his intention to set up a new  democratic movement.    In his opinion, the new movement should include  representatives from all regions of the Russian Federation who  "have never been engaged in political activities, but by their  views and convictions are the most active supporters and  defenders of the democratic reforms in Russia."    Burbulis also noted that "it would be politically wrong for  him to proclaim a new democratic party or movement now." "Let it  happen from inside, from regions," Burbulis said.    Asked about his attitude to Yegor Gaydar's plans to create a  new party called Russia's Choice, Burbulis noted that "it is  already impossible to stop these plans." "Let the new party be  born," Burbulis said noting that it would not fulfil its  expectations,    Burbulis also noted that he would like to be "kind of a  bridge" between the party Russia's Choice and the new democratic  movement which he envisages.    [Moscow ITAR-TASS in English at 1451 GMT on 7 April 1994  adds: "Commenting on this move, Russia's Choice Leader Yegor  Gaydar expressed "deep regret" over it. "Although Gennadiy  Burbulis's decision will have serious consequences for the  faction, it should not be dramatized", he noted. Another member  of the Russia's Choice faction, Stepan Sulakshin, followed suit  and announced his intention to quit the faction at the same  meeting."</p>

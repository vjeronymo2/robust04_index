			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] At a news conference, Prime Minister  Pawlak pointed out the following problems:    [Begin Pawlak recording] We had the opportunity to brief  President Delors on Poland's political and economic situation.  We told him Poland puts the goal of integration with the EU  first, but is not neglecting other actions streamlining  cooperation, particularly regional cooperation, chiefly with the  Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and the CEFTA [Central  European Free Trade Agreement]. We have intensified our work in  this sphere. A very important part of the talks concerned the  infrastructure in the broad sense, including communications, but  also concerning the information infrastructure. These are the  areas that will decide the future, on the conditions for the  economy and our society's development. This enables us to look  with greater faith at Europe's future. [end recording]</p>

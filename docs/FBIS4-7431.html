			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [First two paragraphs are SANKEI SHIMBUN introduction] </F>   [Text] Some people involved in obtaining "The Scoop" video  footage have been arrested. In connection with the "fabrication  of facts" in TV Asahi's special news program "The Scoop," in an  interview on 24 April, the Chinese coordinator, Mr. A, 25--who  obtained videotapes on public executions from the PRC  authorities--testified to SANKEI SHIMBUN that the authorities  had investigated his family members, friends, and acquaintances;  his mother, who actually borrowed the videotapes; and, that a  number of others who helped in filming the news program had been  arrested. Regarding his fleeing to South America, Mr. A said:  "I will be a dead man if I am arrested." "I do not know what I  am going to do from now on."    Mr. A came to Japan on an educational visa in autumn 1991.  While studying at a Japanese language school in Tokyo, he took  advantage of his experience and connections to work as  coordinator for media coverage in China. He returned to his  hometown Fuzhou city temporarily to assist in filming the  program in question.    [SANKEI SHIMBUN] In Japan, they say you testified that you  wore the uniform of an armed policeman and acted as one in the  program.    [A] That is true. I said that.    [SANKEI SHIMBUN] Where did the video footage on the public  executions come from? And how did you obtain them?    [A] I asked assistance from my mother, who is a public  security cadre, and she borrowed them from a certain official of  the judiciary. I dubbed them at home and handed the tapes over  to Kasahara [Tadao Kasahara, president of the subcontractor  production outfit which actually produced the news program]. He  later told me: "What I brought home was unacceptable," so I  again borrowed other tapes, dubbed them, and brought them back  to Japan personally. These were the ones used in the program.    [SANKEI SHIMBUN] How much money did you get for this job?    [A] All in all, around 2 million yen.    [SANKEI SHIMBUN] When and how did you leave Fuzhou?    [A] I left Fuzhou on 25 September 1993. A friend of mine  who works for the authorities had called and told me "you are in  danger." I immediately took a taxi to Shenzhen. From there, I  went to Hong Kong, and returned to Japan on 27 September.    [SANKEI SHIMBUN] How did you keep yourself informed?    [A] I have some old friends still working for the  authorities. My elder brother, who is in hiding in China,  sometimes telephones me. After I returned to Japan, I stayed  with members of the TV program production staff and other  Chinese friends. I was also in contact with my elder brother  and friends, through trusted friends.    [SANKEI SHIMBUN] When did you leave Japan?    [A] On 24 December. I was told that five men had been sent  to Japan to arrest me. I was frightened so I went to see  Kasahara and the TV Asahi people, but none of them wanted to see  me. The video footage on public executions is a state secret.  If I get caught, I will be sentenced to death.    [SANKEI SHIMBUN] How will you make a living from now on?    [A] I still do not know what to do. I have three fake  passports, but I think I will have to buy an authentic one.</p>

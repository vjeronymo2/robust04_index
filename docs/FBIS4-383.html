			<p>BFN     [Text] In Rwanda, there is no cease-fire. However, the  belligerents are reported to be willing to respect a truce. In  any case, it will be a short one and its aim will only be to  make the evacuation of foreign nationals possible. Colonel  Marchal, the commander of the Belgian contingent within the UN  Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR], gives some explanations:    [Begin recording] [Marchal] The cease-fire that was  negotiated this afternoon has changed names. It is now called a  truce that will be implemented as soon as the document is  signed. It will be valid for 48 hours.    [Unidentified correspondent] When is the document going to  be  signed, Colonel?    [Marchal] The document remained to be drafted and then, of  course, signed by the two sides. I assume that this is  happening right now. As soon as the document is signed, there  will be a 48-hour time limit for the evacuation of expatriates.    [Correspondent] This means that this is a 48-hour truce. In  other words, fighting may continue, it is likely to continue  after these 48 hours, right?    [Marchal] Fighting is indeed supposed [as heard] to resume  after these 48 hours, unless the political side of the  UNAMIR...[pauses] which had the opportunity to use this 48-hour  time limit to make progress in the negotiations which have been  started. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: PCT improves 9% to Pounds 1.17m Profits before tax of the PCT Group rose by 9 per cent to Pounds 1.17m for the year to end-December after taking account of a Pounds 126,000 fall in interest charges to Pounds 767,000. However, a rise in the tax charge from 25 per cent to 39 per cent left earnings 3p lower at 13.8p. Turnover declined from Pounds 18.9m to Pounds 17.9m - the USM-quoted group has interests in the marketing, hire and development of power tools and lifting and welding equipment. A proposed final dividend of 4.5p on the enlarged capital makes a 7p (6.4p) total.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, May 27 (AFP) -- Kazakhstan on Friday [27  May] became the 19th country to join the Partnership for Peace  program with NATO, with Foreign Minister Kanat Saudabayev saying  it would help contribute to world peace and stability.    "This document responds to the interests of our country  which  strives for stability," the minister said after signing the  document. "We do not accept any kind of confrontation or  conflict."    The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation program launched last  January provides for increased military cooperation between the  Atlantic Alliance and former Soviet bloc states.    In response to reporters' questions, Saudabayev said his  country, one of four former Soviet states to hold nuclear arms,  along with Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, would continue sending  nuclear arms to Russia for dismantling "after some technical  questions are solved."    Kazakhstan up to March had transferred to Russia 12 of a  total 104 SS-18 nuclear missiles for dismantling under terms of  the START I Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.    At the signing ceremony, NATO Deputy Secretary General  Sergio  Balanzino hailed Kazakhstan as a signatory of both the START and  the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, saying it was a "sign of  your commitment to the reduction and elimination of nuclear  weapons on your territory."</p>

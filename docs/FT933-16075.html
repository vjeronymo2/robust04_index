			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Birt urged to press on with BBC management reform MR JOHN BIRT, the BBC director-general, has been advised by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to persevere with the controversial Producer Choice policy. Mr David Hill, managing director of the ABC, told Mr Birt in a meeting in London last week that a similar scheme introduced four years ago at his broadcasting organisation had been 'a dramatic and remarkable success'. Producer Choice, launched at the BBC in April, provides for the full costing of all programmes and gives producers the right to buy in services from the outside market. The Australian version is called User Pays. Mr Hill said that since the scheme started four years ago there had been a 20 per cent increase in productivity at the ABC. The number of staff had also fallen from 6,500 to 5,500. In 1989-90, Mr Hill said, 2.3m resource hours were used to produce programmes. In 1992-3 the total was 1.8m, yet in the same time the number of hours transmitted increased by 6 per cent. Mr Hill pointed out, however, that the Australian scheme was phased in more gradually and producers had to get permission before buying in services from outside.</p>

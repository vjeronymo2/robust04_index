What is it that politicians are seeking? What kind  of politician are you?    Answer: Politicians may be divided into two types:  One type enjoys power, the other seeks satisfaction in the  realization of self. From childhood, I have aspired to be an  historic figure, and I have always said that if I only knew  while alive that my name would go down in history, I would be  very happy indeed! This is the meaning of life that is more  important than anything else.    A man who enjoys power must attend to things personally, but  I don't attend to everything personally, and I don't get myself  involved in everything. In fact, I am too impatient to be a very  good administrator; I am not good at coordinating, compromising,  and I hate details. I see power as a tool to help realize a  sense of self. To realize my sense of self, I don't mind hard  work and sacrifice at all.    That is the exact opposite of those who enjoy power, for  they  like to attend to things themselves with their power; a very  good example is that of the first emperor of the Ch'in: He  studied official documents till all hours of the night,  personally got involved in all things, and had to make every  decision.    Question: Which type of politician do you think  fit Mao Tse-tung, and do you admire him? What kind of  politicians do you most admire?    Answer: Mao was between the two types; he enjoyed  power so much that he could not face the fact of being deprived  of it; that was Mao in his old age.    I greatly admire de Gaulle, he is the politician I most  respect and admire. He was a war hero in World War II, and  occupied a position none would dare challenge; yet, when he  found he could not do anything useful, he resigned and retired  to the countryside for 12 years. Was there any opportunity for  him to stage a comeback? The political situation at the time  appeared to rule that out. However, when the French military  supported de Gaulle's return to deal with the Algerian revolt,  the first thing he did upon assumption of power was to announce  that France would let Algeria go through direct negotiations.  This truly was something that not anyone could accomplish.    When de Gaulle returned to power, he ameliorated the  historical animosity between France and Germany, promoted the  European common market, made future plans not only for France  but also for Europe and established a foundation for the  continuing future development of Europe; that was true  leadership. In 1968, with France paralyzed by a series of  national demonstrations and strikes, he went on television and  in a short statement announced that general elections would be  held within a month, and that immediately put an end to all  demonstrations; this grave crisis was resolved by his one  television address. The elections resulted in a major victory  for de Gaulle, but despite the victory he made plans to step  down for he knew that his era was ending. Issues of  administrative reform and the student had to be addressed, but  these trifling matters did not interest de Gaulle and he passed  them on to others to deal with.    At the time I was in England; the democratic politics of  England was also of the traditional, old-line type, and their  legislators had first class educational background, oratory  skills and training, but they were no match for de Gaulle when  it came to handling major issues from a broad perspective.    Question: What kind of historical figure do you  want to be?    Answer: There is no need to talk about that now,  for it's too early to do so. I consider life like painting a  picture, one naturally knows what one wants to paint when one  picks up a brush. De Gaulle certainly knew [his objectives of]  European unity and a strong France before he proceeded to work  toward those ends. But what about opportunities? These are the  external conditions. Whether one has an opportunity depends on  the kind of environment in which one finds himself. When I was  young, I was very pessimistic, moody and depressed, thinking  that I would not have an opportunity in my lifetime. Taiwan is  too small a place, and even if one had talent and ability, one  could hardly influence the world [from Taiwan]; I felt I was  born into the wrong era. But now I no longer think this way; it  is very clear to me that a politician does have enough room to  exercise power.    Question: How do you see Taiwan today?    Answer: So long as I live, it is quite possible  that Taiwan will develop world-class influence; there is no  doubt, the question is only what one does to bring that about.  The space Taiwan occupies is really not that small, therefore a  Taiwan leader should allow Taiwan to develop its world-class  influence in the same way as de Gaulle deliberated on how to  establish a strong and powerful France and launch a new European  era in the midst of turmoil and instability.    Question: How many years will it take to influence  the whole world?    Answer: I have just said, if I were the president  now, I would immediately proceed to create that kind of era.  Frankly speaking, if I had the opportunity to be Taiwan's leader  today, I would not waste one minute or one second. Only a person  without ability would waste any time, and if at this point in  life I don't know what should be done, I would be in a total  mess!    Question: How do you see the Party Program on  Taiwan Independence? Is it a reflection of the anti-Kuomintang  [KMT] sentiments or is it a national goal? If the DPP came to  power, would it change the national flag or the country's name?    Answer: Objectively speaking, Taiwan is an  independent country; I hope we ourselves at least recognize that  fact, but as to how foreigners see it, it becomes a question of  tactics. Taiwan was originally an independent sovereign country,  and all we did was to announce that fact. Now you ask whether  the country's name and flag should be changed, actually these  are small matters, and questions of tactics are also small  matters. If China is displeased, are we not supposed to do  anything? Why do we say we must make changes? Are we supposed to  wait for the day when China does not care before we make any  changes? Naturally we hope to make changes, but if changing the  country's name would create great difficulties, then we can wait  a while; as the Chinese Communists themselves often say, we too  can wait 60 years. Waiting a while is not a difficult thing to  do.    Question: In the course of the opposition  movement, when the Chung-li incident or the Mei-li Island  incident occurred, you happened to be away. Did you anticipate  these things and therefore leave [Taiwan]?    Answer: In the Chung-li Incident, what could I  have done if I were here, participate in the demonstrations?  Direct the demonstrations? That is really laughable. Frankly  speaking, the historical meaning of the Chung-li incident is the  use of people's power to block the fabrication of ballots. If  you expect me to oppose the Chung-li incident, that would be  impossible. Undoubtedly, I had a share of the responsibility in  that incident! No, not responsibility, it was my pleasure to see  these type of things happen, where people use their power to  oppose the [opposition's] brute force in the elections. If the  elections could be held with fabricated ballots, the elections  would be fraudulent. Under such circumstances, you cannot expect  me to be in control, that cannot be done; but to turn that  around, if you expect me to carry on further agitation at the  scene, that also would not be right, would it?    I was not present when the Mei-li Island incident occurred,  because no one knew it was going to happen; and if no one  expected it, how could I have been present? I left Taiwan two  months before the incident, and I did not leave with the  expectation that it would take place.    As to the charge that I have paid too small a price, that  naturally is difficult to refute. I have not spent time in  prison, and did not seriously consider serving any prison  sentence. But perhaps I should say I did not avoid prison, nor  was I afraid of it. Is any further explanation necessary for  what I have done in my life so far? Are there disasters more  unpredictable than the Chung-li incident? I would not say  however that I dare not take a stand for fear of this type of  disaster.    Question: Have you assessed the situation to  determine how it can be used to your advantage?    Answer: For one engaged in politics, one naturally  makes his moves in the context of major trends. It's true I  threw myself into one such major trend. When I returned in 1986,  I brought with me the pressure to organize a party along with  homecoming. I turned homecoming into a major movement which was  likely to succeed objectively speaking. However, if other people  insisted on twisting the facts, no matter how you explain them,  it would be to no avail; if you have accomplished nothing in  life, people would certainly not talk about you, but if you aim  to achieve great things, why should you care what others say  about you?    For example, up to this point of my life, I can say I am  [speaking in English]: Very proud of myself. In all  my life, my goal is like de Gaulle's; in painting a picture of  my life, I am an idealist in search of ideals in life. I am  perhaps too self-confident, and therefore do not let small  matters bother me; when other people vilify me over small  matters, I care not at all. We all know what is beauty; like a  great painter, one knows what and how to paint, and one would  not bother about or argue over trifles. I have often said that I  am not a person concerned with the superficial, but where it  concerns the ultimate gains and losses in life, I do indeed  care; my hope is to become a person with a place in history and  I care about the major achievements in my life but not all the  minor, superficial things.    The biggest difference between me and others is that I am  not  concerned about details. Frankly, I don't care at all to be on  the banquet circuit. I am like that: Other people consider this  business [of banqueting] to be indispensable, but I don't care  about it at all! I don't care about society's reaction, I do  care about myself, [my place] in history and whether I can  accomplish [my] great historic mission.    Question: You said you are not a particularly good  administrator, but whether as Governor or President in the  future, isn't administrative ability a prerequisite?    Answer: It's true I don't care for details, but as  my one and a half years as the T'aoyuan County magistrate  demonstrated, I didn't do badly on that score. A political  leader cannot simply rely on thinking big, on ideals, for  ability is also important. You can say that I am bored by  administrative responsibilities, but that does not mean that I  don't know how to administer. There are no truly able political  leaders who don't know about administration; it is because they  know it too well to involve themselves personally that they  select the right persons for the jobs with themselves holding  the key.    Question: If you became governor, would you then  go on the banquet circuit?    Answer: Society says this is not a good thing! It  is not that I care, or that I love banqueting, it's just that I  don't care for such things.    Question: Some people say that you are like Li  Hsiao-lung [2621 1420 7893], winning is what counts, the means  utilized are not important?    Answer: It's the exact opposite. It is not that  people like me do not choose their tactics, they do. Because we  have too much faith [in others] that we do need to choose  tactics. I am much smarter than you on that score, it's like  what Mencius said: "Even if one can rule the empire by killing  one innocent person, one should not do it." It is because I have  too many choices, that's why we choose our tactics; only people  in a terrible fix do not choose their tactics, because they  don't have the option to so choose.    Question: What kind of blueprint do you have for  Taiwan?    Answer: I have one important concept; namely,  Taiwan is the world's newest emerging people.    A newly emerging people have two special characteristics:  They know a great deal and they are full of vitality. There are  historical reasons for this. In the early days, because  East-West cultural exchanges took place through the Gansu  corridor, the Mongols knew a great deal. As a nomadic people,  they were full of vitality, and from all this they developed  their special ability and skills. The Manchus were able to  develop special ability by learning horsemanship from the  Mongols, Han culture from the Chinese who migrated beyond the  Great Wall, Western culture through the seafaring Chinese  pirates and trade and commerce through nomadic herding. In the  20th century, the Japanese did the same thing: They knew a lot  more than the Westerners, and they were more vigorous than the  latter. Today, among the world's newest emerging peoples, it is  the Taiwanese who know a great deal and who have the greatest  vitality.    Ten years ago, I had already focused on this issue. I was  the  first one to do so, and it is the source of my sense of  self-confidence. I was moody and depressed when I was young,  thinking that even if the presidency of Taiwan was offered to  me, what could I do? I dwelled on that proposition during my  college years, and became very pessimistic.    Today, our mission is how to enable this newly emerging  people and country to develop and fulfill their historic  mission; people say I am a ultra-nationalist, that's not so, for  it is our historic duty. That's why with regard to the mainland  policy, I am not like the majority in the DPP, it's the exact  opposite: I am not afraid to make concessions. I consider it  [the mainland policy] a Western expedition: When Taiwan  businessmen invest on the mainland, that's the beginning of  Western expedition; it is an unstoppable historic trend and we  are bound to succeed for we cannot fail. Through China's massive  market and manpower, Taiwan will achieve a position of  preeminence in the 21st century in the same way the Mongols and  Manchus did in their days, and will fulfill its historic destiny.    The second stage will not be easy to handle, it will require  correct policy as well as leadership. We have seen how the  Mongols and Manchus failed, will we repeat their mistakes? As  leader, one has the responsibility of absolutely not letting 10  or 20 years pass [without doing what must be done]. Perhaps one  should put it this way, will your achievement be that of just  another economic power? The historic mission of Taiwan, in my  view, is to establish a more rational relationship between  production and distribution, for this is the flaw in economies  of the Western nations including Japan. Nevertheless, in summing  up, what we hope to build is a societal system. Perhaps our  historic mission is that history will let Taiwan rise up and  leave something behind for mankind. The meaning of Taiwan's  place in history, therefore, is to establish and leave behind a  more rational and more perfect economic system that will benefit  all mankind. This is the framework of my thinking and the  mission of my life.    That is why I do not really care to be a county executive,  the provincial governor or even the president, for my hope is to  have an opportunity to accomplish the above mission, for  otherwise being president of the State of Taiwan would have no  meaning.

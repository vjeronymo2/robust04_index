			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Italian public sector chief charged: Iri state group chairman linked to illicit political funding scandal MR Franco Nobili, chairman of Iri, Italy's biggest state holding company, was yesterday arrested by Milan magistrates and transferred to the city's San Vittore jail on charges of corruption. Mr Nobili, 62, holds the most prominent position in the Italian public sector. Until now, the Iri group has only figured in a minor way in the 15-month investigations by Milan magistrates into illicit funding of the political parties, mainly through kickbacks paid on contracts. The chief executives of the Italian subsidiaries of two foreign companies operating in the lucrative telecommunications sector - Sweden's Ericsson and the UK's GEC - were also arrested on charges of alleged corruption. The arrests relate to a developing line of inquiry by Milan magistrates into kickbacks allegedly paid for a share in Italy's large telecommunications sector. Mr Nobili has been Iri chairman since 1990, having been appointed to this post, traditionally controlled by the Christian Democrat party, by his friend Mr Giulio Andreotti, who was then prime minister. The operations of Iri are unlikely to be affected since Mr Nobili was effectively forced into a representational role last August when Iri's status was changed to a joint stock company. The running of Iri and strategic planning has been in the hands of Mr Michele Tedeschi, the managing director. Within the past two months, the management of the country's three main state-run industrial groups have all become implicated in the corruption scandals. In March, Mr Gabriele Cagliari, the chairman of Eni, the state oil concern, was arrested along with the heads of the group's four main subsidiaries on charges of allegedly falsifying accounts. Since then, a complex picture of illicit funding of political parties, has emerged from Eni companies, believed to have been worth L27bn (Pounds 11.5m) since 1989. At the same time, Mr Mauro Leone, deputy chairman of Efim, the industrial holding placed in liquidation last July, was arrested on charges of alleged fraud. The allegations of corruption in Mr Nobili's case are understood to refer both to his time as Iri chairman and during the period from 1978-89 when he ran Cogefar, a leading construction company. The magistrates are reportedly mainly concerned with his activities in Cogefar, before its merger with Fiat's Impresit in 1989. The alleged payment of bribes by Cogefar-Impresit to obtain contracts has been the main account on which magistrates have been questioning Fiat executives over the past year. Mr Nobili's arrest is linked to a fresh questioning of Mr Enzo Papi, former managing director of Cogefar-Impresit, arrested last May and held for 55 days before admitting the payment of bribes.

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Goodyear net income slips to Dollars 88m GOODYEAR Tire &amp; Rubber, the only surviving US-owned tyre company, yesterday said its board had approved a two-for-one stock split and a 20 per cent hike in its quarterly dividend payment to 30 cents a share on a pre-split basis. The company recorded underlying fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 102.8m, or Dollars 1.43 a share, excluding extraordinary items and accounting changes. This compares with Dollars 99.3m, or Dollars 1.55, a year earlier, when the company had fewer shares outstanding. Including one-time items, Goodyear's net income stood at Dollars 87.5m, or Dollars 1.22, in the fourth quarter against Dollars 105.1m, or Dollars 1.65, last year. Sales rose 5 per cent to Dollars 2.93bn from Dollars 2.78bn. The results were in line with Goodyear's earlier fourth-quarter predictions and its shares eased Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 70 3/8 at close of trading in New York. The proposed stock split and dividend increase will be put to a shareholder vote at Goodyear's annual meeting on April 5. During 1992, Goodyear took a one-time net charge of Dollars 1.01bn on the adoption of two non-cash accounting changes. As a result, Goodyear posted a net loss of Dollars 658.6m, or Dollars 9.22 a share, in 1992, compared with net income of Dollars 96.6m, or Dollars 1.61. Stripping out the charges and other one-time items, Goodyear earned Dollars 367.3m, or Dollars 5.14, in the year compared with Dollars 74.5m, or Dollars 1.24, in 1991. Sales advanced 8 per cent to Dollars 11.78bn from Dollars 10.91bn. During the fourth quarter, Goodyear had gains of Dollars 75.9m from the sale of its polyester resin assets which was partly offset by charges of Dollars 39.6m for workforce restructuring and charges of Dollars 15.8m for the planned sale of its roofing busi ness and other items. Goodyear's debt stood at Dollars 1.9bn at the end of 1992, compared with Dollars 2.6bn at the end of 1991 and Dollars 3.7bn in mid-1991. As a result, the company's interest expense fell to Dollars 232.9m at the end of the year from Dollars 217.8m a year earlier. Selling, administrative and general expenses rose to Dollars 8.97bn at the year end from Dollars 8.41bn a year earlier, reflecting higher advertising spending. Goodyear's tyre sales rose 6 per cent in the fourth quarter to Dollars 2.4bn, but operating income dropped 39 per cent to Dollars 125.9m. The oil transportation segment had operating income of Dollars 347,000 in the fourth quarter compared with a loss of Dollars 5.4m a year earlier.</p>

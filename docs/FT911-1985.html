			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Money Markets: A further easing THERE WAS a further easing of wholesale interest rates in London yesterday after Tuesday's cut in the US discount rate encouraged speculation about lower UK bank base rates. Trading was quiet with many European centres closed for May Day. Three-month sterling interbank fell to 11-11 9/16 from 11 3/4 -11 5/8 per cent, while 12-month money was quoted at 11 5/16 -11 3/16 against 11 5/16  11 1/4 per cent. Prices of short sterling futures were steady on Liffe. June delivery opened a little firmer at 88.84 and moved within a range of 88.79 to 88.86, before closing unchanged at 88.83. The Bank of England initially forecast a day-to-day credit shortage of Pounds 750m on the cash market, but revised this to Pounds 700m at noon and to Pounds 600m in the afternoon. Total assistance of Pounds 565m was provided. Before lunch the authorities bought Pounds 95m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. In the afternoon another Pounds 360m bank bills were purchased in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent. Late help of Pounds 110m was also provided. Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up of Treasury bills drained Pounds 237m, with exchequer transactions absorbing Pounds 335m, a rise in the note circulation Pounds 135m and bank balances below target Pounds 45m. In New York the Federal Reserve added temporary reserve to the banking system, via overnight system repurchase agreements, as Federal funds traded as high as 6 1/8 per cent, against the new assumed target rate of 5 3/4 per cent following Tuesday's easing of the Fed's monetary stance. In Amsterdam the Dutch Central Bank left its intervention rate at 8.70 per cent when offering six-day special advances to the domestic money market. The new facility will replace Fl 2.55bn draining from the market today as an earlier six-day pact expires. In Tokyo unsecured overnight call money was steady at 8 7/32 per cent, but may encounter upward pressure today ahead of a long weekend holiday closing the financial markets tomorrow and on Monday. Fixed periods had a soft tone, amid speculation that the Bank of Japan is now more likely to cut its discount rate after Tuesday's move by the Fed, despite official denials from Tokyo.</p>

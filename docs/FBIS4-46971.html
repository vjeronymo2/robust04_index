			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by the Independent Institute of Social and National </F> Problems: "After the Presidential Elections"]    [Text] In the December 1992 referendum on the independence  of Ukraine, 54.2 percent of the voters of Crimea voted for  independence. It became immediately obvious after the plebiscite  that the people had cast their votes for independence without  being in the least guided by the national idea, but by a hope  for a better economic situation, in comparison with Russia, and  a quick reformation of the economy of Ukraine, whose  possibilities were being touted by prominent politicians and  economists. The lack of economic reforms led with catastrophic  speed to a drop in the standard of living and placed the economy  of Ukraine on the brink of a crash.    The Crimean parties and movements that came out for the  independence of Crimea or annexation to Russia acquired a  political weight in direct proportional dependence on a  worsening of the economic situation. The most active was the  Republican Movement of Crimea (later organized into the  Republican Party of Crimea), headed by Yuriy Meshkov.    Yuriy Meshkov, who won convincingly in the presidential  elections, gained this victory most of all owing to economic  promises: The inclusion of Crimea in the ruble zone and the  establishment of close economic ties with Russia. One of  Meshkov's main promises before the first round of voting was the  conduct of a referendum on the status of Crimea; however, after  the adoption by the Ukrainian parliament of amendments to the  Constitution that allowed the president of Ukraine to revoke the  decisions of the Crimean authorities that do not conform to  Ukrainian legislation, Meshkov softened his position  significantly regarding relations with Ukraine just before the  second round, and he even began to say that there is no question  of secession from Ukraine. Meshkov did not set forth a distinct  economic program describing the mechanism of proposed  reorganizations, either during the preelection campaign or after  his victory. A reputation for an unpredictable policy, which was  reinforced among many observers, was confirmed by Meshkov during  the course of his visit to Moscow, already as president. The  sensation of this visit was the offer to Russian economist  Yevgeniy Saburov of the post of prime minister of the Republic  of Crimea after a two-day acquaintanceship.    A successful and quick reformation of the Crimean economy,  which the newly elected president promises, is extremely  problematic. There is no strong authority in Crimea now that is  capable of implementing its decisions; there are no borders,  customs, or an currency emissions bank. In fact, the Crimean  economy cannot be fully fledged while being in strict dependence  on the economy and monetary systems of Ukraine and Russia.    Local observers note the rather tense mutual relations of  the  president and the old managerial apparatus. The Supreme Soviet  of Crimea and the "party in power" that was formed, relying on  Nikolay Bagrov, the speaker of parliament, a rival of Meshkov in  the presidential elections, is in no hurry to support the  radical steps of the newly elected president that are capable of  leading to a confrontation with Ukrainian authorities. Moreover,  the invitation to Yevgeniy Saburov to work in the Crimea aroused  displeasure both among a significant part of the local political  elite and in government circles.    The first economic projects that could be heard from the  lips  of Yuriy Meshkov (the introduction of the ruble together with  the Ukrainian coupon into monetary circulation, the use of  Crimea as a landing site for "Shuttles" and "Burans") and  Yevgeniy Saburov, who has assumed the duties of deputy prime  minister (the establishment of a multiple currency regime, in  which not only rubles and coupons will be in circulation  simultaneously, but also dollars, marks, and others, and the  speedy transformation of the Crimea into an international  tourist health resort center) are unrealistic.    Crimea's economy is rigidly tied to the Ukrainian economy.  It  is sufficient to mention two factors that are essential to the  vital activity of the peninsula: The drinking water and electric  power come from Ukraine. A change in the status of the Crimea  will at least lead to a switch to world prices for water and  electric power, which the Crimean economy cannot endure.    On 24 February, the Supreme Council of Ukraine passed the  decree "On the Status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea in  Accordance with the Constitution and Legislation of Ukraine."  The decree instructed the Supreme Council of Crimea in a month's  time to bring the laws and Constitution of Crimea into  conformity with Ukrainian legislation, and the president of  Ukraine--to ensure the implementation of the law on the  representation of the president of Ukraine in Crimea and  together with the procurator general of Ukraine to react in a  timely way to violations of the legislation of Ukraine by  Crimean authorities. This document was Kiev's first reaction to  the development of the Crimean situation after the election of  the president, and it became a warning on the readiness of  Ukrainian authorities to take harsh measures in the event of  attempts to change the status of Crimea.    The position of official Kiev is supported by the majlis of  the Crimean Tatar people. It declared its nonrecognition of the  institution of president, which is recorded in the Crimean  Constitution, inasmuch as it was adopted without the  participation of representatives of the indigenous people, and  also nonrecognition of the presidential powers of persons whose  policy will be directed at ignoring the right of the Crimean  Tatars to self-determination. Thus, the Crimean Tatars reserve  for themselves the right of acts of civil disobedience and even  more resolute measures.    It can be claimed that stability in the Republic of Crimea  will depend to a significant degree on the position of Russia,  which has not been clearly stated at an official level to this  day. The attempts to strengthen Russian influence in Crimea on a  state level will lead to serious complications in  Russian-Ukrainian relations and will most likely arouse a  negative reaction on the part of the world community. This  variant is entirely possible: Ukraine will reject the removal of  nuclear weapons from its territory in the event of unilateral  actions by Russia with respect to Crimea, inasmuch as this will  be a violation of the guarantees of security given by Russia in  the signing of pertinent documents. Thus, Crimea becomes one of  the important factors of the stability of the European part of  the former USSR.</p>

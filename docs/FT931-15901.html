			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Property: Confusion clouds the listing regulations - A look at legislation related to historic buildings and considers what help is available for preservation DURING the 1980s almost half a million property owners were forced to accept the obligations of their building becoming 'listed'. After the demolition of the Art Deco Firestone factory in west London, over the 1980 August bank holiday when the building was about to be listed, Michael Heseltine, then environment secretary, ordered a relisting of properties. But while estate agents now cite Grade I, II* or II listing to certify that a house has quality - and English Heritage (EH) prosecutes owners for deliberate damage - public understanding of listing, and what you may or may not do to your house, has lagged. And the regulations for VAT relief - an important consideration when a refurbishment bill can be as much as Pounds 100,000 on a large property - seem to counteract the intentions of listed status. Recession has contributed to the confusion. Applications for listed building consent for alterations have become much less frequent which has meant few planning disputes have arisen and a smaller body of case law exists than if work on listed buildings had continued at the pace it did in the 1980s. As a result, less pressure has been put on the chancellor to give VAT relief to those who are legally obliged to maintain the best buildings in Britain, although EH, the Historic Houses Association and the Country Landowners Association regularly remind him of how he could help. Of the 440,000 buildings in England certified by listing as the country's premier building stock and of architectural or historical importance, about 6,000 are Grade I, 29,000 are Grade II* and 405,000 are Grade II. EH submits candidates for listing to the Department of the Environment for approval. In spite of EH's efforts, the DoE has approved few modern buildings. After a building is listed its details are recorded in the 'Green Books', which are available from local planning authorities and sometimes public libraries. If you are buying a listed house, ask the vendor's agent for a copy of the entry and check if it is included in Pevsner's Buildings of England. Regular maintenance does not require building consent. Once a building is listed, owners are obliged to maintain it, as the Guide to the Legislation Relating to Listed Buildings of Simmons &amp; Simmons (solicitors) and Jackson-Stops (estate agents) explains. Owners may apply for a grant to make up some of the cost. (Ask first at your local authority. EH is unlikely to give grants except for large sums and important buildings.) Anything that 'alters the character' of the house requires consent. For Grade I and II* houses, the local authority usually refers the matter to EH and amenity societies such as the Georgian Group. If it is about to approve the work, an 28-day delay allows the DoE to consider whether it will refuse permission. If the owner wants to demolish a substantial part or all of a listed building, the case goes automatically to the DoE and the other bodies. When an owner neglects a building, the local authority can issue orders specifying work that needs to be done or do the work itself and present the bill. The ultimate sanction is for the council to acquire the building by compulsory purchase, when the price is based on the present state of the building. North Shropshire District Council acquired Pell Wall Hall for just Pounds 1. EH's Buildings at Risk survey estimates that around 37,000 listed buildings are at risk from neglect, more than 900 in London. If a Grade I or II* building is at risk and could be used if restored, chances of a grant from EH are higher. Present VAT rules do not help the conscientious owner. Regular repairs which can be extremely expensive - for example if a large house needs to be re-roofed - attract VAT at the usual 17.5 per cent. Only work that changes the building and needs listed building consent is exempt from VAT. These rules make no sense. The new work may negate features for which the building was listed in the first place. They give owners an incentive to make unnecessary changes in order to keep the bill down. Although most owners feel the pinch on regular maintenance, Adrian Dobinson, of Renaissance Partnership in Bath, (tel: 0225 314426) says: 'No government in the world is going to give you VAT relief for clearing the gutters or repainting. They go with living in any house.' But if the colour or even the hue of the paint is changed and consent is applied for, help is available. A DoE directive issued under Lord Ridley when he was environment secretary accepts that this changes the character of a building and so qualifies this for the relief. Dobinson's firm specialises in listed buildings and sends its own team of builders around the country, as he has found it hard to ensure that local builders do the job properly. Dobinson says VAT relief is not the hurdle that many owners think. But obtaining it requires the consent and a carefully specified list of works. More jobs qualify than many people imagine and Dobinson has a body of precedents ready to cite to the Customs and Excise which, he says, is generally helpful. Insurance is another unrecognised problem. Take advice. If the house burns down, you are legally liable to put it up again as it was. But the cost of doing so is likely to be more - even twice or three times - than what you would get for selling the property. 'Take everything into account', says Dawn Carritt, of agents Jackson-Stops, 'even the garden walls, if you have an old walled garden and they are listed'. If you are buying a house, check whether any of the walls, gates or statuary has a listing of its own and make sure that everything is insured for its replacement cost. If you are in doubt about how much to insure for, consult an estate agent or chartered surveyor. In a third grey area (but one which is slowly becoming better defined) are the fixtures of listed buildings, as Coming Unstuck - a recent report by the Victorian Society - highlights. If a building is listed, its fixtures (such as fireplaces, staircases and door frames which are physically attached to it and garden ornaments) are covered by the listing. Whether or not the Green Book entry specifies them, it is illegal to remove them without consent, which is unlikely to be given, as it is bound to change the character of the house. Sadly, many fixtures are lost through theft and by owners cashing them in. The Victorian Society recommends that local authorities be given the power to serve stop notices when fixtures are under threat and urges tougher control on the sale of fixtures from listed buildings. It should be illegal to offer them on the expectation of (retrospective) consent. If you want to embellish your house with architectural antiques, make sure the dealer or auctioneer tells you where they have come from. It would be sad if they had to be pulled from your house to be restored to their rightful home.

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / BT staff stage walk-outs and demonstration British Telecommunications faces unofficial walk-outs and a demonstration in London today by managerial and professional staff in protest over a briefing on their pay prospects for next year. BT told the Society of Telecom Executives it intended to differentiate between skills and jobs principally in the light of the external market, rather than traditional internal relativities. Pay would be linked to performance. The society said this stance threatened to drive down pay and did nothing to redress the effects of the pay freeze imposed this year. The next pay agreement starts in April.</p>

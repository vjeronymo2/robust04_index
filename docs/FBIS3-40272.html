After his return, Peterle said that the Slovene delegation  signed an agreement on establishing diplomatic relations with  Kirghizia; a similar agreement was also reached with Uzbekistan.  The delegation signed agreements on cultural cooperation and on  developing closer economic relations with Kazakhstan and  Turkmenistan. Several economists were invited to Slovenia to  attend business meetings.    Peterle was accompanied by a group of Slovene businessmen.

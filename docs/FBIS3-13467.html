			<p>Language: <F P=105>English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Dev Prakash] </F>   [Text] In violation of the spirit of bilateralism,  good-neighborliness and the Simla Agreement, Pakistan has been  mounting an assault on India at the international forums on the  so-called violation of human rights in J and K [Jammu and  Kashmir] and Punjab. Pakistan has been pampered by the  uncalled-for statements based on half-truth by President Clinton  and other officials of the USA. Suffering from innate sense of  political insecurity pretending to rule with the help of ISI  [Inter Service Intelligence], Ms. Bhutto seems to have lost all  [word indistinct] bearing and composure. [sentence as heard]  She is suffering from the illusion that she can annex Kashmir,  it being a Muslim-majority border state, or by championing the  cause of Muslims in Kashmir she can seek leadership of the  Islamic world. She has not only forgotten that millions of  people in her own country are deprived of fundamental freedom  and basic human rights, but also that she is losing support all  over the world by deporting terrorism to India and other  neighboring countries.    To expose Pakistan's false propaganda against India on human  rights violation, India as of late allowed nongovernmental  organizations, individuals, and envoys of various countries to  see for themselves the condition in J and K. This has helped  India in enhancing its credibility at the international forums.  Innocent people are being butchered by Pakistan-trained  extremists in the valley. Thousands of foreign mercenaries,  especially Afghans, are attacking Indian security forces before  mingling with masses at crowded places to avoid retaliation.  And if in retaliation any civilian is killed in cross-fire,  Indian forces are blamed for violating human rights.    Delhi-based ambassadors and high commissioners of 10 Western  and Islamic countries visited J and K last week and met leaders  of Hurriet Conference at the residence of their leader, Mirwaiz  Umar Farooq, who was there with their leaders like Maulvi  Ansari, Qazi Abdullah, Professor Ghani and Javed Ahmad. The  envoy's team also met among others acting president of the JKLF  [Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front]; human rights commission  officials; and [Kashmir] Governor, General, retired, K.V.  Krishna Rao. These diplomats from Bulgaria, Hungary, Nigeria,  Senegal, Turkey, Indonesia, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia and  Canada have met people holding all shades of opinion and have  realized the role played by Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. The  reaction proves the success of the center's federal government's  new policy to open up Kashmir and invite the envoys to visit it.    The separatists would not have to adjust [as heard] to the  fact that the other side of the story would also get  international exposure. Only last month, ambassadors of  Belgium, Greece and Germany had visited Kashmir to assess the  situation for themselves. India has also invited the member  countries of the ICO [Islamic Conference Organization] to send  their envoys to the state. It has permitted the International  Committee of the Red Cross to send a team to the state and is  currently negotiating with Amnesty International too which is  keen in visiting the valley. Earlier, U.S. secretary of state  [title as heard], Ms. Robin [Raphel], had paid a visit on her  own to the valley. The misunderstanding and falsehood spread by  the Pakistani lobby is gradually being cleared up and there is  now a greater appreciation of the Indian position that it is the  victim of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism.    On the basis of Vienna Declaration, the UN Human Rights  Commission on 4 March adopted a resolution condemning terrorism  and calling upon the international community to fight the menace  at the national, regional, and international levels. It also  expressed concern at the gross violation of human rights by  terrorist groups by saying that it cannot be justified under any  circumstances. It is a big blow to Pakistan which is spreading  fundamentalism in various countries.    In Kashmir, Pakistan has tried to create religious cleavages  and divide. It has resulted in the ethnic cleansing and  large-scale displacement of people. Efforts are being made to  change the demographic profile of the Kashmir Valley. Coming to  Pakistan's own record of human rights, the latest reports of  Asia Watch and Human Rights Commission of Pakistan are  eye-openers as they have accused the Pakistani Government of  severe abuse of human rights of minorities and women in  particular.</p>

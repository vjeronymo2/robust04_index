			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 6--On the completion of the  week-long foreign visit to Switzerland and Germany, the Prime  Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, returned home today, highly  satisfied with the interactions with political and business  leaders.    Declining to address the customary on-board conference on  his  special aircraft, Mr. Rao just told presspersons in his  delegation that "you have seen how the visit went off. I don't  think I have anything more to add."    The task of elaborating on the Prime Minister's successful  trip was left to the top officials who accompanied him,  including his Principal Secretary, Mr. A.N. Verma, the Finance  Secretary, Mr. Montek Singh Ahluwalia and the Foreign Secretary,  Mr. K. Srinivasan. These officials drew attention to some of the  significant aspects of the Prime Ministerial visit both in terms  of economic and political content.    On the economic front, there were two factors which emerged  from the visit. In Davos for instance, Mr. Rao chose the  gathering of world business leaders to clarify India's position  that it would go along on the path of economic reforms, but  would choose its own pace and direction.  <H5>  Pressure Resisted </H5>   The insistent pressure on India to speed up the reforms  process has been resisted by the assertion that the country  would not blindly follow the prescriptions laid down by "people  sitting thousands of miles away, but would instead choose its  own model of development, suited to its genius and  circumstances." In other words, potential foreign investors have  been assured of the Government's commitment to the reforms  process but with the caution that all their demands would not be  met.    "There is a standard check-list with these people before  they  take investment decisions. Has the country de-regulated; has it  lowered tariff barriers; has it privatised (meaning the public  sector); has it liberalised labour laws, etc. We have said "Yes"  to some of these points and "No" to the others. That is our  position and it has been made clear to the investors what to  expect from India," a senior official said.    That the Indian official position this year could be  different from what it was in 1992--the Prime Minister's first  visit to Davos--is obviously based on the stronger economic  position today. With foreign exchange reserves of over $10  billions, with a large number of proposals for foreign direct  investment being cleared and with buoyant foreign institutional  investment in the stock markets, India could afford to take a  stronger stand at Davos this time, the official added. This  strong economic position is reinforced by the fact that India is  now definitely on the "investment radar screen" of most  industrial groups, particularly with the collapse of the  expectations that had arisen with the changes in eastern Europe  two years ago.    "The euphoria about Russia is over. The other markets don't  show much prospects. The Asian region and India are the few  bright spots for investors and most of them are aware that they  should be in India in the medium term. This is the message we  got in Davos," the official added.  <H5>  Industry, Government Mix </H5>   The second important development of the Prime Ministerial  visit is the new relationship established between Government and  industry. This was evident not only in Davos but also in Germany  where the inter-mixing of the official and industrial delegation  was so much that the entire entourage of industrial leaders  practically became part of the Prime Minister's delegation.    The meeting between Indian and German industrialists in Bonn  was held in the office of the German Chancellor, Mr. Helmut  Kohl. "This is unprecedented. Never has the NATO [North Atlantic  Treaty Organisation] room of the Chancellor's office been thrown  open for an industrial meet," the Indian Ambassador in Bonn, Mr.  K.S. Rana, pointed out. The second point to note was that at  this meeting, where Mr. Rao and Mr. Kohl were present, the top  bureaucrats of the Government of India literally took a back  seat and were seated behind the Indian industrial delegation.  "This too has never happened before. Imagine the Finance  Secretary sitting behind an industrialist," one official pointed  out.    "The industrialists were given the signal that they were as  much important in selling India as an investment destination as  the Government. This close relationship between Government and  industry is a new development, unlike in the past when  officialdom maintained a distance from industry," the official  said.  <H5>  Politically Significant </H5>   On the political front too, Mr. Rao's second visit to  Germany  in a little over two years is of much significance. As is known,  this is an election year in Germany, including that for the  Federal Chancellery and going by indications available now, Mr.  Kohl faces an extremely difficult task in getting re-elected.  His bane has been the economy, which has come under severe  pressure with the unification of West and East Germany, an  achievement for which Mr. Kohl had taken the entire credit in  the past.    Today, there is over 10 per cent unemployment in the  country,  the economy is expected to grow at zero per cent and interest  rates are too high for fresh investment. In short, the economy  is in recession and is burdened by the continuing cost of  reconstruction of the eastern parts.    Mr. Rao's singular political achievement with this visit has  been the establishment of a rapport with the entire political  spectrum in Germany. The packed schedule that the Prime Minister  had in Bonn was marked for the more meetings he had with  Opposition political leaders against the one meeting with Mr.  Kohl. Moreover, the message that Mr. Rao got from these meetings  was that India would continue to be a priority area for Germany,  irrespective of the Government that comes to office after the  October elections.    "The Asia Policy of Mr. Kohl has national support and this  has been confirmed by the political leaders who met the Prime  Minister. Thus, India would remain a partner of choice and the  strategic partnership between the two countries would remain  unaltered even with political changes in Germany. This assurance  has been received by India," another top official in the Prime  Ministerial entourage said.</p>

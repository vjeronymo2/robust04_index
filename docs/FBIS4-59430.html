The  forces of unity, democracy, and modernization notify brother  citizens residing in the vicinity of the bloody al-Ahmar gang  and their supporters in Sanaa, Ta'izz, and al-Hudaydah to  temporarily vacate in order to avoid injury arising from the  crimes of the members of this bloody (?killer) family that  ignited the fires of total war against our people and their  honorable and loyal forces.

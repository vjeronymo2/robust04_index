As part of a worldwide restructuring, the multinational group's UK subsidiary will announce today that its Copy Products and Business Imaging Systems divisions are being merged to form a new division, Kodak Office Imaging. Kodak intends to exploit its expertise in handling images in the rapidly expanding electronic business information technology sector. Kodak Office Imaging will be responsible for providing a range of products and services spanning all areas of business document imaging - scanning, microfilming, digi-tising, manipulation, enhancement, retrieval, transmit-ting, receiving, printing, publishing and photocopying. Mr Mike Mansell, who heads the new division in the UK, said: 'Kodak is determined to enhance its customers' business performance by offering complete,tailored solutions across the whole spectrum of office imaging.' Kodak recognises that its commercial business has been overshadowed by its consumer photographic business, and its previous business structure  - around an autonomous business units - failed to fully capitalise on commercial customer relationships. The company is also signalling that it expects to enter into more strategic alliances and co-operative product developments where its can build upon its imaging expertise. Kodak employs 7,000 people in the UK and has total domestic sales of Pounds 400m (Dollars 7240m).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Sladkov, including recorded </F> comment by Stanislav Terekhov, chairman of the Officers' Union;  from the "Vesti" newscast]    [Text] [Sladkov] The Russian Power Party [Rossiyskaya  Derzhavnaya Partiya] is the name of the new political party that  today held the second stage of its founding conference in Moscow  Oblast. The most active sections of the Officers' Union, the  National Salvation Front, and of other small patriotic groupings  were the initiators for creating the party.    [Terekhov] We are beginning to work differently from the  image of being extremists both in the streets and at meetings by  which the people had known us. We are going to defend our  stance in a serious way not by shouting in the streets but by  our deeds.    [Sladkov] According to Stanislav Terekhov, from now on the  patriots will start nominating their candidates to all levels of  state power as the continuation of the struggle to bring to  power the people to whom the interests of the country are above  everything else. Incidently, every leader always talks about  his love for his motherland and if that leader is the supreme  leader of the country he should be a professional.</p>

			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SECURITY GUARD ACQUITTED IN RAPE OF TRANSIENT  </P> <P> A Long Beach jury deliberated less than 90 minutes Wednesday before acquitting  a security guard of raping a homeless woman in the basement of a local  ministry.  </P> <P> Calvin Farrell, 35, was found not guilty after a monthlong trial in which he  was accused of luring a 33-year-old woman into a room at the Christian Outreach  Appeal to "talk Bible."  </P> <P> He has been jailed on a $10,000 bond since Nov. 14.  </P> <P> Deputy Public Defender Jerry Berger argued that the woman consented to having  sex, then conspired to "set up" Farrell, whose security job made him unpopular  among the homeless. Deputy Dist. Atty. Carol Rose, who spoke with the jurors  afterward, said the panel did not believe the witnesses on either side -- most  of whom were homeless.  </P> <P> "It is very difficult for jurors to separate the way of life of the witnesses  from their testimony," she said. "I guess the homeless are just not considered  credible."  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AMTRAK ADDS 2 DAILY ROUTES SERVING BURBANK  </P> <P> After two years of rumbling through on their way between Santa Barbara and San  Diego, Amtrak trains will provide Burbank with twice-daily service beginning  today.  </P> <P> A southbound train to San Diego via Los Angeles is scheduled to stop each day  at the former CalTrain platform on Empire Avenue near Burbank Airport at 9:48  a.m. A northbound train to Santa Barbara will stop there at 8:18 p.m.  </P> <P> The stops are the result of a three-year campaign by Burbank officials to  attract Amtrak to the city, which has been without rail service since the  short-lived CalTrain commuter line stopped running in 1983. A platform built  for CalTrain on the Southern Pacific tracks along Empire Avenue has remained  unused since the service, a joint operation between Southern Pacific and the  state Department of Transportation, was halted because of low ridership.  </P></p>

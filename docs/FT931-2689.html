			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Rocard sows fresh discord among left MR Michel Rocard yesterday sowed further dissension in his Socialist party, which faces electoral defeat in Sunday's general election, by repeating his open criticism of President Francois Mitterrand. In an interview in Le Figaro newspaper yesterday, Mr Rocard, considered the party's likely standard-bearer in the 1995 presidential election, toned down earlier remarks that Socialists were generally being victimised by an electorate which had 'personal scores to settle' with Mr Mitterrand. Popular sentiment against the president was 'without doubt unjust', and Socialists had to accept some of the blame for it, he said. A recent poll showed 62 per cent of voters disapproved of Mr Mitterrand's performance, and only 24 per cent approved. However, Mr Rocard went on to criticise Mr Mitterrand for failing, following his 1988 presidential election victory, to reach out properly to parties to the left and centre of the Socialists. The president had chosen to deal 'with individuals and not with political forces'. This was why, Mr Rocard said, he himself had recently called for a 'big bang' recomposition of the left after this month's election. The criticism, four days before the first round of parliamentary voting, provoked embarrassment and anger among Socialists. Mrs Martine Aubry, labour minister, accused Mr Rocard of political cowardice. 'To blame others, whether within or outside one's party, shows a lack of courage and is especially worrisome for the rebuilding of the left,' she said. In a reminder that Mr Rocard was prime minister from 1988 to 1991, she said: 'It's a collective failure.' Mr Michel Sapin, finance minister and a Rocard protege, said his mentor 'could have spared us such unnecessary little comments'. Mr Charles Pasqua, a hard-line Gaullist, lauded Mr Mitterrand for at least having had the courage during the campaign to 'climb to the bridge of the sinking Socialist ship and to tie himself to its mast, in the old navy tradition'. The Rocard-Mitterrand rift reflects long-standing personal rancour, but may just be a foretaste of internal Socialist recrimination. It overshadowed the government's last pre-election cabinet meeting. That gathering produced a proposal to use privatisation proceeds to fund state pensions, calls for the EC to raise fish prices to help distressed French fishermen and demands that Brussels desist from deregulation of European utility monopolies. Opinion polls show that more than 75 per cent of farmers plan to vote for the right-wing opposition, which has pledged to renegotiate last year's reform of EC agriculture policy. Some 2,000 employees of Thomson Tubes Electroniques, which makes television tubes, voted yesterday to share work among themselves in order to avoid 412 redundancies threatened by the management.</p>

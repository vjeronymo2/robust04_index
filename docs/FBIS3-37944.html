			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Boris Yeltsin to the Federal Assembly </F> in Moscow -- live]    [Text] Esteemed chairmen of the Federation Council and the  State Duma, esteemed members of the Federation Council, esteemed  deputies of the State Duma: It is with special feeling that I  have stepped to this podium. Today's address is an  extraordinary event in my life and in my political career. It  is the first time that the new Russian parliament is to hear the  president's address.    Russia begins to chart its policy in a new way. Writing this  address was not an easy task. The difficulty was because I  wanted to put too many things into it. We need to accomplish  still more. Therefore, it is important not to dissipate our  efforts and concentrate everything--our resources, political  will, intellectual potential, and the people's enormous desire  to live better--on the key areas in order to achieve the results  together.    This is why not only the present situation but also the  ideas  for the future proposed by you--including those put forward  during the election campaign--are reflected in this address.    Regrettably, in 1993 a lot of energy was expended on tough  political confrontation. Extreme measures could not be avoided,  either. But we prevented civil war. People could see for  themselves that there would be no winners in an irreconcilable  struggle. It can have only one result--the destruction of  Russia. The time of internecine strife has expired completely  for Russia.    There were successes and profound disappointments on the  path  of reforms. But if you ask me today if I would start these  difficult changes again, the answer will be unequivocally yes.  Both then and now I am convinced that there was no other path.  In January 1992 we were forced to start something we could not  avoid.    We are gradually learning lessons during every month of our  lives. It is impossible to transform a country like Russia in  one attempt. What is needed is a flexible, long-term,  anticipatory policy that takes into account Russia's  peculiarities, the national character, and changes in the public  interests and moods--the mentality of the people of  Russia--which for decades was being molded in a different  direction.    In the last few months we have come to understand better one  important truth: In order to achieve success, we need to bring  into play tremendous and so far almost unused reserves--the  reserves of cooperation in constructive work. This is an  indisputable requirement for all of us, for those who have  entered parliament, for those who are prepared to share the  responsibility for Russia's destiny.    Let us be realistic and let us acknowledge that a part of  the  opposition still wants to take revenge by force. On both sides  there are those blinded by the need to take revenge on their  ideological opponents. However, hatred and the thirst for  vengeance can only worsen Russia's serious illness.    I want to say another thing: Social accord is not  forgiveness for all. Compassion is compassion only when it does  not contravene the law and moral standards. There is a  foundation for accord in Russia today: the  Constitution--adopted by a popular vote. Let us ask ourselves:  Is there another, more solid foundation? There is not.    No one party, no one movement, no one group of  intellectuals,  no one politician or statesman has the same degree of support  today as the Constitution. It won the votes of people of the  most varied convictions and outlooks. Having lost faith in many  things, they nonetheless went to the polling stations and gave  to the state a law that is binding, above all, on those who are  in power.    Our country is experiencing today one of the most complex  moments of its history; however, Russia did not begin with Peter  the Great or the October Revolution of 1917. It does not end  with the collapse of the communist superpower. The empire that  not long ago intimidated all of mankind while suppressing real  life for the Russian people and all of its other peoples is no  more.    The Russian state, however, has still not taken a worthy  place in the world community. We no longer have the state that  acted as a strict supervisor and ruthless judge toward its  subjects. We should also acknowledge, however, that there is  still the absence of a fully democratic and lawful state in  Russia.    Most people are constantly worried about what tomorrow will  bring, about the future of their children and their elderly  parents. But the authorities, both in the center and in the  regions, seem not to notice the rapid stratification of society.  One has to act responsibly and acknowledge that we are  underestimating all the dangers this stratification brings.    I am not calling for a return to universal egalitarianism in  poverty, to the notorious dispossession of the kulaks. But in  this matter, in this extremely fine matter so painful for  society, one should not allow the process to be totally  spontaneous and uncontrolled.    We are painfully learning that a bureaucratic and  self-devouring economy, in which 10 people are doing what one  person can normally do, has no future. But so far we do not  have a normal market economy either. It is those who cheat and  use violence who are at ease. The honest, enterprising people  who are not afraid of working and taking risks find it extremely  difficult today to start their own business and grow.    All these are today's realities, however hard it is to admit  it. True, our country has greater freedom, but this is not  enough. Our task is to ensure that Russia has greater justice,  security, and confidence in today and tomorrow. We have already  seen that it is impossible to build Russia properly at the will  of some manager, party, or individual. The time has come for a  new political style of trust and constructive cooperation,  mutual understanding, and agreed action. The time has come for  a nationwide action that can unite efforts of all of us. We  have such an action. It is the strengthening of statehood, the  strengthening of the Russian state. Let's acknowledge at last:  As long as we have a weak state, there is no basic law and  order in the country. All residents of the country and all  peoples of Russia are interested in a stable and strong state  because all of us, irrespective of our nationality or place of  residence, need civil peace and not interethnic conflicts. All  parties and political movements and all factions of the State  Duma should be interested in strengthening the state. It is  only in a sound and strong state that they can count on an  honest implementation of the interests of their supporters.    Our closest neighbors have a vested interest in the Russian  state being stable and strong, for it is precisely a strong  Russia that is the most reliable and realistic guarantor of  stability for the whole territory of the former USSR.    The world community also needs a strong Russia; otherwise,  it  will be a permanent source of threat to security and to mankind.  A strong and vigorous state is a most important condition for  the continuation of transformations in our country. A healthy  and civilized market will not gain a firm foothold without such  a state; nor will democracy reveal its true worth or the great  Russian culture and morality be reborn. The strengthening of  our state is an indisputable goal that can and should unite all  Russian people in this dramatic period the country is going  through.    The strengthening of the state is a task for us all. It will  make it possible for the president, the Federal Assembly, the  government, and the constituent parts of the Federation to all  channel their energy for the good of Russia.    We began this work many times over the past few years;  however, until now it had no legal basis to underpin it and was  carried out in a chaotic and inconsistent manner. The state, in  its current configuration, fails to cope with its most important  functions. This pertains, above all, to safeguarding order and  the rights and safety of citizens.    The country is being engulfed by crime. To this day, the  existing state structures are permeated by a spirit of  irresponsibility and arbitrariness. Life in our country is  still bound up in innumerable petty restrictions and  limitations. The work of both central and local authorities  suffers from much confusion and incompetence. The army of  bureaucrats is rapidly growing. In a situation of heightened  financial tension, the federal authorities, with amazing ease,  are spending vast sums of money on themselves. This growing  appetite is doing more to undermine the state's reputation than  any mistakes or miscalculations. This is not to mention the  taxpayers' pocket: It is their money that supports all of us.    All this testifies to the fact that a new alienation between  the authorities and the everyday needs of the people is  appearing and has appeared. If bureaucracy previously stood  between them and the nomenkatura caste, then today money must be  included as well.    It is precisely the disgrace of corruption that is  increasingly often the gulf preventing a solution to many  issues. This is what I was speaking of: the grave illness of  Russian statehood. The task to unite us today--the president,  parliament, and government--is to stop these destructive  processes. We do not have to create anything. We have only one  effective medicine and that is to strengthen the state on the  basis of the Constitution.    This will produce a result if we work together. We need a  common program of state reforms in the Russian Federation. Its  strategic aims are:    First, the state authorities should work not for themselves  but for the precisely identified and formulated interests of  Russia and its citizens. This means a shift away from the  policy of impulsive reactions toward a strategy of considered  anticipatory actions.    Second, power should be effective. This means the desire and  ability to finish off what has been started and to assess very  toughly any possible shortcomings in the decisions made.  Judicial reform occupies an important place here. A strong  third estate does not weaken but, on the contrary, strengthens  the other estates. I attach particular importance to the  Constitutional Court, which should objectively interpret the  Constitution. Local self-government needs to be developed and  provided with legislation. In this connection, perhaps there  could be joint consideration of the timing of elections.  Serious attention needs to be paid to reform in the army, to  regulating the state border regime, and much more.    Third, an end must be put to the apparatus free-for-all, in  which any sensible decision or initiative is stifled in the  death grip of the apparatus. The method is known: the clear  regulation of functions and responsibilities. Unfortunately,  this is absent thus far.    Fourth, power must become open and understandable for  people.  This means that dialogue needs to be developed, the formation of  a civic society needs to be promoted, and we should not cut  ourselves off from the mass media, but rather help them to  pursue the policy of constantly removing state control from the  press--although, there needs to be moderation here as well, of  course.    The television channel that, via the Orbita system,  preserves  the integrity of the Russian information zone and encompasses  the near abroad and European countries, should have the state as  its proprietor.    A strong state is essential, above all, to combat crime.  This is the most important issue of the year. In this respect,  our cooperation is especially necessary. The public awaits from  the Federal Assembly laws on which the state can rely to defend  their safety and tranquillity. I think that it is correct to  combine two ideas here. The first is to continue preparation of  new criminal legislation. The current legislation is hopelessly  out of date, and it is increasingly difficult for the  law-enforcement agencies to use it to oppose criminality. The  second is to adopt laws designed to resolve urgent issues of  providing the law-enforcement agencies with the essential  statutory documents.    Rapid drafting and adoption by parliament of a law on  extraordinary measures to suppress crime should be the first  move in this direction. Russians will accept such a decision  with understanding. The law-enforcement system is also ready  for its implementation. Our mutual task in this area is not to  sink into a state of affairs in which extraordinary emergency  measures are again becoming institutionalized. We should not  allow any infringement of citizens' rights. We should give  necessary powers to the law-enforcement agencies. We should  also mobilize all the state and public institutions for fighting  crime and clearly define their tasks and their responsibilities.    Tired of waiting in vain for the federal legislative acts,  authorities in a number of regions have already started  implementing similar measures themselves. By doing this, they  have succeeded not only in putting criminal situation securely  under control, but also in improving it.    We have no right to economize on ensuring a secure  environment for our people in the present day situation.  However, we should finance only the clearly-defined areas and  programs aimed at fighting crime. A number of these have  already been drawn up and adopted. Together with long-term,  wide-scale measures, it is urgently important to implement  measures to combat street violence. Organized crime needs  special attention. Today its aim is to strangle the country.  Only by joint, decisive, and consistent actions will it be  possible to protect Russia from it. Specialists have been  suggesting such actions for a long time.    One of those measures are enshrined in law is to allow  law-enforcement bodies to use the potential amassed in the last  few years to launch sustained blows on organized crime and  corruption.    For all the people of Russia, strengthening the state has an  additional profound meaning. We are talking about preserving  the country. Russia is too dear to us to even think about its  disintegration. Unity cannot be ensured by force or deceit. It  cannot be preserved by setting some peoples against others. A  path of federalism is a path toward truly strengthening Russia.  It is clearly outlined in the Constitution. This does not  mean, however, that a federation has already been built.    The delimitation of powers and property between the federal  authorities and the constituent parts of the federation is  proceeding extremely slowly. During this year, this matter must  be sorted out.    Another no less important task is to build the vertical  structure of federal power in Russia. It is in the interests of  the federation that regions are granted maximum opportunities in  governing, but the functions retained by the federal authorities  must be performed in a coordinated manner throughout the  country--be it the system of national security, in the power  engineering complex, in the communications network, in the  information network, and so on.    It is the task of the year to surmount the clear injustice  with regard to regional benefits and privileges. Standard  criteria for the extension of benefits from the federal taxes  and credits are needed as the very air we breathe -- the clearer  they are, the less abuses there will be.    Interethnic conflicts, both within the country and near its  borders, pose a real threat to the stability of the Russian  Federation. Such conflicts are the result of previous  injustices and mutual grievances. Internecine strife and the  number of such conflicts grow day by day, hour by hour -- and  the longer this goes on, the more complicated it becomes to find  a way out and to heal the new and deep wounds.    Our country is more interested than anyone else in  eliminating interethnic conflicts. For as long as Russia feels  that it is a frontline state, there will be neither peace nor  prosperity in Russia. Practice has shown that apart from  Russia, no one is ready to take upon themselves the heavy burden  of peacemaking in this area of the world. Hence, our country's  role is all the more important and responsible.    Time is inexorably moving on. It is already 50 years ago  that one of the most monstrous crimes of the Stalinist regime  was committed -- repressions against whole peoples.  Deportations added shameful pages to our country's history.    On behalf of the Russian Federation, the successor of the  former Soviet Union, as head of state, I apologize to all the  citizens of Russia and their families who suffered from the  deportations. It is our civic duty to eradicate the  consequences of those terrible events. This difficult and  delicate work should unite and not divide, us. It should bring  people together and not breed further strife.    It is our duty to make 1994 a year of undivided attention to  the problems of the people of Russian origin who are living in  neighboring states. We have at our disposal a great number of  facts that are clear proof that our compatriots are being  subjected to discrimination. It is Russia's obligation to  strive -- not in words, but in deeds -- to ensure that such  practices are stopped. If one is talking about an infringement  of the lawful rights of the Russian people, it is not the  exclusively internal affair of one country or another, but it is  our own, state, national affair. I ask -- I even demand -- of  all branches of Russian state power that they follow this  principle rigorously.    I would also like to speak about our compatriots who are  returning to Russia from the new neighboring states to their  permanent homes. For the present they are not the children but  the stepchildren of Russia. There is no let-up in the flood of  settlers and refugees, but this means that one must no longer  accept the fact that no one takes their problems seriously or  carries true state responsibility. This is an immense problem.  A special program has already been worked out, and it will be  submitted by the government for endorsement by the Federal  Assembly. But in order for it to be implemented, what is  necessary is a pooling of our efforts and a concentration of  means.    Esteemed members of the Federation Council and deputies of  the State Duma: We have learned from our own experience that we  will not overcome the economic crisis or ensure the genuine  market order or make the economic situation predictable or  create prerequisites for the economic growth without a strong,  able state.    I know that after the December elections and changes in the  government, people both in Russia and abroad became worried  about the country's future economic course. I want to dispel  these worries. As long as I remain the president I will defend  and maintain the policy of economic transformations. In 1994 a  continuation of the economic reform will be one of the most  important directions of Russia's domestic policy.    Some important elements of market relations have already  emerged, such as economic freedom, the right to own property,  and working markets of goods and services. However, it is too  early to say that the Russian economy lives by laws of the  market. Now we have a combination of new market trends, which  are still weak, and of old command levers. The system of  administration and distribution has not disappeared without  trace: It has reshaped itself. Bureaucrats who used to deliver  plans and allocate funding have now entered the market and are  now distributing and often even trading in centralized credits,  export quotas, and licenses.    There is a continuing and strengthening trend toward  lobbying. Reform of the economic mechanism is proceeding very  unevenly.    The result is well-known; the crisis is abating slowly.  Output is continuing to fall, viable enterprises are closing  down, the country is tormented by inflation, and tension in  society is consistently high. The greatest mistake that could  be made today is to offer the public false alternatives: the  previous state-run command economy, or the so-called pure market  that is absolutely independent of the state. Both options are  ruinous for Russia and for the Russian economy.    The task is to find a sensible correlation between the speed  of reform and the realistic social price to be paid for it, to  enlist the powerful but as yet poorly used reserves within the  reforms, and to seek the optimum form of state involvement in  economic processes.    The past two years have shown that not only reform incurs a  social price. Still greater damage is being done by an economic  mechanism that is long overdue for change. It is time to  establish an effective state regulation that is compatible with  market mechanisms. This is one of the most important threads of  the current phase of the reforms.    The state should treat the state sector of the economy as an  owner, otherwise the confusion will not be overcome and the  squandering of the state sector by certain economic managers  will not be halted. The policy toward liberalization of exports  needs to be continued while, at the same time, state control  over the export of strategic raw materials and energy resources  from the country needs to be toughened.    It is vital that the government strengthen currency controls  and sanctions against offenders who are illegally concealing  currency resources abroad. Legislation needs to be changed.  Standards designed for an economy of centralized planning and  financial autonomy [khozraschet] are of no use now. Russia  needs an up-to-date and effective civil code. Its general  section has already been prepared, but I would ask the  government--which is conducting this work--to take account of  the provisions of presidential decrees, primarily those  concerning the economy. I intend to send the draft civil code,  as a whole, for examination by the Federal Assembly this year.    The year 1994 should be the year of the start of real  structural reorganization of the Russian economy. Russia should  only produce what is required by the individual, state, or world  market. The country should stop producing products nobody  needs. Of course, this is a very complex and costly task. It  cannot be solved in a short period of time, and especially, by  bans. This does not mean, however, that one should keep  avoiding it. Can it be that the government is still not  convinced that the absence of structural policy will bring about  structural degradation? It is already happening. We are  gradually losing modern technological infrastructure and most  valuable productions--first and foremost, hi-tech productions.  We are lagging behind not only world achievements, but we are  already lagging behind ourselves. The principle that says that  those will survive who can survive is ruinous. It is not those  who produce the best-quality output with the consumer in mind  who currently survive in Russia, but those who enjoy the most  perks and privileges, those who enjoy the authorities'  protection, and those capable of beating money out of the  government. If this tendency continues, the Russian economy can  and will become a market-based economy, but it will be primitive  and inefficient at the same time. It is high time the  government decide on structural priorities and act proceeding  from this.    Is there anything that prevents us from clearly defining  the membership of a group of producers which are of strategic  and great social importance to Russia, producers which are  highly competitive in the world markets? Specialists estimate  that this kind of group would not account for more than 10  percent of what is produced in Russia. It is precisely such  producers that must be given normal state support over the next  few years, while others should find this support substantially  cut within specific limits.    It is time to define what output is needed by the state and  in what volume. I have here in mind defense orders, too.  Directors of major enterprises have repeatedly put the same  request to me: to influence the government, so that the  government may let it be clearly understood to them whether or  not to produce this or that kind of output. It is just a yes or  a no. A yes means that financial obligations taken upon oneself  are fulfilled; a no means that no impediments are placed in the  way of the process of conversion.    A demonopolization of production in Russia is a most  important reserve of reforms. You cannot have normal economy  while one enterprise dictates to others its own conditions, just  because it happens to be the only one of its kind, producing its  particular line of goods. Monopolism in Russia took decades to  take shape. It was, in fact, a state policy, costing gigantic  sums and resources. Demonopolization will, likewise, require  tremendous effort and time. It must be started in real terms.    Investment policy can also be implemented during reform.  There is talk of an investment crisis and a lack of state money  to support industry, yet vast sums are being pumped into  selected sectors and enterprises. Meanwhile, as before, there  is no real investment activity. Order can be imposed only on  the basis of a clear investment policy, the role of which is  greatly magnified in conditions of crisis, inflation, and the  state's highly restricted financial possibilities.    It is high time for the government to establish a single  procedure for the granting of state support and to strictly  monitor how such support is used.    We hear endless talk about inflation being incompatible with  the process of investment. With so much talk, there is almost  no time to form the necessary institutions and structures to  develop legislation in this sphere. Little practical work is  being done to create real conditions for attracting foreign  investments. This is the criticism I hear at every meeting with  foreign businessmen, be it in America, in England, in Japan, in  China, or elsewhere.    At the same time it is obvious that as long as our own  entrepreneurs do not start to invest in Russia's economy,  foreign partners will refrain from making major investments.    The Russian state has to be consistent in defending the  interests of Russian companies in the domestic and world markets.    There are other reserves. After the completion of the  voucher stage, privatization has to be taken resolutely into a  new mode. It should attract investors, both Russian and  foreign. This year the privatization should give the economy  much more than before.    The year 1994 should become the year in which the state  gives  real support to the producers. In a system like this, any  honest enterprise or entrepreneur can only die a painful death.  It is impossible to live honestly. Nor is it possible to  collect all that is due to the state. Last year, the budget  revenue was to have been between 24 and 25 trillion rubles, but  in actual fact it amounted to 17 trillion. That's what high  taxes have achieved. The system of taxation should become  simpler, easier to understand and, most importantly, stable --  at least in the next couple of years.    In 1994, it is time to embark on drastic changes in state  support for the agricultural sector. Rather than meeting all  the demands from the sector, the main principle should be a real  reform of its economic mechanism, above all ensuring the right  of private ownership of land.    The country has been living for a long time in the  conditions  of constantly high inflation. Until the inflation is curbed,  the crisis cannot be overcome.    Any actions by the federal authorities in the area of  economic policy must undergo an inflation safety test. The  maximum allowed level of inflation must not be exceeded. This  demand will be ensured also by the constitutional powers of the  president. The economic reform is never painless. Its social  cost is significant. We should focus on poverty, on striking  inequality, and employment. They cause the greatest concern.  The president, the Federal Assembly, and the government should  constantly keep in mind hardships experienced by workers of  enterprises coming to a standstill--who may become unemployed  tomorrow--the poverty experienced by many scientists and staffs  of higher educational establishments--which makes unbearable the  lives of many young families--and also difficulties experienced  by a significant proportion of farmers.    Millions of people in our country are living below the  poverty line. It is unacceptable to adopt for implementation  state programs that cause a further decline of essential  standards of living. However, we have such programs.    Esteemed members of the Federation Council and deputies of  the State Duma, everything I am describing is part and parcel of  tense, day-to-day work that should now be seriously addressed.  There is vast room for action here for ministers, deputies, and  staff of the apparatus--for everyone, in a word. If we really  come to grips with it, then all political discord, offenses, and  empty disagreements will be forgotten. Everyone will benefit  from this, and primarily Russia. The main thing is not to stop  and not to waste time.    In strengthening the Russian state, we should all pay  particular attention to culture, science, and education. These  are vital conditions for our country's progress. One has to  admit with bitterness that this area has become a disaster zone  today. Without strong state support, spiritual freedom turns  into the destruction of talent and into intellectual poverty.  It is time to admit that culture will not survive without the  state actively participating in its future. It is the state  that should preserve the common cultural heritage in all its  wealth and diversity, and it is the state that should provide a  specific program for the development of the multinational  Russian culture.    Yes, there is an acute shortage of funds today; however, the  state should pursue the kind of policy that would make the  spiritual sphere one that powerfully attracts financial and  material resources. In 1994, this sphere should become a zone  with most-favored status. Federal, regional, and local  authorities, and any entrepreneur should receive real incentives  to providing active backing for this. I support setting in  motion a system for capital to flow into culture, education,  science, and health care and, let me add, ecology. Not only we  will benefit from this. Above all, it will be our descendants  and the Russia of the future that will benefit.    To continue reform of Russian foreign policy is one of the  guidelines for strengthening Russia. Over the latest period, it  is not only Russia that has changed beyond recognition. The  whole world has become more complex and unpredictable.  Consistent promotion of Russia's national interests is the main  task of our foreign policy. Openness and cooperation are prime  means for achieving it. But if required to protect the state's  legitimate interests, Russia has a right to act firmly and tough  when it is really necessary. Until recently our foreign policy  lacked initiative and creative approach. Russia's prominent  peacemaking initiative in the Bosnian conflict has been an  exception, regrettably, so far. Meanwhile, the present-day  world needs a novel look at the global problems and goals of the  21st century, and Russia is capable of generating new major  original ideas.    We like to repeat that it is a great country, and this is a  fact, indeed. So let us always maintain this lofty standard in  our foreign political thinking as well. We have clear  priorities in international policy--the most important being the  prevention of a new global war, either cold or hot. It is for  this purpose precisely that we are coming out unequivocally in  favor of strengthening the regime of non-proliferation of  weapons of mass destruction and the latest military  technologies. We share this principle as one that is mandatory  for all--not only for Russia, as some people would like to  believe.    In 1994, we have to put an end to the vicious practice of  unilateral concessions. This also relates, inter alia, to the  defense budget. One should not forget the fact that defense  expenditures are something totally different from expenditure on  war.    These resources are being used to finance a major part of  our science sector, these resources are being used to build  housing for homeless officers' families, these resources are  being used to provide for our children serving in the armed  forces.    There must be order in international arms trade. The most  important condition for this is observance of Russia's  commercial interests. They have suffered considerably in recent  years.    We are for being realistic when dealing with the problems of  European security and we are for the Partnership for Peace, open  to all states of great Europe without any exceptions.    However, while respecting the sovereign rights of states and  organizations, Russia is against the expansion of NATO through  some or other countries of the European continent without Russia  itself. This is a path toward new threats to Europe and the  world. Russia is not a guest in Europe, but an equal  participant in the community of Europe, interested in its  prosperity -- and it is this premise that we will proceed from.    We are for developing partnership with both West and East.  But for us, partnership is not an exchange of niceties during  negotiations but real cooperation and interaction, in all  spheres from high politics to friendly social contact between  people of different countries, in all spheres at state and  national level, at the level of enterprises, companies,  organizations, and individual citizens. The obstacles to such  wide-ranging partnership should be removed as soon as possible.    Russia did not take part in the race to be the first to  leave  the USSR and to become the most independent state. Now many are  gradually being cured of the euphoria of being able to swim in  the raging sea at will. We are returning to one another within  the framework of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Russia  is for the strengthening of the Commonwealth, above all through  the establishment of an economic union, a common CIS market, and  the establishment of a system of collective security and the  strengthening of guarantees of human rights.    However, there exist factors which it is always essential to  take into consideration. Integration should not damage Russia  itself, nor should it be effected at the cost of our forces and  resources, material and financial alike, being stretched to  breaking point. This would only entail new disappointments and  it would not bring our states closer, but pull them apart from  each other.    Russia's foreign policy will be strong and effective if  interaction between various state bodies in its implementation  is secured as something tangible. I address this request, in  equal measure, to the relevant departments of the executive  authority and to the Federal Assembly -- we have one country and  it will only gain from this kind of interaction.    Esteemed members of the Federation Council and deputies of  the State Duma, I regard it as essential to spell out the most  essential things, on which concern, including my concern, will  be focused this year.    First: Law and order must gain a firm foothold. We are not  just talking of adopting high quality laws; we must also aim at  their implementation. Without that, it will not be possible to  put an end to official abuses, nor will it be possible to ensure  guarantees for people's legitimate rights.    Two: the fight against crime. We won't make life more  peaceful for the people of Russia if we confine ourselves to  emergency half-measures. We need a complex of legislative,  economic, organizational, and social measures. To fight crime,  one has to change conditions in society and in the state as a  whole.    Three: the economy. I intend to resolutely continue and  develop the reform started in 1992, using its reserves to the  maximum, fully keeping in mind the price that has to be paid on  this path.    Four: concern for the country's spiritual future. The  current state of culture, science, and education is, as I have  already mentioned, extremely alarming. This year an upturn  should be ensured in these spheres.    Five: Support for the regions and territories and the  protection of their interests. Much has already been said on  this matter. I can add that last year the drafting of the  principle of a new regional strategy in Russia began. This year  the strategy will be actively implemented. It is on this basis  we shall be able really to ensure the unity and integrity of  Russia.    Six: the future of Russians in the near abroad. This  problem requires constant and painstaking work, combining  firmness with delicacy, being consistent and reacting precisely  to the changing situation. I believe it is my duty to defend  the prosperity and dignity of our fellow countrymen wherever  they may live.    Seven: stepping up Russian foreign policy. Here the  qualitative parameters of equal partnership are coming to the  forefront. The key area is strengthening the Commonwealth of  Independent States.    We have established normal relations with the majority of  world states and have joined the main international  organizations. Now the main thing is, proceeding from national  interests, to make the potential of these ties fully effective  in Europe, in America, in the Asia-Pacific region and in other  areas.    Russia has the opportunity for beginning a qualitatively new  stage of its development. The period of total destructive  processes of the previous system is ending. We are laying the  economic, legal, and social foundations of a new Russian  society. Having received your proposals in response to my  message, I am addressing you with a specific plan of my actions  to put it into practice.    I know that there are those among you who doubt whether we  will be able to cope with these tasks, given the spiritual and  ideological discord that reigns in society and in our hearts  today. But we must provide an answer to this question together  -- not in tedious and fruitless debates but in real  collaboration. Only in common work will we be able to overcome  mutual suspicion and bring back trust in one another. Only by  common work will we be able, once and for all, to push back from  Russia the threat of confrontation and to achieve stable civic  accord. Only in common work will we be able to tear through the  black shroud of uncertainty and restore spiritual balance and  find ourselves in the new conditions.    Russian citizens expect cooperation from us. I am confident  they will support us because they want security on the streets  and in their homes; they will support us because they want  Russia to be peaceful and prosperous. I hope that in a year we  will all be able to look those who elected us in the eye and  say: Things were difficult for us, but we did in the space of  this year all we could, and it is not in vain that we lived  during these past 12 months.    For my own part I will do all I can toward this end. Thank  you for your attention.</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / International Company News: Hafnia asks for its shares to be suspended HAFNIA Holding, the embattled insurance-based financial services group, yesterday asked for its shares to be suspended by the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. In a terse statement explaining the request, the company said that a 'conclusive phase' in negotiations with Norway's UNI Storebrand and Sweden's Skandia to establish a Nordic alliance had been reached. The suspension was also aimed at limiting market speculation about the company's future. However, neither Skandia nor UNI Storebrand's share were suspended. Hafnia is due to release its 1991 results tomorrow. The group has already warned of a loss. Analysts in Copenhagen estimate that the loss will be about DKr300m (Dollars 47.4m), which compares with a loss of DKr1.39bn in 1990. A primary factor in the poor performance is the large investments which Hafnia has made in its domestic rivals, Baltica and Skandia. Danske Bors, the broking arm of Den Danske Bank, estimates that Hafnia has made an unrealised loss on its large share investments of about DKr1.5bn, reducing the value of group equity capital from DKr6.5bn at the end of 1989 to about DKr2.5bn at the end of the first quarter of this year. This and similar estimates have caused Hafnia's shares to fall from over DKr700 in 1990 to DKr289 when suspended. Hafnia acquired just over a third of the shares in Baltica Holding in 1990 in an attempt to gain control. It then made a standing offer of DKr1,000 per share for any new shares issued by Baltica, but two weeks ago withdrew the offer, giving no explanation. Last December, UNI Storebrand and Hafnia spearheaded an attempt to gain control of Skandia, by far the largest Nordic insurance group. Hafnia has 14.8 per cent of the shares in Skandia, an investment which has cost about DKr2.5bn. Lex, Page 20</p>

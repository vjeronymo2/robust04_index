			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Personal View: Why US locomotive should decouple Over the past 20 years the distribution of earnings in the US has been changing in a way which, until recently, has not been matched in the rest of the industrial world. Despite the fact that the real American per capita gross national product has been rising (up almost 30 per cent from 1973 to 1992), real earnings have been falling for much of the workforce. While about 20 per cent of the male workforce has been on a rapidly rising up escalator, another 20 per cent has been on a level moving sidewalk, and the remaining 60 per cent has been on a down escalator. Two factors lie behind these statistics. Technology seems to be demanding a much more skilled workforce. Wages have been rising for the skilled and falling for the unskilled. As the US is much more open to manufactured imports from low-wage third-world countries than from Europe or Japan, what economists know as 'factor price equalisation' (in a global economy those with third-world skills will make third-world incomes even if they are living in first-world countries) also seems to be pushing down wages of the unskilled. To some extent America's working wives have come to the rescue. By working an increasing number of hours a year they have succeeded in holding the real family incomes of the bottom 60 per cent of the population approximately constant, even though male wages have been falling. The average American family rightly sees itself working much harder yet making no economic progress. Even more frightening, most of these families now have little unused female work effort that they can throw into the economic fray. Wives are already working close to full-time. Nothing but economic decline looms ahead. Not surprisingly, voting studies reveal that those on the up escalator voted overwhelmingly for President George Bush while those on the down escalator voted overwhelmingly for President Bill Clinton. To have any chance of delivering on his promise to stop the down escalator, Clinton needs to offer a number of things, such as greater investment in skills. And a 4 to 4.5 per cent rate of growth is an absolute necessity if he is to create better job opportunities and rising real wages for the 80 per cent male workforce that did not participate in the economic gains of the 1970s and 1980s. But suppose he were to succeed and the 4.8 per cent growth rate of the fourth quarter of 1992 were to be sustained. Mr Clinton would immediately have a trade problem. The US starts with a large trade deficit (rising towards Dollars 100bn) and could expect a huge surge of imports if its economy were to grow much faster than the economies of rest of the industrial world. But if this surge of imports were to occur, it would essentially drown President Clinton's economic recovery. If one looks at the relationship between output and employment in American manufacturing, every Dollars 45bn in extra manufactured imports essentially costs the American economy 1m jobs. Mr Clinton cannot afford to lose those jobs. If he does, he will not be able to deliver on his promises to those that elected him. As a result, the president has no choice but to take whatever actions are necessary to ensure that the US trade deficit does not worsen. To put it bluntly, President Clinton cannot let the American economy become a locomotive for the rest of the world. The rest of the world is now an economic train too large for the US locomotive to pull alone. If the US were to try, its recovery would simply stall. The right answer from the the perspective of the US and the world is an aggressive co-ordinated fiscal and monetary expansion with the three big economies (Germany, Japan and the US) acting as a joint locomotive. If such co-ordination cannot be arranged quickly, however, Mr Clinton will have no choice but to take direct action to stop the US trade deficit from worsening. The clash between the world's desire to hook on to the American locomotive and President Clinton's need to decouple his locomotive from the rest of the world's economic train will be most acute with respect to Japan. Japan has a Dollars 135bn trade surplus, which is rising at the rate of Dollars 50bn a year. Based upon history, if the US were to grow substantially faster than Japan, Japanese exports to the US could be expected to surge. The problem is very simple. Japan does not know how to engineer an economic recovery without such an export surge; the US will not have a domestic recovery if such a Japanese export surge were to occur. The immovable object meets the irresistible force. The author is Dean of the Alfred P Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology</p>

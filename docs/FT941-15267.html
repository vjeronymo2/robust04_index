			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Food &amp; Drink: A curious French-English cocktail - Giles MacDonogh has some culinary ups and downs in Jersey I DID not know quite what to expect from Jersey. I half imagined an island filled with retired Jaguar salesmen with Basil Brush accents - and thought I spotted a few propping up the bar in the Old Court House Inn in St Aubin - but I was put right on this subject by a resident: you need around Pounds 2.5m to retire to Jersey, and business in Jags is just not that brisk. With so much wealth about one might expect to see some of its trappings; but no, the Jersey rich seem on the stingy side. And there is another face to the island: the daily delivery of grockles from all over Britain; the sort who have yet to learn about Benidorm and who eke out their holidays on the tightest of budgets. They may be spotted in the chippies of St Helier wearing multi-coloured shellsuits. Then there are the natives: a curious cocktail of French and English. The English speak with a slightly Australian-sounding twang; an accent made famous by Alan Whicker. The French potato farmers keep themselves to themselves - although they can be traced to the public bars on the north of the island - speaking a clear, up-to-date French, and drinking pints of beer. In spite of the farmers and the French road names, France does not spring quickly to mind on Jersey, although the coast is only 14 miles away to the east. This is sad. There is something oppressive about Jersey's British holiday resort feeling: the chip shops, the shellsuits; the sites of great natural beauty (of which there are many) where the only available refreshment is a Walls' ice cream or a stale bun. French restaurants have a habit of failing, like the acclaimed Granite Corner on the north side of the Island, praised in the Good Food Guide. It has now lost its Perigourdin chef. Doran's Courtyard Bistro, in St Helier, is a friendly place, but excessively provincial. The cooking is in what one might call the Jeanette Winterson style: the titles of the dishes had all mated with the contents of the fruit bowl. The decent Jersey Pottery Restaurant in Gorey is a tourist trap, luring holiday-makers in to buy lacklustre pots. Portions here are generous in an American way. I ordered a small portion of scallops but unwisely neglected to repeat small when it came to the lobster salad and was all but defeated by the sheer quantity of food. A starter of melon and crab turned out to be two melons filled with the insides of what looked like a dozen large crustaceans. Closer contact with France could solve a number of local problems. There is the terrible drawback of so much produce coming from Britain. The only good cheesemonger, Select Tastes in the market in St Helier, suffers from lack of demand for its largely English list. With only two wine merchants to choose from, most has to be brought from London, which results in high transport costs. Doug le Mesurier, who farms rock oysters at Royal Bay, knows his natural market is France where there is an inexhaustible demand. On mainland Britain, the law requires him to treat oysters with ultra-violet rays, a costly process which is rendered otiose by the cleanliness of Jersey's coastal waters. And his oysters are good: some of the sweetest I have tasted; refreshed, he says, by freshwater wells which spout far out to sea. There are other things to be had besides potatoes and tomatoes: Ralph Mouger makes a clean, sappy wine at the Chateau le Catillon; and if Randalls has stopped brewing beer and gone over to importing from the mainland, the Ann Street Brewery's Mary Ann pubs serve an Old Jersey real ale on hand pump. There is even a brew pub called the Tipsy Toad making three beers: Jimmy's Bitter, Agile Frog and, if you are in luck, Horny Toad. To forget the downside of Jersey you must go to Longueville Manor. Malcolm Lewis, his Norwegian wife, Hild, and his sister, Sue Dufty, are charming hosts. The Lewises left Lancashire for Jersey three generations ago but there are still reminders - like the slab of black pudding with the English breakfast. Longueville Manor is once again the best place to eat on Jersey, so if you have money to launder in one of the island's banks, do not hesitate. The best way to experience chef Andrew Baird's cooking is the sampler menu at Pounds 50 (without wine): a salad of pan-fried foie gras with apples and celeriac; courgette and its flower filled with salmon mousse; a ragout of Jersey lobster, scallops and Dublin Bay prawns; the lightest of asparagus consommes; and a pink champagne sorbet. This was followed by best end of lamb complete with vegetables - I fear too large a portion for the menu; marinated goats' cheese on baby vegetables, which I found dull, but I admit I was flagging by then; and a super peach Melba. I defy anyone to retain an appetite for the petits fours. The hotel and its kitchen were clearly good enough to attract a big party of Frenchmen who were unloading their bags just as I was leaving. Some days before there had been a commotion on the island when some French fishermen had occupied the Ecrehous reefs belonging to Jersey. As I travelled home it struck me that the Frenchmen at the hotel might have been the advanced guard in some future invasion of Jersey. I do hope so.

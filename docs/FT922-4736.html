			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / People: UK advice on US corporate governance Jonathan Charkham, an adviser to the Governor of the Bank of England, is underscoring his reputation as one of the world's leading experts on corporate governance by being appointed the first foreigner on a US presidential committee examining the subject. Charkham, 61, is one of 24 members of the newly-established subcouncil on Corporate Governance and Financial Markets chaired by Edward Regan, comptroller of the state of New York. It is one of eight subcouncils of the President's Competitiveness Policy Council which advises the President and Congress on issues affecting the competitiveness of US industry. The Corporate Governance subcouncil will 'study if, and to what extent our current system of corporate governance and the nature of financial markets constrain US corporations' ability to fully realise their strategic plans and to compete in world markets'. Carolyn Brancato, executive director of Columbia Law School's Institutional Investor project, has been appointed staff director of the new subcouncil which will meet three times. Its recommendations will be included in the second annual report of the Competitiveness Council. Charkham, who has just finished a paper on corporate governance in the US, is already a member of Columbia's Institutional Investor project advisory board and has come to know many of the figures involved in the US debate. Other members of the subcouncil include the New York Stock Exchange's William Donaldson, Martin Lipton, a lawyer who made his name in some of the fiercest takeover battles in recent history, John Neff of Wellington Management and Richard Breeden of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The new council has a much wider remit than Sir Adrian Cadbury's committee on corporate governance in the UK. In addition to the traditional questions about the relationships between directors and managers it will also study 'to what extent rapid turnover in securities markets, use of new investment instruments such as derivatives, and heightened attention to quarterly financial statements cause corporate management to function with less than optimal time horizons'.</p>

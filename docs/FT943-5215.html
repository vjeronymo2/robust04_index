			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Amsterdam The busy first-half reporting season continues this week. The market was in good form in the early part of last week before news of an unexpected downturn at Bols Wessanen, the drinks group, on Wednesday, led prices lower. That news put a check on a rise in shares in Heineken, which reports its own first-half results on Friday. Elsewhere in the brewing sector, Grolsch unveils interim figures on Wednesday. Ahold is due to report tomorrow and Fortis Amev first-half figures come on Thursday. Compiled by Michael Morgan</p>

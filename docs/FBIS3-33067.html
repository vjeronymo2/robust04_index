			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori at a dinner </F> in honor of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria at the Peruvian  Embassy in Santa Fe de Bogota; date not given; from the "Good  Morning Peru" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] The consolidation of the processes of political and  economic reforms offers great possibilities for bolstering  Colombian-Peruvian relations. That is why we fluently speak the  common language of development today. A civilized way of life  and democracy have been threatened similarly in Colombia and  Peru. Colombians and Peruvians, however, have responded readily  to the scourge of narcotraffickers and terrorists.    Our societies know that we will succeed in establishing a  genuine peace on which we can build true progress and justice.  I am convinced that as of now, based on the premise of  consolidating the processes of modernization of our countries,  perspectives will open so that the existing bilateral mechanisms  will become more dynamic and high-level contacts between our  governments will become more frequent and profitable.    I am sure, President Gaviria, that Latin America's hour is  at  hand. The bases that we are laying today are the cornerstones  of the building to be shaped by the hands of the new generations  with a view to the future. Our independence will be sealed with  our national development. For this new stage of  Colombian-Peruvian relations and for the realization and  progress of our peoples, we mutually wish ourselves much  success. Thank you very much. [applause]</p>

It remained abnormally cold in northern Florida,  where temperatures fell to 24 degrees at Tallahassee and 29 at Jacksonville and  Gainesville, but Miami reported a high of 79. In North Carolina, the mercury  sank to 21 at Cape Hatteras, tying a record set on the date in 1899. Light snow  was widely scattered with little significant accumulation.

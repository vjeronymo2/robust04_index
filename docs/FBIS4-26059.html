			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Night News" program] </F>   [Text] As China has yet to promulgate and enforce a law on  the control of pollution caused by solid wastes, there is a  degree of difficulty in solving the problem of imported  hazardous wastes. However, due to repeated occurrences of  similar incidents, relevant state departments have begun to  attach high importance to such incidents.    In a telephone interview with the station's Nightly News  editor today over the importing of chemical wastes at Nanjing  Port and of industrial waste at Ningbo Port, Wang Yangzu, deputy  director of the State Environmental Protection Bureau,  reiterated that as early as 1991, the State Environmental  Protection Bureau and the General Administration of Customs had  issued a circular on controlling the import of hazardous wastes.  Wang Yangzu called on relevant departments in localities to  strictly handle matters according to the guidelines set forth in  the circular and called on them to mete out severe punishment to  units and individuals who import hazardous wastes without  authorization.</p>

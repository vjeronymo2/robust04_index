			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 630.2 defines significant terms used in the proposed regulations. The term ``disclosure entities,'' as defined in proposed &sect;630.2(b), means all banks, the Funding Corporation, and the Financial Assistance Corporation. Because the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac) is not liable for any debt or obligation of any other institutions of the System, for purposes of the proposed regulations, the term ``Farm Credit System'' defined in proposed &sect;630.2(d) does not include Farmer Mac.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each bank may individually issue notes, bonds, debentures, or other similar obligations under authority of section 4.2(a), (b), and (e) of the 1971 Act. Also, each bank may join with other banks of the System to issue consolidated bank debt obligations under section 4.2(c) of the 1971 Act or Systemwide debt obligations under section 4.2(d) of the 1971 Act. Under section 4.4 of the 1971 Act, all banks are jointly and severally liable for debt obligations issued under section 4.2(c) or (d) of the 1971 Act. The proposed regulations use the term ``FCS debt obligations'' (defined in &sect;630.2(e)) to encompass both consolidated bank debt obligations and Systemwide debt obligations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Publishing and Filing the Report to Investors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;630.3 contains general requirements and instructions for publishing and filing annual and quarterly reports to investors by the disclosure entities. For purposes of subpart A of the proposed regulations, the term ``report to investors'' or ``report'' refers to both the annual and quarterly reports required by this part unless otherwise specified. Under proposed &sect;630.3(a), the disclosure entities would be required to jointly publish the report. Proposed &sect;630.3(b) provides that each report must present combined financial statements and accompanying footnotes to provide investors with the most meaningful presentation of the combined financial condition and results of operations pertaining to all System institutions. The proposed regulations define the required combined financial statements in proposed &sect;630.2(g) as the ``Systemwide combined financial statements.'' Pursuant to proposed &sect;&sect;630.3(c) and 630.20(l), the Funding Corporation must determine the ``reporting entity'' <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  of the Systemwide combined financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A ``reporting entity'' refers to the identity or boundaries of an entity for which financial statements are prepared. A reporting entity may comprise two or more affiliated entities and is not necessarily a legal entity per se.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;630.3(c) through (g) contains general requirements similar to those followed by individual institutions in preparing and filing disclosures to shareholders under &sect;620.2 of this chapter. Pursuant to proposed &sect;630.3(c), the disclosure entities would be required to prepare their Systemwide combined financial information for disclosure to investors in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards prescribed in part 621 of this chapter. This would ensure comparability between the report to investors prepared pursuant to this proposed rule and the disclosure to shareholders prepared by individual System institutions pursuant to part 620 of this chapter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

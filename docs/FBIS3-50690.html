The generals discharged from duty owing to a "reshuffling of  structures" had less than 35 years in service, and their ages  would allow them to remain on duty, the daily LA REPUBLICA  reported on Tuesday, 4 January.    The alleged "purged" generals are Roger Alvitez, Edgar  Sullca, Eusebio Bedoya, Rodolfo Enceles, Hector Escobar, Jesus  Sanchez, Ernesto Arenas, Cirilio Pacheco, and Ramiro Berrantes.    All of them had been scheduled to attend a public tribute  given in their honor by the PNP but did not attend, apparently  unhappy with the government decision.</p>

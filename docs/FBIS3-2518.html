			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li  Peng stressed today the importance of correctly handling  relations among reform, economic development and social  stability.    "Economic development is the center of all our work, reform  and opening up are the motive force of development, and  development and reform are the foundation of long-term social  and political stability in China; and social stability, in turn,  is a prerequisite for economic development and smooth progress  in reform," the premier said.    Li expounded the relationship in his report on government  work which he delivered at the first meeting of the Second  Plenary Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC).    The premier said that China is now presented with a rare  historical opportunity and that the work of governments at all  levels should be subordinate to and serve the endeavor of  seizing opportunities, deepening reform, opening China wider to  the outside world, promoting development, and maintaining social  stability.    Li called on governments at all levels "to do a good job in  every field of endeavor, identify and solve problems promptly  and ensure that reform, development and stability are  coordinated and promote each other." Only by so doing, he said,  can China win one victory after another in its drive for  socialist modernization.</p>

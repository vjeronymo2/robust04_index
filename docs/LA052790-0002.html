			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES TO TAPE  </P> <P> The Wages of Fear (TNT Sunday at 7 p.m.): One of the most suspenseful movies  ever made, this 1952 H.G. Clouzot classic involves four men hauling  nitroglycerin on primitive South American highways. Yves Montand and Charles  Vanel star. (2:20)  </P> <P> Deadline U.S.A. (Cinemax Wednesday at 11:30 a.m.): Richard Brooks' prophetic  1952 film is one of the best movies ever made about the newspaper business.  Humphrey Bogart is the editor and Ethel Barrymore the publisher of a crusading  metropolitan paper struggling to survive in the new era of TV. (1:30)  </P> <P> Rasputin (Bravo Thursday at 6:30 p.m.): Distinguished Russian director Elem  Klimov's 1976 film is as mesmerizing as its subject, rich in the kind of  atmosphere and detail necessary in bringing alive its bizarre yet riveting saga  of the self-proclaimed holy man whose hold on the Russian royal family helped  bring about the revolution. Alexei Petrenko's Rasputin is so convincing as to  be downright scary. (2:00)  </P></p>

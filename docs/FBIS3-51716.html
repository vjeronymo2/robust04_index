			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Carmem Cruz: "International Year Marks Defeat </F> for Indians"]    [Text] Brazil's 262,000 Indians have little to commemorate  in this International Year of Native Peoples, which they have  turned into a year of struggle to get their lands demarcated.  The government has demarcated fewer areas than in 1991 and 1992,  over 80 percent of the lands already confirmed are still being  invaded by lumbermen, prospectors, and ranchers, and violence is  on the rise. The massacre of the Ianomamis in Roraima increased  the number of murders to almost twice the total recorded during  the past three years. Suicide among Guaranis is continuing. The  new statute has not been approved, and the rights guaranteed by  the 1988 Constitution may be undermined by revision.    It is an alarming picture, and it is made worse by the  authorities' lack of commitment to solving such serious problems  as the complete lack of health care for the Indian communities.  Malaria and tuberculosis, Hansen's disease, and other illnesses  are affecting the Ianomamis, whooping cough is claiming new  victims among the Uru-eu-uau-uaus in Rondonia, and even  influenza and measles are not under control because there is a  complete absence of health workers and medicines in the area.  Transferring responsibility for medical care to the Ministry of  Health has resulted in chaos. Not because Funai [National Indian  Foundation] was able to handle things adequately, but because  the ministry, even though it has funds for providing the Indians  with health care, has been unable to implement actions to  provide the villages with the things planned during exhaustive  meetings on the Esplanade of Ministries.    After two long years of quarreling over health care for  Brazil's Indians, Funai and the Ministry of Health decided to  meet during a seminar at CNTI [National Confederation of  Industrial Workers] headquarters in Luziania and discuss  long-awaited cooperation. That meeting had the effect of  balancing the ministry's need to spend the thousands of real  cruzeiros it has set aside with Funai's need to reactivate the  village posts, which have deteriorated and, in most cases, been  closed completely. That cooperation is to be modeled on the  Ianomami Area Health District, the only unit that the ministry  has managed to begin operating reasonably well in recent years.    Quarrels--As though the needs of the Indian  communities--needs created precisely by the government's  assistance policy--were not enough, quarrels over possession of  the land on which they live or from where they have been  expelled are making the daily life of many tribes a real hell.  That is the case, for instance, with the Caiova Guaranis in Mato  Grosso do Sul, who are in permanent conflict with the ranchers  who have settled on their land. The Indians have been driven  from their villages, and although their land has been  demarcated, they cannot enter it.    Judge Suzana de Camargo Gomes in Campo Grande recently  handed  down a decision unfavorable to the Indians. It invalidated the  president of the republic's directives and recognized the  ranchers' right of possession as legitimate. The Indians are  threatening to invade the area and die for their land.    In Roraima, where encouragement from Roraima society and  Governor Ottomar de Souza Pinto in particular has been  justifying incursions by prospectors into Indian areas, the  conflicts in Ianomami territory culminated in the massacre of 17  Indians, including women and children, in August. In the opinion  of Francisco Loebens, secretary of Cimi [Native Missionary  Council], that massacre was merely the continuation of the  extermination process being imposed on the Ianomamis, who are  perhaps the only group in the country to show a declining  population curve. Also in Roraima, the Macuxi and Ingarico  tribes, which live in the Raposa/Serra do Sol area, are being  forced to coexist with the thousands of prospectors who have  left Ianomami territory to settle along the rivers in the  extreme northeastern part of the state.    The Raposa/Serra do Sol area is one of the two major areas  which the Brazilian Government failed to demarcate this year,  the reason being pressure from politicians in the North Region  and from the military. The other area was the Upper Negro River  area in the Amazon Region, which is also a border region. That  area has been chopped up like the Ianomami area. Under the  Sarney administration, as attorney Juliana Santilli of Cimi  pointed out, the area had been divided into islands. Half the  area that had been taken away was restored this year, but it has  not been demarcated.  <H5>  Demarcation the Big Battle </H5>   The Upper Negro River area was ready to be demarcated, but  the Ministry of Justice felt that in order to continue the  process, previous decrees would have to be revoked. The military  felt that demarcation along the border presented a danger to  sovereignty. Everything came to a halt.    In Bahia, the Ha-Ha-Ha Pataxo Indians in Paul-Brasil have  been struggling for decades to recover their lands, which are  currently occupied by ranchers. They recently invaded three of  the ranches in their territory and took hostages. The Military  Police moved in, broke up the operation, and removed the 800  Indians from the properties. The Indians do not have access to  the river that runs through the area, and the local municipal  government has stopped supplying them with water by water truck.    In southern Para, the exploitation of mahogany and other  valuable species is jeopardizing vast Indian areas. The same  thing is happening in Rondonia, where the leaders themselves  participate in illegal deals and agreements. Besides harming the  environment, that exploitation is causing a serious social  problem by causing by breaking up the communities.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Situation With Indian Lands                                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Description              |Number                   |Hectares                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total Indian Lands       |532                      |90,970,570               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Demarcated               |266                      |46,239,481               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |To be demarcated         |266                      |44,731,089               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |To be identified         |135                      |-                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Needing revision         |72                       |-                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Confirmed                |198                      |44,049,794               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Source: Directorate of Land Affairs, Funai (4 November 1993).                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |The above figures show that Indian lands constitute 11 percent of the nation-|  |al territory. Of the total number of Indian areas, 51 percent have been dema-|  |rcated, and another 49 percent remain to be demarcated. Half of the lands oc-|  |cupied by the Indians have already been confirmed--a total of 198 compared t-|  |o 532 areas.                                                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  Groups Organized </H5>   One unquestionably positive result for the Indians this year  was the progress made by the leadership movement, which now  includes more than 100 organizations. In Amazonas State alone,  the Indians have 31 rank-and-file representative bodies, among  them the Coordination Board for Indian Organizations of the  Brazilian Amazon Region (COIAB) in Manaus and the Federation of  Negro River Indian Organizations (FOIRN) in Sao Gabriel da  Cachoeira. In the course of this year, they have held two major  congresses in Brasilia and established the National Forum for  the Defense of Indian Rights, which operates at Brasilia  University (UnB) with the immediate objective of forcing the  demarcation of Indian lands.    The union of those groups has resulted in more political  debate and considerable progress in the struggle for autonomy.  Many communities have started a struggle to recover their lands  and even to demarcate those lands themselves. The Capaputo  Indians in Alagoas have recovered areas which belonged to them  traditionally and legally. The same thing has happened with the  Bracui Guaranis in Rio de Janeiro and the Ha-Ha-Ha Pataxos in  Bahia.    In the South, the Caingangs were able, partly by force, to  demarcate their lands in an area being used for agrarian reform.  The Jaguapires are continuing to confront the ranchers in an  attempt to get back their lands in Mato Grosso do Sul. In  Amazonas, the Culinas are also continuing to demarcate their own  areas, which are in dispute between them and the owners of  rubber plantations. But in addition to demarcating their land,  the Culinas are evicting the rubber plantation owners in a  peaceful atmosphere and also seeking ways to survive in a  delimited area. The problem is that culturally, the Culinas move  about a great deal, and now they need to plan ways to ensure  their subsistence in a restricted territory.  <H5>  Brazil Establishes Commission </H5>   In Brazil, where the Indian question is arousing the concern  and interest of organizations all over the world, the  International Year of the Indian could not possibly have slipped  by peaceably. Although it took four months to wake up to that  fact, the Brazilian Government was eager to free itself any  major guilt, so in April it issued a decree establishing the  Commission on the International Year of Native Peoples. The  commission consisted of representatives of the Ministries of  Justice (Funai), Foreign Affairs, Education and Sports, Health,  and Environment.    But at the commission's first meetings, which were held at  Funai headquarters, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said firmly  that it would not accept the terminology "Native Peoples" in the  name of the commission: the expression should be "Native  Populations." Although responsible for coordinating activities  related to the international year, the commission did not take a  single step forward; it wasted hour after hour quarreling about  the name.    The quarreling discouraged the other members of the  commission, who were surprised at the end of August by another  decree from President Itamar changing the commission's name to  Commission for the International Year of the Indian.  <H5>  Opinion Still Divided on Guardianship </H5>   Three proposals for the new Indian Statute were submitted to  Congress: one from the Center for Indian Rights [NDI], another  from Cimi, and the third also from the NDI. The special  committee appointed to debate the bill submitted a substitute  bill. The committee spokesman has been replaced, and now the new  spokesman, Deputy Luciano Pizzato, after establishing a  consensus between Funai, Cimi, and the NDI with the support of  the Office of the Public Prosecutor of the Republic, will submit  the results of the debates to the Indians themselves.    The most controversial issue in the new statute is  unquestionably that of guardianship. The bill's authors agree  that guardianship as it exists amounts to institutionalization  and domination. The Indian is regarded as being relatively  incompetent, since he is not a full citizen with complete  rights. Funai would wind up being more of a protective force--a  police body--and give up its social welfare or paternalistic  activities. That is what the great majority of Indians want,  although some groups such as the Caiapos, the Xavantes, and some  of the Caingangs still associate the end of guardianship with  the end of protection.    Revision--The Indians, nongovernmental organizations, and  congressmen involved in the Indian cause in Brazil mobilized to  oppose constitutional revision, feeling that the gains provided  in the 1988 Constitution might be reversed by the current  members of Congress. But revision was approved, and as a result,  the move now is to mobilize in favor of retaining the articles  dealing with the Indians. According to Deputy Marco Penaforte  (PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], Ceara), chances are  good that they will be retained in view of the short time  remaining. The chapter on Indians and those on the environment  and consumer protection have been taken off the constitutional  agenda. If the articles are not retained, the next step will be  to submit amendments reversing amendments aimed at destroying  the rights already gained.    There are many such amendments, but some are causing more  concern than others, one example being that by Deputy Nicias  Ribeiro (PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], Para)  (Constitutional Amendment No. 133/92), which bans the  demarcation of lands in border areas and makes demarcations  subject to approval by the National Congress.    The hope of the Indian leaders and of organizations  defending  the environment and the minorities is that as a result of the  scandals in the National Congress, constitutional revision will  be postponed. It has not made much progress so far despite the  efforts of the supporters of constitutional revision. In any  case, the way in which it is being proposed means that only a  few aspects of the Constitution will be revised.  <H5>  Individual Opinions </H5>   Rubens Ricupero, minister of environment and the Legal  Amazon  Region: "The international year dedicated to the Indians should  serve to remind us that respecting them, preserving their  culture, and giving them dignified living conditions in their  traditional environment means respecting ourselves."    Dinarte Madeiro, president of Funai: "The greatest gift we  could have given the Indians in this international year would  have been the demarcation of their lands. Unfortunately, that  has not been possible because of the lack of funds. But we  cannot blame President Itamar, because this situation has been  dragging on for years."    Guenter Francisco Loebens, secretary of Cimi: "This year has  led to closer coordination among the organizations concerned  thanks to the establishment of the Forum for the Defense of  Indian Rights. Those organizations have united and cast aside  their particular differences in a struggle that has sought to  make up for the government's ineffectiveness. The general  realization today is that if the government will not do it, we  will."    Waldir Tobias Macuxi, president of the Council for the  Coordination of Native Peoples and Organizations of Brazil: "We  Indians are all being used for propaganda purposes both in  Brazil and abroad. They use us and invite us to international  events, but they do not allow us to talk about the problems we  face. Violence is increasing steadily, and the people committing  that violence go unpunished."    Marco Penaforte, president of the Commission on Environment,  Minorities, and Consumer Protection of the Chamber of Deputies:  "The International Year of the Indian has not achieved its  objectives in Brazil."    Juliana Santilli of the Center for Indian Rights (NDI):  "There has been a lot of rhetoric, but little has been done. As  far as demarcation is concerned, there has been progress, but it  is far short of what should have been accomplished. Moreover,  the conflicts in various areas are growing worse, and even  though half of the Indian territories in Brazil have been  demarcated, the Indians have not been given secure possession of  their land."</p>

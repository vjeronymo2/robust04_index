			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Pressures on House of Fraser shown in accounts THE FINANCIAL pressures which caused the Fayed brothers to announce plans to float the House of Fraser department store chain next year became clearer yesterday. House of Fraser Ltd's net assets fell from Pounds 811m to Pounds 755m in the year to January 30, the annual report showed. The store-chain subsidiary includes 59 House of Fraser stores, and Harrods, which is not to be floated. Even allowing for some adjustments, these figures mean the Fayeds would have risked breaking covenants to House of Fraser's bankers, which required an increase in net worth of 5 per cent a year. The accounts also confirm that House of Fraser Ltd provided borrowing guarantees to the group holding company amounting to Pounds 668m, of which Pounds 616m had been drawn down at April 30. House of Fraser group denied this week that the Fayeds were under financial pressure and said a refinancing was arranged in April. The accounts show that House of Fraser Ltd's borrowings were refinanced at variable rates linked to the London interbank offered rate, but the terms are not disclosed. One indication of financial pressure is that Pounds 60m must be repaid by April next year and Pounds 175m before April 1995. The Fayeds believe the flotation of the stores will enable them to reduce their debts and to retain Harrods. Turnover at House of Fraser Ltd grew by 4.6 per cent to Pounds 1.06bn in the year to January, which the company described as a 'strong performance in difficult market conditions'. It said operating profits increased by 27 per cent to Pounds 74.5m. An exceptional charge of Pounds 68.7m meant House of Fraser Ltd made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 7.8m, compared with a profit of Pounds 40.3m the previous year. The charge mainly related to the waiving of inter-company loans. The European Commission of Human Rights said yesterday the Fayeds had not been denied justice by Britain, Reuter reports from Strasbourg. The brothers claim they were denied redress in British courts against a damning Department of Trade and Industry report in 1990 about their business affairs.</p>

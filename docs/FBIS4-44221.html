			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The lead domestic news story in leading  Helsinki dailies HELSINGIN SANOMAT and HUFVUDSTADSBLADET for 12  June was the decision of the Swedish People's Party (RKP) to  reject a resolution giving unqualified endorsement for a yes  vote in the 18 October referendum on European Union [EU]  membership. As reported by HELSINGIN SANOMAT's Pekka Vaisanen,  the party at its convention in Turku instead voted 100-80 to  satisfy itself with simply supporting the EU accession agreement  as signed by the government. According to Vaisanen, the debate  showed clearly that most delegates favored EU membership, but  voted on compromise wording favored by RKP Chairman and  Communications Minister Ole Norrback, who feared a strong  membership resolution could alienate the party's vocal anti-EU  minority in the March 1995 parliamentary election. Norrback also  was seen as hoping to keep open the chances of making electoral  alliances with members of the tiny Liberal Party and other new  independent movements in the spring election. Among such  grass-roots movements is one supporting popular Defense Minister  Elisabeth Rehn.    Led by Deputy Chairman Hakan Malm and mainly representing  agricultural interests, the anti-EU forces had wanted an  additional statement declaring that Finland should have the  right to change its decision on membership if Sweden's  membership referendum went the other way. This was handily  defeated, however. The most outspoken opposition to membership  heard at the convention came from a rural delegate, who warned  that Finland would lose the ability to control economic policy  under the EMU (European Monetary Union), and that in a future  recession this would hurt forestry exports.    According to Maria Romantschuck of HUVUDSTADSBLADET, this  compromise allowed the RKP ministers in Prime Minister Aho  center-right cabinet to claim to have received "support from the  entire convention for the government having signed the  agreement."    In a separate analysis piece, Vaisanen asserts that those in  favor of EU membership had a "clear upper hand" in the debate.  "The Swedish People's Party delegates want into the EU above all  for security and economic policy reasons," he claims. A theme  often heard was the need to tie Finland to the Nordics and the  West in general. Again according to the author, for the  delegates it was "important to show Finland belongs to West  Europe, and in no circumstances to East Europe." Quoting from  one delegate's speech: "The alternative to EU membership is that  we will become a small island on Russia's flank."</p>

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Records: Joyous treasures from less explored territory - This year's opera delights have been new recordings of Rameau and Massenet rather than Verdi and Wagner A CURIOUS year for opera on record: while new versions of mainstream operas  -Rossini, Verdi, Puccini, Wagner, Strauss - were almost all disappointing, leaving one to wonder why the companies bothered in the first place, ventures into less familiar territory brought bounty. For me perhaps the most joyful venture of all was Les Arts Florissants' dazzling account of Les Indes galantes, a Rameau opera-ballet that is at once pageant, spectacle and melodic feast: irresistible 18th-century entertainment (French Harmonia Mundi HMC 901367.69) Two examples of the rarer Massenet afforded illumination as well as pleasure. The very last opera, Cleopatre, taken live by Koch Schwann (314 064 K3) at the 1990 St Etienne Festival, discloses a subtly drawn, tautly concentrated chamber work, set within Grand Opera trappings. RCA's Cherubin (09026-60593-2) offers a starrier (Von Stade, Ramey, June Anderson) yet also less stylish brand of Massenet: but the work itself, from earlier in the 'final period', is a delight - light, sentimental, charming, melodically memorable. The new Lyons Opera version of Poulenc's Dialogues des Carmelites (Virgin Classics 7 59227 2), conducted by Kent Nagano, does not render obsolete EMI's celebrated original-cast one: what it does achieve, is a powerful new light on a remarkable 20th-century opera. Collins Classics's speed in placing on disc the Opera North premiere performance of Robert Saxton's Caritas (1991) is wholly praiseworthy: a bold first opera, with obvious weaknesses but also an entirely unobvious voice of its own, and a heroine's role distinctive and fascinating (Collins Classics 13502). Philips launched its long-term relationship with the Kirov Opera with a superbly impassioned Khovanshchina, conducted by Valery Gergiev (432 147-2): the rough-hewn epic of Russia at a point of historical change has never seemed more unnervingly 'relevant', or more grandly gripping. The reissue in a single money-for-value package of Karl Bohm's 1960s DG sets of Berg's Wozzeck and Lulu, both with Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Evelyn Lear, provides not just a great bargain but a revelation of great opera conducting - at once 'traditional' and forward-looking, idiomatically shapely and muscular (DG 435 705-2). The year of the Rossini bicentenary, miserably thin on new goodies, did encourage EMI to reprint on CD three examples of Vittorio Gui's glory as a Rossini conductor. The Glyndebourne Cenerentola (CMS 7 64183 2), Count Ory (CMS 7 64180 2) and even the Barber with Victoria de los Angeles (CMS 7 64162 2) may no longer count as the last word in Rossini singing: but nonetheless, what Rossinian bliss] Another 1992 peg - the Barcelona Olympics and other Spanish Big Events  - prompted the record companies to hang on it a great number of compilation reissues from their Iberian back-catalogues. Decca's four two-disc boxes of 'Musica para piano', Spanish piano music from Soler to Mompou via Albeniz, Granados and Falla, sneaked their way into my record-players again and again: Alicia de Larrocha's peerless skills in this repertory, her gifts of truthfulness, vivacity and calm, demanded no less. Sviatoslav Richter's 1957, 1959 and 1965 Schumann recordings for DG come up as an even more treasurable reissue, subtle and secretive in atmosphere yet also thrillingly bold and broad (435 751-2). Richter accompanies Oleg Kagan and Yury Bashmet in live accounts, from Moscow in the 1980s, of the Shostakovich Violin and Viola Sonatas: bleak music, its agonies nakedly exposed, and here expounded with magnificently firm authority (Melodiya SUCD 10-00095). Alfred Schnittke, the most important Shostakovich successor, is now the modern composer most favoured by record companies; among the many Schnittke issues of 1992 I gained most reward from Natalya Gutman's account of the First Cello Concerto (coupled with the Schumann, EMI CDC 7 54443 2) and Rostropovich's of the Second (coupled with In Memoriam, Sony SK 48241). The best of Schnittke's wild, uneven, unabashed inspiration is here. John Eliot Gardiner and his English Baroque Soloists and Monteverdi Choir, annual heroes of these record round-ups, demand their place yet again. Two DG Archiv choral records - a lovely Beethoven collection with the Mass in C as its focus (433 391-2) and a marvellously robust Haydn Seasons (431 818-2)  -make exhilaratingly fresh sounds, fresh statements about the music. In performances of this order, the great Early Music adventure continues with all its exploratory zeal intact.</p>

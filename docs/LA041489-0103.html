			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Trading Cola for Ships: Norwegian ship brokers have cooked up a deal in which  Soviet shipyards may build up to 85 new vessels worth nearly $2.6 billion that  will be partly paid for in Pepsi, pizza and fried chicken. Ole-Jacob Libaek,  who helped broker the deal, said the U.S. soft-drink giant Pepsi-Cola Co. wants  to replace vodka as the medium of payment for millions of dollars in products  it exports annually to the Soviet Union. Libaek said, "Pepsi Cola is very big  in the Soviet Union and the Russians also want Pizza Huts and Kentucky Fried  Chicken," both owned by Pepsi. The Soviets "prefer to trade goods for goods  because of their deficit of foreign currency," he said.  </P></p>

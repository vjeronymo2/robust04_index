A preliminary award amounting to approximately one-third of the funds available will be made to applicants from the States named below, if their applications are received by BJA by November 30, 1994. Application should be made on the Federal Standard Form 424, and include all assurances and certifications required by law. BJA will provide applicants with these forms as necessary. An original and three copies of the application are required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) While the amount of these preliminary awards will not be based on actual information provided by the seven States, applicants are requested to provide in their application brief descriptive information on: Their overall alien problem as it burdens their correctional system; their method of determining which inmates are undocumented aliens within the meaning of this regulation; currently available estimates of the incarcerated criminal aliens population, in terms of bed spaces, if possible; currently available cost per bed figures; and, the methods to be used to provide inmate specific information, as described in these regulations, to the granting agency. In particular, the applicant should address its ability to provide the types of data elements for individual aliens that are specified in the regulation, and its ability to provide this information in electronic form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) These types of information will enable BJA to plan with greater certainty for the final award process and to work with INS and these applicant States during the period of time between preliminary and final award to establish verification mechanisms which will ensure a proper final distribution of funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The amounts of these preliminary awards have been calculated solely on estimates of eligible aliens and costs provided in the recently released Urban Institute report, ``Fiscal Impact of Undocumented Aliens: Selected Estimates for Seven States,'' (1994), which was commissioned by BJA. This report contains reliable estimates for the numbers and costs of incarcerating illegal criminal aliens in the seven States with the highest percentage of illegal aliens. Reliance on this report enables BJA to award the one-third of the $130 million, as is statutorily required to be distributed within 120 days from the start of the fiscal year, in a timely and reasonable fashion. However, the final awards for these, and any other applicant, States will be based on actual counts and other information provided by the applicant States themselves, as verified by BJA and INS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

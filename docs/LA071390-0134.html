			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> COAST GUARD SAVES BOY, 8, FROM OCEAN  </P> <P> An 8-year-old Huntington Beach boy was plucked from the ocean by a Coast Guard  boat after he was swept out to sea and trapped near some rocks off the Oregon  shore, a Coast Guard spokesman said Thursday.  </P> <P> Peter Dunbar, who was on a beach outing with a group of friends Wednesday, was  taken to a hospital, where he was treated and released, Petty Officer Randy  Sharp said.  </P> <P> Dunbar was swimming in relatively large, six-foot surf on a foam body board  when a powerful rip current washed him seaward, Sharp said. His friends swam in  and asked a resident to notify rescue officials.  </P> <P> Dunbar was wearing a wet suit that was too big for him, and it filled with  water, hampering the boy's ability to swim, Sharp said. The boy did have fins,  he said.  </P> <P> "By the time our boat got to him, he had taken in lots of water. He was  conscious and OK, but he was very scared," Sharp said.  </P> <P> Dunbar was visiting a grandfather, Ted Tiegen of Lincoln Beach. Relatives  declined to comment about the incident.  </P></p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Star Wars adversaries head for further clashes THE Bush administration and Congress are heading for another clash over the Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI), the US's effort to develop a system of anti-missile protection. The two sides in the 'Star Wars' debate reached a compromise last year that would have concentrated efforts on developing a limited, ground-based anti-missile defence that would comply with the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty Under the compromise an SDI system would have been deployed at Grand Forks, North Dakota, by 1996. Leading senators, however, complain that the Defence Department's SDI Organisation is still pursuing a more futuristic system of space-based missile interceptors, using up funds needed to meet the 1996 deadline for deploying a ground-based system. Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate armed services committee, clashed last week with Mr Henry Cooper, director of the SDI Organisation, presaging a fierce battle over the administration's request for Dollars 5.4bn (Pounds 3.13bn) of SDI funding in fiscal 1993  - an increase of nearly a third over the Dollars 4.1bn allotted by Congress for the current year. SDI's ambitions have dwindled from the grandiose vision of total defence sketched out by former President Ronald Reagan. The collapse of the Soviet Union has shifted the debate. Today, congressmen are more concerned about an accidental or rogue launch from the former Soviet Union or about future threats from countries such as Iraq or Iran. The Defence Department, however, regards the Grand Forks ground-based interceptor system as inadequate protection. 'Such a defence would not protect the US against the full range of threats,' the department's annual report to Congress said.</p>

			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHILDREN TREATED TO WARNING BY PRESIDENT ON DRUG ABUSE  </P> <P> The White House helped 500 local schoolchildren celebrate Halloween on Tuesday,  and along with the treats the youngsters got an admonition from President Bush  to beware of something truly scary -- illegal drugs.  </P> <P> Bush and his wife, Barbara, emerged through the mouth of a 15-foot  jack-o-lantern erected over the staid diplomatic entrance of the White House.  </P> <P> In addition, the White House collected pledge cards from the children  forswearing drugs.  </P> <P> "You know they say that there's a ghost in this old house, and the most famous  one is Abraham Lincoln," Bush told the children.  </P> <P> "Barbara and I haven't seen the ghost of Abraham Lincoln walking the halls, but  this is our first Halloween in the White House, so maybe we'll see him  tonight."  </P> <P> The President added: "Halloween is a time for ghosts and goblins, for haunted  houses and scary stories." But there is one "scary story that isn't  make-believe. You know what I'm talking about . . . illegal drugs and how they  hurt people, how they hurt families, hurt kids, some of them just like you."  </P></p>

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Closing ERM fault lines WHAT IS to be done with the ERM? The answer of the top policy-makers of the European Community is apparently 'nothing'. Reports from the monetary committee and the heads of the EC central banks agree that the ERM needs to be better, by which they mean more flexibly, managed. This view is not persuasive. This is far more than a technical matter. The purpose of the ERM is to contribute to the harmonious economic development of the EC. This it has of late failed to do. The gross domestic product of the EC rose by only 0.7 per cent in 1991 and then by 1.1 per cent in 1992. GDP is likely to fall this year. This dismal performance partly reflects the way the ERM has spread the effects of mismanaged German unification. When Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, the distinguished Danish central bank chief, complains that currency co-operation has collapsed because of 'competitive devaluations' he confuses the symptoms of the ailment with its cause. Countries such as Denmark are caught between the unmentionable - the perverse policies of unified Germany - and the intolerable - their recent decline in competitiveness. It is not surprising that they feel frustrated. But to imagine that things would be fine if these devaluations had been prevented is fantasy. So what needs to be done? Three points must be made. First, EC leaders must not be mesmerised by hopes for economic and monetary union. Unless the convergence criteria are torn up, 1999 is now the earliest plausible date for Emu. During the six intervening years, meeting the convergence criteria must be reconciled with sensible macroeconomic policies. That will be possible only if Germany turns its pro-European rhetoric into domestic reality by aggressive rebalancing of its fiscal and monetary policies. Second, the EC must confront the economic failures demonstrated by this week's interim OECD report on employment. How, EC leaders must ask themselves, is the EC to secure lower unemployment and faster economic growth? In the 1980s they found an answer in completing the single market. In the 1990s the answer will lie not in Emu, but elsewhere, notably in the labour market, but also in trade liberalisation and in efforts to reduce the high burden of taxation. ERM management Finally, the ERM itself needs to be reformed. Some believe the principal role of the ERM is to make disinflation more credible. Others argue that the single market would prove either unworkable or unacceptable without an exchange rate arrangement. The former objective implies fixed nominal exchange rates, while the latter implies fixed real exchange rates or, at the least, that changes in real exchange rates should be limited to those warranted by economic fundamentals, including cyclical divergences. This distinction is important. The Italian lira, for example, suffered a 10 per cent deterioration in real competitiveness, vis a vis the rest of Europe, between early 1987 and last September. It is also far from academic, since one cause of the ERM crisis was the effects on competitiveness of reliance on the fixed exchange rate route to lower inflation. Events have made the choice. An ERM based on adjustable exchange rates and operating under freedom for capital flows must set nominal exchange rates that reflect competitiveness. How far then would changes in management of the ERM suffice and how far must the system itself be changed? The answer is that both are needed. Credibility problem For countries that already seem suitable for fixed exchange rates, the difficulty with the ERM is imperfect credibility. Short of Emu, that problem cannot be eliminated. A radical approach would be for the central banks, presumably all independent, to announce their willingness to support one another's currencies without limit, for as long as each country retains stability-oriented policies. For countries that need adjustable exchange rates, the principal difficulty is that the bands have not allowed adequate interest rate flexibility. Nor have they prevented the emergence of one-way bets for speculators. A part of the solution is wider bands - perhaps as much as 10 per cent on either side of the central rate. Another part is a presumption that there would either be a change in monetary policy or a change in central parity, whenever a currency deviates from its central rate by more than, say, half the width of its band. Furthermore, the old and new exchange rate bands would overlap to include the actual exchange rate - eliminating windfall gains for speculators. A currency would also be switched into the narrow band only if its exchange rate remained near the central rate for some years. The EC must confront its central failings of slow growth and high unemployment. At present, unfortunately, the EC's monetary arrangements, both actual and planned, are proving an obstacle rather than a help. So Mr Major was right to identify 'fault lines'. Unfortunately, the British government seems to have done little to help the discussions about how to remove them. Yet it would be both politically and economically foolish to put sterling back into an unreformed ERM. In the new world of freedom for capital flows and economic upheaval, the ERM must be made either more flexible or more fixed. Ideally, it needs to be changed in both directions at the same time.</p>

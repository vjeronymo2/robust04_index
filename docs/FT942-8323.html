			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Telegraph doubt The surprise move by Mr Conrad Black, owner of the Telegraph group, to reduce his holding in the publishing company prompted speculation over whether the 12.5m shares had all been successfully placed. According to a spokeswoman at the Telegraph, the shares were sold to Cazenove and Goldman Sachs, and by the close of business yesterday the Seaq screen was showing only 10m traded both ways. There was strong speculation from rival marketmakers that the two brokers were still sitting on stock. Neither Goldman nor Cazenove would comment. The shares were sold by Mr Black's Hollinger company at 587p apiece, reducing his holding in the Telegraph from 66.2 per cent to 56.95 per cent. The stock retreated 20 to 600p. Wellcome shares came in for some rough handling by the market, sliding 13 to 561p, having reacted to a story circulating late in the session that the company may be encountering strong opposition to the 'over-the-counter' sale of the new highly successful version of its anti-herpes drug Zovirax. A hearing of the US Food and Drug Administration was said to be under way yesterday and that much of the evidence being heard had come from opponents of the drug. Specialists said the drug's proponents had yet to speak and that the outcome was still expected to come down in favour of Wellcome. First-quarter results and another report from the gas industry watchdog Ofgas combined to produce a good showing by British Gas shares yesterday. Dealers said the main upside in Gas shares came following the Ofgas consultation document on competition in the non-domestic gas market. One analyst described the Ofgas report as 'possibly another little victory for Gas in its campaign for an easing of the regulatory stranglehold it finds itself in'. At the close Gas shares were 4 1/2 higher at 284p after rather disappointing turnover of 7.5m BT, on the other hand, slipped 2 1/2 to 376 1/2 p, with the partly-paid 2 off at 258 1/2 p, after the company delivered preliminary profits in line with expectations but slightly disappointing the market with a 7 per cent increase in the dividend total. Turnover in BT ordinary was 9.4m but significantly higher at 13m in the partly-paid stock. The strong performance of Burmah Castrol, up 7 more at 881p, was said to have reflected further keen support for the stock ahead of a presentation to analysts next week, but also amid vague stories that the company could be a break-up prospect to a predator. Shares in Burton, the store group, firmed on a positive analysts meeting after the retailer had unveiled a slight decline in underlying first-half profits. While Debenhams turned in another strong performance, results from Principles and Top Shop remained poor. However, stores specialists described the mood of the meeting as 'honest and pragmatic', although few were committing themselves to outright buy recommendations. Reflecting the hesitant mood, forecasts were being both trimmed and edged forward. The shares gained 2 1/2 at 56 1/2 p on turnover of 13m. As expected, WH Smith announced the restructuring of its shares, with the 'A' stock adding 2 at 512p. Results from Fine Art Developments sent the shares rising 11 to 505p. A positive Mr John Chataway at London Wall estimated that the group's 15 per cent stake in the Grattan mail order business, which has just returned to profit, was now worth Pounds 44m, and that this factored in to his 1994-95 earnings estimate put the stock on an undemanding 12 multiple, or a 25 per cent discount to the sector. A predictable agm statement from Guinness helped the shares recover from their worst, closing 5 1/2 down at 488p. Restructuring at HP Bulmer, the cider maker, helped the stock rise 8 to 397p. A James Capel buy note was said to be behind a bounce of 18 to 1120p by Thorn EMI. GKN was lifted by an upbeat statement at the company's annual meeting. The shares jumped 15 to 596p. Kleinwort Benson was also reported to have become more positive on the stock and upgraded current year profits estimates by Pounds 22m to Pounds 170m. A Smith New Court recommendation helped TI Group firm 6 to 374p. However, engineering group IMI was friendless after BZW was said to be negative on the stock. The shares relinquished 2 to 343p. British Aerospace bounced 9 to 484p after news that BAe Sema, jointly owned by BAe and Sema Group, had won a contract from the South Korean navy. Defence electronics group GEC closed 1 1/2 ahead at 313p after a positive conference on the defence sector at Robert Fleming Securities. Volume was 2m at the close. Tough trading conditions at Iceland were revealed at the company's agm and the shares slid 6 to 146p. A surprise Pounds 40m rights issue from NSM, the coal mining group, saw the stock plunge 43, or 20 per cent, to 174p. Shares in Jackson, the Ipswich-based construction group, leaped 11 to 66p after a return to profits and a 20 per cent dividend increase.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Gold Fields ahead at mid-term to R143m Gold Fields of South Africa, the mining house whose investments include holdings in some of the country's richest gold mines, reported a 5 per cent improvement in pre-tax profit to R143m (Dollars 42m) in the half-year to December 31 from R136m the previous year. The interim dividend is maintained at 70 cents a share. The group looks set to arrest a four-year slide in earnings by the year-end in June as the recovery in the gold price in 1993 translated into sharply higher dividend receipts from its gold mining investments. The turnround in the gold market also masks the disappointing performance of the group's R1.7bn developing Northam Platinum mine and struggling base metal operations, knocked by the downward drift in copper, lead and zinc prices for much of the past year. Investment income rose to R133m from R115m, more than making up for a decline in interest receipts on the group's lower cash reserves. Costs and expenditure were flat at R86m including exploration spending of R19m, of which one-third was spent on the group's recently-acquired gold mining interests in Ghana, Ecuador and Venezuela. With a negligible tax provision of R5m against R12m last year, after-tax income was up at R138m against R124m. Mr Robin Plumbridge, chairman, said he was confident of a modest improvement in bottom line profit at the year end from the R287m reported last year with the rise in interim distributable profit to R132m from R118m. The 'surprising strength' of the gold market as prices returned to Dollars 390 in December boded well for the year ahead as it seemed the price spike to more than Dollars 400 in mid-93 had not done sustained damage to demand for gold from jewellers. He was optimistic the group's loss-making copper mines would ride out the trough in metal prices.</p>

			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Books: Forced into sleuthing - Crime WHEN THE protagonist of a detection novel is not a police agent but a private citizen, the author is always obliged to explain why he or she does not simply call the cops. A frequent answer is: because there aren't any. Perhaps the murder takes place in a remote house, isolated by a blizzard (The Mouse Trap), or on an island where the telephone lines to the mainland have been cut (And Then There Were None), or perhaps the principals are in a foreign country where the forces of law and order are corrupt and unreliable. In two recent first novels, the authors seem hard put to make their answers plausible. Bronte Adams, whose Brought to Book (Virago Pounds 5.99, 232 pages) includes a lot of wry, convincing detail about life in the world of book publishing, invents an unlikely one-eyed heroine who gets herself into the most absurd punishments rather than risk involving the incredibly suspicious police. The author does not lack a gift for invention; there is enough plot for half a dozen murder stories, the setting is well established, and the sheer absurdity of much of the story (the idea of a one-eyed girl trying to conceal her identity]) makes it fun to read. Sarah Lacey's debut novel, File Under Deceased (Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 14.99, 186 pages), is traditionally and effectively laid out, though here, too, the intrepid Leah Hunter, virtually forced into sleuthing, seems particularly wilful in not collaborating with the police, especially since she finds the sergeant attractive. The small town setting in Yorkshire is established with real authority, and the social layers of the constricted society are as distinct as the tiers of a cake. The plot is a bit thick, but the novel suggests a real talent. In Lacey's next one, the tough but golden-hearted Sarah will presumably work hand-in-hand with sergeant Nicholls. He may even have won a promotion.</p>

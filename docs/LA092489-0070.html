			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'INDUSTRIOUSNESS' OF SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> The first page of Sunday's (Sept. 17) Westside section reported on the  industriousness of Santa Monica officials. They are very busy indeed -- busy  attempting to destroy Los Angeles residential neighborhoods. They will reap the  monetary benefits of an expanded Santa Monica Airport, while Los Angeles  residents bear the brunt of the increased traffic.  </P> <P> They also have been working to ram a light rail line through along Exposition  Boulevard. It would go through commercial property in Santa Monica and through  lovely residential areas in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Where will they strike next?  </P> <P> ESTELLE EISLER  </P> <P> Rancho Park  </P></p>

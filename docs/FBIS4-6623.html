			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 20 KYODO -- Domestic vehicle production  and sales of Japan's "Big Two" automakers -- Toyota Motor Corp.  and Nissan Motor Co. -- for fiscal 1993 were down from the year  before, the two automakers announced Wednesday [20 April]. The  dismal showing for production and sales of cars, buses and  trucks in the year ended March 31 stems from slack consumer  spending due to the national economic downturn, industry  analysts said.    Toyota said its domestic motor vehicle output for fiscal  1993  totaled 3,459,840 units, 11.4 percent lower than the year  before. Output of cars fell 11.4 percent to 2,795,055 and that  of trucks and buses together declined 11.2 percent to 664,785,  it said.    By contrast, Toyota's overseas vehicle output surged 14.3  percent to 908,199.    The auto giant's domestic vehicle sales sagged 8.1 percent  to  2,024,329 in terms of registrations, with car sales falling 7.3  percent to 1,439,790, and those of trucks and buses slumping  10.1 percent to 584,539.    Toyota's exports of cars for the year under review came to  1,072,227, down 15.5 percent, and those of trucks and buses  totaled 399,440, a 7.7 percent drop.    Meanwhile, Nissan said its overall domestic output of cars,  trucks and buses for fiscal 1993 fell 14.1 percent to 1,749,814.  Production of cars were down 11.8 percent to 1,484,303 and that  of commercial vehicles fell 24.9 percent to 265,511.    The company's overseas production, however, gained 7.2  percent to 993,503.    Nissan's overall domestic vehicle sales were down 9.6  percent  to 1,067,130, with sales of cars slumping 9.9 percent to 793,455  and those of commercial vehicles falling 8.8 percent to 273,675,  the company said.    The company's vehicle exports plunged 30.0 percent to  629,990, with exports of cars falling 29.8 percent to 513,997  and shipments of commercial vehicles plunging 30.9 percent to  115,993.</p>

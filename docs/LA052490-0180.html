			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: LIFE IS AN ADVENTURE IN GOOD TASTE  </P> <P> A "thirtysomething" reader posed an interesting question. "Why is it when  speaking with an 'older' person about a trip or a vacation they've been on, I  get an answer like this?  </P> <P> "Me: 'You were at Yellowstone last summer. How was it?'  </P> <P> "Them: 'Oh, it was wonderful! We had the best spaghetti I've ever tasted just  outside of Jackson Hole at a little restaurant. . . .' "  </P> <P> The young woman observed that about 75% of the conversation with older people  is about food . . . where it is, how much it cost, how it tasted. She wondered  if it was because they grew up in the Great Depression, when food was scarce  and they had to eat the same thing all the time.  </P> <P> I think that's part of it. When I was attending college, my mother's letters  read like a menu. She began with breakfast and outlined everything she had to  eat for the entire week. Our phone conversations were always about the same  thing: food. "What are you having for dinner? I'm heating up the leftover ham  and frying some potatoes and having a little corn on the cob."  </P> <P> A few years ago, she and my dad took a cruise to Alaska. They took 125 slides;  only six had people in them. (Two of them were pastry chefs.) The other  pictures were of carved bits of ice, cheese displays, baskets of bread and  flaming desserts.  </P> <P> I blamed the Depression years for having to "clean up" everything on my plate  and eat up the black bananas before I could start on the yellow ones. We were  told the "heels" of bread made your hair curly and starving Armenians were  waiting in line for those stinking Brussels sprouts. Mom would spend a fortune  on glass jars and lids to can a bag of "free" apples.  </P> <P> My other theory is that after a certain age, food is one of the few vices left  that you can enjoy. The kids are gone and have their own lives. Your job is a  memory. Physical activities are a real effort. A new car no longer gives you  the kick it once did. Food is one of the few fantasies you can lust after and  turn into reality. If you live long enough, food even replaces sex.  </P> <P> Our young friend said the weird part of her findings was that a couple of weeks  ago, a contemporary of hers went to a Paul McCartney concert, and when asked  how she liked it, said, "Oh, it was great. You should have seen all the food we  had before the concert -- honey-baked ham, roast turkey, munchies. . . ."  </P> <P> I told my reader that her friend was older than she thinks.  </P></p>

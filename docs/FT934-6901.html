			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / ITC issues invitation to apply for a new cable licence in UK The Independent Television Commission yesterday issued the first invitation for four years to apply for a new cable licence in the UK. The franchise, for the west Kent towns of Sevenoaks, Tonbridge and Tunbridge Wells, is the first to be advertised under the 1990 Broadcasting Act. This means that the 'local delivery licence', as new franchises will be known, will go to the highest bidder. Apart from the annual bid - there is no minimum figure - applicants will have to pay a percentage of their income from advertising and television subscriptions. In the case of west Kent it will be zero in the first five years, 2 per cent for the following five years and 6 per cent for the last five years of the 15-year licence. Encom, whose majority shareholder is Bell Canada, has expressed an interest in the west Kent franchise. It already holds franchises in areas such as Dartford and Bexley in Kent. The latest cable figures show that by October 1 the number of homes subscribing to modern cable services had passed 500,000 for the first time.</p>

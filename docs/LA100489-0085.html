			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES;  </P> <P> INJURED GIANTS LOOK FOR SECOND WIND AGAINST THE CUBS  </P> <P> The only thing strong or steady here Tuesday was the wind, which chilled the  teams who tonight begin a National League championship series that neither  seems capable of winning.  </P> <P> Huddled in one Wrigley Field clubhouse were the East Division champion Chicago  Cubs. You love them because they haven't won a pennant in 44 years, or the  World Series in 81 years. You love them because of their bleachers, their ivy,  and that break-dancing grandfather named Harry Caray.  </P> <P> But do you know them?  </P> <P> Quick, name one of their catchers. Any of their catchers. How about the left  fielder? OK, then the center fielder.  </P> <P> A hint: None of them, nor 14 other Cubs, have ever played on national  television in October.  </P> <P> In the other clubhouse, dressed in turtlenecks, long johns and puffed chests,  were the Western Division champion San Francisco Giants. They have just won  their second division title in three years. They have the game's most powerful  3-4 punch in Will Clark and Kevin Mitchell.  </P> <P> But historically, hitting does not help teams in body casts.  </P> <P> It was announced Tuesday that catcher Terry Kennedy has a mysterious shoulder  ailment, startling news that was greeted by Giant officials with nothing more  than a rolling of eyes. That is because scheduled Game 3 starter Don Robinson  has a bad right knee, reliever Craig Lefferts has a not-so-mysterious shoulder  ailment, and Clark is still hobbled by a bruised knee suffered in a recent  collision with Dodger catcher Mike Scioscia.  </P> <P> Then there are Mitchell's tender left wrist, third baseman Matt Williams'  hamstring strain, and shortstop Jose Uribe's bruised left shoulder. These sore  Giants have been administered more shots than Mitchell has hit.  </P> <P> Said the Giants' leader, Clark: "I just hope we've got enough guys to drag out  there."  </P> <P> Said the Cubs' leader, Rick Sutcliffe: "I just hope we never wake up."  </P> <P> Beginning tonight in Game 1 at Wrigley Field at 5:15 p.m. (PDT), with the Cubs'  Greg Maddux (19-12) facing the Giants' Scott Garrelts (14-5), both teams had  better hope this seven-game duel is not determined by the one player who seems  poised and vicious -- the wind.  </P> <P> "There are really only two bad parks in this league for the wind," Lefferts  said. "Ours, and theirs."  </P> <P> Here at Wrigley, with little notice, infield fly balls can land in the seats.  At the Giants' Candlestick Park home, with little notice, infielders can land  in the seats.  </P> <P> "But at least here, the wind goes in one direction, and you know which  direction," Cub first baseman Mark Grace said. "There, you have to send four  guys after every popup."  </P> <P> Said Lefferts: "You watch, the wind will bite somebody. They are used to it,  and so are we, and it doesn't matter. Before it's all over with, somebody will  definitely get bit."  </P> <P> If it happens to the Cubs, they may not feel it. After winning just nine games  in spring training, worst in the league, they won eight of their first 10  regular-season games. Then, behind the unorthodox moves and inspiration of  Manager Don Zimmer -- he has used his cleanup hitter to suicide-squeeze bunt --  the Cubs embarked on a journey during which they spent 100 days in first place,  including the final two months of the season.  </P> <P> "Sometimes, I've got to touch myself to make sure I'm really here," shortstop  Shawon Dunston said.  </P> <P> He's not the only one. Only six Cubs have been here before, including just  three from that 1984 division championship team that beat the San Diego Padres  in the first two playoff games in Wrigley Field, then lost three straight at  San Diego, blowing what was then a best-of-five series.  </P> <P> "Guys on this team ask me all the time about how bad that was and I tell them,  up until now it was the highlight of my career," said Sutcliffe, who with his  tender shoulder apparently healed will start Game 3. "All of us have to  realize, we may never be here again."  </P> <P> It is that attitude that should most scare the favored Giants. From catchers  Joe Girardi and rookie Rick Wrona to rookie left fielder Dwight Smith to rookie  center fielder Jerome Walton, the unknown Cubs may have no idea how much they  should fear.  </P> <P> "We might not be smart enough to get nervous," first baseman Mark Grace said.  </P> <P> Walton, for example, is nursing a sore right hamstring. But he laughed when  asked if he should play at less than 100%.  </P> <P> "Don't matter what percent I'm at," he said. "I'll be there. I deserve to be  there."  </P> <P> Not that rookie-of-the-year favorite Walton -- he hit .293 and stole 24 bases  -- or Smith, with a team-leading .324 average and 52 RBIs in 109 games, or even  tonight's starter Wrona, who hit .283, should have reason to worry. They will  be surrounded by steady Grace, who hit .314; Andre Dawson, who hit 27 home  runs, and, of course, by the quietly great second baseman Ryne Sandberg, who  batted .290 and hit 30 homers.  </P> <P> And if things get tense, all the Cubs need to do is bring in reliever Mitch  Williams, who typified this team from opening day, when, against Philadelphia,  he loaded the bases in the ninth inning, then struck out the side. Of course,  he doesn't have any postseason experience either.  </P> <P> "That's OK," he said. "Even when I'm in trouble, I don't think I'm in trouble."  </P> <P> The Giants, 18 of whom have postseason experience, know when they're in  trouble.  </P> <P> They ended the season losing six of their final seven games and were swept by  the Dodgers in a series that showed just how much Robinson and Clark were  hurting.  </P> <P> Then came the problem with today's scheduled starting catcher, Kennedy, an  important left-handed hitter against the Cubs' three right-handed starters in  this series, Maddux, Mike Bielecki and Sutcliffe. He woke up Monday with a sore  shoulder.  </P> <P> At first, he thought he had slept on it wrong. But it was still hurting  Tuesday, enough to require a cortisone shot and much fretting.  </P> <P> "It's a serious problem," said Giant Manager Roger Craig, who was satisfied  enough with Kennedy's Tuesday workout that he will still probably start today.  "Thing is, the whole world knows that maybe now he can't throw as well, or  swing at bat as well. That's not good."  </P> <P> Craig was also satisfied with a simulated game pitched Tuesday by Robinson, who  has been fighting his sore knee for a month. Even though the 235-pound pitcher  grunted through every delivery, it appears he will at least be able to walk to  the mound for Friday's scheduled start, following Garrelts and Rick Reuschel.  </P> <P> "I've come this far, man, I definitely want to go out there," Robinson said.  </P> <P> Then there's Clark. He shook his head when asked if his badly bruised knee,  suffered a couple of weeks ago when Scioscia fell on him, was healed.  </P> <P> "Nope, it's not better at all, but now is not a time to be worrying about it,"  he said.  </P> <P> Besides, Clark noted in a touch of humility, he, despite his .333 average and  111 RBIs, and Mitchell, despite his 47 homers and 125 RBIs, aren't the most  important Giants today.  </P> <P> "The key to this series will be the No. 1 and 2 hitters," he said. "They've got  to get on for the other guys."  </P> <P> For the Giants, those hitters will be Brett Butler and Robby Thompson. For the  Cubs, it will be Walton and Sandberg.  </P> <P> Of course, Clark and his teammate think they can win, no matter what. When  asked if he was eagerly anticipating an all-Bay Area World Series, Clark  grinned.  </P> <P> "You're forgetting something," he said. "Oakland has to beat Toronto first."  </P></p>

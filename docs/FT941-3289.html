			<p>940316 FT  16 MAR 94 / US nuclear test ban extended President Clinton has told Congress that he is extending the US moratorium on nuclear testing until September 1995, the White House said yesterday, Reuter reports. White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said the decision was based in part on the restraint of other declared nuclear powers in not resuming testing in response to China's test last October. She also credited the encouraging progress in comprehensive test ban talks since they opened in January.</p>

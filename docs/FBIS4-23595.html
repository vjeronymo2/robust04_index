			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town June 9 SAPA -- The government was  committed to reconciliation, and nation-building had been  central to the African National Congress's policy since its  establishment in 1912, President Nelson Mandela said on  Thursday. Answering questions atthe World Economic Forum's  southern African summit in Cape Town, he said in the past  opponents of apartheid who had applied for indemnity had had to  state what crimes they had committed.    "Now we say we want to be even-handed." Those who had  committed crimes in defence of apartheid would have to subscribe  to the same conditions. This was the only way in which the  wounds of the past could be healed.    Mr Mandela stressed the intention was not to institute  Nuremburg-style trials.    He added that the category of apartheid defenders being  referred to was those who had thought they were implementing  policies in which they believed, and not those who had planned  the murder of innocent people.    "I hope all of you will accept our bona fides. We want to  say  we are committed to reconciliation."    The ANC had said from its inception that South Africa  belonged to all its people, black and white -- and in the 1950's  152 leaders of the people had been charged with treason for this  principle.    "We are the one organisation whose bona fides should not be  questioned," President Mandela said.</p>

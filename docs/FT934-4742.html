			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Brighter outlook for GEC on back of investment Yesterday's sharp decline in GEC's share price, sparked by Lord Prior's warning of more or less flat earnings for the current year, may have been overdone. There is no doubt, however, that coupled with the group's lacklustre results for the first half, the warning prompted an abrupt change of market sentiment. Looking further ahead the picture is somewhat brighter, as the group should begin to reap the benefits of its heavy investment in electronic systems and power systems, two of its three principal businesses. Profits in the electronic systems division, for example, were down by Pounds 11m to Pounds 79m but orders, up 2 per cent since March at Pounds 4.9bn, exceeded sales of Pounds 1.14bn. Orders were received for avionics systems for Tornado aircraft for Saudi Arabia, sonar systems for Trident and the laser warner for the Eurofighter. The decline in profits in electronic systems was caused by heavy development costs necessary before product sales, according to Lord Weinstock, GEC managing director. The costs of interactive in-flight entertainment systems, for example, had risen and provisions had been made. Work on the Eurofighter was progressing, but longer development cycles provoked higher spending, he said. Pre-tax profits in the components - semiconductor chips - area were flat at Pounds 6m. The company's profitability is tied to volume sales of products such as computer disk drives for which it makes special circuitry. Power systems showed a slight rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 77m to Pounds 79m. The order book, at Pounds 6.6bn, was 8 per cent higher than at the March 31 year end. The company has been selected by the Korean High Speed Construction Authority to negotiate the high speed train contract for the Seoul-Pusan line, valued at Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.61m). It has also won orders worth more than Pounds 300m for London Underground's Jubilee Line extension. Telecommunications, the third of GEC's principal businesses, showed a significant drop in profits to Pounds 44m (Pounds 61m). Orders received, however, were up 32 per cent. Continental Europe, where GEC has about one third of its business, remains the company's chief problem area, but the trio of businesses in the US, Gilbarco, Videojet and Picker, turned in record sales and profits.</p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Arts: At the end of the rainbow - Cinema THREE COLOURS RED (15) Krzysztof Kieslowski DREAM LOVER (18)Nicholas Kazan SLEEP WITH ME (18) Rory Kelly FLESH AND BONE (15) Steve Kloves IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU (PG) Andrew Bergman Is the crusty retired judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant) at the centre of Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colours Red really a portrait of the director? Kieslowski is now a crusty retired film-maker. Before unwrapping this farewell movie at Cannes last May, he announced that he was going into a life of chain-smoking leisure and contemplation. Like Judge Trintignant, he realises that truth is a desperate thing to keep chasing; and that curiosity about human beings is not necessarily an honest virtue, just as often it may be, or may become, a sleazy addiction. Trintignant, deep in the book-lined villa where the film's student/fashion-model heroine (Irene Jacob) first finds him, after she has injured his Alsatian dog in a car collision, spends his days tapping into neighbours' phone calls. Like a movie-maker he flirts with omniscience. He knows of the next-door husband's guilt: 'Sooner or later he'll jump out of a window and his wife will know everything.' He knows too about the blonde girl who is two-timing her young lawyer boyfriend, who happens to live near Jacob herself. A few scenes later, prompted by our heroine's virtuous indignation, Judge Trintignant reveals his crimes to the cops and the newspapers. Enough with the hi-tech voyeurism, he seems to say. And is Kieslowski saying the same? Three Colours Red rounds off the Polish film-maker's tricouleur trilogy with this essay on fraternity. The movie, like the Judge, often seems tired. Many of the metaphysical Kieslowski twitchings were displayed to better effect in Blue. This goes for the obsession with parallel lives. Is Mlle Jacob's young lawyer neighbour mystically re-living Trintignant's life, right down to exact, reverberant incidents like the dropping of a pile of exam books in the street? It also goes for the director's fondness for deus ex machina wrap-ups. In Red we have a hideously glib ending in which a cross-channel ferry is sacrificed to bad weather so that six people can survive to reveal themselves as - yes] - the key young characters from all three trilogy movies. This includes the young lawyer, at last hurled by Fate into Jacob's arms. Red begins as a movie about communication between people and generations. The opening sequence is a dazzler: camera snaking at high speed along phone cables as they plunge through earth and then under the sea. And thereafter the film's title colour is picked out in each scene, warmly, brilliantly, like a electronic beacon between strangers and ages. But midway through the film we start to get an empty, hungry feeling. Surely Kieslowski and regular co-writer Krzysztof Piesiewicz have forgotten something vital: to put real people into this story. Where past heroines - Juliette Binoche in Blue, Irene Jacob in The Double Life Of Veronique - were tortured, touching souls grappling with the tragicomedy of everyday life, no one in Red lives and breathes except as illustrations to a thesis. That thesis is: Everything, for good and ill, connects. Trintignant's Judge is the sacred and profane side of our Neighbourhood Watch epoch: satanic, he snoops; God-like, he can confer happy endings. Jacob's leggy, open-hearted model is a sort of Miss Perfect Human Communion 1994. And the setting is Geneva, world capital of brokered harmony. In the Kieslowski cannon the jagged realities and loose nerve-ends of Blue, and the song-without-end mysticism of Veronique, have been put away for this too, too neat last testament. Red shows that even lives that do not naturally connect can be forced into harmony by a little hi-tech hot-wiring mixed with supernatural benison. But every film industry likes to compel human unions when it cannot germinate them naturally. Each film this week is a variant on that oldest coercive formula of all: Boy Meets Girl. Nicholas Kazan's Dream Lover is a directing debut by the screenwriter of Patty Hearst and Reversal Of Fortune. So we expect a few frissons amid the amatory fol-de-rol. Boy (James Spader) meets girl (Madchen Amick); then boy starts to wish he had not met girl when Amick shows signs of deceit, infidelity and a hidden past. Boy ends up in a mental asylum hatching murder plots. While ambiguity thrives, the film has a wicked wit. Kazan lets Spader get ever more lost amid the chic white spaces of his home and office - he is an architect (but, ah irony, not of his own destiny) - while Amick's dream-bride beauty becomes ever more sinisterly blanched and iconic. For 80 of its 103 minutes, we are guessing, fretting and chewing the nearest set of fingernails. But the ending is a disaster: a surrender to thriller cliche that should be stamped like a black spot on Kazan's directing CV, to warn future employers. In Rory Kelly's Sleep With Me, boy (Eric Stoltz) meets girl (Meg Tilly); boy marries girl; boy then discovers that second boy (Craig Sheffer), his longtime friend, has raging passion for girl. We move into a Jules and Jim syndrome, California-style, in which kooky triangular fun alternates with moments of semi-murderous intent. Six scriptwriters, including Neal Jimenez (River's Edge) and Roger Heddon (Bodies, Rest And Motion), each worked at different story sections: which explains why the film feels like a game of consequences played out by the students of a creative writing class. Some innocent-seeming scenes are sharp as a paper's edge. Others, notably the rambling 'confessions' to video camera during a long barbecue sequence, are as blunt as yesterday's writing ideas that you balled up and threw into the WPB. Do watch, though, for a funny cameo by Quentin Tarantino as a party guest deconstructing Top Gun as a gay fable. As for Flesh And Bone, what ever high-concept story conference produced this? Boy (Dennis Quaid) meets girl (Meg Ryan). Boy, we learn, is the grown-up ex-accomplice of a violent burglar father (James Caan) who shot to death the girl's family when she was a baby. So the stage is set - or the flat, moody, infinite Texas landscape - for a flat, moody, infinite film. The slow incubation of revenge shares screen time with the grimly inert 'lerve' story at the centre. It feels like a bad O'Neill play staged by a community theatre company: one of those outdoor productions where the audience has to keep moving its chairs around. Now we are watching everyday small-town life as it is clumped through by Quaid, a man of few words and none of them interesting. Now we are out in the cornfields with Ryan, wondering why the talented star of Sleepless In Seattle took on this rewardless, one-note role. Ah, yes; of course. She is married to Quaid. Dynastic connections are important in Hollywood. It Could Happen To You is a romantic comedy starring Nicolas Cage, nephew of Francis Coppola, and Bridget Fonda, daughter of Peter, and directed by Andrew Bergman, son of Ingmar: if only. Ingmar should have taken over this film and given it teeth and mania. Boy (policeman) meets girl (waitress). Boy, in lieu of tip, promises girl half whatever he wins on a lottery ticket. Boy wins lottery. Boy wins girl. Boy's wife (Rosie Perez) promptly goes berserk, which provides the only comedy in a film so thick with anodyne, lolloping romance that by the end we are crying out for one of those murders so generously on offer in the week's other movies.</p>

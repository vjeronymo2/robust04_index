			<p>BFN     [Text] Semarang, Central Java -- Some 1,500 workers at PT  [Limited Company] Jati Luhur Agung went on strike yesterday  demanding a pay raise in compliance with the government's  regional minimum wage.    One of the demonstrators, Sugito, told THE JAKARTA POST that  the workers had conveyed their demands to the management on  April 4th but to date had not received any reply.    The workers currently received Rp [Rupiah] 2000 a day, far  below the sanctioned minimum of Rp 2,700 (US$1.27) for labor in  Central Java.    "We will be happy to return to work as soon as they address  our demands," he said.    The workers disbanded without incident from the wood  floor-panel factory at 2 p.m. [0700 GMT] under the watchful eye  of the police and armed forces.</p>

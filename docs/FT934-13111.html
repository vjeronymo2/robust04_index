			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Presonal Finance (30): After market dissonance equities are hardly top of the pops / Serious riches WHEN A pop celebrity offers you a glass of champagne at 11am, you think he is acting true to form. But in all other respects, Geoff Stephens, pop songwriter extraordinaire, does not fit the stereotype. There are no flashy cars, no multi-chambered mansions dotted across the world, not even a swimming pool at his modest house tucked away quietly in suburban Berkhamsted; and his wife is the same one he married 36 years ago. The modesty is not for lack of success. His songs, some of them co-written, have been recorded by a constellation of stars  - Elvis Presley, Cliff Richard, Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jnr, Tom Jones, Olivia Newton John, The Hollies. Perhaps the reason is that Geoff Stephens, who was born of working-class parents, appears to be a cautious man only too aware that money is easy come, easy go in the music business. As a boy, he had wanted to be a writer, and that is the temperament which appears to define him more easily than the exhibitionism of the pop world. He was already married with two small children when he had his first big hit in 1967, and his family responsibility seems to have inhibited any temptation to blow his new winnings. 'Winchester Cathedral' knocked Diana Ross and the Supremes off the the top of the charts in the US, and it won Stephens an Ivor Novello award for best pop song of the year. In the same year, he had another hit with 'There's a Kind of Hush all over the World,' originally sung by Herman's Hermits, and later revived by the Carpenters. 'The success of those songs in the same year turned my life around,' said Stephens. 'It was like winning the pools, except pool winnings are tax-free and in that era tax rates were over 90 per cent. 'I had a young family, and knew that the music business is very speculative. Songwriting is not a steady job, and there was no guarantee that I could repeat the success; so, after advice from my accountant, we finally decided that the only way to get around this was to emigrate,' recalls Stephens, who appears to have agonised hard over a decision he was aware could attract criticism. The idea of Jersey was abandoned in favour of Geneva; and he lived up a little more to the stereotype when he moved there in 1969, buying a house with a swimming pool and tennis court. 'The original intention was to rent and stay there a couple of years, but we put down roots. Many of my collaborators were happy to come and stay with us, and I also travelled to Nashville and Los Angeles to promote my songs.' He deposited funds with a reputable stockbroker in Geneva, to manage a portfolio for him on a discretionary basis, but after losing money in the 1974 crash, the experience left him feeling shy of equities. 'I became a building societies man, and had deposits on the money markets.' He also invested in his own publishing company  - Tic-Toc Music  - which is still in existence. In 1977, Stephens returned so that his children could finish their education in England, and the family settled in Berkhamsted. 'Graham Greene used to go to the local school here and his father had been headmaster.' In the early 1980s, Stephens decided to venture back into equities, but when the portfolio started to suffer losses, he decided to pull out. 'Again, I went to an investment adviser, and he handled a portfolio for me on a discretionary basis, but I managed to come out of that with a loss, too. Timing is very important. If I had not got cold feet, I should have stayed in the market.' Stephens also had safe investments, such as National Savings, but did not think about a pension until a few years ago. 'I always thought my songs would be my pension, but my accountants, Arram Berlyn Gardner, suggested an executive pension plan, which I am delighted with. They also proposed that I retreat to the sanctuary of the building society and the money markets, where I enjoyed a period of high interest rates in the 1980s.' One of their other suggestions was to place money in Rothschild Old Court Guernsey funds, which offer the flexibility of deferring a tax liability since they are offshore roll-up funds. 'When interest rates started coming down, I wondered how to protect myself against inflation, since most of my money was held on deposit. My accountants suggested insurance-based products, such as with-profits bonds and back-to-back investments, which can achieve better rates of return and are a further way of deferring tax liabilities.' Having decided that there must be more to financial planning than insurance products, Stephens also consulted Chamberlain de Broe, the London-based fee-charging financial advisers. He does not need investment income, because his earnings meet his needs, so the portfolio is oriented towards capital growth, while taking account of his cautious attitude towards equities and reluctance to speculate. The bulk of his portfolio is still on deposit and in managed currency funds. These have been heavily oriented towards the dollar, but, since his expenditure is in sterling, the cash portion of the portfolio is being eased back into sterling whenever the dollar shows any strength. Tax-efficiency is a priority, so National Savings certificates, a personal equity plan, the executive pension, and the full use of his wife's personal allowances once independent taxation came into force in 1990, have all been the obvious investment choices. There is a measure of speculation in equities through investment and unit trusts. Stephens currently has holdings in Mediterranean investment trust, Exeter Warrant fund and City of London Emerging Markets. A range of tax-planning opportunities is also presented through his ownership of a company. 'My accountants, who had previously recommended a dividend policy as a tax-efficient way of extracting company funds, are, as I approach retirement, now proposing salary increases, to enable me to provide maximum funding to my executive pension scheme.' The pop world has changed in the past decade, as more and more stars have eschewed the songwriter in favour of penning their own tunes and lyrics. Stephens has turned towards writing for musicals instead, but many of his old hits return to haunt him, and to provide an unexpected source of income. His song, 'The Crying Game', for example, written in 1965, was recently revived for an Oscar-winning film named after the song. His favourite investment now is his publishing company, and the bruising experiences with equities are still evident. 'In principle, I still believe in investing in your own company and your own children  - that is the way for me. My son Paul has started a recording studio/production complex  - Bury Farm Studios, in Bovingdon  - and Tic-Toc Music is investing in that. In that way, you are relying on your own expertise, rather than that of others.'</p>

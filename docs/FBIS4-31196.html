			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "bog, mh": "Voting on Amendment to the Electoral </F> Law Will Probably Take Place on Thursday"]    [Excerpts] Bratislava--Virtually the whole day of  yesterday's continuation of the 32d meeting of the National  Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR] was taken up by the debate  on the draft amendment to the electoral law, which was put  forward by a group of deputies. Because of the large number of  proposed changes and to give the deputies time to study them  thoroughly, the vote on the amendment was postponed until 2  June, according to NRSR Chairman Ivan Gasparovic. [passage  omitted]    The proposal to amend the electoral law was put forward by  Deputy P. Hrusovsky (Christian Democratic Movement). He  proposed that the provision be deleted from the law under which  the ballot papers are delivered to the voters' homes. According  to the amendment, the ballot papers should be handed out at the  polling station. The amendment also amends provisions on the  active right to vote of citizens of the Slovak Republic living  outside the territory of the Slovak Republic. Until now, only  Slovak Republic citizens permanently residing in the Slovak  Republic had the right to vote. Under the coalition's proposal,  they are to retain the right to vote even if they are not  permanently residing in the Slovak Republic. To exercise this  right, however, they must come to the Slovak Republic to cast  their vote. The amendment proposes, furthermore, an increase in  the number of candidates on the political parties' slates of  candidates for the NRSR from 40 to 50. The coalition's  proposals were opposed by deputies from the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] and the Slovak National Party [SNS].  [passage omitted] Jan Carnogursky proposed that campaign  broadcasts be permitted on private radio or television and not  just on Slovak Television and Slovak Radio. Countering calls  that the ballot papers be delivered to voters' homes, Interior  Minister Ladislav Pittner said that "that which prevents  manipulation in filling out the ballot papers is what is  democratic." According to Pittner, the issuing of ballot papers  on election day is customary in the neighboring countries.  Besides, the citizen can familiarize himself with the  candidates not only from the election campaign but also at his  place of residence, where the lists of voters and electoral  lists with the names of candidates and political parties will be  posted 30 days before the elections. [passage omitted]    The deputies then passed an amendment to the law on the  regulation of conduct of business with tobacco, salt, and  spirits and on the abolition of state financial monopolies. The  existing legislation awarded the exclusive--that is,  monopoly--right to conducting business in these areas to  state-owned enterprises, which was an obstacle to the  development of economic competition. [passage omitted]    The NRSR bill on the social fund was put forward by P.  Jakubik (Party of the Democratic Left) on behalf of a group of  deputies. The bill was largely identical with the principles for  the generation of the social fund that the government approved  on 24 May. The only remaining disputed issue was the possibility  of generating the social fund in loss-making companies (this  idea was favored by the trade unions, while employers and the  government were opposed). Ultimately, the deputies approved a  version under which both commercial and nonprofit organizations  will be obliged to set up the fund from 0.6 percent of the  volume of wages or salaries paid out in the current year. This  obligatory allocation will be included in the organization's  expenditures (costs). Employers who made a profit [the year  before] will also create the social fund from the company's  costs. In the case of profit-making organizations, the social  fund can amount to up to 1 percent [of the total wage bill].  The adopted law will come into force on 1 September 1994 for  the production sphere and on 1 January 1995 for budget-funded  and subsidized organizations. All contributions paid out to  employees, in cash or in kind, will be subject to a special  10-percent tax. The aim of the social fund is to grant employees  certain material benefits, such as contributions to meals,  transportation, or a supplementary pension insurance, and also  the provision of nonreturnable social assistance. Of the 104  deputies present, 67 voted in favor of the bill's passage, 17  were against, and 18 abstained. [passage omitted]</p>

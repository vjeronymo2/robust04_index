			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Cash call talk hits Cadbury Talk of a Pounds 1bn rights issue swirled around Cadbury Schweppes yesterday. The suggestion was that Cadbury could soon launch a one-for-four cash call at 480p a share to enable it to buy the 76 per cent of Dr Pepper/Seven Up, the US's third biggest soft drinks group, it does not already own. However, some analysts, while accepting the logic of the move, said that at 480p it would still leave the UK group short of the estimated Pounds 1.4bn needed. They also pointed out that it is only six months since Cadbury last asked shareholders for funds - the Pounds 324m used to purchase A &amp; W Brands, also of the US. Cadbury shares fell back on the speculation and closed 12 down at 523p - but still well ahead of their recent low of 445p at the end of November. Cadbury dramatically increased its stake in Dr Pepper six months ago in a move which alarmed the fiercely independent US group. The two companies would have a combined market share of the US soft drinks market of around 14 per cent and would be better able to take on Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, the industry leaders.</p>

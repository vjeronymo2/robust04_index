			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / International Company News: Thais shell out for shrimp venture - Steven Chia hopes to supply chitin products Mr Steven Chia is euphoric about his latest shrimp venture. 'Chitin,' he said at his office in Bangkok, 'looks like a miracle product'. Extracted from the shells of shrimps and crabs, chitin is a cellulose-like substance with diverse applications; its derivatives can be made into surgical stitching thread that dissolves harmlessly in the flesh, or used to separate heavy metals in water treatment plants, or sprayed on to fruit to prevent moisture loss. The potential worldwide demand for chitin products is estimated at more than Dollars 1bn a year, but supply has been limited by difficulties in extracting materials of the right quality and in sufficient quantities. Mr Chia, managing director of Seafresh Industry (Thailand), one of the main Thai shrimp exporters listed on the Thai stock exchange, sees this unsatisfied demand as a chance to make money. Seafresh, with plenty of shrimp shells at its disposal, has established a Dollars 1m joint venture with Kitosan Laboratories of Malaysia to produce about 100 tonnes of chitin a year; a typical price is Dollars 50 per kg (although some grades command much higher premiums) and in the first year alone Mr Chia is counting on net profits of Dollars 2m from the venture. Whether it turns out to be miraculous or not, the Seafresh chitin investment underlines the determination of Thai shrimp processing companies to add value to their output as exports continue to grow. This year Thai frozen shrimp exports are expected to rise by 10 per cent to some 160,000 tonnes, valued at about Dollars 2bn. Shrimp is one of Thailand's biggest exports after textiles and computer parts. Japan and the US are the main buyers. Thailand, the world's biggest shrimp exporter, has seen dollar prices boosted by the strength of the yen and by a fall in Chinese production after outbreaks of disease in Chinese shrimp farms. Thai seafood companies and their shareholders are reaping the rewards. 'Foreign institutional investors tend to be a bit dubious about agribusiness stocks because they are prone to cycles and earnings in the past have been disappointing,' said one Bangkok-based stockbroker. 'It's only since late last year that we've seen a pick-up in sales and that's now feeding through into margins.' But the volatility of shrimp prices still preoccupies Thai exporters, especially when they face possible competition from new aquaculture ventures in countries such as India and Vietnam. Hence the urge to process the shrimp in Thailand: the prices of downstream products for the retail market are not only higher but more stable than those of basic frozen shrimp, and Thailand believes its skilled labour for processing gives it a competitive advantage over new entrants to the market. Methods of adding value range from boiling the shrimp to producing frozen sushi for Japan. Seafresh, for example, adds value to more than half its output, producing breaded shrimp for tempura and making spring rolls; recently it began selling shrimp fried rice to South Korea. Charoen Pokphand Feedmill, part of the multinational CP group, makes most of its money from shrimpfeed, but also has a subsidiary exporting fried shrimps in batter and skewered shrimps in barbecue sauce. Surapon Seafoods, another seafood exporter, is switching some of its production from unprocessed frozen shrimp to pre-cooked meals - including meat and vegetables - for Japanese convenience stores. Other companies are following the same road. The most likely obstacle to the Thai shrimp industry's continued expansion is the carrying capacity of the country's environment. Shrimp farms are notoriously destructive - they usually replace the mangrove swamps where fish breed - and prone to disease. They tend to be poisoned by their own effluent and fail after a few years, as happened in Taiwan. 'A cynic would say it's getting near the end of the road for Thailand as far as the shrimp industry goes,' said a stockbroker, who asked not to be named. 'They need new territory, long coastlines, clean water and preferably places that are poor where they don't have very strong environmental rules.' The CP group has already announced plans to invest an additional Dollars 100m in the shrimp and shrimpfeed business in India, and is also looking at the possibility of investing in other countries such as Bangladesh and Vietnam. For the time being, however, the industry in Thailand is managing to stave off disease and devise ever more sophisticated ways of packaging and marketing its shrimp products. Seafresh's project to make chitin and chitosan - chitin's main derivative - is just the latest example of how Thai companies are making the most of their shrimp. Mr Chia says the new plant, to be operational in six months, will be able to produce a range of grades demanded by buyers for everything from cosmetics to loud speaker diaphragms (another application). 'We can tailor-make the product the buyers need,' he says.</p>

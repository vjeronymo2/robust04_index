He noted that the Czech Republic had a normal political  system without any ethnic problems. The pace and dynamism of  privatisation is more important than the current share -- about  60 percent of privatised companies in the Czech Republic's total  production, Klaus said, adding that the share of the private  sector was nil in the 1980's.</p>

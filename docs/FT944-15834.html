			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Tiny rival attacks Branson over cola name Richard Branson, the Virgin company chairman who appears to delight in challenging the supremacy of established organisations such as British Airways and Coca-Cola, is himself coming under attack from a minnow competitor. Mr Ric Huning, a businessman who has been operating a small group of companies called the Elfin Group from Wales, says he, and not Mr Branson, was the originator of the idea of a Virgin Cola drink. Last week, with a great deal of fizz, Mr Branson announced the launch of Virgin Cola. The drink will initially be distributed mainly through Tesco supermarkets in the UK. Mr Huning says he first presented the Cola concept to Virgin in 1992 but that in January 1993 the organisation rejected the idea. Virgin has confirmed that the following letter was sent to Mr Huning on 28th January last year from a Virgin company executive, Mr Craig Dixon: 'Thank you for your letter of 11th January 1993. Your idea for 'Virgin Cola' looks very interesting and I am sure it would be a great success. 'However, we are currently concentrating investment on ideas which fit in with our existing businesses. 'Unfortunately your idea is a little too far removed from those businesses to be of interest to us. I wish you luck with your endeavours and thank you for considering Virgin.' Following this letter Mr Huning said that he started discussions about manufacturing and marketing Virgin Cola himself. But then, according to Mr Huning: 'Somebody in the (Virgin) organisation must have decided somewhere through 1993 that it was a damn good idea and they should really do it.' Round one in the battle has already been lost by Mr Huning. In July this year Virgin gained an interim injunction in the High Court preventing Mr Huning from using the Virgin Cola name in the UK. Harbottle &amp; Lewis, Virgin's lawyers in London, said that the letter from Mr Dixon was 'written by mistake in the middle of an extremely aggressive set of correspondence' between the firm and Mr Huning. This correspondence made it clear to Mr Huning that 'if he tried to go ahead and use this (the Virgin Cola name) we'd come after him,' said Harbottle &amp; Lewis. Virgin said Mr Branson had said some years ago that he was thinking of going into the soft drinks business. Mr Huning had been told a long time ago that 'Cola wasn't about an idea  - it was an obvious idea. It was about a formula, and we needed someone to bring us the formula.' Mr Huning, who has subsequently fallen out with two of his fellow directors and seen the collapse of his main trading company, remains undeterred. He may be prevented from launching Virgin Cola in the UK, but says he is poised to launch in the US, and is also pressing ahead in Australia and South Africa. Mr Huning said this was being done with the backing of a consortium of international businessmen. Meanwhile, Virgin is preparing for round two. The company's lawyers said: 'We are going to take all and any necessary action against Mr Huning wherever he sees fit to make these allegations.'</p>

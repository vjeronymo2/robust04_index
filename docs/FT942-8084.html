			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Shadow cabinet splits three ways over leadership: Brown starts his campaign to head Labour with appeal to socialist values The shadow cabinet was last night divided between three candidates for the party's leadership as Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, launched his claim with an appeal to traditional socialist values. Mr Brown, delivering the keynote speech at Labour's annual Welsh conference in Swansea, sought to shore up his standing on the left of the party with a strong appeal to 'enduring' socialist values, and fierce attacks on the City of London, privatisation and means-testing for pensions. Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, will launch his candidacy in a speech tomorrow, as unofficial campaigning accelerates after the burial of Mr John Smith, former leader. Friends of Mr Blair, the party's leading modernist, said he would also seek to increase his appeal to the left with an 'inclusive and radical' campaign platform to combine Labour's traditional values with modern policies. Mr Blair has strong support in the shadow cabinet, but backing is flowing to Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, who is strongly supported on the left of the party. Mr Brown is running third. Mr John Prescott, the traditionalist shadow employment secretary, appears to have no firm shadow cabinet support, although support for him is emerging among trade union leaders. Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, praised Mr Brown and Mr Prescott for their commitment to Labour's policy of full employment. Senior Labour officials say there is no doubt that Mr Prescott will be endorsed by other union leaders if he chooses to stand. Mrs Margaret Beckett, the acting leader, also appears to be without support among her senior colleagues. Mrs Beckett has not decided whether to stand, but is expected to continue as deputy leader. Shadow ministers are refusing to endorse candidates publicly, in accordance with a shadow cabinet ban on campaigning until after the European parliament elections on June 9. However, Mr Blair is believed to have the support of Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, Mrs Ann Taylor (education), Mr Jack Straw (local government), and Ms Mo Mowlam (national heritage), who is expected to act as campaign manager. Mr Brown is thought to be backed by Mr Tom Clarke (development), Mr Donald Dewar (social security) and Mr George Robertson (Scotland). However, Mr Dewar and Mr Robertson would back Mr Blair if Mr Brown stood aside. Mr David Clark (defence) is said to be undecided between Mr Blair and Mr Brown. Mr Cook is believed to have the support of Mr Frank Dobson (transport), Ms Joan Lestor (children) and Mr Michael Meacher (open government). Mr David Blunkett (health) and Mr Chris Smith (environmental protection) are said to be undecided between Mr Cook and Mr Blair. Mr Ron Davies (Wales) is also thought to favour Mr Cook. The level of support for Mr Cook is likely to hamper efforts by Mr Blair's camp to persuade him to withdraw from the race and offer his support to the shadow home secretary. Mr Cook has not decided whether to accept a formal nomination for the leadership, but he is under strong pressure not to withdraw. Labour's ruling national executive committee will decide on Wednesday to ignore leftwing calls for an autumn election and accept formal nominations for a four or five-week cam-paign starting immediately after the June European elections. Senior shadow ministers say there is a growing belief that at least three candidates will stand, forcing the party to use a preferential voting system for the first time in a leadership election.

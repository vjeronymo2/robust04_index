			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Fiasco of Sundays may have had its chips / Review of the shop-hours options open to MPs The Sunday trading bill was supposed to be one of the most contentious pieces of legislation to come before the Commons in the current session. Tempers were expected to run so high that the government, bruised by a successful backbench revolt on the issue in 1986, allowed a free vote. It has not happened. The bill passed its second reading by a huge majority after a polite debate last week and has almost disappeared from view, buried by controversy over the Budget and the Ulster peace talks. That may change today when MPs debate the core of the bill - three options put forward by retailing and religious pressure groups to reform the widely ignored 1950 Shops Act. The options are: Complete de-regulation, bringing England and Wales into line with Scotland, favoured by the Conservative right and backed by the prime minister, the home secretary and a majority of the cabinet. Unrestricted trading for small shops, with a six-hour limit on larger stores. This was drafted by the Shopping Hours Reform Council, which represents big chains such as Tesco that already open on Sundays, in defiance of the law. Unregulated opening for most small shops, DIY stores and garden centres, and unregulated opening for four Sundays before Christmas. This is backed by the Keep Sunday Special (KSS) campaign, an alliance of small retailers and sabbatarians, and some big stores, including Marks and Spencer and John Lewis. There is broad agreement that the 1950 act is well past its sell-by date. For example, fish and chips may be sold at a take-away outlet other than a fish and chip shop, while fish and chip shops can sell any takeaway food other than fish and chips. But there is no consensus on which option, if any, will win. The least likely outcome is de-regulation, which is opposed by a big majority on the opposition benches. It would have to attract the votes of virtually all Conservative MPs to succeed. That is unlikely because of the strength of support among traditionalist Conservatives for the KSS option. The KSS group is worried, however, by the defection of Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, once a strong supporter but now backing the six-hours option. The union's decision has split its 12 sponsored Labour MPs, some of whom will stand by KSS. But many Labour MPs are likely to follow the union into the six-hour lobby, which also has the support of the TGWU, the other union representing shopworkers. Both sides claim the support of a majority of MPs. But the first option to attract a majority of votes cast will win, which means that the decision might hinge on the order in which the speaker calls the options. The provisional order - de-regulation, KSS, six-hours - appears to favour the last option, if only because MPs are likely to want to resolve the issue if the other two options have been defeated. Further complicating the issue, Sir Peter Emery, a Conservative backbencher, has tabled a series of amendments which would prevent trading on Sunday mornings. The government says it is neutral on this approach. It is possible that no option will win a majority. If that happens the government will probably bring the least unpopular option back to the Commons after giving MPs a few weeks to mull over the chaos they will have caused. But it is a scenario which gives ministers nightmares.</p>

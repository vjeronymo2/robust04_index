			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (5): Strains start to show - Pensions reform For French financial markets, there are few issues more important over the next few decades, or more sensitive, than the future of the country's pensions system. The burden of an ageing population is placing a strain on the present pay-as-you-go system, whereby the pensions of today's retirees are paid by contributions from the active workforce. Reform of the system, and the possible creation of capitalised pension funds, promise a significant boost to the French stock market, the venture capital industry and to long-term savings. The implications are profound, ranging from improved financing for industry, to the reshaping of France's brand of capitalism. The problem is that reform also promises a welter of complications, from opposition from trade union groups to disputes between banks and insurance companies about how new schemes should be structured, and to the government's concern not to stifle consumption. As a result, the centre-right administration is treading cautiously on the issue. Legislation on the pension fund reform, due originally in the first half of this year, and then this autumn, now appears unlikely before next spring's presidential elections. The needs of France's social security system, however, and of its financial markets, suggest that some steps will have to be taken. 'At the end of the day we need capitalised pension products to help strengthen our financial system and to respond to demographic pressures,' says Mr Alain Leclair, deputy president of asset management at Banque Paribas. The demographic pressures are clear. France's ageing population means that the proportion of over-60s will increase from about 20 per cent of the population today to about 27 per cent in 2020 and one-third in 2050. 'This may seem like a long-term problem, but the younger generation are already finding it hard to finance the retirement of the older,' says an executive at one French insurance company. The strains have prompted a series of reforms to the existing system. Mrs Simone Veil, the minister for social affairs, has eased the burden on the pay-as-you-go scheme by extending the period of contributions from 37.5 years to 40 years and increasing the number of best-paid years on which pension payments are calculated, hence reducing the average. Separately, Mr Alain Madelin, the minister for enterprises and economic development, has introduced a reform which provides tax incentives for artisans and independent workers who invest in private pension schemes. The law, passed through parliament in the summer, has recently taken effect. Mrs Veil's measures have already had an impact. 'The deficit under the existing system seemed set to reach about FFr300bn by the year 2020,' says one pensions expert at a French merchant bank. 'It now seems more likely to be in the region of FFr100bn by that date.' It is still, however, a big gap. Proponents of pensions reform argue that the case for the creation of capitalised pension funds is further buttressed by the potential benefits to industry and financial markets. The Patronat employers' federation, for example, is urging the creation of pension funds which can be managed by the companies themselves and used to buttress their balance sheets. Mr Jacques Barrot, chairman of the finance committee in the national assembly and a champion of pensions reform, recommends that banks, insurance companies and individual businesses should get incentives to establish pension funds and that at least half of employee contributions should be invested in their own companies. The French government has itself emphasised the potential benefits of reform. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, has claimed that the development of capitalised pension funds would represent a significant boost for the Paris Bourse. 'As long as important privatisations are in the pipeline, we need funds that have a majority of their holdings in shares,' he said. Some industry observers see the potential for a further important change in French capitalism. By creating powerful pension funds, like those in Britain and the US, French companies would be less dependent on cross-shareholdings with other businesses in their search for stable investors. 'Obviously such a change does not take place overnight,' says one analyst at a securities company in Paris. 'But pension funds could provide the answer to the perennial French problem of capitalism without capital.' The government's willingness to act and the prospects for the various proposals hinge on political considerations. Reform of the pension system is a sensitive subject and with presidential elections less than seven months away, the administration is now demonstrating caution. French trade unions, which are represented in the management of the existing system, oppose reform. 'It is a policy that would benefit the rich. It is they who can afford to pay for a supplementary scheme and get the tax deductions to do so,' says an official at the Confederation Generale du Travial, the communist-led union organisation. Mr Marc Blondel, the general secretary of Force Ouvriere, a more moderate union, advances both social and economic arguments against the formation of capitalised pension funds. 'Reform would end the solidarity between age groups and social classes . . . it would put a brake on economic recovery,' he says, pointing to the dampening effects it might have on consumption. For most observers, the sensitivity of the subject and the potentially complex nature of reforms suggest that reforms must await the presidential polls. 'The idea may appear to have lost some of its urgency,' says one insurance executive. 'But it is a vital issue which cannot be put into retirement.'</p>

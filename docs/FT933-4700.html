			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Taiwan's China negotiator quits TAIWAN'S chief negotiator with China said yesterday he would resign after bitter disputes within the Taiwan government over policy towards Beijing, Reuter reports from Taipei. 'If I cannot make use of my ability under this environment, it will be a waste of my time and have a negative impact on improving relations between the two sides,' said Mr Cheyne Chiu, secretary general of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation. Local media quoted Mr Chiu as saying he would quit at a November meeting of the foundation board, which handles talks with China in the absence of formal diplomatic ties. Mr Chiu handled intensive talks between China and Taiwan in Singapore in April. Taiwan's Securities and Exchange Commission, seeking to slow a flood of investment into China, yesterday formally banned companies from using issues of stock and convertible bonds to fund mainland projects. China's economy is likely to grow at 13 per cent again this year despite measures to prevent overheating, Mr Zhu Rongji, vice-premier and central bank governor, told a meeting of business executives in Bali by video-telephone link, Reuter reports from Nusa Dua, Indonesia. Mr Zhu said growth in 1993 GDP was likely to average 13 per cent, compared with close to 14 per cent for the first six months of the year.</p>

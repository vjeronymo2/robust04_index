			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / International Company News: MIM advances on lead and zinc price increases MIM, the Australian resources group, yesterday reported net profits of ADollars 29m (USDollars 20.9m) after exchange differences and minorities for the three months to September 20, compared with losses of ADollars 3.5m a year earlier. MIM said its net operating profit increased to ADollars 34.5m from ADollars 3.5m, because of higher metal prices and lower operating costs. Sales were up to ADollars 455m from ADollars 408m, in spite of the exclusion of the Newlands-Collinsville coal project in New South Wales. It said copper prices were up 23 per cent in the first quarter of last year, lead was up 12 per cent, and zinc 59 per cent.</p>

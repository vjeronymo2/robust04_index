			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN'S NEXT EXPORT MAY BE ITS ELDERLY, U.S. DEVELOPER SUSPECTS;  </P> <P> AGING: OTHERS, HOWEVER, SCOFF AT THE SUGGESTION THAT THE JAPANESE ARE BUYING  GOLF COURSES HERE AS SITES TO BUILD ASIAN RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES LATER.  </P> <P> Four years ago, Japan's powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry  floated the idea of exporting a new commodity to the United States and other  countries.  </P> <P> But for a change the Japanese found no ready market for the export, which was  not a fancy new television or camcorder or car. Rather, it was Japanese  retirees. Faced with criticism at home and abroad that Japan was advocating the  separation of families and attempting to dump responsibility for its aged onto  other lands, MITI soon deep-sixed the proposal.  </P> <P> At a recent forum here, a San Francisco Bay Area developer suggested that the  idea might be coming back around, given that Japan must soon figure out how to  deal with its rapidly growing pool of elderly.  </P> <P> So what makes him think that retirement communities in the United States might  be in the offing?  </P> <P> "Shrewd Japanese investors . . . are buying golf courses with excess land to  develop housing," said William H. C. Chang, 33, president of Westlake Builders,  a San Mateo, Calif., developer of retirement facilities.  </P> <P> "It would be a relatively easy transformation to convert such land into  retirement villages," said Chang, who was born in Japan of a Japanese mother  and a Chinese father.  </P> <P> Indeed, Japanese interests have snapped up a number of premium golf properties  in the past few years, including the Riviera Country Club &amp; Golf Course in  Pacific Palisades (for $108 million) and Napa County's Silverado Country Club  &amp; Resort.  </P> <P> Ostensibly, the Japanese seem to be taking advantage of their awesome spending  power to pick up prestigious properties, partly to provide an alternative to  Japanese clubs, where million-dollar memberships are common.  </P> <P> But Chang contends that golf, a sport the Japanese love, isn't their only  interest.  </P> <P> His late-afternoon comments roused a roomful of drowsy participants at a recent  Pacific Rim real estate conference sponsored by the law firm of Baker &amp;  McKenzie at San Francisco's Hotel Nikko.  </P> <P> "It sounds like an excellent idea," said John A. Lisanti, president of American  International Golf Resorts in Greenbrae, Calif., a company that puts together  golf course deals for Japanese investors.  </P> <P> To him, maybe. But many other real estate developers -- both Japanese and U.S.  -- contend that Japanese traditions and culture would prevent the idea from  ever getting off the ground.  </P> <P> When the notion was first proposed in 1986 "it got such rave reviews that  somebody almost got his throat slashed," said an executive of a U.S. company  that operates nursing homes and retirement centers.  </P> <P> The idea received a flurry of publicity when it was advanced by a Japanese  government official who had returned from a posting in Spain, where he saw how  far European retirees' money could go. Under the "Silver Columbia Plan," as it  was called, private companies were to develop retirement communities, or  "silver towns," by 1992, the 500th anniversary of Columbus' landing in America.  </P> <P> Besides Spain, countries mentioned as possible sites included the United  States, Mexico, Canada, Brazil, various Asian nations and Australia.  </P> <P> The plan quickly drew criticism from many of those countries, which envisioned  having to provide medical care and other age-related services to hordes of  expatriate Japanese. And in Japan, where the elderly traditionally have been  cared for at home by family members, officials also took heat. MITI abandoned  the effort.  </P> <P> "There was a cultural abhorrence of this," said Barry Robinson, associate  editor of Ageing International magazine in Washington. "It was very  un-Japanese."  </P> <P> Asked about Chang's thesis, however, Robinson noted that, even though the  government-sponsored effort has been shot down, private Japanese developers  might yet consider building such communities overseas.  </P> <P> Clearly, the rapid aging of densely packed Japan cries out for solutions.  Because of a falling birth rate and longer life expectancies, the country is  aging far more quickly than most others.  </P> <P> Revised statistics from the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare indicate a  cloud in the "silver" lining. Whereas a year ago it was estimated that Japan  would have 20 million people over age 65 by the year 2000, the new numbers show  an even higher figure: 21.3 million, or 16.6% of the population, according to  researchers at the East-West Center in Honolulu who analyzed the data.  </P> <P> The elderly population will peak in 2020, when nearly 24% will be part of the  "silver" crowd and Japan will have one of the oldest populations on Earth.  </P> <P> It is customary in Japan for sons and daughters to take in aging parents. But  as more Japanese women enter the work force, the Confucian belief in "filial  piety" is losing ground, observers say. At the same time, land is becoming  scarcer and prohibitively expensive.  </P> <P> And that raises the question: Where will all those elderly live?  </P> <P> Sanford R. Goodkin, a San Diego real estate consultant, figures that it is  inevitable that some will end up in overseas retirement communities.  </P> <P> "The Japanese have been pursuing expertise in this area for eight or nine  years," said Goodkin, executive director of the Peat Marwick Main/Goodkin Real  Estate Consulting Group.  </P> <P> For example, a subsidiary of Nisshin Steel Co. of Japan is investing in a joint  venture with the LeisureCare division of Leisure Technology Inc., a Los  Angeles-based developer of retirement communities, to build 44 retirement  centers in North America over the next 15 years.  </P> <P> However, the Japanese are "a long way off" from building anything overseas  targeted strictly to Japanese elderly, said Jerry Falcon, president of  LeisureCare, based in Northbrook, Ill.  </P> <P> To be sure, many affluent Japanese have been buying winter homes in such sunny  spots as Hawaii, San Diego and Australia's Gold Coast. But many observers see a  massive shift of Japanese old people overseas as highly unlikely.  </P> <P> "Most Japanese are not very comfortable in spending old age in other countries  where they don't understand the language and the culture," said Yukuo Takenaka,  president and chief executive of Takenaka &amp; Co., a Los Angeles investment  banking firm.  </P> <P> Japanese companies, in fact, are involved in joint ventures with U.S. firms to  develop retirement communities on their home turf. They include centers along  waterfronts and in rural areas, to get the elderly away from congested cities.  </P> <P> Another idea under study in Japan is "silver manpower centers," where the  elderly could live and work, said Richard K. C. Lee, a retiree who works part  time as a specialist on aging at the East-West Center's Population Institute.  </P> <P> The Japanese government, meanwhile, is encouraging other governments to grant  extended visa privileges to older Japanese tourists to enable them to stay  overseas a few months at a time, rather than the few days' visits that are now  the norm, according to Kazuo Hoshino, a MITI official.  </P> <P> The plan, he said, would enable Japanese to experience life overseas without  living "abroad for good."  </P> <P> Chang remains convinced that Japanese "silver towns" are a likelihood. By 2000,  he said, technological advances such as supersonic travel will make overseas  retirement feasible.  </P> <P> And golf course purchases, he added, "are just the tip of the iceberg."  </P></p>

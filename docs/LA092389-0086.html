			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRISTIE'S TO AUCTION RARE WINES AT BEL AGE  </P> <P> Wine collectors who have long awaited that odd bottle of 1864 Chateau Lafite  will have a chance to bid on one today at the Bel Age Hotel during the first  commercial wine sale to be conducted on the West Coast by Christie's, the  London auction house.  </P> <P> The bottle, filled four years before the Bordeaux estate was bought by the  Rothschild family, was opened, sampled and recorked at the winery last May,  according to the auction catalogue, and the cellar master "attested to its fine  condition, remarking on its youthful fruit, excellent balance and lack of  browning" -- a common sign of vinous senility.  </P> <P> According to Christie's marketing research, such a bottle would be snapped up  at $5,000 but could fetch $8,000.  </P> <P> Expected to sell for up to $15,000 is an oversize bottle of 1924 Chateau  Mouton-Rothschild -- actually eight regular bottles, or six liters of wine,  corked into a single behemoth of a bottle that the Bordelais call Imperial. The  broad glass front and claret colored background provided a striking and  expansive setting for Jacques Carlu, a noted Paris architect and stage designer  of the day, to mount his specially commissioned label. Combining a stylized  ram's head (mouton meaning sheep), a wine barrel and five arrows representing  the Rothschild brothers, the label was said to have stunned Bordeaux wine  merchants who feared losing marketing control if other vintners sought to  distinguish their estate-bottled products -- which they surely did.  </P> <P> The auction, to be conducted by Michael Broadbent of Christie's in London, will  offer a range of vintages from another famous Bordeaux estate, Chateau Petrus,  including magnums, or double-bottles, from 1945, 1947 and 1961.  </P> <P> A number of older Napa Valley wines are also going on the block, including  Beaulieu Vineyards "private reserve" bottlings from 1951, 1958 and 1968. A wide  range of wines have been drawn from the cellar of who Christie's described as  "a prominent Los Angeles collector." These include 11 vintages of both  Romanee-Conti in Burgundy and Chateau Petrus, not to mention 19 vintages of  Chateau d'Yquem, a straw-colored dessert wine from the Bordeaux village of  Sauternes, including what Christie's called "the legendary" 1921 vintage and a  single bottle of the 1811 -- "probably the most renowned vintage of the 19th  Century, indeed arguably of all time" -- priced at about $20,000.  </P> <P> In all, the auction will include property drawn from more than 30 private  collections, offered in two lots starting at 11 a.m. and at 2:15 p.m. at the  Bel Age in West Hollywood.  </P></p>

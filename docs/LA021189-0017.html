			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INSURER APPEALS POLICY RENEWAL ORDER  </P> <P> The Travelers group of insurance companies Friday asked the California Supreme  Court to overturn an order issued last week by state Insurance Commissioner  Roxani Gillespie requiring it to renew about 22,000 car insurance policies in  California.  </P> <P> Noting that four Travelers subsidiaries are seeking to withdraw from the auto  insurance business in the state, Travelers Executive Vice President Thomas  McAboy said the appeal contends that the company "has a basic constitutional  right to cease doing private passenger automobile business in California,"  regardless of any provisions to the contrary in Proposition 103. During the  appeal, Travelers has said it will renew all policies.  </P></p>

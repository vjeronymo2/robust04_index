			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOWN SEEKING LOST 1939 TIME CAPSULE  </P> <P> City officials hope to open a time capsule, buried nearly 50 years ago, next  October -- if they can find it.  </P> <P> City Manager Jim Luckett Jr. said City Council minutes from 1939 refer to the  capsule as commemorating the construction of City Hall. But the minutes do not  say where the capsule was buried.  </P> <P> Luckett said that either no marker was ever put on the capsule or it was  covered during recent remodeling.  </P></p>

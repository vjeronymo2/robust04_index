			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Spain, Banking and Finance (11): Post-merger difficulties / Profile of Banco Central Hispano BANCO Central Hispano (BCH), the biggest domestic private bank in terms of assets, is unlucky. Banking mergers are always expensive and never easy; when they occur in a recessionary climate they become very difficult. The union between Banco Central and Banco Hispano Americano that brought BCH into being was announced midway through 1991 just as the economy was beginning to slide. Last month, Mr Jose Mara Almusategui, the BCH chairman, gave a very a strong 'I am in charge' message that only served to underline the post-merger difficulties. Analysts note that BCH was the sole domestic banking group to post a drop in its net interest income last year and that its cost-to-income ratio was, at 72.3 per cent, substantially higher that that of other institutions. In its 1992 balance sheet, BCH was forced to put aside Pta67bn for bad debt provisions and a further Pta3.2bn to cover depreciations in its portfolio. Mr Almusategui, former chairman of Hispano Americano, the smaller of the two units, became president of BCH last October, succeeding Mr Alfonso Escamez, the veteran Central chairman who is something of a living legend in the domestic banking sector. Within six months Mr Almusategui had stamped an aggressively personal style on the group. The Almusategui revolution essentially consists in cutting out senior executive levels - the managing director slot has disappeared - and concentrating all reporting on the chairman's office. This applies both to the core banking business and to the network of industrial interests that involve the BCH group. Mr Almusategui toyed with the idea of pooling BCH's industrial interests into a single holding, much as Banesto has done with its Corporacion Banesto. With a background in public sector industrial conglomerates - he has held top jobs in both INI, the state holding company, and in INH, the chief shareholder of the Repsol energy group - Mr Almusategui is a firm believer in corporate umbrellas. In the event he has stopped short of travelling all the way down the Banesto road but he has considerably tightened head office control over the bank's industrial assets. Under his newly imposed system, Mr Almusategui will personally review the budgets and business plans set by each BCH-controlled company and he will likewise pass judgment on how targets have been met. The system must be unsettling for the companies which have grown used to minimum interference from what used to be a mostly hands-off shareholder. 'From now on I have told every chairman of the industrial group that I am on the end of the phone line. It would be an error therefore if they failed to ring me when necessary,' Mr Almusategui said recently. BCH's chairman says that what he is seeking is unified management criteria for the group. He has set in place centralised teams at head office which will shadow the different companies within the BCH group in four specific areas: financial relations with the parent bank; strategic planning; budgets; and market performance. The revolution also involves creating a specific BCH image. Modelling itself on campaigns launched by BBV and Banco Santander, BCH has recently produced a bouncing pink kangaroo that leaps around TV commercials calling on all comers to sign up for a new savings account. The marketing hype is quite foreign to BCH's constituent parts because Banco Central, a familiar institution on every high street corner, never needed to sell itself over much while Hispano Americano, which appealed to a somewhat higher income bracket, was essentially just as relaxed. Mr Almusategui's team feels that the new sales aggression is exactly what the banking group needed. By just flexing its muscles with the kangaroo campaign, BCH claims it has attracted Pta200bn in new customer deposits within a month. BCH believes that it will be back on the road of steady profitability just as soon as it overcomes its merger difficulties. For the time being it must be patient; BBV, which was created in 1988, three years before BCH, only claimed that it was properly back on the profitable path this year. There is little doubt that BCH is tackling the difficulties. In the past 18 months it has reduced the number of its branches from 3,500 to 2,810, shedding some 4,000 jobs in the process, and it has spent Pta6.7bn in a new information system for the network. Mr Almusategui is also anxious to realise as much as possible through disposals. Three regionally-based subsidiary banks have been sold off this year and a fourth subsidiary, Banco de Fomento which has a 165-branch national network, is also up for sale. In March, France's BNP withdrew from negotiations to acquire Fomento, allegedly because of the Pta47.8bn price that BCH had placed on its subsidiary. BCH's chairman claims that for the duration of this decade, the banking group could raise profits of Pta30bn-40bn annually through disposals of the group's varied interests. The estimate is a very reasonable one for BCH has valuable stakes in a broad spectrum of Spanish blue chips. The bank is also the leading shareholder of Cepsa, the petrol refiner and distributor, the construction company Dragados, the property group Vallehermoso and the sugar-based food group Azucarera. Mr Almusategui told an interviewer that he had no intention of selling off such crown jewels unless 'situations of real necessity' were to take place. With a merger process underway at an unfavourable moment, it is more than useful for BCH to have such a safety net.</p>

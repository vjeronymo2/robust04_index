			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Fung Wai-Kong] </F>   [Text] Local people are less confident of China's ability  to handle the territory's change of sovereignty following the  visit by the Director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office, Lu Ping.    According to an Asian Commercial Research survey sponsored  by  the SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST, the number of people who felt less  confident in China handling the transition was almost double  those who felt more confident. A total of 36 per cent said they  felt less confident, while only 19 per cent said they were more  confident. The other 45 per cent had no opinion on the matter.    People cited Mr Lu's behaviour and the failure of Britain  and  China to talk to each other as the major reasons for their drop  in confidence. The poll also revealed that Mr Lu's refusal to  meet Governor Chris Patten tarnished his image among the people  of Hong Kong.    Just over 36 percent of respondents said Mr Lu's actions had  lessened their opinion on him, while only 6.5 percent said the  visit had improved their perception of Mr Lu. About half the  respondents said the visit had not changed their opinion on him.    In response to whether Mr Lu's highly publicised visit would  undermine the Governor's authority in the territory, 53 percent  of respondents said it had no effect, while 27 percent agreed  that it had. Six percent said the Governor had gained in  authority as a result of the visit. The poll also suggested  that the majority of people wanted to see Mr Lu and Mr Patten  meet again. About 35 percent said they were eager to tell Mr Lu  to keep the freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people and not to  infringe upon them.    The survey was conducted between May 4 and 7 and a total of  400 Cantonese speaking people aged 18 to 64 years were  interviewed by telephone.    Meanwhile, in a forum, major political party leaders said  they thought Mr Lu's visit to Hong Kong had not been  satisfactory. The vice-chairman of the United Democrats, Albert  Ho Chun-yan, said Mr Lu had been acting against the public's  wishes rather than the other way round. The Liberal Party said  it regretted the fact that Mr Lu was not able to meet the  Governor during his visit. But vice- chairman of the pro-China  Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, Tam  Yiu-chung, said Mr Lu had met people from a wide spectrum of  society during his visit, and this would certainly help him to  understand better the wishes of Hong Kong people.    Mr Lu yesterday met about 300 workers from pro-China unions  at the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions headquarters. He  told them Hong Kong should not be used as a political base to  change the socialist system in China. After the meeting,  federation chairman Cheng Yiu-tong quoted Mr Lu as saying some  people in Hong Kong had distorted his remarks that Hong Kong  should not become a political city. Mr Cheng said Mr Lu told  the workers that what he meant was that the territory should not  become a base to convert China from socialism. He also quoted  Mr Lu as saying that the recent report by the Foreign Affairs  Select Committee of the House of Commons had made him realise  Britain had changed its policy towards China. "Some people" in  Britain believed that it was an "obsolete" approach for Hong  Kong to maintain its co-operative relationship with China.    Mr Lu leaves Hong Kong today.</p>

Speaking to reporters after he  met with Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina in Jakarta  today, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said Indonesia has firmly  adopted such a stand as the basis of its international  relations, adding that Indonesia also believes that a country  should not impose its will on another country, especially by  imposing a blockade.    Speaking to reporters, Cuban Foreign Minister Robaina said  his visit to Indonesia is part of his tour of seven Asian  countries in his country's efforts to oppose the economic  blockade imposed by the United States for the last 30 years.</p>

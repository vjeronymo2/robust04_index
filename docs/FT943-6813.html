			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / International Company News: Matsushita Electric up to Y8.9bn Matsushita Electric Industrial, the leading Japanese electronics group, achieved a one-third increase in worldwide net profits to Y8.9bn (Dollars 90.4m) in its first quarter to June. The company, which makes consumer products under brands such as Panasonic and Technics and owns Universal Pictures in Hollywood, said the increase, from last year's Y6.7bn, followed cost cuts which offset the adverse effect of the higher yen. It was also helped by a 3 per cent growth in revenues to Y1,642.2bn. Sales abroad were up 9 per cent but domestic sales fell 3 per cent, although the company said it discerned a better trend in consumer spending within Japan. Domestic sales of both audio and video equipment suffered from what Matsushita acknowledged was a 'shift of consumer demand to lower-priced products'. Overall, communications and industrial equipment showed the best growth, at 14 per cent, with what the company said were notable gains in hard disk drives and CD-Rom drives. The electronic components side was up 3 per cent while home appliances fell by the same margin. A 2 per cent dip in income from its entertainment division came as the strength of the yen eroded dollar revenues at Universal, which was raking in box-office proceeds from the film Schindler's List. The music division also performed well, Matsushita said. Consolidated pre-tax profits were Y37.6bn, up 12 per cent. Net earnings per share were Y4.23 against Y3.20.</p>

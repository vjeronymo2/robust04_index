			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Arts: Calling on corporates - Sponsorship Arts sponsorship was one of the rare beneficiaries from Tuesday's Budget. The heritage minister, Peter Brooke, found another Pounds 300,000 to add to the Pounds 4.5m he gives each year to fund the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme, which provides matching government grants to imaginative corporate sponsors. The BSIS is a perfect example of government arts policy, which is designed to reward those arts organisations which are successful at helping themselves by attracting new sources of revenue. Since 1984 the government has invested Pounds 23.7m in the BSIS but this has produced Pounds 48.3m in new sponsorship for the arts. The extra cash reflects government concern at this year's faltering corporate sponsorship. Last month the annual survey by the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts revealed a 13 per cent fall to Pounds 57.7m. With Arts Council and local authority funding of the arts certain to fall in 1994 the government needs business sponsors to keep the theatres working, the orchestras playing, and the art galleries open - so much for sponsorship being icing on the cake. ABSA is likely to use some of the additional cash to open another regional office, in Birmingham or Exeter. Its office in Halifax has contributed greatly to the massive expansion in arts sponsorship in the north of England. Two great preoccupations of the sponsorship world at the moment are media recognition and event evaluation. In these hard times companies need to know that the money they invest in the arts brings them tangible returns. Shareholders and employees are suspicious of sponsorships that provide little but the warm glow of disinterested patronage. So there will be many expectant faces at the Royal National Theatre on Thursday when the Princess of Wales announces the ABSA/Arthur Andersen Awards for the companies that have made the most imaginative use of arts sponsorship in the past year. It is the one occasion at which captains of industry mingle happily with an abundance of arts worthies. For the winners this is the event that justifies expenditure. Flicking through the nominations there are two noticeable developments - a larger presence by northern based companies; and more small, lesser known sponsors. On the short list is first-time sponsor Boddingtons, the Manchester-based brewer which backs the Manchester Festival of Arts &amp; Television. It is up against the Halifax Building Society, sponsor of Eureka], the childrens' museum in Halifax, and Mersey Docks &amp; Harbour, which supports Merseyside Museums. The only outsider is equally exotic - Generale des Eaux, the French sponsor of the Croydon-based London Mozart Players. The best corporate programme category also has a northern bias, setting English Estates (best known for its RSC support) against Manchester Airport (a major backer of the Halle orchestra and the Royal Exchange Theatre) and the Royal Bank of Scotland. The lone London-based candidate is Lloyds Bank, which with its Fashion, Theatre and Film Challenges for young people, as well as the Young Musician of the Year, is investing Pounds 2m in the arts next year and rivalling BT as the UK's biggest arts sponsor. Among the more intriguing contests is that for sponsorship by a small business. Here a Chinese restaurant, Kar Ling Kwong of Leatherhead, which backs the local Redgrave Theatre, is up against Forward Publishing, publishers of poetry and nominated by Book Trust, and Robert Golden Pictures, which makes commercials and which has aided Opera Circus, neighbours in London's Doughty Mews. The awards could be one of the last official appearances by the Princess of Wales at an arts occasion, following her decision to relinquish public support for many charities. Many arts companies, like the Welsh National Opera, English National Ballet and London City Ballet, will lose a very important sponsorship attraction as a result. With companies reluctant these days to invest in big block-buster sponsorships the Tate, like many arts organisations, is attempting to increase its corporate members.  It has Pounds 25,000 a year for private access to the Tate's galleries.  Double this number and the Tate could be almost Pounds 500,000 more financially secure.</p>

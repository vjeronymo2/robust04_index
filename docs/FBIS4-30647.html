			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Jakarta, Jun 28 (OANA-ANTARA) -- President  Suharto and visiting Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating  agreed here Tuesday to work together to reduce Indonesia's trade  deficit with Australia.    Both leaders shared the view that bilateral trade ties  between the two countries need to be intensified to cut the  deficit, Minister/State Secretary Murdiono said when announcing  the results of a two-hour talk between President Suharto and  Prime Minister Paul Keating.    Two-way trade between Australia and Indonesia is worth US  $2.15 billion a year.    In the meeting, which lasted 30 minutes longer than  scheduled, the two heads of state also discussed the upcoming  informal summit of APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) to  be held in Bogor, about 50 km south of Jakarta, on 15 November  this year.    The second APEC meeting will be attended by representatives  from 18 countries, namely the ASEAN member states (Indonesia,  Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and  Thailand), the United States, New Zealand, Mexico, Papua New  Guinea, Chile, Australia, China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Canada,  Taiwan and Japan. Prime Minister Keating expressed his readiness  to help Indonesia make the APEC meeting a success, Minister  Murdiono said. [passage omitted -- covered in referent item]    Minister Murdiono also confirmed that President Suharto  explained about the recent revocation of the licences of TEMPO  weekly magazine, EDITOR magazine and DETIK tabloid to his guest.    Keating arrived here on Monday for a three-day visit to hold  talks with President Suharto and other Indonesian officials. He  is also scheduled to open a major Australian trade exhibition on  Wednesday.    The trade exhibition is a part of "Australia Today Indonesia  '94", the largest trade and cultural promotion program Australia  has ever undertaken in the region. It is scheduled to last  until 3 July 1994. This is the third visit Keating has made to  Indonesia since he became prime minister.</p>

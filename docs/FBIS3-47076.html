The move comes shortly after a high-ranking MITI bureaucrat  resigned following the trade minister's intervention in such a  case.    Vice Minister Hideaki Kumano said at a press conference that  the ministry will exercise impartiality in personnel changes  even for officials intending to enter politics.    "We will strictly refrain from creating a new post for an  official who plans to quit for elections, for example, so as not  to cause suspicion of any special consideration on the  assumption of transfer to the political world."    Late last December, Masahisa Naito resigned as director  general of the ministry's Industrial Policy Bureau following  conflict with MITI Minister hiroshi kumagai.    The minister had urged Naito to resign, saying he had shown  favoritism in promoting a junior when Naito was director general  at the minister's Secretariat.    Naito contended at his last press conference that he could  not understand nor accept Kumagai's reasons for demanding his  resignation, saying, "the promotion in question followed MITI's  conventional practice."    Such promotions are regarded as boosting the curricula vitae  of prospective political candidates.</p>

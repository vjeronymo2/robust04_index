			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Letter: Not enough shrinkage Sir, You appear to have overdone it. A real, current (Florence Nightingale) Pounds 10 note overlaid on your article 'The shrinking Pounds 10 note' (January 31) is about 4mm smaller in both dimensions. Given your footnote, perhaps you were indulging in proportional representation? Jonathan S Haw, 35 Basinghall Street, London EC2V 5DB</p>

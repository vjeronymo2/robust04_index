Alliance chairman, Guy Lam, told Eastern Express yesterday that  ACE, which will be officially launched today, would make written  submissions to the Chinese and Hong Kong governments on the  issue within the next few weeks. The party will initially seek  support from returning migrants, although Lam said ACE would aim  for a wider band of supporters in the runup to next year's  Legislative Council elections.    Lam, 39, a solicitor who holds a Canadian passport, said the  issue of right of abode after 1997 for an estimated 500,000  foreign passport holders -- many of whom are Hong Kong born  Chinese--would be a priority for ACE. His comments came as the  Secretary for Security, Alistair Asprey, told the Legislative  Council yesterday that the Government had yet to reach an  agreement with China on the alignment of the Immigration  Ordinance with the Basic Law, including the provision of right  of abode for foreign residents.    In a written reply to a question from Leong Che-hung, Asprey  said the Government would publish a guide as soon as an  agreement was reached on the right of abode in the Hong Kong  Special Administrative Region. Lam said the Basic Law, which  regards all foreign passport holders as non-Chinese citizens,  was "vague" and "open to interpretation" on the issue of right  of abode. "We shall be making ourselves known to both  governments after our launch," he said.    "We need something that is much more elaborate than what  exists. We are working towards a proposal or some kind of  formula to be presented to the Chinese government that will be  fair and open to the people of Hong Kong.    "It will be very comprehensive and detailed and something  more than just brief comments by Chinese officials."    Lam said a legally binding agreement could be necessary to  ensure that right of abode was granted fairly. "We want it to  be a legally binding agreement but if not, it should be  formulated in such a way that would clearly ensure foreign  passport holders after 1997 can retain right of abode," he said.    He said ACE, which has an initial membership of 20 local and  expatriate businessmen and professionals, would also closely  follow the localisation of the Civil Service and the issue of  allowing legislative councillors to hold foreign citizenship  after 1997. "Ours is a pragmatic approach although some may call  it conservative -- a word I don't like to use. One of our  priorities is the continued economic prosperity and stability in  Hong Kong," Lam said. "We don't want to rock the boat, and,  therefore the sensible person, whether he or she holds a foreign  passport or not, who agrees with our stance will support us.    "I think the sensible person will agree that Hong Kong's  success is built to some extent on foreign expertise, and that  foreign expertise is brought to Hong Kong by returning migrants  and expatriates."    ACE, which began preparing for its launch just over a year  ago, will field several candidates, including Lam, in direct  elections and in functional constituencies in next year's  elections. "We will be targeting returning migrants but we will  limit our activity to Hong Kong. We won't be trying to expand  ourselves overseas," Lam said. "The best way to become known is  through our performance."</p>

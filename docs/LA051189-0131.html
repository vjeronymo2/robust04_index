			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL APPROVES GENERAL PLAN  </P> <P> The Hawthorne City Council voted 4 to 0 Monday to give final approval to an  updated General Plan that calls for commercial development near the I-105  freeway. The area, the Imperial Highway Corridor, contains a mix of residential  and commercial uses.  </P> <P> The General Plan is a document that will be used to govern all future zoning  for the city.  </P> <P> In anticipation of the completion of the freeway in 1993, several developers  have already expressed an interest in commercial projects there. The city could  begin the redevelopment process in the area as soon as next year, according to  Bud Cormier, assistant redevelopment director.  </P> <P> At hearings on the updated plan, residents expressed concern that if  development did not occur for several years, their properties would be left in  limbo until the city had a development proposal in hand.  </P> <P> But the council, in a 4-0 vote giving initial approval April 24, said that  because development is imminent, residents are likely to benefit financially  from an increase in property values in the area. City consultants and others  said that, in general, commercial property is more valuable than residential  because it can be more intensely developed.  </P></p>

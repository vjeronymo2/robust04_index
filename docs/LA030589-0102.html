			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Anti-abortion demonstrators were hauled away by the busload from coordinated  protests at women's medical clinics in three New England states. Arrests  totaled more than 300, including two members of pro-choice groups that staged  counter-rallies. Four busloads of demonstrators in Brookline, Mass., were  booked on disorderly conduct charges. Other protests took place at abortion  advocate Bill Baird's clinic in Boston; a Danbury, Conn., clinic, and at the  Providence headquarters of Rhode Island Planned Parenthood. The simultaneous  protests began at 7:45 a.m. at three Brookline clinics along a three-mile  stretch of Beacon Street. "What we want to do is witness the life and so gum up  the works (that) no longer is it possible to kill unborn children, so the legal  system simply can't deal with the closing of the clinics. They can't arrest  everybody," said Father David Mullen of St. Paul's Roman Catholic Church in  Wellesley, a protest organizer.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["What Is `Special Alert Order' Aimed At?" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- The South Korean  authorities issued "a special alert order" and "an emergency  alert order" to the "army and police" across South Korea for the  period from May 31 to June 7 with the traitor Kim Yong-sam  setting out on a foreign trip.    A MINJU CHOSON analyst today says this is an unpardonable  treacherous act to intentionally strain the situation on the  Korean peninsula, incite North-South confrontation and step up  their moves for a war against the North.    The news analyst goes on:    The puppets describe the "special alert order" as something  to cope with the North's moves, saying its "moves" must be  watched, making quite a noise as if any ominous event would  break out during the traitor Kim Yong-sam's foreign tour.    This, however, is nothing more than a sophism designed to  cover up their true color as the very one who is aggravating the  situation on the Korean peninsula and racing headlong along the  road of confrontation and war.    At present, the puppets are staging almost every day  warexercises against the North including Military Demarcation  Line (MDL) breakthrough operation exercises in areas near the  MDL and ceaselessly committing provocations in the area along  the MDL, at a time when the United States has deployed Patriot  missiles and attack helicopters in South Korea and massed huge  aggression forces in and around it.    The "special alert order" issued by the puppets against the  North with the traitor Kim Yong-sam's foreign tour as an  occasion is aimed at making the provocation of a war against the  North a fait accompli and step up preparations for it according  to a war policy of the U.S. imperialists.    It is a unanimous judgement of people at home and abroad  that  those who are lost to reason, driven to a tight corner, may take  the road of unleashing a war against the North any moment.    That, however, can never be a way out for the puppets, and  it  will only precipitate their own destruction.</p>

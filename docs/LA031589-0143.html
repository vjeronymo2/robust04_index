			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEWSOME TO PLAY FOR BROWNS AGAIN  </P> <P> Ozzie Newsome, the NFL's all-time reception leader among tight ends, said today  that he will return for one more season with the Cleveland Browns. Newsome, who  has been the subject of retirement speculation for several years, said he had  decided to leave the game after last season but changed his mind after an  overhaul of the Browns' coaching staff.  </P> <P> Coach Marty Schottenheimer quit the Browns at the end of the season over  philosophical differences with owner Art Modell, and most of Schottenheimer's  assistants also left. Newsome decided to wait until a new head coach, Bud  Carson, was chosen, and the veteran tight end then had a long talk with Marc  Trestman, Cleveland's quarterback coach last season, who has been elevated to  offensive coordinator.  </P> <P> During his career, Newsome has had 610 receptions for 7,416 yards and 44  touchdowns. He hasn't fumbled in his last 505 receptions and has caught at  least 30 passes in each of his 11 seasons. Newsome, who celebrates his 33rd  birthday Thursday, had 35 catches for 343 yards last season and extended his  consecutive game reception streak to 143 games.  </P></p>

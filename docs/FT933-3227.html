			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Lib Dems switch to resources tax A STRUCTURAL switch from taxing people to taxing resources was proposed yesterday by the Liberal Democrats in a document intended to address the challenges of the next decade. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said that a shift towards taxing pollution and the use of raw materials would help the UK economy to be more efficient and to compete in the world econ-omy. The party's advocacy of the European Community's plans for a carbon tax will be seized on by the Tories, given the Liberal Democrats' high-profile campaign against the government's imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel. Senior party figures, however, believe that the approach has the advantage of helping to broaden the debate beyond the sole question of whether the party favours high or low taxation. The plans will be advanced today when the party publishes its detailed proposals for environmental tax reform. Yesterday's framework paper, Facing up to the Future, will be debated by the party's conference next week. Its precursor was savaged by representatives at last year's conference for being too rightwing. The current version is noticeably different in tone. One example is its discussion of employment in terms of the redistribution of jobs as well as their creation. Mr Ashdown was at pains to emphasise, however, that the party still differed from Labour in, for example, its commitment to promoting competition. The party has also altered its tone on the EC, introducing a more explicit note of criticism into the document. The paper takes account of the mood of Euro-scepticism in the UK since the debate on the Maastricht treaty, acknowledging that EC member states will want to move forward at different speeds and that the Community must be 'relevant to ordinary people'. The Liberal Democrats' image as the most pro-European of the main parties has been seen by their opponents as a likely obstacle to their picking up a protest vote against the Tories in next June's Euro-elections.</p>

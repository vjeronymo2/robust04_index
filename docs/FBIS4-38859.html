			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>   [Text] Sevastopol June 2 TASS -- "A team of naval experts  is now gauging the strength of the Black Sea navy, especially  its warships. They are trying to determine the necessary  parameters for the division of the fleet, including the classes  of vessels and their technical conditions," Commander-in-Chief  of the Russian Navy Admiral Felix Gromov told ITAR-TASS. He  noted that this was not a meeting of two delegations, but the  work of experts. It is not running very smoothly, because it is  necessary to study every vessel.    Touching on his meeting with Commander-in-Chief of the  Ukrainian Navy Admiral Vladimir Beskorovaynyy, Gromov said that  the sides had some uncoinciding points of view and that  everything should be done to achieve mutual understanding.    Dwelling on the anxiety of servicemen, members of their  families, workers and employees of the naval garrisons  concerning their future in connection with the fleet's division,  Gromov noted that all the necessary documents were now being  discussed and studied. "If a decision is made today on this or  that question, this will not mean that everything will be  carried out tomorrow," he stated. The admiral believes that the  process will continue for quite a time and its main task will be  to avoid harming people and the navy as a whole.    Asked by ITAR-TASS to comment on the situation in the  Pacific  Fleet after the dismissal of its commander Georgiy Gurinov,  Gromov replied: "A very grave accident had occurred on the  Pacific Fleet and nobody could expect it to be left unnoticed or  without corresponding serious decisions. A commander bears full  responsibility for the situation in his fleet."</p>

			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HEALTH;  </P> <P> STUDY FINDS DOUBLING OF OZONE  </P> <P> The concentration of harmful ozone pollution in the lower atmosphere has more  than doubled in the last 100 years, and it will probably rise at an even faster  rate in the next 30 years, researchers said today.  </P> <P> Researchers from Britain's Harwell Laboratory said recent measurements of  ground-level ozone indicate that levels of the gas are, on the average, twice  as high as those recorded by French researchers in Paris in the late 1800s.  </P> <P> When it is in the upper atmosphere, ozone shields Earth from the sun's  ultraviolet rays, which can cause skin cancer and other health problems. But  when found near ground level, the highly corrosive form of oxygen can cause  respiratory distress.  </P> <P> Ozone is not emitted directly into the air but is formed through complex  reactions with nitrogen oxide and other chemicals found in automobile and  industrial emissions containing nitrogen oxide.  </P></p>

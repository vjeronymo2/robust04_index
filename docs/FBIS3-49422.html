			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ivan G. Ivanov: "Hasten Cleverly, but Not </F> Slowly"]    [Text] The Ministry of Industry has made a request to  dismantle and sell 200 enterprises that have accumulated 10.89  percent of the total uncollectable debts in the industrial  sector. The tripartite commission is insisting on closing down  firms that have leased out more than half their property in the  present financial impasse.    For years on end, our politicians and rulers have watched  with mixed feelings while the state economy sinks into a sea of  problems. They hastened slowly, and did absolutely nothing.  Finally, unemployment has gone through the ceiling, reaching  21.4 percent, not including those on unpaid leave. In the state  industry alone, bad debts have reached monstrous dimensions --  almost 13 percent of the GDP of 501 billion leva that the  government is budgeting for this year.    Only now have they got busy, because a market economy cannot  be made without a market, and the simplest definition of a  "market" is a place where someone sells something and someone  else buys it. In Bulgaria this second "someone" is looking  around a great deal, but buying little. His cash funds are  mainly dependent on the state sector. However, because no one  is buying anything, everyone is making losses without exception.    The general flurry of activity is giving rise to chaos. At  the end of 1993, parliament failed to realize how many laws were  needed before the bad debt problem can be settled. Now at  last, they are proposing extremely painful and now unavoidable  "surgical" measures that will be very difficult to implement.  The country lacks coordination, a legislative base, and budget  funds.    Cannot the authorities and the politicians hasten  intelligently?</p>

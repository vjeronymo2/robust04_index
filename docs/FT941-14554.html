			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Grip of Siberian Express A weather front meteorologists were calling the 'Siberian Express' gripped the upper Midwest for the sixth consecutive day yesterday, with extreme cold closing businesses and schools and snarling airline traffic, reports Laurie Morse from Chicago. At Chicago's O'Hare airport, the busiest in the US, many flights have been cancelled since Monday. Snow was still hampering attempts to normalise services. The spell is breaking records. Temperatures in Chicago have not reached above zero for a week, with the mercury dipping to 21 degrees below zero yesterday. In northern regions of the midwest, temperatures fell as low as 60 degrees below zero.</p>

			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AOUN, SET TO TALK, CALLS FOR END TO WAR;  </P> <P> LEBANON: HE MAKES A CONCILIATORY MOVE TO MUSLIM LEADERS AND A CHRISTIAN FOE. HE  DROPS OPPOSITION TO ACCORD.  </P> <P> Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun appealed Friday for an end to Lebanon's 15-year-old civil  war, making a conciliatory move to Muslim leaders and a Christian warlord he  has tried to crush in more than a month of battles.  </P> <P> Aoun also dropped his outright opposition to the peace accord and power-sharing  agreement worked out by Lebanon's Parliament in October.  </P> <P> Police said a week-old cease-fire between Aoun's 19,000 troops and the  6,000-member Lebanese Forces militia of Samir Geagea was holding despite minor  exchanges of sniper fire.  </P> <P> At least 750 people have been killed and 2,089 wounded during the inconclusive  showdown for control of the 310-square-mile Christian enclave.  </P> <P> In another development, police said rival Shiite Muslim militias loyal to Syria  and Iran clashed in South Beirut and southern Lebanon, but there were no  reports of casualties.  </P> <P> The Shiite clashes came two days after a Beirut firefight between the two  groups that left two people dead and three wounded.  </P> <P> The two factions have been fighting sporadically for more than two years for  dominance among Shiites, the nation's largest sect.  </P> <P> The war between the two Shiite militias has left 1,030 people dead and 3,046  wounded.  </P> <P> Aoun, in an unusually conciliatory statement to the newspaper An Nahar, said  there will be no more clashes among Christians or between Christians and  Muslims.  </P> <P> Aoun told the newspaper he wants "dialogue with everyone" to find a settlement.  He stressed that there will be peace in the Christian enclave as well as along  the areas separating Christian territory from the Muslim sectors.  </P> <P> The general also dropped his rejection of an Arab League peace plan brokered  last year in the Saudi Arabian city of Taif.  </P> <P> "Abrogating the Taif accord is not necessary to launch a dialogue," Aoun said.  </P> <P> He did call, however, for unspecified amendments to the plan.  </P> <P> Aoun originally rejected the accord because it did not include a timetable for  the withdrawal of Syria's 40,000 troops.  </P> <P> Aoun described the inconclusive intra-Christian showdown as "self-destructive"  and called on Geagea to declare his "readiness for dialogue so we can meet."  </P> <P> "Once two people manage to meet, they can invite others," Aoun said.  </P></p>

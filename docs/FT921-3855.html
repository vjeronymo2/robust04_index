			<p>920312 FT  12 MAR 92 / International Company News: Agency lifts credit watch MOODY'S Investors Services, the US credit agency, has taken the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank off its 'credit watch' list and confirmed its Prime-1 rating for short-term deposits and commercial paper, writes Simon Holberton in Hong Kong. Mr John Gray, the bank's deputy chairman, said: 'We're happy about' the reinstatement. He said the bank had found it difficult to understand why it had been placed on credit watch. Moody's said the confirmation rested on a balance of positive and negative factors. Although a number of Hongkong Bank's affiliates remained problematic 'their performance appears to have . . . begun to turn around,' the agency added. The confirmation of ratings covers the bank's Canadian and US subsidiaries and Concord Leasing. In aggregate, the bank's short-term debt is valued at about USDollars 1.5bn. It has no long-term debt.</p>

			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / People: Doug Ritchie Doug Ritchie, who as chairman and chief executive of British Alcan Aluminium was responsible for most of the UK's aluminium production, has died of cancer in Montreal at the age of 52. Four years after Alcan of Canada bought British Aluminium for Pounds 30m in 1982 and merged it with its own UK operations, Ritchie was appointed chief executive with the task of turning what had been two domestic companies into one internationally competitive group. He presided over a Pounds 300m investment and rationalisation programme which saw substantial cuts in capacity; the workforce was nearly halved but there were consequent huge productivity gains. Ritchie was born in Ontario and attended McGill University where he was awarded a BSc and an MBA. He joined Alcan in 1966 as a sales supervisor in Toronto. He filled a variety of posts before emerging in 1985 as vice president of Alcan's primary and secondary metals group - giving him responsibility for all the group's North American aluminium smelting and sales activities. In 1991 he became chairman of British Alcan as well as chief executive. At that time a reorganisation of Alcan's European operations put him in charge of all primary and secondary aluminium operations in Europe except for those related to rolled products. He leaves a wife, Cydney, and three grown-up sons.</p>

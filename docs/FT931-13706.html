			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith rounds on PM over rise in jobless THE PRIME MINISTER came under fierce and sustained opposition attack in the Commons yesterday as Mr John Smith used the steep increase in monthly unemployment figures to pour scorn on the government's economic and employment policies. In a cogent and sure-footed assault, the Labour leader branded the figures 'horrendous' and accused Mr Major of blighting the lives of millions with economic policies that had 'failed the nation'. His onslaught came as a new cabinet sub-committee, charged with reviewing how existing measures to tackle unemployment might be improved, met for the first time under the chairmanship of Lord Wakeham, leader of the Lords. The ad hoc group - set up in a clear attempt to deflect mounting criticism - also includes Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury. Ministers from outside the cabinet, not yet named, will include representatives from the education, environment and social services departments. A senior Downing street official said that the main focus of the committee would centre on maximising the impact of existing policies rather than devising new ones. 'It will look right across the government at the employment consequences of all the policies currently being pursued,' he said. But Downing Street did not rule out consideration of new measures like Workfare, which would oblige people to work in return for benefit. Current controversial political issues with implications for employment  - such as the coal mines and the naval dockyards - will not, however, be part of the committee's remit. Acknowledging yesterday's figures were 'deeply disappointing', Mr Major attempted to defuse Mr Smith's offensive by steering the subject onto broader economic issues and denouncing Labour's empty rhetoric. 'Neither you nor your colleagues have set out a coherent policy for dealing with unemployment,' he told the Labour leader. Labour's policies would 'deliberately drive up unemployment and not create the conditions for lasting employment.' It was 'this government that has had the courage to stick to policies to get inflation down.' But bidding to press home his advantage, Mr Smith used a selection of past remarks attributed to the prime minister and his colleagues to cast doubt on the sincerity of yesterday's expressions of concern. 'Aren't you the person who told us 'If it isn't hurting, it isn't working?'', he asked. 'Weren't you the prime minister whose first reaction when the pit closures were announced was that they had to be closed 'cleanly and quickly' and whose chancellor believes unemployment is a 'price worth paying?'' 'How can we possibly believe that your expressions of concern are genuine when we take all these factors into account?' Mr Smith continued. 'When at last are you going to give the attack on unemployment the priority which the nation demands?'</p>

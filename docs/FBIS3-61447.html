Chinchaladze, Public  Health and Hygiene Institute imeni G.M. Natadze at the Social  Security Ministry of Georgia, Tbilisi; UDC 614.7(479.22)]    [Abstract] The issue of public health is considered against  the background of environmental pollution and environmental  protection, and the increasing role of medical and biological  research for preventing unfavorable consequence of industrial  pollution is stressed. It is noted that the level of industrial  discharges doubles every 8-10 years while 18-20% of all  public  health expenditures are related to diseases caused by  contaminated atmospheric air alone. Due to the concern about the  long-term effect of toxic agent inhalation, the environmental  factors are examined in a number of Georgian towns and cities,  e.g., Tbilisi, Batumi, Zestafoni, Rustavi, Sagaredzho, etc. The  study shows that contamination in four out of five cities is  extreme due to inefficient discharge treatment, poor vehicle  emission control, inadequate tree planting, and unsatisfactory  street cleaning. Shortcomings in waste water treatment in the  above cities and the resulting contamination of the Black Sea  are noted. A study of population morbidity confirms the  unfavorable effect of atmospheric contamination on the public  health status and makes it possible to establish a statistically  reliable correlation between the total atmospheric air  contamination index P and population health levels in the  administrative territories under study of r=0.69. The  findings determine the principal emphasis and character of  efforts aimed at improving public health and reducing the demand  for medical assistance; these measures basically amount to  consistent implementation of deliberate measures aimed it  improving the air quality.</p>

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Blue Arrow accused may dismiss lawyers THE TWO defendants in the second Blue Arrow fraud trial are likely to dismiss their lawyers and defend themselves in court because they face heavy tax bills on their fast rising legal costs. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew has agreed to pay the legal fees incurred by Mr Paul Smallwood and Mr Tim Brown, former equities directors with the company, who are charged with conspiracy to defraud over their roles in the 1987 Blue Arrow rights issue. Under Inland Revenue rules, those payments will be treated as benefits in kind to be taxed at the 40 per cent top rate - leaving both with possible income tax liabilities of up to Pounds 400,000 if convicted. The total bills for the two defendants, both represented by MacFarlanes, the City solicitors, and barristers led by Mr Anthony Arlidge QC, are each expected to approach Pounds 1m by the end of the trial. The prospect of such large tax bills forced both Mr Smallwood and Mr Brown to consider giving up the services of their lawyers. Although they have yet to reach a final decision and are still examining the possibility of receiving legal aid to pay for new lawyers, both have effectively reconciled themselves to mounting their own courtroom defences without qualified legal assistance. The trial, which is expected to last about three months, is due to start early in October. Both Mr Smallwood and Mr Brown are believed to be well aware of the strains and pitfalls of mounting their own defences - as demonstrated earlier this year by Mr Roger Seelig, a former Morgan Grenfell corporate finance director, prosecuted over his role in the Guinness affair. Mr Seelig's trial was abandoned after the stresses of defending himself drove him to the brink of a nervous breakdown. Court proceedings had been slowed by Mr Seelig's emotional outbursts and psychiatrists brought in to examine him expressed concern that he had become potentially suicidal. The tax liability has not arisen with those Blue Arrow defendants formerly employed by County NatWest. Unlike Phillips &amp; Drew, County has undertaken to meet the personal tax liabilities of all former employees prosecuted by the Serious Fraud Office over the affair. The issue is now understood to be the subject of 'sensitive' discussions between County and the Inland Revenue. Mr Justice Brooke, the judge in charge of the two forthcoming Blue Arrow trials, yesterday rejected claims on behalf of the four remaining defendants that charges against them should be dropped because they could not be given a fair trial. The trial of Mr Charles Villiers, a former County chairman, and Ms Elizabeth Brimelow, a former County compliance director, is expected to start in January.</p>

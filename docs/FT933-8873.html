			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / World Trade News: East Asia disputes the road to growth - Regional conference points up problems of how to co-operate OPTIMISM that east Asia will lead world economic growth tables into the next century was palpable at the 'Indonesia, Asia Pacific and the New World Order' conference in Bali this week. As Mrs Carla Hills, former US trade representative, said, the region has the potential 'to trigger an economic renaissance worldwide'. There was less unanimity, however, about how the region should co-operate to maximise future growth. While Chinese delegates pleaded otherwise, most east Asian nations regard Beijing as a trading competitor, not an ally. Japanese delegates found themselves isolated by demands that Tokyo improve market access for foreign goods and companies. There was no accord on arguably the most critical issue: whether east Asia should proceed alone or forge an Asia-Pacific axis with the economies of North America. The conference, which brought together leading Asian politicians, academics and businessmen, highlighted the recent economic liberalisation and growth of China, a process which 'is not reversible', according to Prof Edward Chen, a member of Hong Kong's executive council. China is not unique in east Asia, with other developing countries such as Thailand and Malaysia preparing to join South Korea and Taiwan among the ranks of newly industrialised nations. Political analysts, however, sounded a note of caution. Prof Robert Scalapino, a leading Asia academic, warned of the 'awesome problem' of China's swelling urban population. 'Higher education has fallen into a terrible state,' he said, and 'the speculative boom in property and stocks has dangerously depleted bank resources.' In Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous country, 'social dislocation will be the major political issue,' said Prof Juwono Sudarsono of the University of Indonesia. 'Strikes, human rights issues and land issues will tax the ingenuity of the political leadership'. Sustained economic growth, most delegates argued, would allow countries to meet their domestic political challenges. They were less confident that nations could meet the challenge of economic co-operation. Chinese delegates called for the development of regional trade associations, but speakers highlighted east Asia'spoor record in the field. The most prominent organisation is the six-member Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean). But, as Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysian finance minister, noted: 'Asean, despite. . . . booming individual economies, has yet to achieve something substantial in economic collaboration. 'Should any country venture to dominate others the (Asean) grouping would collapse immediately,' he warned. Delegates said the same concern would preclude the effective development of wider regional groupings, such as the East Asian Economic Caucus, backed by Malaysia, or the Asia Pacific Economic Community (Apec), which groups east Asian nations with the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Although the region is without serious conflict, Prof Paul Evans, director of the Joint Centre for Asia Pacific Studies in Canada, stressed that security relations between nations remained a 'significant nightmare'. Delegates pointed to the continuing tensions in China-Taiwan relations, Korean unification and contested sovereignty of the Spratly Isles in the South China Sea as underlining the importance of continued US military presence in the region. A military role gave muscle to Washington in its promotion of the wider Apec forum to facilitate US economic involvement in east Asia. President Bill Clinton has invited Apec leaders to an informal meeting in Seattle in November to discuss Asia Pacific issues, but east Asian countries remain sceptical about US intentions. Malaysia has said that its prime minister will not attend, and as Prof Scalapino commented: 'The Chinese leadership cannot avoid the belief that the US is deeply subversive.' Many delegates believed the US would use Apec to put pressure on Japan to improve market access in the name of economic co-operation. Through its trade surplus, 'Japan exports its unemployment to the rest of the world,' said Prof Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in the US. Asian delegates accused the US of interfering in their countries' internal affairs by linking trade concessions with labour conditions and human rights. But while most delegates were united in anti-US sentiment they agreed with Washington that Japan was too protectionist. Any opening up of Japan's economy would benefit east Asian nations for which it remains the main export market. The likely outcome for the Asia Pacific, delegates said, was the formation of several economic associations, none of which would have any great power. Few delegates challenged the assertion of Mr Gareth Evans, Australian foreign minister, that east Asian nations had a 'steady convergence of aspirations and a growing sense of community'. They also agreed the pace of change toward economic co-operation would be slow.</p>

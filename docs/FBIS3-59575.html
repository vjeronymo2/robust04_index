Hetzel &amp; Co Elektronik-Recycling    GmbH and the equipment technology division of Siemens AG  presented two pilot plants in Nuernberg which dismantle both  black-and-white and color picture tubes into completely sorted  glass. According to Hetzel CEO Juergen Wolf, ten million picture  tubes per year are being discarded in Germany.    According to the company the program-controlled facility  uses  a thermal process to separate the lead-containing conical glass  and the strontium-containing front glass. Test agreements exist  already with the glass industry to reuse the recycled products  for picture tube molding. Black-and-white tubes which consist of  uniform glass are cut open with diamond saws in the pilot  facility which makes it easier to remove the luminescent coating  in a washing installation.    According to the company, there are also plans for recycling  the washed out rare earth elements which currently still go to a  waste dump. At present, the two mobile facilities recycle 240  color tubes and 150 black-and-white tubes per day . According to  Wolf, this throughput can be increased quite easily. The unit  price for recycling a tube is currently DM8, for a complete  computer monitor it is DM35 to DM45.</p>

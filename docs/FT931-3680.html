			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Israeli government tightens security after many attacks THE ISRAELI cabinet yesterday announced measures aimed at tightening internal security, following a spate of attacks against civilians and soldiers in the past week. The cabinet convened for its weekly meeting as public anxiety over security was further exacerbated by the police chief's call on all citizens licensed to carry weapons to do so at all times. Some 230,000 Israeli citizens, including most Jewish male adults in the occupied territories, have gun licences. Mr Yacov Terner, police chief, made his unprecedented call after a Jewish woman had been hacked to death with an axe in the Gaza Strip and the body of an Israeli soldier, shot dead, was found outside Jerusalem on Friday. The police chief came under criticism at the cabinet meeting by ministers who said his call to carry arms had provoked hysteria around the country. To bolster security, the cabinet announced it would increase the number of policemen stationed around the country by 2,000, bolster the civil guard and provide incentives to Israeli employers to hire Jewish rather than Palestinian workers. The recent spate of attacks against Israeli citizens began after a month-long hiatus following the expulsion of 415 Palestinians on December 17. After the cabinet meeting, Mr Micha Harish, industry and trade minister, said the defence establishment had been ordered 'to take all legal measures to strengthen the war against terrorism'.</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Top Granada executive to head ITV MR ANDREW QUINN was yesterday named as ITV's first chief executive on a three-year contract with total remuneration likely to be between Pounds 400,000 and Pounds 500,000 a year. Mr Quinn, the 55-year-old chief executive of Granada Television - who will be responsible for an annual budget of about Pounds 500m - said: 'There is no doubt ITV will have to be more commercial in future. The Independent Television Commission recognises that.' Mr Quinn emphasised that his strategy would be: 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it'. But he added that: Current-affairs programmes would need audiences of 8m to 9m to earn their slots in prime time. Granada's award-winning World in Action has been drawing audiences of 7.5m. Scheduling techniques such as 'stripping' - running the same type of programme at the same time each evening - was now possible. He would argue for extension of the definition of prime time from 10.30pm until 11pm. That might allow News at Ten to run half an hour later if it was decided that was necessary for scheduling purposes. Mr Quinn also warned that further rationalisations would be needed in ITV. 'There is a whole duplication in the system with 15 sets of everything.' The choice of Mr Quinn took ITV right back to the beginning in their search for a chief executive to run the new centralised network from this autumn. Mr Quinn was the first choice of senior ITV executives at the beginning of this year after unofficial approaches to Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4 had been rebuffed. Then came the internal upheavals at Granada and the forced resignation of Mr David Plowright, chairman of Granada Television. Mr Quinn decided he could not leave Granada at such a time. Headhunters were called in and more than 70 names considered before the job came back on the market after Mr David Arculus, group managing director of Emap the publishing company, turned it down. The headhunters are expected to be paid about Pounds 100,000 for 'finding' Mr Quinn and a central scheduler.</p>

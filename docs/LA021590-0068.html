			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COOK IT LIGHT: LOWER-FAT SOUR CREAM COFFEE CAKE  </P> <P> DEAR JEANNE: I am on a low-fat diet due to high cholesterol and high  triglycerides and miss making this coffee cake. I would appreciate your  attention to this recipe. Thank you very much.  </P> <P>  -- MRS. L., New Port Richey, Fla.  </P> <P> SOUR CREAM COFFEE CAKE  </P> <P> 1/2 cup margarine  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups sugar  </P> <P> 2 eggs  </P> <P> 1 cup sour cream  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon baking soda  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon vanilla  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups flour  </P> <P> 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder  </P> <P> 1 cup chopped walnuts  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon  </P> <P> Cream margarine and 1 cup sugar until fluffy. Add eggs, 1 at time.  </P> <P> Combine sour cream and baking soda in separate bowl. Add to creamed mixture.  Add vanilla, then flour and baking powder.  </P> <P> Combine walnuts, remaining 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon, mixing well. Add 1/2  topping to cake batter and pour into 9-inch square pan. Sprinkle remaining 1/2  topping over top and bake at 350 degrees 50 minutes. Makes 9 (3-inch square)  servings.  </P> <P> DEAR ALICE: I served both your recipe and my revision to guests on New Year's  Day and they all agreed that if the two cakes were not side by side you would  never be able to tell the difference. I was able to reduce the margarine and  sugar by half and replaced the eggs with egg substitute. The only cholesterol  now in this scrumptious cake is from the light sour cream, which I substituted  for the regular sour cream in your original recipe.  </P> <P> By toasting the walnuts first, I enhanced their flavor enough to reduce them by  half, and increasing the amount of cinnamon also increases the level of  perceived sweetness to compensate for the reduced sugar in the topping mixture.  I hope you like my Light Sour Cream Coffee Cake as much as my guests did.  </P> <P>  -- JEANNE  </P> <P> LIGHT SOUR CREAM COFFEE CAKE  </P> <P> 1/4 cup corn-oil margarine  </P> <P> 3/4 cup sugar  </P> <P> 1/2 cup liquid egg substitute  </P> <P> 1 cup light sour cream  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon baking soda  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon vanilla  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups flour  </P> <P> 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder  </P> <P> 1/2 cup chopped walnuts  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon  </P> <P> Cream margarine and 1/2 cup sugar until fluffy.

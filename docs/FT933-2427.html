			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Markets: Laporte impresses sceptics - The Bottom Line TAKEOVERS have become unfashionable. Academic research suggests that acquisitive companies seldom achieve the hoped-for benefits. During the last takeover boom of the late 1980s, companies were often urged into unsuitable deals by merchant banks more concerned with generating fees than commercial logic. The City was therefore pleasantly surprised this week when Laporte, the speciality chemicals group, announced a rapid improvement in the results of Evode, the chemicals and plastic group it bought in January. By cutting Evode's workforce by 8 per cent, closing its headquarters and drastically slimming the management structure, Laporte obtained operating profits of Pounds 13.1m from Evode in its first five months with the group - almost as much as it made in a whole year under the previous management. The rapid success vindicated the judgment of Ken Winton, Evode's chief executive, who had to convince a sceptical City that the Evode deal would enhance Laporte's earnings. Some analysts feared Evode had overpaid when it came in as a white knight to make an agreed offer of Pounds 129m for Evode, topping by Pounds 16m a hostile bid from Wassall, the mini-conglomerate. The acquisition of Evode was, however, only the latest of a series of deals which have transformed the UK's second largest independent chemical group, shifting Laporte's focus from commodity chemicals towards high-margin speciality markets. Minton says the concept is quite simple. Whereas commodity chemicals are sold on price alone, specialities are sold for other considerations. The business differs from bulk chemicals because it is research-orientated, changing the product to meet the customer's need. 'A speciality customer is prepared to pay more because the supplier has a monopoly, or has a better product, or his salesmanship is better. A bulk chemical manufacturer is obsessed by production - cutting costs to improve margins. But for specialities, marketing becomes far more important than production chemistry,' he says. Laporte has focused on five core divisions - organic speciality chemicals; construction; absorbents and pigments; hygiene and process; metals and electronics chemicals. The group enjoys an average profit margin of 14 per cent, and Evode's margins have already been lifted from 4 per cent to double figures. Although Laporte's shares jumped by 6 per cent on news of the Evode success, they are still only trading on a prospective multiple of 15.5 - the market average. That does no seem overgenerous at this stage in the cycle for a group which makes 65 per cent of its sales to the recovering economies of the US and UK, and has only a 25 per cent exposure to the declining Continental European markets. While some analysts are convinced by the Laporte restructuring story, others say the group has a record of promising more than it can deliver. Apart from Evode, the recent performance of its other business has been fairly flat, after the impact of acquisitions and currency is removed. The City was alarmed to discover that debt climbed to Pounds 190m immediately after the Evode deal, but has since come down to Pounds 170m, giving Laporte gearing of 57 per cent. It is likely to come down, helped by tight control on working capital and disposals of unwanted Evode assets. A further reason for City uncertainty is the bewilderingly wide range of Laporte's products - everything from cat litter to fine chemicals for the pharmaceutical industry. No analyst or fund manager can hope to understand such a diverse range of markets. Observers are also struck by the rapid rate at which Laporte has changed: more than 80 per cent of the group's business has come in within the last 10 years. Laporte promised the City a period of consolidation after the takeover, and the rapid improvement in Evode's margins is a good start. If Winton can produce a solid series of trading results from his refocused group, the share price should benefit.</p>

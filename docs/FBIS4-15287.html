			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 3 (CTK) -- The leader of Russia's  extreme nationalist Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, today said that his stance on the Czech Republic's  joining NATO was "negative."    Speaking with journalists during the World Slavonic  Congress,  held on his initiative, Zhirinovskiy said that "the Czech  leadership has the right to make a decision," but "it would be  better if Slavonic nations became members of the new Eastern  European community."    Unification on the basis of the Slavonic idea will produce  "a  better, firmer and juster union" than NATO's expansion would do,  Zhirinovskiy said.    At the congress he said the new community would spread "from  the Adriatic Sea to the Kurile Islands."    Zhirinovskiy told journalists that he would visit the Czech  Republic and Slovakia "in the nearest future," but did not  specify.    He has been invited to the Czech Republic by the  parliamentary extreme right Assembly for the  Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC) of Miroslav  Sladek.    The invitation was extended for mid-March, but Zhirinovskiy  said he would come for a two-day visit on March 20. Following  strong disagreement with the visit among Czech political parties  and Interior Minister Jan Ruml's statement that he would do  everything to prevent the visit, Zhirinovskiy cancelled it  saying it would be too expensive.    Sladek, who was invited to the congress, did not take part.  Instead he sent a telegram of greetings, the LDP international  department told journalists.    The about 20 foreign guests sitting in the presidium of the  World Slavonic Congress included Juraj Molnar, deputy chairman  of the nationalist Slovak National Party (SNS). The SNS along  with Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (SNS)  made up the former Slovak Government, dismissed on March 11.    Molnar told the congress that "after 1000 years of Hungarian  yoke and after living with the Czech nation," independent  Slovakia had realised that it "will not exist unless the Slavs  are united."    Molnar told CTK that he had arrived to the congress mainly  to  get acquainted with the LDP leadership. "It is in our interest  to know what role Slovakia will play in central Europe in case  of the Liberal Democratic Party's victory in Russia," he said.    The guests from Slovakia also included two members of "the  provisional government of Subcarpathian Rus" which is seeking  independence from Ukraine.    Subcarpathian Rus, historically part of the Austro-Hungarian  Empire, came under Czechoslovak administration in 1919. A  treaty of 1945 ceded this easternmost region of Czechoslovakia  to the Soviet Union.</p>

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / The Lex Column: HSBC/Midland Hongkong Bank's reluctance to part with cash and its desire to avoid excessive dilution made the issue of loan stock an obvious choice for financing part of its bid for Midland. The resulting issue of between Pounds 350m and Pounds 700m of 10-year subordinated debt would be a large morsel, however, for a market that saw only Pounds 335m of such paper from banks last year and has already absorbed Pounds 250m in 1992. That prompts the question of how marketable HSBC's paper would be. Large issues normally command a liquidity premium in the bond market. Such an advantage would already apply to an issue of Pounds 350m, but is likely to be steadily whittled away as the amount increases towards the top of the range envisaged by HSBC. Despite the rush into gilts since the election, subordinated bank debt is not a favourite of international investors. There is not much appetite from other banks, because the investment has a high risk weighting under BIS rules. Doubtless HSBC's advisers took this into account when setting the margin on the bonds at 160 basis points over comparable gilt-edged stock. That looked generous compared with the 145-point margin offered by the Woolwich Building Society on a Pounds 50m issue just before the bid terms were announced. It still looks broadly in line with the market, even though spreads on similar issues have widened by about 5 points since then. Whether the promised par price would hold for long is another matter. One has to assume that holders of Midland equity are not necessarily natural investors in fixed rate subordinated bank bonds. Many will want to sell their holdings quickly. It is hard to see demand being overwhelming, even though supply of other issues may now dry up while the bid proceeds.</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Japanese developer to reduce holding of properties overseas Kumagai Gumi, the Japanese contractor and developer, is to sell a large number of its overseas properties and post an extraordinary loss to the parent group of Y21bn (Dollars 195m) this financial year. More than Y10bn of the extraordinary loss is accounted for by the sale of one building, the Thames Exchange in London, which was sold to Scottish Amicable, the insurance and investment group, last December. Losses will also arise from its plans to liquidate some overseas units, and write off some loans to them. However, Kumagai says the extraordinary loss will not influence profits for this accounting period because of profits generated elsewhere. The company hopes to be able partially to offset the loss with an extraordinary gain of some Y5.8bn, from cost-cutting and the sale of redundant land. Kumagai is planning to reduce its holdings of unsold overseas properties from more than Y600bn to about Y540bn by the end of March this year. The unsold properties are concentrated in the UK, Australia and the US. The group has been trying to reduce its overseas holdings for some time, but the sluggish international property market has made this a slow process. The slightly better state of the UK commercial property market means that British assets have been easier to sell than those elsewhere. Last May, the debt-laden company reported a drop of almost 40 per cent in pre-tax profits for the year to end March 1993. There was a further 74.5 per cent drop in interim pre-tax profits last November.</p>

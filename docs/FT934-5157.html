			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Leading Article: The fight for Spanish jobs Spain's economy lies becalmed, but Mr Felipe Gonzalez is steering into a storm. The Spanish prime minister is heading towards confrontation with the country's trade unions over his plans to force through badly-needed changes in labour legislation. More strikingly than any other member of the European Union, Spain offers a case study of how outdated and restrictive employment laws prevent economies from attaining full potential. Following yesterday's expiry of a deadline for negotiating labour market reforms, the government is preparing to impose them through parliamentary action. The unions, which last week staged protest marches in 50 cities against government policies, are threatening a general strike in January. As Mr Gonzalez ponders his next move, the eyes of Europe are on him. After unexpectedly winning a fourth prime ministerial term in June's elections, Mr Gonzalez has presided over a gentle reduction in interest rates. He has announced a relatively tough 1994 budget to try to reduce the fast-expanding fiscal deficit. The prime minister has hesitated, however, to put into effect fundamental measures to correct structural flaws in the economy and pull Spain out of recession. Three months of talks with unions and employers, designed to agree a 'social pact' on wages, pensions and labour market measures, have now ended fruitlessly. The time for equivocation is past. Mr Gonzalez must hesitate no longer. Unions opposed The trade unions are trenchantly opposing proposals to dismantle employment laws placed on the statute book shortly after Mr Gonzalez's Socialist party took power in 1982. These regulations, some of which bear the hallmarks of the state corporatism of General Franco, have long outlived any usefulness they might once have had. Spain has successfully consolidated its transition to democracy. But it is now - by overall European standards - a relatively high cost economy. No-one understands this better than Mr Pedro Solbes, the economy minister, who said yesterday that unions had lost touch with reality. Spain is competing for investment not only with other more efficient regions in western Europe, but also with low-wage countries in eastern and central Europe and east Asia. Restrictive hire-and-fire procedures, rigidly centralised wage bargaining, legal impediments on part-time work and apprenticeships, and the state monopoly on placement services for the unemployed are holding back job creation and growth. In view of the large black market for labour, Spain's official unemployment rate - at 22.9 per cent the highest in the EU - overstates the true scale of the problem. Nonetheless, the statistic illustrates its hugely wasteful imbalance between labour supply and demand. Hiring procedures The cabinet on Friday is due to discuss implementing a decree to make hiring procedures more flexible. Since the unions regard this and other planned measures as an assault on workers' rights, a showdown seems inevitable. However, Mr Gonzalez has the resources to weather the challenge. With the ending of the 1985-91 economic boom, the unions have lost the power to impose their will. In contrast to their victory five years ago in forcing Mr Gonzalez to withdraw a planned youth employment scheme, the half-day general strike the unions called last May was a half-hearted affair. In parliament, the Socialists relinquished their absolute majority in June. But the prime minister can rely on support from the minority Catalan party, the CiU, to push the employment legislation through the Cortes. After three peseta devaluations since September 1992, the financial markets since the June election have given Mr Gonzalez a somewhat grudging benefit of the doubt. As the peseta's weakness during the past few days indicates, even this limited confidence will be lost if he again fails to live up to promises to overhaul economic policy. At stake in the approaching tussle is far more than Mr Gonzalez's personal authority as Europe's longest-serving Socialist leader. If Mr Gonzalez fails to meet the challenge he now faces, Spain can abandon any hope of playing a fully competitive role in the economy of the new Europe.</p>

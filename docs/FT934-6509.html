			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Nigerian par bonds rally Nigerian par bonds rallied strongly yesterday, regaining most of the ground they lost following last week's coup, despite growing concern over Nigeria's overall debt position. The bonds rallied from 39 cents in the dollar at the start of the year to a high of 63 cents in October. Prices have held up surprisingly well in the face of renewed political turmoil and rebounded several points to 58 1/4 cents yesterday, on news of the appointment of a provisional ruling council. 'Given the uncertainty, the price does seem rather high, and the market could prove vulnerable to further shocks to confidence,' said Mr Mark Evans of ING Bank. However, traders point out that the bonds cost Nigeria only Dollars 110m a year to service - only two days of its oil revenues.</p>

			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOUR MORE NATIONS WILL PULL ENVOYS FROM KABUL  </P> <P> Four nations announced Friday they will follow the U.S. decision to pull its  diplomats out of Afghanistan.  </P> <P> France, Italy, Britain and Japan made separate announcements of their  intentions to leave Kabul.  </P> <P> The Afghan government responded by criticizing the closings. The Soviet news  agency Tass reported that the decisions reflect an attempt to undermine  international confidence in the Soviet-backed government, besieged by Muslim  guerrillas.  </P> <P> Italy said it will temporarily close its embassy in Kabul as soon as an Italian  journalist seriously injured in Afghanistan can leave, a Foreign Ministry  official said in Rome.  </P> <P> Tass quoted an Afghan Foreign Ministry statement charging that the closure of  embassies on security grounds in view of the imminent departure of Soviet  troops is unjustified.  </P> <P> It said the Afghan army "is successfully defending the cities and provinces  from where Soviet troops have already left."  </P> <P> "Therefore, the decisions of Western states can only be assessed as an attempt  to sap the trust of international public opinion in the ability of the state  authorities to defend the city from extremists."  </P> <P> Tass also reported that a child was killed and several buildings damaged in a  rebel rocket attack on the Afghan capital Friday. It said five rockets hit the  city, one destroying a school.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov flew in on a previously  unannounced visit, less than three weeks before the last of his troops are due  to leave the country.  </P> <P> A Soviet Embassy official said Yazov immediately went into conference with  President Najibullah, but he could give no further details.  </P> <P> Most embassies and aid agencies cut their staffs last August during a period of  heavy rebel rocket attacks on Kabul.  </P> <P> Not all diplomats are happy at the prospect of recall.  </P> <P> "People talk rubbish," one French envoy commented. "It's beautiful weather.  There are no rockets. It's very quiet now."  </P></p>

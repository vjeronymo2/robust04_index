			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Record loss of Dollars 1.3bn at Ford of Europe FORD'S European automotive operations made a record loss last year of Dollars 1.3bn, compared with a loss of Dollars 1.079bn in 1991. The loss was largely incurred by Ford's operations in Britain, including Jaguar, the UK car maker. The loss in Europe included a Dollars 419m one-off charge for restructuring, while adverse currency fluctuations added exchange rate losses of more than Dollars 200m. Ford of Europe announced late last year that it was planning to cut more than 10,000 jobs by the end of 1993. The workforce of its European automotive operations, excluding Jaguar, had already been cut by 19 per cent from 115,000 in 1990 to 93,000 late last year and is set to fall to 83,000 by the end of 1993. Jaguar, which was taken over by Ford at the end of 1989, said that its loss last year was little changed under US accounting rules, at Dollars 394.9m, compared with a loss of Dollars 402.2m in 1991. Under UK accounting rules, the loss was cut to Pounds 189.5m (Dollars 286m) from Pounds 226.2m a year earlier. The Jaguar UK workforce has also been sharply reduced, to only 6,481 at the end of 1992 from 7,520 a year earlier and 11,661 at the end of 1990. Jaguar's retail sales worldwide fell last year by 12.4 per cent to 22,478. This was the lowest level since 1982. Production dropped last year by 10.5 per cent to 20,593 - lowest since 1981. The UK car maker is expecting some recovery in its fortunes this year, however, with a forecast increase in sales of 25 per cent worldwide, led by stronger demand in the US. Jaguar sales in January were 25 per cent higher than a year ago, helped by a 30 per cent rise in its sales in the US, its most important market. Mr David McCammon, Ford vice-president for finance in the US, said that most of the group's European automotive losses stemmed from Ford of Britain and from Jaguar. Ford, the leader of the UK new car market, has suffered heavily during the recession. Its UK sales fell again last year by 8.4 per cent, depressing its UK market share to only 22.2 per cent, from 24.2 per cent a year earlier. The loss of Dollars 1.3bn incurred last year by Ford's European automotive operations, including Jaguar, followed a net loss of Dollars 1.079bn in 1991, and net profits of Dollars 145m in 1990 and Dollars 1.19bn in 1989. The losses in Europe more than accounted for Ford's total automotive losses outside the US last year of Dollars 1.1bn. Ford's European car production fell by 6.9 per cent last year to 1,459,792, although its output of light commercial vehicles rose by 9.5 per cent to 226,547, helped by the launch of the Fiesta Courier van. The Ford group has fallen to fifth place in the west European new car market.</p>

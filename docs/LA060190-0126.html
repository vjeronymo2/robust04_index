			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PATHE ARRANGES LOANS FOR BULK OF MGM/UA BUYOUT  </P> <P> The $1.2-billion acquisition of MGM/UA Communications Corp. by Pathe  Communications Co. remained on course Thursday, despite rumors to the contrary,  as new terms were spelled out in lengthy documents filed with the Securities  and Exchange Commission.  </P> <P> MGM/UA revealed that Pathe will finance part of the buyout with an unsecured  $450-million loan from one if its subsidiaries, Comfinance S.A. of Luxembourg.  It also disclosed that Time Warner Inc. will directly loan Pathe $650 million  toward the purchase, with the United Artists film library as collateral. Time  Warner previously agreed only to guarantee a loan.  </P> <P> MGM/UA also left open the possibility that majority owner Kirk Kerkorian will  retain some interest in the company. The deal is supposed to close by next  Thursday, though MGM/UA reserved the right to extend the deadline.  </P> <P> Concerns about the purchase surfaced earlier this week when a story spread that  a Time Warner board member was stirring opposition to the deal. According to  published reports, the board member -- whose name was not revealed -- objected  to Time Warner's involvement with Pathe co-President Giancarlo Parretti, who is  appealing a "fraudulent bankruptcy" conviction handed down by a Naples court.  </P> <P> A Pathe spokesman denied the reports, and Thursday's announcement of the  amended purchase plan appeared at least partially designed to offset concerns  that the deal was in trouble.  </P> <P> "It sounds like they're probably going to get it done now," said Jeffrey  Logsdon, an entertainment industry analyst with the brokerage Crowell, Weedon  &amp; Co. in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The MGM/UA filing indicates that Pathe's financing for the $20-a-share deal  remains somewhat mysterious, however. Comfinance, a holding company, will issue  Pathe a one-year, $450-million loan that is funded through "working capital and  available financing," but the documents do not explain where Comfinance will  acquire the money.  </P> <P> Pathe has the option of paying off the loan at any time within the year and may  do so with shares of common stock. It may also repay the loan through the sale  of unnamed assets.  </P> <P> Time Warner spokeswoman Marilyn Harris said executives were not available for  comment on the revised plan.  </P> <P> Time Warner initially agreed to arrange for the loan on Pathe's behalf in  return for distribution rights to the United Artists film library and future  MGM/UA and Pathe releases. Under the new plan, the Time Warner loan will be  made directly to Pathe, and secured by a note for the loan's amount and certain  assets, such as the Pathe and Cannon Group film libraries.  </P> <P> Time Warner is also expected to retain the same film distribution rights.  </P> <P> Finally, MGM/UA's amended filing revealed the sources of money used by Pathe in  its non-refundable $150-million down payment. According to MGM/UA, $71 million  came from Pathe's "available cash" and $79 million was "advanced by the  (company's) European interests."  </P></p>

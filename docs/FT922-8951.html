			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Berlusconi denounces capping of TV receipts MR Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian media magnate, has angrily denounced a decision by a watchdog body capping his television advertising receipts. The potential loss to Mr Berlusconi's Fininvest group this year could be L300bn (Pounds 136m). Over the weekend Mr Berlusconi said he would be contesting the decision in the courts. The cap was imposed by Prof Giuseppe Santaniello, who acts as the media ombudsman. In a long judgment, he claimed that the dominant position reached by Mr Berlusconi's televison stations in the advertising market was limiting competition. Mr Berlusconi's main channels - Channel 5, Italia I and Network (Rete) 4 - account for 56.8 per cent of all Italian television advertising. With his smaller channels such as Junior TV and Italia 7, his group controls 60.1 per cent. The three channels of RAI, the state-owned television, generate only 28 per cent of total television advertising, while Tele Monte Carlo, the next most important private group, accounts for only 3 per cent. In February Prof Santaniello began considering a complaint lodged against the monopoly position of Fininvest by some 30 newspaper and magazines publishers and TV station owners. The complaint addressed Mr Berlusconi's position in the print media (he controls magazines and a newspaper) as well as TV as a result of his acquisition of control of the Mondadori publishing groupin April 1991. The publishers were concerned that in a declining market where television was taking an increasing share from the print media, Mr Berlusconi had acquired a position where he could dictate prices and profit unfairly from the synergy of his group. The television networks claimed Mr Berlusconi was undercutting rates because he had been able to acquire his TV channels at low cost.</p>

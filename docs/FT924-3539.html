			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / European Government Bonds: Bundesbank unlikely to cut rates ALL EYES will be on Thursday's meeting of the Bundesbank's central council, the last for the current year and therefore the sole remaining opportunity this year for Germany's central bankers to deliver the long-awaited cut in interest rates. There was plenty of evidence last week to stimulate hopes that rates would be cut. A raft of statistics showed it is more likely than not that Germany's stagnation will deteriorate into a recession, for example, an adjusted 0.5 per cent fall in third-quarter gross domestic product from the previous quarter, and a 2 per cent contraction in industrial output in October against the previous month, and a plunge in manufacturing orders. The worse the state of the economy, the better the outlook for inflation and ultimately interest rates. Taken together with signs of wage restraint - last week steel-workers in the north-western region of Germany settled for an effective 3.3 per cent a year between 1992 and 1994 and the insurance industry for 4.3 per cent - it is not surprising the bund market staged a rally later in the week, with prices rising across the yield curve on Thursday and Friday. However, these positive market developments have to be balanced against a number of factors which make it unlikely that the cut will come this week. Inflation is still running at 3.7 per cent - annualised M3 growth for October was at more than 10 per cent, compared with the 3.5-5.5 per cent target range - and the Bundesbank has made it clear in recent weeks that the battle against inflation is its chief priority. Furthermore, the greater the political pressure to abandon this orthodoxy - in the name of the European Monetary System, for example - the more stubborn the central bank is likely to be in defence of its position. At present, the political pressure is enormous, with the French franc under fire and the European Community summit in Edinburgh looming. For this reason the Bundesbank, embarrassed at the way its last interest cut in September was presented as a victory for the politicians, is unlikely to deliver even a token cut on Thursday. The consequences for the EMS are of secondary importance to the preservation of the central bank's credibility in the battle against domestic inflation. More likely is a gradual easing from the first quarter of next year - after the public sector wage round has started in the first half of January. The deteriorating outlook for the real economy may then start to affect prices. Inflation is being driven upwards by increases in rents and services and is likely to be pushed above 4 per cent from the beginning of next year because of rise in the rate of value added tax to 15 per cent from January 1. The problem for investors in the bund market is that a gradual sinking of interest rates in the first months of next year has already been discounted. The yield curve has flattened out. Mr Thomas Mayer, chief economist at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt, says that the best investment opportunities are at the shorter end of the curve - that is, bunds with maturities of two years where yields are at 7.37 per cent against 7.10 per cent for 4-5 year bunds and 7.33 per cent for 10-year bunds. Mr Mayer believes long bunds may test the 7.00 per cent mark in the first quarter of next year if interest rates do come down. In the meantime, he is advising clients who wish to invest in D-Marks to put their cash on deposit for six months, where they can obtain 8.5 per cent interest.</p>

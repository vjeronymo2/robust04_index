			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / UN tightens Haiti sanctions: Little assurance new curbs will work against military junta Tougher international economic sanctions went into effect against Haiti yesterday after leaders of the military junta failed to leave the country by a United Nations deadline of May 21. But there was little assurance the sanctions would be more effectively implemented than the narrower embargo on deliveries of fuel and arms over the last seven months. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, formally notified the UN Security Council on Friday that General Raoul Cedras, the military commander who ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1991, had not met the necessary conditions, triggering a broad embargo on shipments of everything except food, medicine and cooking gas. The existing fuel embargo, however, has had little effect on the Haitian military - although it has raised prices - because of a steady flow of contraband petrol across the border from the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti. US Vice-President Al Gore said yesterday the US was holding talks with the Dominican Republic on ways of improving implementation of the sanctions, but declined to threaten reprisals if co-operation does not improve. He insisted that it would be 'premature to discount the effectiveness of these tough new sanctions, but we are proceeding with other measures as well'. In the Dominican Republic, the government of 87-year-old President Joaquin Balaguer remains to some degree in suspense after the elections board ordered a recount in last week's election, responding to complaints of fraud made by Mr Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, the challenger. President Bill Clinton's Haiti policy has continued to suffer intense criticism, particularly from human rights advocates and black politicians, even after the White House shifted its policy of returning Haitian refugees to their country and named Mr William Gray, a respected former congressman, to be the US's new special envoy on Haiti. But the US won significant endorsement for its new policy towards refugees, which involves hearing their claims to asylum at sea, when Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, promised her agency's assistance in processing Haitian emigrants. The US has chartered a Ukrainian cruise ship as a processing centre at sea, but Mr Clinton last week raised with Mr John Major, the British prime minister, the possibility of using some uninhabited islands in the Turks and Caicos archipelago, a British possession which lies to the north of Haiti.</p>

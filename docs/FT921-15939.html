			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Observer: Representing long service When it comes to ancient politicians, America has plenty to be proud of. The secretive Jamie Whitten moved into the record books yesterday as the longest-serving member of the US House of Representatives. The Mississippi Democrat first came to Washington a month before Pearl Harbor after winning a by-election on November 4 1941. A reformed segregationist, he has never scored less than 63 per cent in his 26 elections Congress's seniority system means that Whitten, although one of the least known politicians in Washington, is also one of the most powerful. Other congressional leaders may decide on policy and dominate the news headlines, but it is Whitten, as chairman of the House Appropriations committee since 1978, who actually doles out the money. Old politicians know that purse strings are more important than policy, so it is no accident that Whitten's counterpart on the Senate Appropriations committee is the longest-serving Democrat in the Senate, Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia with 33 years under his belt. Now 81, Whitten still has one longevity record ahead of him: the almost 57 years of total congressional service clocked up by Arizona's Carl Hayden, who served 15 years in the House before moving over to the Senate. By contrast, Britain's politicians are positive youngsters. Sir Bernard Braine, the father of the house of commons, has only been an MP for 41 years and he is retiring this year . . .</p>

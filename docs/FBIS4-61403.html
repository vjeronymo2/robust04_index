			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Abbreviated transcript" of concluding speech by Russian </F> Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin at 26 April meeting with  editors of national and regional newspapers in Moscow: "Viktor  Chernomyrdin: The Country Must Unite and Achieve Accord"]    [Text] Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Russian  Government, has decided on a state subsidy to Russian newspapers  totaling 110.4 billion rubles through the end of 1994. This  decision was adopted at the prime minister's meeting with a  large group of editors of national and regional newspapers.    It was also determined at the meeting that the distribution  of the resources allocated by the state will be carried out by a  public council made up of leaders of central and local media  under the Russian Federation Committee on the Press.    During the meeting there was a thorough discussion of the  situation and problems of the central and regional press and the  need for financial support for the majority of publications,  especially in economically weak regions. The basic provisions  of a draft Russian Federation law on state support for the mass  media were also discussed. Viktor Chernomyrdin briefed the  chief editors in detail on the situation in the national economy  and the government's economic policy.    In the course of the discussion the chief editors received  the maximum information necessary to them not only for their  daily work, but for an unbiased view of the state of affairs in  the country. This gives them the opportunity to look more  critically at the established view that the government  supposedly lacks understanding of the problems of the press.  The government regards the press not only as the "Fourth  Estate," but as the "number one" sector, to whose situation it  intends always to pay the keenest attention. Today we publish a  transcript (abbreviated) of Government Chairman V.S.  Chernomyrdin's concluding speech at the meeting with editors.    [Chernomyrdin] So where are we now? That is almost a  philosophical question. We are going through a difficult period  in the economy. Throughout the year 1993 people were  threatening us with all kinds of cataclysms, and they are  threatening us now, trying to rock the boat at any price. I  must say that this no longer works with the government.    We do not do everything right, not everything works out for  us, but I wish to say again that our government is now operating  as a single organism, it has acquired the shape of the kind of  government that the Russian state should have. That process --  I have never said this before -- took 18 months. And in very  difficult conditions. You name it, we had it. But now, as long  as people do not distract us and keep nudging us, and let us get  on with our work, I have grounds for optimism.    There is no vacillation in the government. That does not  mean that everyone is living, so to speak, in perfect harmony,  that it is all unanimous. I would not accept that situation,  when one person says something and everyone else nods. We have  been through that before, we have seen it before. On the  contrary, this is a government in which every member has his own  opinion, his own view of matters, these are people who are  united by their concern for the state, people who understand  what is required of them, what they must do, and how they should  do it.    The government apparatus, for all its shortcomings, is also  beginning to gain strength and experience. I am sure,  therefore, that the difficulties that have still to be overcome  are within our government's power.    A few words about economic affairs in general. The results  give me no particular reason to boast or to reassure myself, or  you. Because the situation is complex. The decline in  production is continuing, and has not yet been stopped. That is  our main affliction today. Questions of nonpayments are  interwoven with these problems. In general, however, the  financial system is beginning to stabilize. First and foremost,  we have succeeded in curbing inflation. With the exception of  January, we have reached a stable level and are maintaining it.  Yet do you remember how people said that we could not do it,  that we would not be able to? Anyone would think someone else  was going to do it on our behalf. We are keeping and will keep  inflation within the limits indicated in the government program  in August 1993.    We do not today set the goal of reducing inflation to zero.  And we are criticized for that. I do not agree with this  criticism. You could reduce inflation to zero quickly. If you  stopped everything else: factories, plants, transport. That is  intolerable! It simply means ruin for the country. It is no  use pressing and squeezing so hard that all production processes  stop completely. We are in a period in which it is necessary to  keep a very sensitive finger on the pulse.    It is well known that factories are coming to a halt and  plants are stopping work. The worst thing is that enterprises  are closing that should not be closing, enterprises the country  needs, with modern technology and essential output. But there  are others that not only should, but simply must be closed.  We no longer need so much of what the defense industry  produces. We make mines; for three years now no one has wanted  them; yet the shoe factory next door is on the brink of  stoppage. So what is more important to us today? We do not  need all these mines, yet we make them, because those  people would be out on the streets otherwise. And there are so  many plants like that in Russia! They were intended for the  entire Soviet Union, which, at the time, stood against the whole  world. And today, Russia is suffering because of this.    Here the time factor plays an enormous role in many ways. It  took a year for the Omsk tank plant to start producing tractors,  when they wanted to do it in three months. No way. It turns  out that a tank is easier to make than a tractor for a farmer.  They can't do it, they don't know how. The ones they did make  might as well be made of gold. One defense plant, for instance,  made a pumping jack -- not a single oilman wanted one. Because  they made it to their own standards and put in components which  made it three times the price of any imported model. Nobody  bought them, and nobody will! The consumer does not want these  jacks, and that means the country does not want them. It  is madness to operate on the principle of "at any price." Those  days are gone. But some managers have still not grasped that  fact, they expect to beg or extort the money, they expect to be  given money from the treasury. They will not get it! If  they go on like that, what they will get is bankruptcy.    Can we get by without bankruptcies? No. I would like to go  into this particularly. Bankruptcy is being used  deliberately to intimidate people. Who is intimidating them,  and why? Who is trying to trivialize the matter and  present it crudely -- the gates are locked and the workers are  outside the gates? When an enterprise goes bankrupt, as a rule  privileged conditions apply to it: It is exempted from taxes  and dues, for a certain period it is, in effect, given financial  support so that it can go over to a new form of production. We  have many enterprises that were built many years ago and have  already operated for 30-40 years. Some need knocking down  completely and rebuilding from scratch, others need to replace  their technology and equipment, others again should be combined  with similar enterprises. There is opposition. Why?  Because, with bankruptcy, there is, without fail, a change  of management. And this instills such fear in the managers that  they are prepared to goad their own people into opposition, as  long as nothing is changed.    Is a rescue service needed? Of course. And that means that  funds for which provision is made in the budget will go to  support those enterprises without which the national economy  simply cannot function. We have some enterprises which are, so  to speak, "one of a kind," which everyone needs. We incorporate  special items in the budget for such enterprises, and there are  funds which should work for their support.    I am saying all this because, after all, we are not likely  to be able to stop the decline in production this year. The  rate of decline must be halted, the trend must be broken. So we  will channel all our resources and reserves into this, both  intellectual and material.    What is the most important thing today? Investments. You  could say that for two years we have all but stopped investing  in the naational economy. And without that, we will never get  anywhere. Hard as it may be, even if it means tightening our  belts still further, investment processes must be revitalized.  It is therefore important to get this across to people, to  explain that Russia cannot survive without new, up-to-date  technologies.    To this day some enterprises are still working to fill the  warehouses, and there are a good many of them. What is the  investment process? It is not only capital investments, not  merely increased production capacities, although that is  sometimes necessary too. It is also the updating of the machine  tool pool, of equipment and technologies, it is thorough  processing of raw materials and other materials. It is output  quality. And, of course, it is competitiveness on the world  market.    About rural problems. We are now making adjustments to the  budget and increasing resources for the development of the  agro-industrial complex, because there is no alternative.  Things have always been difficult in the countryside, but today  they are more difficult than ever. Therefore let us channel  some of our resources -- even bypassing credits, that is,  basically, giving interest-free subsidies -- into supporting the  agrarian sphere at this stage. It is not enough to declare that  we will not buy grain from the West, we still have to produce it  ourselves. And not only grain. Therefore more attention must  be paid to rural people. They cannot be made into scapegoats.  It is too serious a matter. Often people try to blame  everything on them, to argue that the agro-industrial complex is  a bottomless pit in the national economy. But we were the ones  who put them in that position. So let us rectify those  conditions.    A question that is of concern to everyone is -- where are  we,  in fact. As I understand it, and as calculations show, we  have reached the low point in the crisis decline. But we can  now feel the firm ground beneath our feet. Now we must find our  balance correctly and use this ground as a jumping-off point so  as to start to climb again. And we are capable of doing  this, because even today Russia retains a very considerable  potential. Even today it is by no means a poor country.    We are gradually paying off our debts, for the second year  now we are not asking anyone for anything, we just want Russia  to enjoy conditions on the world market that are not  humiliating, but equal, as for any other state. You remember,  24 billion [dollars] was mentioned, and then more than 40  billion.... We have not received much yet -- $3 billion. And  we are going to receive 3 billion more. But these are all  credits, this is not some kind of nonrepayable aid, it is debts  which will have to be repaid. So this is not, so to speak, the  secret of happiness. The main condition which we uphold  everywhere is that we should not be kept in the lobby of the  world market, like poor relations. We have something to offer  in trade, we have competitive output. And this does not  only mean raw materials! We have metal, metal products, machine  tools, developments in space programs, in atomic power  engineering, in nuclear matters, where we can compete. But we  are being held back. They are still setting conditions, for  instance, for us to enter the European Community, and that means  that in effect they are discriminating against us. We can and  should operate on equal terms, so as to pay our way and solve  our own problems. And this would only make matters easier for  our partners, too.    Why am I saying this? We are not poor, and we produce quite  a lot, even given this rate of decline. We are shutting down  oil wells, but we have enough fuel. We could produce more  output. But what are we to do with it? We could produce more  metal, but we cannot sell it. We could offer a different fuel,  nuclear fuel -- we just cannot produce as much as we could sell.  We have to stop production units, and that means accelerating  the recession. Military plants are closing down -- there are  problems everywhere on the weapons market. They give us nice  big smiles, but when it comes to the crunch, suddenly there are  thousands of reasons for not allowing us access to the Western  market.    Now, about money. Say what you like, the ruble has held  its ground. Maybe this is not so noticeable for us, but if you  compare it with what is happening in the neighboring CIS  countries, you can see that our tough line has produced and is  producing results. People are no longer running away from the  ruble. For the first time we have seen from State Committee for  Statistics figures and from bank statistics that people have  started accumulating rubles, saving them.    I have explained this before, maybe I am repeating myself.  You could relax the financial pressure, ease up on the monetary  and credit policy, print more money, add to the enterprises'  circulating capital, and settle accounts, but then we will once  again be presenting an intoxicating picture of running on the  spot, supporting everyone indiscriminately. And we do not want  all that! We do not want a feeble and mediocre country --  that is what some people refuse to understand, as they try to  push us back into the old quagmire of universal parasitism and  lack of responsibility. Of course Russia should have an  effective defense complex, it should have a modern industry up  to world standards, producing output that is competitive on any  market. Russia cannot, by virtue of its history and its very  nature, be an underdeveloped country willing to be fed by  others. Therefore we can no longer have a feeble policy: that  of giving to everyone and supporting everyone. But it is not  enough simply to understand that, it must be brought home to  people, explained to them. Maybe we do not talk about this  enough, but it is the main issue today.    Here the role and position of the press is particularly  important. You journalists, better than anyone else, understand  and feel the country's pulse, the people's mood. Try to explain  what is most important -- we must all unite. I think the Treaty  on Social Accord will take effect, but much will still have to  be done for the accord to be realized, for it not to remain only  on paper. The country must unite and achieve accord. It is not  discord we need now, but cohesion.    A problem of statewide significance is the struggle against  crime. The federal program on this topic, which was recently  approved by the president, must be fulfilled. We are trying to  provide everything that the program stipulates in the budget.  And we must give the maximum, because the people no longer  understand us. The fact that you cannot walk the streets, that  you cannot travel by train, that you cannot go on the subway --  this is simply impermissible. The state's role here is  paramount. Of course, it is not all just up to the law  enforcement organs. This is a scourge that we must all deal  with together, and the press too must play a more active part.    Much depends on you. It is no use shying away from it now, a  lack of restraint in the press and permissiveness in life cannot  be tolerated. You must criticize, you must argue, but you must  not insult or offend people just for fun, for the sake of a fine  turn of phrase. This annoys people and tears society apart.  Sometimes you read things and wonder: Is nothing sacred any  more? Anyone would think we were not living in the same  country. This is what must be left behind, you can do it, you  know how.    I think all you have to do is try. The government will meet  with media workers and leaders -- I promise you that. You must  know more, you must have the information. You must see how the  government operates, so that you can put us straight when  necessary. You can do that too, you know how.    Of course it is upsetting to see needy people, the plight of  pensioners and war veterans is distressing. But we will support  the veterans and the low-paid, we will pull up the living  standards of the needy. This is not unfounded populism. Our  rate of income is already above the rate of inflation.    Today we are beginning here to break the negative  trends that characterized the country's development over the  last two or three years. And we will break them, but it needs  patience, for the sake of the country, for the sake of the  children, so that they do not find themselves in a humiliating  position. Hard times have fallen to our lot, we must bear it  and we must respond. Let us grit our teeth, and things will be  easier for all the people. And we will come through. We cannot  fail to come through. We do not have the right. And I will not  accept any other viewpoint today.</p>

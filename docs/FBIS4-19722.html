			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Belgian Army Chief of Staff General Charlier </F> by Katrin Brahy; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Anchorman Lambrechts] For Lieutenant General  Charlier, the Belgian Army chief of staff, the mission in Rwanda  was the most difficult of all those carried out in Africa in a  long time. Gen. Charlier confirmed the anti-Belgian resentment  in Rwanda. However, the Belgian troops will serve again for the  United Nations if the need arises, but not under the same  conditions. Gen. Charlier was interviewed by Katrin Brahy.    [Charlier] I believe that this type of mission will remain  essential in the future. The international community cannot  ignore situations like that prevailing in Rwanda, Yugoslavia, or  Cambodia; it has to be present and reduce the degree of violence  in those countries.    [Brahy] I assume that if the circumstances so dictate, you  would like your mandate to be changed?    [Charlier] Exactly. As in any military operation, the means,  the mandates, and the conditions of an intervention should be  adapted to the actual situation on the spot instead of being  subject to the slow UN procedures. For example, the Belgian  Government asked on 7 April for a modification to the UNAMIR [UN  mission in Rwanda] mandate. It was told that this would take  weeks! Thus, some fundamental things certainly must be changed  regarding relations between UN Headquarters in New York and the  theaters of operations. The rights and conditions for the blue  helmets to protect themselves must be adapted to the  circumstances.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Manila, February 11 (XINHUA) -- Senator Blas Ople  today cautioned against reported move in the House of  Representatives to review the country's committed one-China  policy.    This could "needlessly complicate our relations with foreign  countries and even create incidents inimical to our national  security," said Ople, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee.    Ople made the remark in the wake of reports that 97  congressmen had co-authored a House resolution calling for a  review of the country's relations with China and Taiwan.    The resolution came out just one day after the clandestine  meeting in Subic of President Fidel Ramos with Taiwanese leader  Li Teng-hui, for which the Chinese Embassy here had already  lodged a protest with the Philippine Government saying the  incident had violated the agreed one-China policy.    "The sphere of foreign policy with respect to China and  Taiwan is fraught with perils and this should be treated with  great sensitivity, not knee-jerk emotional reactions or rank  amateurism," Ople said in a statement.    He said that "(the House) move will be prone to  misunderstanding and may cause unintended consequences."    He added that the country's political leaders should share  President Ramos's attitude that friendly relations with China  should be preserved and nurtured for the sake of the national  interest.    "We want and we seek a mutually advantageous economic  relationship with Taiwan, and value their cooperation, but this  should be conducted in a manner consistent with our solemn  undertakings under the 1975 covenant with China on a policy  recognizing only one China," he said.</p>

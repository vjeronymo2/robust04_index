			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 5 Apr (INA)--The newspaper AL-'IRAQ has  asserted that the United States is experiencing growing  frustration because its criminal objectives against Iraq and its  people have been thwarted.    In an article published here today, the paper adds: The  United States is going to the limit in its aggressive approach.  It is flouting all laws and norms, including the unfair  resolutions passed by the UN Security Council.    The paper goes on to say: Those endowed with an analytical  mind that enables them to read between the lines are well aware  of the reasons prompting the United States to proceed with its  anti-Iraq campaign. These reasons are manifest in the way the  United States is managing this campaign.    The paper says: And within this context falls the bizarre  U.S. position at the UN Security Council, and the U.S.  determination to overlook the fact that the reasons for  maintaining the anti-Iraq embargo have been fully removed, that  Iraq has fulfilled its commitments toward the UN Security  Council, particularly with regard to Resolution 687, and that  the world body must honor its commitments toward our country  through the rapid implementation of Paragraph 22.    AL-'IRAQ adds: It is the U.S. colonialist policy, which is  rooted in hegemony and a willingness to do the impossible to  promote the image of the Zionist entity as a key regional  player, that is pushing the United States to circumvent this  resolution, and to obstruct the crystallization of any fair  relevant position that could be entertained by the other members  of the UN Security Council. This was made clear during the UN  Security Council's recent periodic review session.    AL-'IRAQ concludes by saying: The rancorous and intransigent  U.S. position, which professes to uphold legitimacy and  international law, has nothing to do with either of the two. As  a matter of fact, it is the outcome of an evil and frenzied  endeavor to weaken Iraq and cripple its pan-Arab and  humanitarian role.    The paper urges the parties that have taken a constructive  and fair position inside and outside the UN Security Council to  promote their positions in the interest of true legitimacy and  international law, which the United States seeks to undermine in  order to advance its own interests and the interests of its  agents and stooges, as well as its evil schemes.</p>

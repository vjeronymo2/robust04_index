			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JOSEPH N. BELL: AT 19, HE AIMS TO BE A CITY FATHER  </P> <P> Young people are taking a lot of heat -- and rightly so -- these days for their  avid disinterest in public affairs, including a dismal voting record, so when  one comes along who takes the opposite tack, it seems worthy of note. That's  why I drove down to San Juan Capistrano the other day to visit with Gerhard  Peters.  </P> <P> Peters is one of 14 candidates for three seats on the San Juan City Council. He  is also a 19-year-old sophomore at Saddleback College who is concerned that the  voters of that community take his candidacy the same way he does: seriously.  </P> <P> We talked outside the Dana Point Harbor coffee bar where Peters has worked for  more than three years, currently as manager. He puts in a 40-hour week there,  carries a full academic load at Saddleback -- and managed a 3.6-grade-point  average last year.  </P> <P> I asked him when he finds time to campaign, and he explained: "I'm off school  on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and I also have Friday and Sunday mornings free." He  made it sound as if that were ample time to carry out his self-appointed  mission of trying to knock on the door of every registered voter in San Juan.  </P> <P> "There are 13,000 registered voters here," he said matter-of-factly, "and  realistically I expect to get to about one-third of them personally."  </P> <P> He probably will, too. There's a kind of quiet determination about him that  makes converts and belies his obvious youth. He's thin, of modest height, has  straight brownish hair neatly parted with the hint of a cowlick, wire-frame  eyeglasses, a high thin forehead, and a kind of wry humor that pokes  occasionally through the layers of earnestness. Although I haven't made a  study, I suspect that -- if elected -- he would be Orange County's only city  councilman wearing braces on his teeth.  </P> <P> But he would probably find that observation flippant, as well he should.  "People don't know who I am when I knock on their doors," he said, "but most of  them have been real nice to me. A few gave me a kind of astonished look because  I'm so young, but they didn't say it.  </P> <P> "One man told me he was excited to see a young person so involved. Another guy  invited me in and asked me to tell him about things I'd like to do in the city.  A lady talked to me for a half-hour, asking me questions, and then when I had  answers she kept probing. Nobody's been hostile, and only a couple of people  have said they didn't want to talk and shut the door."  </P> <P> Peters admits that there aren't any terribly controversial issues on the local  scene -- except, perhaps, "development in historically sensitive areas," on  which he has "a moderate position; I support non-intrusive development."  </P> <P> Clearly he is learning the political lingo. But instead of attacking his  opponents -- none of whom he has yet met -- he would like his candidacy to be  seen as an affirmation of youth.  </P> <P> "The community," he says "has a misconception about young people. My peers are  a lot more politically aware than they used to be. They have opinions, but they  don't feel comfortable expressing them in the field of politics where they feel  intimidated by older people.  </P> <P> "But I believe we have the potential at any age to be anything we want to be,  and I'd like to be an inspiration to people my age. At first, they thought this  was a crazy idea, but now they respect me for it. I think, for example, it's  important to have an anti-drug member on the council who is young. I'd fight  that much harder. I have a real interest in what goes on here, and the best way  to make things happen is to do them yourself. They could use somebody my age on  the council."  </P> <P> Peters says he arrived at this place pretty much by himself, without a  political mentor either at home or at school. His mother, who is German (hence  the "Gerhard") met and married his father when he was stationed with the U.S.  Army in Germany. They were divorced about 10 years ago, but Gerhard's father  lives in Costa Mesa and gets together often with his son. Gerhard's stepfather  is a Marine captain who has been in charge of recruiting activities at several  sites in this area, making it possible for his family to put down roots for the  past seven years in San Juan, where his mother is an executive secretary for a  local industry.  </P> <P> According to Peters, he didn't get involved in campus politics either at Dana  Hills High School ("the student government didn't have much to say about what  went on there") or at Saddleback College. He chose instead to put most of his  extra curricular energy into the 4-H Club, where he says he was into  "leadership and citizenship."  </P> <P> He has a hard time coming up with a political role model but finally singled  out John F. Kennedy, not so much because he believed in Kennedy's political  philosophy ("I'm rather conservative"), but because "Kennedy appealed to the  younger people." Peters reflected on that a moment, then added, "But I'm not  modeling my life after anyone."  </P> <P> He doesn't have a political organization, although he said that several of his  friends have offered help, "but I like to put myself out front." He's a little  hard to pin down on his future because it depends on whether or not he wins,  and he doesn't care to speculate on what he'll do if he doesn't win.  </P> <P> He's making it clear that he will run for only one four-year term "because if I  don't get it done in four years, it won't get done -- and besides, I don't  think politicians should get too comfortable in office." As a councilman, he  would expect to continue his education at either UC Irvine or Cal State  Fullerton, majoring in political sciences with an emphasis on international  relations.  </P> <P> The only time he showed any mild rancor was when he referred to a whimsical  comment by the current San Juan mayor -- who will be running against him --  that both his children are older than Peters. "So why don't they get involved?"  asked Peters a little testily.  </P> <P> Peters is thinking about a fund-raiser but doesn't see the need for it yet. You  see, he saved up $50 to finance his campaign and the day before I talked with  him had visited a local print shop and discovered that he could reproduce all  the single-sheet flyers he needs for $30. So his campaign fund is still  solvent.  </P> <P> He was also carrying a stack of voter registration forms, which he says he has  with him at all times in case he runs across an unregistered voter. I was  pleased to be able to tell him that I'm already registered. And I'd also be  pleased to have Gerhard Peters knock at my front door.  </P></p>

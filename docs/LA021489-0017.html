			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE DRUG CLINIC: CRACKING THE USER'S FACADE OF DENIAL  </P> <P> "Find a need and fill it" is a wise business maxim. "Figure out what people  need -- and they'll buy it." That sounds logical, but the nation's need for  alcoholism treatment went unfilled -- until relatively recently.  </P> <P> In the late 1970s I was sitting in a think tank with alcoholism treatment  marketers and TV advertising consultants. Research had shown there was  definitely a need for treatment out there. The question was: How do we fill it?  In spite of regular ads in medical journals only 5% of the patients in  alcoholism clinics were sent by doctors. The other 95% were being brought in by  the police, the courts or angry spouses.  </P> <P> "To educate doctors doesn't pay," the admen deduced. You can always tell a  doctor -- but not much. Did we clinicians have any better ideas?  </P> <P> Well, yes. Why not take alcoholism education to the people who live with the  problem?  </P> <P> Right! The ad men positively jingled. Sutton robbed banks because that's where  the money was, right? The disease is all over so let's take our TV ads directly  to the living rooms of America.  </P> <P> We know that the average family consists of 1.8 alcoholics/addicts and four  co-dependents (non-alcoholics who suffer along with them). So how's this for a  30-second ad: An introduction showing signs and symptoms, such as personality  changes and drunk-driving arrests. These things co-dependents already know.  Then add some things they only suspect, like memory loss and decreased life  span. Close the piece with hope ("treatment works") and flash the clinic logo  on the 800 number.  </P> <P> Now the admen were really getting into it -- scribbling, sketching, even  ad-libbing new terms. To rattle "heartland puritanism" and shape up "bicoastal  sophistication," let's dramatize the ads with high-pressure soap scenes. That  will crack what clinicians call "denial," the thing that doctors, co-dependents  and alcoholics/addicts hide behind.  </P> <P> It worked with almost Pavlovian charm. After running ads for one month,  America's alcoholics were hauled out of closets and dragged into clinics by  guilty co-dependents. Why? Because the ads portrayed the co-dependents as  contributing to the demise of somebody they loved -- or hated. The clinics  filled up and multiplied. The nation went on a treatment binge. There  definitely was a need and the treatment "industry" had found a way to fill it.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, there were angry objections to this invasion of America's  privacy. These ads, it was charged, were not just titillating -- they were  actually traumatizing people's emotions; the ads were exaggerating "minor"  family problems.  </P> <P> True, the ads that got the greatest response were the ones that evoked anger,  fear and guilt. But, the ad guys countered, do you really think that these ads  can scare an unhappy wife so much that she will label her errant husband an  alcoholic, drag him to a hospital, spend their hard-earned money on expensive  treatment -- and label herself a co-dependent, to boot? No, not unless there is  a real problem.  </P> <P> Why do hospitals advertise? To fill beds. Why are the ads successful? Because  there is a need. How do the ads achieve their goal? By breaking through the  viewers' denial and making them aware of their need.  </P> <P> Let's face it. Alcoholism and drug addiction are different from other diseases.  If you have a headache, rash or hearing loss, you'll feel it, or you'll see it,  or somebody will make you aware of it -- and 500,000 doctors are willing to  treat it.  </P> <P> Not so with alcoholism/addiction. That's a disease of denial: The addicts deny  it, their families hide it, the neighbors suspect it, the bosses ignore it and  the doctors mistreat it.  </P> <P> We may not like it, but we might as well accept it. The real reason the ads  work is because they tell troubled viewers what others (family, friends,  bosses, doctors) should tell them, but won't. They play on anger, fear and  guilt because that's where our soft spots are. And they invade our living rooms  because, to paraphrase bank robber Willie Sutton, that's where the alcoholics  are.  </P></p>

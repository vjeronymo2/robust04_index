			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Food and Drink: Perfect grains of eastern promise - Philippa Davenport takes a two-part look at rice and its status as a prized delicacy in Iran Patna, basmati, arborio and Japan or pudding rice are known to most of us. Real rice enthusiasts may also be familiar with carnaroli, vialone nano, Thai fragrant and the red rice of Carmague. I doubt, though, that many have tucked into ambarboo, darbari or dom siah. This last trio comes from Iran, a country where I had imagined rice to be a basic everyday food, on a par with the potato in England. Not so. Bread is Iran's starchy staple. Rice is a prized delicacy, food for the rich, for special celebrations and for serving to guests. 'It has always been cherished as the most festive of foods. At No Rooz, the Iranian new year on March 21, it is eaten by even the very poorest. Indeed, this is often the only time of year when the villagers of the high central plateau will dine on rice.' So I was told by Margaret Shaida, a journalist and historian born in Oxfordshire, who married an Iranian and lived in her husband's homeland for 25 years. Shaida's interest in the food and cookery of Iran, gleaned at first from her in-laws and subsequently from her own considerable research, grew so passionate that she eventually wrote and published The Legendary Cuisine of Persia. A jewel of a book, rich in history and heady with aromatic perfumes, it won her a Glenfiddich food book award and is shortly to be published in paperback. Shaida told me how she had been inducted into the rituals of choosing and buying rice by her mother-in-law. At the end of holidays spent in the relative cool of the Caspian coast, where most of Iran's rice is grown, the two women went to call on the family's rice merchant. After initial formalities and refreshments, hands were dipped deep into sacks and the grain withdrawn was examined. A starchy smell indicates age, she was taught. The grains gradually become drier, more dusty and brittle. The tapering points may break off. Rice remains good for up to two years after harvest, then it deteriorates. Back at home her mother-in-law would test a batch from each sack to ascertain the soaking and cooking times needed. Salt was added to the sacks to reduce the risk of attack from mice or weevils in storage, and broken grains were sifted out, their imperfection marking them down as suitable only for soup-making. Practically all the rice grown in Iran is consumed there. Darbari, produced solely on the Shah's plantations, probably does not exist any more, says Shaida. Ambarboo, the long pointed grains of which possess the fragrance of amber, is another exclusive estate-grown rice and very expensive. A little dom siah is occasionally exported. Snap it up if it is fresh, Shaida advises. Otherwise, for Iranian cookery she recommends good basmati rice such as that sold under the Tilda label. Perhaps it is precisely because rice is not a staple, but food for special occasions, that so much care is taken in Iran over choosing cooking and presenting it. Most of us grab, unquestioningly, any old packet from the deli or supermarket shelf. And we tend to rely on the absorption cooking method, either dropping rice into double its volume of boiling liquid, or stirring in the liquid gradually for risotto or paella. The Iranian way is more painstaking and involves several steps. The rice is washed and soaked at length in salted water. Then it is parboiled, drained gently, transferred to a well-oiled container and steamed to perfect tenderness. There are two main forms of presentation. The rice may be served in a mound of free-flowing grains surrounded by pieces of tahdeeg (the crust from the bottom of the pan, regarded as the ultimate proof of a cook's ability to cook rice well). Or the rice may be steamed not in a saucepan on top of the stove but in a mould in the oven. In this case it is baked until crusted with gold all over, then turned out for serving. Iranian rice dishes are nearly always composite, in other words the grain is laced or layered with other ingredients. What is remarkable is that the individual character of each component remains distinct - each beautifully foiled by the other(s), not reduced to a blurry blend. As befits festive food, finishing touches are sometimes extravagant: the rice may be garnished with jewel-bright fruits, choice nuts, saffron or spun sugar. Shaida cooked one rice dish of each sort for me to sample. Both were exquisite, simultaneously simple and sophisticated. First there was a mound of rice with lentils, a leaden sounding combination if ever I heard one. In practice it was delicate and lovely  - a revelation. The lentils were judiciously few. Grey-green tinged with pink, scattered through the rice, they tasted mealy and peppery, while each grain of the white, fragrant rice tasted of itself. The dish was decorated with a trickle of brilliant yellow saffron rice, a ladleful of the freshly steamed grain being stirred into a few spoonfuls of intense tincture of saffron. Quite different from European saffron rice dishes, in which the whole potful is irrevocably flavoured and stained with the spice, here the aroma and flavour of plain white and saffron grains could be enjoyed jointly and separately. Side dishes included sticky dates and a bowl of fried onions unlike any I had ever eaten. They were the colour of mahogany, sweetly caramelised, rustling like autumn leaves and incredibly digestible. Many variations on this splendid polow are given in Shaida's book including one made with almonds, pistachios and pinenuts, said to be a traditional favourite of pearl divers, and another rife with fresh herbs (three parts of herbs to four parts of rice) with which to celebrate spring. The second dish Shaida cooked for me - an elegantly striped and moulded rice recipe - is equally delicious but since it is fairly lengthy I will give the details next week. The Legendary Cuisine of Persia by Margaret Shaida is due to be published by Penguin (Pounds 12) on November 3. A good selection of Iranian produce is available from Super Bahar, 349A Kensington High Street, London W8.</p>

			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / International Company News: Philip Morris falls 22% as cigarette profits slump PHILIP Morris, the US food and tobacco group, yesterday announced a 22 per cent drop in second-quarter net earnings as its US cigarette profits slumped following April's sharp cut in the price of its Marlboro brand. Net earnings were Dollars 1.1bn, or Dollars 1.20 a share, down from Dollars 1.35bn, or Dollars 1.48, in the same period of last year on revenues which rose 4.2 per cent to Dollars 15.79bn. Mr Michael Miles, chairman, said that the group's consumer businesses other than US tobacco were continuing to enjoy solid profits group, up 13.3 per cent for the quarter. The company's announcement on April 2 that it would not make any US premium brand cigarette price increases, and was cutting the price of Marlboro, led to a reduction in wholesale inventories. This meant a 21.5 per cent decline in second-quarter US cigarette volume to 47.5bn units. Philip Morris said that primarily due to this reduced volume, and increased marketing expenses associated with the price cuts, second-quarter operating income for domestic tobacco was down 53.1 per cent at Dollars 684m. However, market share growth in the premium segment and in discount sales meant Philip Morris's retail share of the US tobacco market reached a record 43.6 per cent in the quarter. The pricing strategy for premium products, and improved prices on discount products, 'allow for future profits growth off the newly established base,' the company said. International tobacco operations saw operating income rise 15.6 per cent to Dollars 577m on revenues 25 per cent ahead at Dollars 4bn. Marlboro's international sales volume rose 2.2 per cent to 58.7bn units. North American food operations had operating income 9.9 per cent higher at Dollars 667m, while revenues rose 1.6 per cent to Dollars 5.4bn. International food produced income of Dollars 269m, up 13 per cent, on revenues 19.9 per cent ahead at Dollars 2.5bn, due primarily to acquisitions and growth in confectionery, partly offset by currency movements. Its Miller brewing company made Dollars 140m, up 21.7 per cent, on revenues 1.1 per cent higher at Dollars 1.2bn. For the half year, the group reported net earnings of Dollars 2.27bn, or Dollars 2.58, compared with Dollars 2.45bn, or Dollars 2.68, in 1992.</p>

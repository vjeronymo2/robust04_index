			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Putting a premium on cost-cutting and consolidation: Patrick Harverson examines two US insurance deals Although the troubled US property and casualty insurance business is still a long way from recovery, industry analysts are hailing two deals this week - the Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 670m) acquisition of Continental Corporation by CNA Financial and the Dollars 420m rescue of Swedish-controlled Home Holdings by a group of US investors - as important steps in the right direction. The industry is plagued by: over-capacity which has led to intense price competition, rising claims from natural catastrophes such as earthquakes and hurricanes, increasing pressure from regulators and ratings agencies to acknowledge longstanding asbestos and pollution losses, and declining capital among several big companies. As a result, insurers have reported sharply lower earnings or losses on their property-casualty businesses, and the poor results have prompted the ratings agencies to downgrade the debt of several leading companies (including, in recent weeks, Cigna, Aetna, Continental and Home Holdings). The downgrades only exacerbate the industry's woes, because insurance agents and brokers tend to shy away from lower-rated companies. In spite of this gloomy scenario, analysts say some of the the property-casualty industry's worst problems can be solved by cost-cutting and consolidation. Hence, the acclaim on Wall Street for Tuesday's announcement that CNA will be acquiring its troubled rival Continental - a deal which should enable the two companies to realise considerable economies of scale. Ms Anna Iacucci, insurance analyst at the ratings agency Moody's, says the CNA-Continental merger is a welcome consolidation within the industry. 'We have seen companies buying books of business or buying smaller companies . . . but this is the largest yet.' The merger will create the seventh largest insurance company and the third biggest property-casualty group in the US, with combined assets of Dollars 58bn and revenues of Dollars 16bn. Although some observers expressed surprise that CNA - which has earned a reputation as one of the most conservatively run of US insurers under the ownership of the New York-based Tisch family - was buying a company plagued with losses, a capital shortage and doubts about the adequacy of its reserves, most said the deal made sense. CNA will pay Dollars 20 a share in cash for Continental, a hefty premium over the pre-bid price of Dollars 14, but well below the insurer's Dollars 24.75 book value. Aside from the Dollars 1.1bn it will spend on acquiring Continental, CNA will also have to invest Dollars 275m which had been pledged by the investment group Insurance Partners in an earlier refinancing. CNA plans to finance the acquisition either with long-term debt, or some combination of debt and equity. The immediate task is to wring as many cost savings possible out of the merger. The combined operations employ 21,000 people, and big job cuts are likely. Similarly, there will be considerable early gains to be achieved from merging back-office operations and systems. Benefits should emerge from combining CNA and Continental's complimentary product lines, most notably in personal insurance (particularly motor and home policies), commercial insurance and specialty insurance (especially marine and professional liability). It is vital for CNA to achieve all potential cost savings because of fierce competition. Ms Iacucci says: 'Both companies are competing in lines of business that face commodity-type pricing.' Some analysts believe the main impact of the merger will not be on pricing, but on the approach of other insurers to cost cuts. Mr Alan Levin of Standard &amp; Poor's believes that while the merger 'will probably reduce the potential for a tightening of rates, because CNA is saying it will restructure itself to live in a world where rate competition is very high', it will also 'put significant pressure on their competitors, who will need to find ways to reduce their own cost bases.' Although the rising claims, falling prices and inadequate capital that forced Continental into CNA's arms are the same problems that persuaded a group of US investors to bail out Home Holdings this week, the motivations behind the two deals are different. As Mr Levin points out: 'CNA is a classic strategic investor. Jack Byrne and his group are classic financial investors. They believe they have uncovered a diamond in the rough and therefore they're buying at value. CNA is buying a company which it hopes to restructure fundamentally.' Under the deal between Mr Byrne and Home's current majority owner, the Swedish insurer Trygg-Hansa, the US investor group will inject Dollars 420m into Home in return for ultimately taking control. The deal is regarded as a much bigger gamble than CNA's purchase of Continental, because Home has some of the largest exposures to environmental losses.</p>

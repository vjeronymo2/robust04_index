			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Hypo-Bank surges to DM1.5bn THE BAYERISCHE Hypothe-ken-und Wechsel-Bank, one of Germany's two large Bavaria-based banks, yesterday became the third of Germany's 'big five' banks to announce a large leap in 1992 profits. Group partial operating profits - which exclude a contribution from own-account trading - rose by 21.2 per cent to DM1.5bn (Dollars 920m) over the year. Total operating profits, including DM89.2m earnings in own-account trading, were up 16.3 per cent to DM1.6bn. The Bayerische Vereinsbank, the other large Bavarian bank, last week announced a 24 per cent increase in 1992 partial operating profits to DM1.48bn, and on Monday the Commerzbank, Germany's third-biggest bank, reported a 53 per cent surge in group net profits. The headline profits figures do not reflect a sharp deterioration in credit risks in the last few months of 1991. Hypo-Bank said it was increasing its provisions for bad and doubtful debts by 48 per cent, from DM620m in 1991 to DM917.4m. Earlier this week, the Bayerische Vereinsbank increased its provisions against domestic commercial debt by 38 per cent to DM860m. Commerzbank said it would be making substantial provisions against bad and doubtful debts, details of which will be released on Friday. Dresdner Bank and Deutsche Bank, Germany's two biggest banks, report next week. Mr Eberhard Martini, Hypo-Bank's chief executive, said there had been a 'healthy single-digit percentage rise' in general banking and mortgage banking in the first two months of the year.</p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Arts: Young soloists take centre stage - Weekend recitals There were notable recitals by two young artists this past weekend, but of different orders. At the Barbican on Sunday afternoon we had the phenomenal Siberian-Israeli violinist Maxim Vengerov, aged nineteen-and-a-half years. At the Wigmore Hall the night before, the pianist Peter Jablonski - three years older - was the latest 'Outstanding Young Artist' in the Marks &amp; Spencer series. Jablonski was fluent, finely sensitive, technically well-schooled and full of maturing promise. Vengerov, however, is something extraordinary, so preternaturally 'natural' a violinist as to compel rapt attention and awe as well as delight. As is his wont, he chose an eminently serious programme, leaving spectacular feats for the Wieniawski Polonaise at the end and for his encores - just two Kreislers and a sort of frantic galop by Bazzini, all dazzlingly brilliant. (At the Wigmore last March, he spun off showpiece encores for some 40 minutes.) Vengerov is a glorious champion of such old-fashioned stuff, as you would expect of a Compleat Violinist like him. Almost invariably it was composed by master-performers, who knew better than anybody how to exploit the possibilities of the instrument to the limit. He does them full honour. In classical works he exercises respectful self-restraint. Here, he began with Mozart's K. 305 Sonata in A, in which the piano almost shades the violin, and then proceeded to old Brahms's lovely, vernal Sonata in G. Though Vengerov is fortunate in his current piano partner - Itamar Golan, no mere accompanist but an imaginative virtuoso in his own right - it took them most of the recital to find a just balance in the Barbican acoustic. In the Mozart, designed for a much lighter 'harpsichord or fortepiano', and sometimes in Brahms too, the piano overweighed the violin. After the interval, when perhaps somebody had warned them, Golan was self-effacing to a fault in Prokofiev's visionary F minor Sonata, black and brooding. Little harm was done, for Vengerov pursues a musical line with such full-hearted intensity, always smoothly controlled but speaking volumes, that one has to listen like the Ancient Mariner's guest. He thinks in very long paragraphs, not just phrases. In fact his seamlessly articulate legato in Brahms risked leaving too few breathing-spaces for comfort - but while it went on, nobody could conceivably complain. Until he let his hair down for his sensational Wieniawski and the encores, it was the Prokofiev that displayed Vengerov's superb gifts at fullest stretch. Jablonski too was at his best in Prokofiev, the angry, nervy Seventh Sonata; it was impressively taut and searching, if without the ultimate degree of scathing force. Similarly, the first and last pieces of Debussy's Book I Images built admirably toward climaxes which proved rather mild when they arrived - like Liszt's fustian 'St. Francis Walking on the Water', too loosely aqueous (and too foxed by finger-slips). In four Scarlatti sonatas Jablonski offered less fantasy and less vital 'ping' than Leon McCawley two weeks ago, but a subtler, more delicate sound-palette. His F minor sonata K466 was beautifully imagined, a transparent dream of melancholy.</p>

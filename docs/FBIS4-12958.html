			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the Yemeni </F> Presidential Council and assistant secretary general of the YSP,  by Taghrid Sa'adah; place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [Sa'adah] What is the first item on your  agenda during your visit to Jordan? Do you have new proposals,  especially after the failure of the Salalah meeting?    [Muhammad] Our visit to Jordan is meant to meet with His  Majesty King Husayn to brief him on the latest developments in  the Yemeni arena. We also want Jordan to continue its role in  the military committees and in the dialogue with the political  leaders, since Jordan hosted a Yemeni meeting and helped to  endorse the accord document in Amman in the presence of all  Yemeni parties. This obliges Yemen to brief Jordan's king,  government, and people on these developments. The visit is also  part of the Arab tour we have made, particularly after the  Salalah meeting between the president and his deputy. [passage  omitted]    [Sa'adah] The Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] is making shuttle  tours to Arab capitals. For what purpose and what proposals do  you have?    [Muhammad] Any party that achieves unity cannot be seeking  disunity once again. However, we are now facing a process in  which unity and democracy are being buried through the  annexation, and ending the existing status, of southeastern  regions. The YSP is therefore concerned with rectifying the  domestic and foreign situation of the unity state. The YSP's  contacts with its brothers and friends abroad is meant to ensure  that Yemen will continue to play its natural role, along with  its Arab brothers and friends abroad, away from the atmosphere  of domestic problems and the results of the Gulf war. This is  as far as its responsibility as a partner in government is  concerned. As for its responsibility as a party, the YSP is  still responsible for part of the Yemeni homeland. The YSP has  domestic and foreign contacts and no one can deny or bar this.  This is a right for others as well -- the General People's  Congress, the Yemeni Reform Grouping, and others. They all  travel on visits and have contacts. The tour of 'Ali Salim  al-Bid adopted a specific formula. We are for national dialogue  and the document which met 70 percent of our demands. We did  not propose any view in our tour. However, we had in mind the  military developments in Yemen, outlined in a report by the  joint Jordanian-Omani military committee which also proposed  solutions to this crisis, as well as the fact that we know and  others know that the other parties do not want to, and cannot,  implement the accord document. Therefore, we are only asking  the Arab brothers to contribute toward solving this problem,  since we are part of this nation. [passage omitted]    [Sa'adah] Why did 'Ali Salim al-Bid visit Saudi Arabia after  signing the document in Amman?    [Muhammad] The visit was meant to explain the YSP's position  to Saudi officials, after the other party had foiled the Amman  meeting and after it had exploded the military situation in  Abyan, in cooperation with the Islamic Jihad group. This was  also after we made sure that the other party does not want to  implement the accord, considering the conditions he set when he  signed it. This prompted us to explain our position to besiege  any military adventure that any party could think of. Yemeni  stability is part of the stability of this region. Our region  is rich in resources and the world cares about these resources.  What happened during the Gulf war confirms this fact and that  any party that disrupts security and stability will not be  allowed to do that. [passage omitted]    [Sa'adah] It is being said now that oil is one of the  reasons for the current crisis and that it is behind your desire  to establish a federation. President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih said  that you are seeking to be an oil country. What is your comment?    [Muhammad] Oil was a catalyst for unity in the first place  because it existed before the unity. Our regions contain oil  and we know how much they contain. Therefore, we expedited our  efforts for unity. However, the way some people think indicates  they had contemplated annexing the southern regions on this  basis.</p>

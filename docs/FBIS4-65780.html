			<p>BFN     [Text] Athens today lodged a harsh demarche with the  Albanian Government on the continuing detention of the six  leading members of the Greek minority organization Omonoia as  well as on the unfounded and provocative accusations against  Greece. Our correspondent Foivos Karzis reports:    [Begin recording] [Karzis] The Greek demarche was extremely  strong and concerned not only the continuing detention of the  six Omonoia leading members but also the new attempt to involve  Greece in activities within Albania. Two of the accusations  leveled against the six people concerned cooperating with the  Greek secret services and conspiring to separate Albanian  territory. Acting on instructions from Foreign Minister Karolos  Papoulias, Ambassador Petros Angelakis, head of the Albanian  Affairs Department at the Foreign Ministry, summoned the  Albanian ambassador in Athens to express Greece's strong concern  and protest over these actions. Angelakis pointed out to him  that such actions weaken the Athens- Tirana relations. A short  time ago, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Konstandinos Bikas pointed  out that Tirana's options do not lead to defusing the crisis.    [Bikas] The Albanian Government has to realize that with the  aforementioned actions it follows a slippery road which exposes  it to the appropriate international organizations and does not  render trustworthy its efforts to restore the democratic lawful  order and the rule of law in the country, nor is it possible for  Albania to convince anybody that it respects its international  obligations.    [Karzis] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos had  earlier reiterated the warning to Tirana.    [Venizelos] Greece has depended and continues to depend on  the improvement of Greek-Albanian relations. Greece pursues the  respect for the rights of the Greeks in Albania and the Albanian  Government knows this very well.    [Karzis] Official opposition leader Miltiadhis Evert  approved of Greece's intervention to suspend the EU [Economic  Union] grant to Albania while Nikolaos Konstandopoulos, chairman  of the Coalition of the Left and of the Progress Party, called  for mobilization at all international forums.    [Evert] It is a most positive step and proves that when all  the parties get together and follow a decisive policy, a  coordinated policy, we can really achieve much more.    [Konstandopoulos] I believe that in order to defend the  Greek minority rights there should be a decisive, cool  mobilization by Greece at all the international organizations.  [end recording]</p>

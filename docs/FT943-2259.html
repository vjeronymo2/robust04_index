			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee futures touch fresh 8 1/2 -year highs Coffee futures in London briefly burst through their recent 8 1/2 -year high yesterday morning as continued drought in Brazil and signs of falling consumer stocks raised fresh concern about supply shortages. The November contract rose to Dollars 4,089 a tonne, just above the peak of Dollars 4,085 reached during the trading day following the second severe frost in Brazil in early July. These levels are the highest the market has seen since January 1986. The position held comfortably above Dollars 4,000 for the rest of the day, closing up Dollars 107 at Dollars 4,039 a tonne. Mr Robert MacArthur, head of the Tropical Trader Group at Merrill Lynch in London, said the dry weather had now lasted as long as the serious drought in the mid-1980s. Coming on top of the two frosts, the persistent dry spell was adding to fears about the likely shortfall in next year's crop from Brazil, the world's largest producer. In addition, Colombia had suffered a smaller harvest this year and would have to draw down its internal stocks to meet domestic demand, while US stocks were dwindling. 'The market's done very well in fair volume,' he said. 'It looks as if the trend is still for higher prices as we move into the winter period.' London was buoyed by a strong performance by arabica futures in New York to match that of Friday. In early trading, New York was up nearly 9 cents. By the afternoon, the December contract was 4.95 cents higher at 226.75 cents a pound.</p>

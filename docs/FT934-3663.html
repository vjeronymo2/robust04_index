			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Schools face crackdown on teaching hours Schools in England and Wales will have to publish details of the number of hours spent teaching each day, after the first annual report of Ofsted, the school inspection service, called for an urgent inquiry into the length of the school day. The Department for Education made clear that it was planning action on the length of school days after a 20 per cent variation in the total time schools spend teaching was revealed. Mr John Patten, education secretary, said the variation was 'unacceptably wide'. He added: 'Parents must wonder how one school can offer up to a day a week more teaching than another, and what effect this has. I certainly do.' The report said bullying was a problem in every school inspected, and found 'an urgent need for improvement of educational management and leadership, especially in matching resources to priorities'. Mr John Major, the prime minister, announced the plan to add more information to the league tables published on schools each year. Professor Stewart Sutherland, chief inspector of schools, said the variation, from more than 25 hours tuition each week to less than 20 hours, was equivalent to a whole year's extra teaching at some schools over five years. Teachers' unions reacted with alarm. Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the NASUWT union, said the report was an 'implicit suggestion that the school day should be lengthened'. It would meet 'outright opposition from teachers faced with increased workload and a possible pay freeze'. The report found that in all schools most lessons were at least satisfactory. However, 30 per cent of lessons for children between eight and 11 were unsatisfactory while only 15 per cent of classes for post-16-year-olds were unsatisfactory. Ofsted added that there was a 'stubborn percentage of unsatisfactory teaching' and a 'small proportion' which was 'downright poor'. Good teaching standards had a 'direct correlation' with successful academic results, but there was evidence that poor teaching was concentrated in inner cities. Prof Sutherland said: 'Sadly, the incidence of such teaching is often greater in schools serving pupils and parents in urban areas with high levels of social and economic disadvantage. We cannot be satisfied until we record improvements for all children, regardless of back-ground.' Ofsted is also to start a full investigation of the sharp drop in popularity of mathematics and science courses compared with arts subjects. Prof Sutherland said: 'There is no doubt about the trend - the overall number of students taking A-levels is increasing while the proportion taking science and mathematics is declining.' He said there was a growing trend for teachers to have to teach areas of science and mathematics with which they were not familiar, but would not speculate further on the reasons behind the trend.</p>

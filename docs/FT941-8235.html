			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Company News (This Week): Lean years end for composite insurers - Other Companies Three UK composite insurers reporting results for 1993 this week are expected to be comfortably back in the black, after three years of difficult trading conditions. Guardian Royal Exchange starts the ball rolling tomorrow with its pre-tax profits expected to be between Pounds 135m and Pounds 170m, before investment gains are brought into the picture. That compares with comparable profits of Pounds 3m in 1992. Commercial Union, the most successful of the UK composites in recent years, is expected to post profits of between Pounds 179m and Pounds 213m when it reports on Wednesday compared with Pounds 24m last time. Finally on Thursday Royal Insurance is expected to register profits of between Pounds 120m and Pounds 160m against a Pounds 27m loss in 1992.</p>

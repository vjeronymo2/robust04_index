			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Rolls-Royce wins Dollars 20m order from Hungary - FT reporters on projects unveiled yesterday at the Farnborough Air Show Rolls-Royce has won a Dollars 20m order from the Hungarian airline Malev for Tay engines to power four Fokker 70 passenger jets, writes Our Foreign Staff. Fokker has announced that three of the aircraft are being leased from American International Group's International Lease Finance Corporation and the fourth is being bought from Fokker. Fokker said the order, for delivery between autumn 1995 and spring 1996, brings total orders for the new twin-engined aircraft to 33. Fokker chairman Mr Ben van Schaik said at the show more orders were on the way for the aircraft, which is due to be delivered to its first customers this October. Anglo-German aero-engine maker BMW Rolls-Royce has awarded a contract to RoSEC, a joint venture between Rolls-Royce and Smiths Industries, to design and manufacture the digital engine control system for the BR715 engine. It said the deal could eventually be worth Dollars 75m. BMW Rolls-Royce is 50 per cent owned by Bayerische Motoren-Werke. Aerospatiale sales for the first half of 1994 have fallen 3 per cent compared with the same period in 1993, chairman Mr Louis Gallois said. Mr Gallois said first half orders were weak, particularly for helicopters and civil aircraft, and Aerospatiale needed to continue efforts to cut costs.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Application to Foreign Entities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the Proposing Release, the Commission discussed the application of the proposed rule to foreign entities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 76 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission was, and continues to be, concerned that excluding foreign entities and persons would leave domestic markets and exchanges at a competitive disadvantage relative to foreign markets and exchanges. Moreover, the Commission is concerned that the exclusion of foreign intermediaries ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> broker-dealers and banks) that maintain omnibus accounts with domestic broker-dealers would competitively disadvantage domestic intermediaries that perform omnibus trade execution or custodial functions for large traders. The Commission believes that the preservation of a fair competitive environment is fundamental to the accomplishment of the purposes of the Market Reform Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 76 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  See Proposing Release, 56 FR 42558, at text accompanying nn. 105&hyph;109.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission solicited comments from foreign and domestic market participants and foreign regulatory agencies regarding the application of the proposed rule and, specifically, alternative means for filing Form 13H, maintaining Form 13H information, and assigning LTIDs. The Commission received 15 comments from foreign entities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 77 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  These commenters questioned the extent to which the proposed rule would apply and asserted that compliance with the proposed rule may cause breaches of certain local confidentiality requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 77 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Of these 15 comments, 12 were submitted by regulatory organizations or industry associations, including; the Ambassador of France, London Stock Exchange, British Department of Trade and Industry, German Ministry of Finance, Association of German Banks, British Merchant Banking and Securities House Association, Delegation of the Commission of the European Communities, Institutional Fund Managers Association, Institute of International Bankers, Swiss Bankers Association, Hong Kong Association of Banks, and Thesaurier-Generaal of the Netherlands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many of these commenters generally asserted, without explanation, that the application of the proposed rule was unacceptable. A few of the commenters acknowledged the existence of memoranda of understanding (``MOUs''), however, none offered specific ideas or sought further discussions regarding alternatives or the development of ``MOU-type'' understandings. It should be noted that, in an enforcement context, the Commission would continue to obtain information from foreign regulatory authorities pursuant to existing MOU protocols.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed above, the application and scope of the reproposed rule would be established by the definition of a large trader, which closely tracks Section 13(h)(8)(A) of the Exchange Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 78 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission also notes that foreign broker-dealers would not be subject to recordkeeping or transaction reporting requirements of the reproposed rule. Accordingly, only foreign entities that are large traders would be subject to the reproposed rule. The duties and burdens imposed on all large traders include: (1) Filing Form 13H; (2) disclosing large trader status; (3) providing other information about accounts and reported transactions; and (4) if the foreign large trader maintains or controls transactions in an omnibus account carried by a registered broker-dealer, and the duty to assure compliance with the identification and disaggregation requirements of the reproposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 78 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  15 U.S.C. 78m(h)(8)(A) (1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A foreign entity or person would be a large trader, thus subject to the reproposed rule, only if the following four elements are present: (1) A person owns or controls an account or aggregated accounts; (2) such person effects aggregate transactions in publicly traded securities that reach the identifying activity level; (3) such transactions are effected directly or indirectly by or through accounts maintained by a registered broker-dealer; and (4) such transactions are effected by use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails or any facility of a national securities exchange.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The various combinations of these elements are too numerous to discuss at length. However, the bounds of the application of the reproposed rule may be explored through the analysis of two typical examples of securities activity that may be referred to as ``foreign activity.'' First, assume that a foreign bank maintains an omnibus account with a domestic registered broker-dealer. Through this omnibus account, the foreign bank effects trades in publicly traded securities on a national securities exchange for its foreign customers ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> citizens of, or persons domiciled in, a foreign country) that reach the identifying activity level. In this case, the foreign bank would be a custodian or nominee large trader and would be required to: (1) File Form 13H and Schedules 7b and/or 8; (2) disclose its LTID and all such accounts to the registered broker-dealers carrying such accounts; (3) assure compliance with the disaggregation and identification requirements as well as the accuracy of Schedules 7b or 8; and (4) if requested, disaggregate accounts or transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, the foreign bank large trader would not be required to disclose on its Form 13H the non-large trader foreign customers whose trades are effected through its omnibus accounts. However, the reproposed rules would require the foreign bank large trader to assure that the information contained on Schedules 7b and 8 is accurate and complete. Accordingly, the foreign bank large trader would be required to disclose to the Commission the LTID or IID System numbers of its identified large trader customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, if the foreign bank large trader effects transactions through such omnibus accounts for one of its customers and such transactions reach the identifying activity level, then in order to assure compliance with the disaggregation and identification requirements of the reproposed rule, the foreign bank large trader would have a duty to advise such foreign customer of its duty to file Form 13H and disclose its status in accordance with the reproposed rule. This duty would apply to the foreign bank large trader whether the customer's transactions were effected on a discretionary or non-discretionary basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For a second example, assume that a registered broker-dealer carries the account of a domestic or foreign customer, and it effects a program trade in publicly traded securities in a foreign over-the-counter market or exchange. In order to effect the trade, the registered broker-dealer transmits the order information by facsimile to a foreign broker-dealer affiliate. Further, assume that the affiliated foreign broker-dealer effects the transaction for an omnibus account which it carries in the name of the domestic broker-dealer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This activity would cause the foreign or domestic customer to be a large trader because it owned accounts, had effected the requisite trades indirectly through an account maintained by a registered broker-dealer, and through the means or instrumentality of interstate commerce.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternatively, if the foreign broker-dealer exercised control over the transaction then it also would be a large trader because it would have controlled accounts and effected the requisite trades by or through an account carried by a registered broker-dealer. Conversely, neither the customer or foreign broker-dealer would be large traders if the trade was effected exclusively by or for an account owned or controlled by the foreign or domestic customer and carried by the foreign broker-dealer, because the transaction would not be effected directly or indirectly by or for an account carried by a registered broker-dealer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed above, the identification requirements would significantly clarify and narrow the scope of the reproposed rule and, thereby, reduce the associated burdens on all large traders. Accordingly, the Commission believes that the burdens imposed on foreign large traders are necessary and appropriate, not unduly burdensome, and are imposed uniformly on domestic and foreign markets, exchanges, intermediaries, and investors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

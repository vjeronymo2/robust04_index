			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> A CREATIVE GARDONY AT GRAND STREET BAR  </P> <P> Laszlo Gardony has the look of a mad scientist -- a shock of wild, unruly hair;  round, overmagnified spectacles; a rumpled shirt, and an arms-akimbo  interaction with the piano. But he sure can play.  </P> <P> Friday night at the Grand Street Bar in his first Los Angeles appearance, the  Hungarian jazz musician made the most of somewhat less-than-perfect  circumstances. Working with a new bassist, Mary Ann McSweeney, in a room filled  with TGIF revelers, Gardony stuck to his guns and played a set of attractive  original material from his new Antilles Records release.  </P> <P> The decision may not have delighted the noisemakers who only wanted to hear  background music, but it was a wise creative choice. Most of Gardony's pieces  had a distinctly atmospheric quality -- not quite Impressionistic, but strongly  suggestive of cinematiclike images. Many were based on percussive ostinato  chording juxtaposed against rapid-fire melodic curlicues.  </P> <P> On the few occasions when Gardony whipped out a pure jazz improvisation -- "Elf  Dance" was a good example -- he demonstrated strong mainstream jazz skills.  Pieces such as "Sunrise" and the rhapsodic "Anne's Dream" underscored his  classical training. After six years of living in the United States, mostly in  the Boston area, he clearly has found an equitable balance between his academic  background and the street rhythms of America.  </P> <P> Despite her relative unfamiliarity with the music, McSweeney played a strong  supportive role. Her brief solo moments on "The Legend of Tsumi" -- sliding up  and down a modal scale -- provided the perfect counter to Gardony's bombastic  chording. The other member of the trio, San Francisco drummer Ken Wollesen,  contrasted sturdy time-keeping with an unusual array of percussive zips,  creaks, squeaks and rattles. DON HECKMAN  </P></p>

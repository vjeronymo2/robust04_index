			<p>BFN     [Text] In a talk with Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation  correspondents Dhimitrios Andreou and Konstandinos Yennaris,  U.S. Ambassador Richard Boucher said the United States is ready  to study alternative approaches to the Cyprus issue, but he does  not believe that the effort to promote the confidence-building  measures [CBM's] has failed.    [Begin recording] [Andreou] The U.S. ambassador had not yet  been briefed on the talks in Vienna, so he refrained from  evaluating their progress. He reiterated that the United States  and the United Nations will make every effort to reach an  agreement on the CBM's. Commenting on a remark that there is an  impression that everything is limited to these efforts, the U.S.  ambassador said he is not in a position to say whether more  could be done. He said: We are applying a great deal of  pressure. If this effort fails, other ways will be considered.  If there is a way to implement the measures, we will try to  find it.    [Addressing Boucher] Are you ready to consider alternative  ways and even measures under Chapter 7 of the UN Security  Council? [not further specified]    [Boucher] We are ready to consider alternate ways. I think  it would be immature for me at this point to start addressing  what those will be. The effort has not yet failed.    [Yennaris] Are there any other ideas floating around, other  alternatives?    [Boucher] There are all kinds of ideas floating around but  we  have not settled on any of them.    [Andreou] Referring to the Vienna talks, Boucher said we are  not seeking ways to prolong the talks but ways to reach an  agreement. He added that every negotiation has a point at which  you either reach an agreement or turn somewhere else. He  concluded: Until then, we will continue trying.    [Yennaris] What is the specific aim of the exercise in  Vienna?    [Boucher] The effort in Vienna is -- even while the report  on  the last few months of negotiations is being discussed -- to try  to make sure that we have explored every possible avenue for  reaching an agreement on the basis of the UN proposal.

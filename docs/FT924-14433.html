			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: Bottomley pledge on NHS funds THE GOVERNMENT will honour its manifesto pledge to make annual increases in real National Health Service spending, in spite of the pressure being brought to bear on departmental budgets, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said yesterday. She also told representatives that a further 128 hospitals and community health services would be joining the ranks of NHS trusts from next April, bringing to two thirds the proportion of such care that will be provided by the trust regime. A total of 150 hospitals had applied to join the third wave of NHS trusts altogether, she said. Speaking after her enthusiastically received conference address, Mrs Bottomley told reporters that she 'stood by' the manifesto commitment to 'year by year increase the level of real resources committed to the NHS'. Although they will surprise many in the light of indications that the Treasury may want to lower further the Pounds 244.5bn public-spending total agreed for 1993-94, her comments do not rule out cash reductions in the health budget, which was slated to rise by more than 6 per cent - or well in excess of the rate of inflation. Next April, local authorities will become responsible for co-ordinating a policy to help elderly and handicapped people to remain in the community, receiving Pounds 539m in community care grants in the first year. Announcing that the patients' charter was to be extended to cover primary care and 'unacceptable' outpatient waiting times, she also laid out a blueprint for a new 'quality initiative' intended to disseminate best practice.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Opposition Bids for Watchdog </F> Commitees, as Government Parties Divide House Committee  Chairmanships"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 19 -- The opposition Progressive  Alliance, headed by the Democratic Party of the Left, and the  former Christian Democrats of the People's Party are working to  secure the chairs of the so-called watchdog committees and  panels, while the government parties move to take the chairs of  the thirteen House regular committees.    The bid by the opposition to chair the bicameral commission  on the national broadcasting corporation RAI and the anti-Mafia  commission, as well as the panels on elections and parliamentary  immunity, received a boost here on Thursday [19 May] when House  whips postponed any decision on the matter until next week.    Speaking to the press after today's meeting, Forza Italia  whip Raffaele Della Valle said "We are open to the possibility  that some watchdog commissions could go to the opposition and  now think it necessary to consult with our representatives in  the Senate and then, eventually, even with members of the  opposition."    "Before defining the make-up of the panels" added Raffaele  Valensise, of the National Alliance, "we must see what those in  the Senate think and try to hammer out a common platform."    People's Party whip Beniamino Andreatta said before today's  meeting that the RAI and anti-Mafia should go to the opposition  "because this is how it is done in all majority democracies  where the opposition is recognized the role of control." The  People's Party whip went on to agree that the powers of the  majority should be reinforced but that this should correspond  with the reinforcement of the opposition powers of control.  "The bottom line is this: the RAI and anti-Mafia commissions  should go to members of the opposition. There is the problem of  credibility.... There are some things which give rise to  suspicion and great concern for the future. No majority  democratic country exists where the majority crowds the control  commissions."    Andreatta, however, was of a different mood coming out of  the  meeting which he told the press has "produced results." The  People's Party whip went on to say how discussion did not focus  on details but on questions of principal. "We are talking about  organizing a majority democracy, the principal of democracy  cannot be winner-take-all. There exists" Andreatta added, "a  criteria of reason, of separate roles in parliament, in the  institutions, the possibility that each performs their task."    Similar views were expressed by Luigi Berlinguer, the  Progressive whip, who argued "In the absence of precise rules,  we ask that there be a global discussion on who should chair the  control commissions, which by logic should go to the  opposition." Berlinguer went on to add how the government  coalition had made no promises, but that "the outcome  (postponement) of the meeting was a sign that discussion is  open."    Meanwhile, in related developments, the government coalition  appeared geared to take all the chairs of the regular thirteen  House committees, with five going to Northern League, four to  Forza Italia, three to the National Alliance and one to the  Christian Democratic Center.    The National Alliance appeared in line to chair the  committees for constitutional affairs, foreign affairs and  financial affairs with their candidates Gustavo Selva, Mirko  Tremaglia and Paolo Agostinacchio, respectively.    Forza Italia was said to be in line to chair the committees  for culture, with Vittorio Sgarbi; justice, Tiziana Maiolo;  budget, Silvio Liotta; and productive activities, Alessandro  Rubino.    Indications are that the Northern League committee chairs  could go to Riccardo Fragassi or Paolo Bampo for defense;  Roberto Castelli for the environment and public works; Uber  Anghinoni for agriculture. The League has also proposed either  Fiorello Provera or Roberto Calderoli for social affairs and  Marco Sartori to chair the labor committee.    Despite its opening to the opposition on the chairs, Forza  Italia was said to be ready to propose Tina Lagostena and Marco  Taradash to chair the equal opportunities and RAI commissions  respectively.</p>

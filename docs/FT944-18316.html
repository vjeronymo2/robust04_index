			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / International Company News: Fibres business drives growth at Snia BPD Snia BPD, the fibres, chemicals and biotechnology subsidiary of Fiat, lifted operating profits by nearly 50 per cent and more than doubled pre-tax profits in the first half of 1994, writes Andrew Hill in Milan. The group, quoted on the Milan stock exchange, increased pre-tax profits to L26.8bn (Dollars 17.2m) in the first six months of the year, from L12.1bn in the year-ago period. Operating profits rose to L54.6bn on turnover of L1,337bn, up 16.7 per cent on turnover for the first six months of 1993. The group attributed the strong performance mainly toimprovement in the fibres division, headed by its quoted subsidiary Snia Fibre. It returned to an operating profit of L10.3bn in the first half, compared with a loss of L11.7bn a year earlier. Snia BPD said it expected its full-year pre-tax result to show 'a significant improvement' on 1993, thanks partly to a continued reduction in financial charges. By contrast, Cogefar-Impresit, the Fiat construction subsidiary, is still suffering from the downturn in the Italian public works sector. It announced a consolidated loss of L36bn for the first half.</p>

			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Survey of Reinsurance (4): Cushioned against misfortunes - US reinsurers have responded to shifting times WHILE mid-year renewals saw rates for most classes of insurance begin to rise worldwide, mainstream property and casualty rates in North America, the largest insurance market in the world, remain inadequately low. This is due to raging competition in the US reinsurance market. As more US reinsurers subscribe to the view that at least Dollars 100m of capital and surplus is required to be a serious player, so capital has poured into the market without the premium base increasing in line. US reinsurers' capital (measured by policyholders' surplus, which is the excess of assets over liabilities) has rocketed by 63 per cent since 1987, from Dollars 7.9bn to Dollars 12.9bn. This has had the effect of depressing pricing levels, as more reinsurers chase the premium dollar to maximise their capital usage. In spite of the inevitable worsening of underwriting performance with a market combined ratio (underwriting and claims expenses as a percentage of premiums) of 103 per cent in 1987 rising to 107 per cent in 1991, investment gains have more than offset underwriting losses. Market net income in 1991 amounted to Dollars 2bn compared to Dollars 100m the year before. This was aided by around Dollars 600m of realised capital gains. Moreover, because primary insurers are increasing their retention levels and switching much of the residue risk from proportional treaty to excess of loss covers, reinsurers have been cushioned to a large extent against the abnormally long and brutal run of misfortunes primary insurers have had to contend with in recent years. Analysts reckon it will take a natural disaster involving at least a Dollars 2bn insured loss, or the insolvency of a leading insurer, to inflict enough pain on US reinsurers to raise rates. Even the Los Angeles riots and the Chicago floods have not produced losses large enough to make an impact. If not through rate increases, reinsurers have taken some action against soft and shifting times. Provoked by continuing overcapacity, reinsurers are looking to the primary market as a means to generate new sources of business. 'Reinsurers are looking at opportunities where they can issue primary insurance policies for agents marketing specialty insurance and niche programmes,' says Andrew Barile, president of Ambel Consultation Services. This trend toward what Mr Barile calls 'vertical integration' is bringing fresh capital into non-standard lines such as excess general liability, errors and omissions and non-standard auto liability. Mr Barile cites Phoenix Re, General Re and Nac Re as examples of leading reinsurers who have set up their own primary companies to pursue such business. Observers are unanimous that this trend will continue. According to Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, US reinsurers managed to increase net premium volume to Dollars 14.9bn (from Dollars 13.9bn in 1990). This growth, says S &amp; P, has been largely fuelled by an increased number of financial reinsurance transactions, geared to provide surplus relief and stabilise losses for insurers, which are replacing more traditional forms of reinsurance coverage, and the re-claiming of business from alternative markets such as self-insured municipalities and captive insurers. While reinsurers show willing to adapt underwriting practices, they are also seeing their industry slimming down. Reinsurers' proclivity to increase surplus, parent companies wanting to bail out of an increasingly complicated business and a reduction in demand among cedants (the reinsurance buyers) for the traditional reinsurance product have all conspired to contract the lower tiers of the market. In the past year, New Zealand Re was purchased by English &amp; American Insurance, MONY Re was acquired by Folksamerica and American Union Re is now a reinsurance department of American States Insurance, to mention but a few examples. This trend is set to continue. It is the smaller and medium-sized reinsurers which are most vulnerable in the competitive US market. Such companies are being generally excluded by ceding company guidelines from writing casualty related risks. Desperately seeking more market share, they have been forced to take on more property business, some of which is of a catastrophe nature, while purchasing less reinsurance protection due to the shortage of retrocessional capacity. Underwriting results are therefore fatally weakened. Nor is the prognosis good for the large players. Undoubtedly, they have benefited from a 'flight to quality' with cedants ever more concerned with size and continuity as financially troubled reinsurers such as Unione Italiana Reinsurance of America have been driven out of business in recent years. Indeed, the top 10 reinsurers accounted for 53 per cent of business written in 1991. This compares with a 44 per cent market share in 1985. No-one disputes that some of this increased market share has been at the expense of smaller players. But analysts point to three reasons why the top tier reinsurers are living on borrowed time. First, US regulators are proposing risk-based capital rules which should change the way in which security is measured and better identify companies which are applying capital correctly in relation to their resources. The rules will greatly reduce reinsurers' surplus, thereby depriving companies of the investment cushion against deteriorating underwriting results. Second, Aetna's recent selling off of American Re, the third biggest US reinsurer, has highlighted market reserve deficiencies. Last year, for example, reinsurers raised their reserves by the lowest amount in 20 years. Because of this, buy-out specialists Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts and Co have written a provision into the American Re deal which requires Aetna to add an additional Dollars 500m to the reinsurer's reserves if deemed necessary. According to S &amp; P, with a deteriorating market combined ratio and continuing inadequate rates expected next year, reinsurers will need to make loss reserve adjustments. And third, the taking on of financial reinsurance, with all the regulatory and accounting uncertainty that entails, and 'alternative market' business is begging questions about the future stability of US reinsurance. As Steve Bolland of broker Gill &amp; Roeser remarks, 'the final effect of this is uncertain at present, but an educated guess would be that some reinsurers are writing business in areas where they have no experience or statistics to guide them. The results of this may not be apparent for some years.</p>

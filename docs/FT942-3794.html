			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up THAILAND The stock exchange of Thailand has agreed to lower the entry fee for new brokerage seats from the original asking price of Bt350m (Dollars 14m) to Bt300m staggered over five years, following complaints from Thailand's 37 sub-brokers and the securities and exchange commission, writes William Barnes in Bangkok. The fees, previously revised from Bt350m to Bt305m, are still above the SEC's suggested Bt200m. Nevertheless the commission has indicated it will allow this revised price to stand. The 40 full members of the exchange have at least responded to the request of Mr Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, the finance minister, for an explicit and more open policy on admitting new members. Subject to certain minimum qualifications all sub-brokers, many of whom have foreign joint venture partners, will be allowed full membership of the exchange, perhaps within two or three years. New brokers will pay Bt200m upfront and then pay 10 per cent of their trading commissions to the exchange for five years or until that total reaches Bt100m, whichever is the sooner. BEIRUT The foundation for a revived Beirut stock exchange will be laid on June 23, when secondary trading opens in Solidere, the Dollars 1.8bn property development company created earlier this year in one of the Middle East's biggest flotations, writes Mark Nicholson in Cairo. The secondary market in Solidere's 1.8m shares will, said Mr Nasr Chamaa, managing director, as with its launch subscription, be open only to Arab investors. A grey market in the Dollars 100 par issue has already seen shares change hands at a 20 per cent premium, bankers say. Formal over the counter trading will open under the auspices of the Societe Financiere du Liban, which is jointly owned by Lebanese commercial banks. The trading floor, which will at the same time become the market for Lebanese Pound treasury bills, will at first have seats for about 30 members, the majority being local commercial banks.</p>

			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEWER FEES WILL JUMP FOR USERS OF CRESCENTA WATER DISTRICT  </P> <P> Monthly sewer service fees will more than double in September for about 23,000  customers of the Crescenta Valley County Water District, officials announced  this week.  </P> <P> The rate increase, which will boost monthly residential fees from $8.40 to $20,  is needed to pay the community's share of the cost of improvements to the  Hyperion sewage treatment plant in Los Angeles, said Robert K. Argenio,  district general manager.  </P> <P> The city of Los Angeles is under federal and state mandates to complete by 1998  an estimated $3.4 billion in improvements and additions to the Hyperion plant,  part of a waste water treatment and disposal system that also serves seven  other cities and several county water and sanitation districts.  </P> <P> The Crescenta Valley district, like other users, has no voice in the  improvement project, but must pay a share of the costs, Argenio said.  </P> <P> The district's initial share was estimated at $1.5 million, but that estimate  was revised by Los Angeles officials in May to more than $8 million, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Increases Expected  </P> <P> Additional increases can be expected in the future.  </P> <P> "I would like to be able to say this increase will take care of all foreseeable  costs, but I cannot do that," Argenio said. "We believe that if actual costs  are as high as projected, even this increase might not be adequate to meet our  long-term obligations."  </P> <P> Similar sewer service fee increases are planned by other districts.  </P> <P> Los Angeles, for instance, expects the present monthly sewer fee of $8.24 paid  by the average residential user to climb to $23.07 during the next five years,  said Fred Hoeptner, a financial manager for the Los Angeles Department of  Public Works.  </P> <P> Argenio said the five-member water board deliberated for more than two months  before "very reluctantly" authorizing the fee increase. "There was really no  alternative," he said.  </P> <P> Rates for multifamily dwellings and commercial users will climb by 138% in  September.  </P> <P> Argenio said newsletters will be mailed within the next few weeks to all of the  district's 30,000 customers alerting them to the fee increase.  </P> <P> The higher fee will affect about two-thirds of the district's customers who are  connected to the sewer system.  </P> <P> Unlike Los Angeles, which charges sewer fees based on the amount of water used,  residential customers in the Crescenta Valley pay a flat monthly rate.  </P> <P> The district serves the unincorporated area of La Crescenta and a small portion  of La Canada Flintridge.  </P></p>

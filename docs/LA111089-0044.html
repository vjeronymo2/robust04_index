			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TORRANCE PLACES AIRPORT FUND ISSUE ON BALLOT  </P> <P> A proposal that would allow the city of Torrance to eliminate its airport fund  will appear on the March ballot, despite the objections of pilots who say the  move would be an initial step toward closing the airfield.  </P> <P> City Council members, characterizing the proposal to amend the City Charter as  a simple bookkeeping change, shrugged off criticisms from pilots' groups as  they voted unanimously Tuesday to place the measure on the March 6 ballot.  </P> <P> City Finance Director Mary Giordano said that the measure would remove charter  provisions requiring that the airport fund exist but that airport finances  would continue to be accounted for separately.  </P> <P> Last week, City Council members threatened to close Torrance Municipal Airport  because of a pilots' lawsuit charging that the city has not obeyed state  land-use planning laws.  </P> <P> Pilots charged Tuesday that the Charter amendment would allow the city to  siphon money away from the airport.  </P> <P> "The only conclusion that we can draw is that you are using this apparently  otherwise useless action to take one more step towards closure of the airport,"  said Scott Raphael, an attorney representing the California Aviation Council.  </P> <P> The aviation council and several local pilots filed suit against Torrance last  month, asking a judge to block development of 52 new homes under the airport's  flight pattern until the city obeys a state law requiring that it prove the  project is compatible with the airport.  </P></p>

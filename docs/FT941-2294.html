			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Bad debts hit profit at Unity Trust Unity Trust, Britain's trade union bank, suffered a fall in the size of its retained profit to Pounds 104,000 last year, compared with Pounds 364,000 in 1992, Robert Taylor writes. It said yesterday when announcing its results for its tenth year of operation that the fall was partly because of provision for bad debts and partly because of investment in new services, particularly pensions. Operating profit before bad-debt provision and taxation was Pounds 2.3m last year compared with Pounds 1.7m in 1992. Operating income rose to Pounds 7.18m last year from Pounds 6.08m in 1992. Last year the bank wrote off Pounds 5.72m of bad debt.</p>

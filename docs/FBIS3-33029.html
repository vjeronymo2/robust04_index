			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Forum" column] </F>   [Text] The prevailing tension that borders on economic  warfare between the United States and Japan places our country  in an extremely delicate situation that prompts us to conduct  ourselves with the utmost caution lest we harm the ties that  bind us to the two nations that are now at odds.    Indeed, the long-standing ties that bind us to the United  States must be carefully maintained and advanced, mostly because  the treaties that will make the Panama Canal entirely our  responsibility will soon go into effect. Now would not be the  most appropriate time for any cooling of the relations we have  maintained from the birth of our Republic to date. In addition,  any shift on our part against the northern nation would prompt  an immediate reaction from the U.S. side that could only bring  negative consequences for us. On the other hand, Japan is a  major canal user, not to mention the fact that we are linked to  them by a treaty on alternatives to the Canal, whether it leans  toward the construction of a sea level canal or a third set of  locks. A cooling of our many ties with such an important ally  that also maintains immense commercial relations with our  country would not be advisable for us, either. Circumstances  such as those mentioned above demand from our government, mainly  our Foreign Ministry, a cautious, intelligent, and evenhanded  attitude to conduct our relations with the two nations as if on  a razor's edge. Otherwise we would run the risk of leaning too  heavily on one side to the detriment of the other, which would  really mean acting against ourselves.</p>

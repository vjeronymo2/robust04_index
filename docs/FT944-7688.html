			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow plunges 91 points on rate fears Wall Street US share prices plummeted late yesterday afternoon to finish at their lowest since early July amid fears that further interest rate increases would begin to slow economic growth, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average blue chip indicator was down 91.52 at 3,677.99. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 dropped 8.21 to 450.09, while the American Stock Exchange composite surrendered 5.14 at 436.14 and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 16.53 to 741.21. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 385m shares. Yesterday was the worst day for the Dow since February 4, the day the Federal Reserve embarked on the current course of monetary tightening that has driven interest rates from 3 per cent in January to today's 5.5 per cent. On that day the Dow plunged more than 96 points. The decline adds to Monday's loss of nearly 46 points, which took the Dow down to its lowest level since August 22. NYSE volume yesterday was the highest day's total of the year in the wake of investor fears that rising interest rates would draw money from equities and into interest-bearing instruments such as bonds. On Monday, Morgan Stanley reduced the stock portion of its equity model portfolio to 85 from 97 per cent and increased the cash holdings to 15 per cent from 3 per cent. For one of the first times this year, equity prices did not follow the trend in bonds, which posted gains after an afternoon auction showed moderately strong demand for five-year notes. Some analysts believe the uncoupling may be a signal that the markets finally believe that the Fed is willing to continue lifting interest rates until the economy slows down. Until now, said some, many market actors were not convinced that the Fed was willing to sacrifice some growth in order to rein in inflation. Major cyclicals were off sharply. Caterpillar fell Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 51 5/8 , DuPont Dollars 2 to Dollars 52 3/4 , International Paper Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 68 1/8 , General Electric Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 46 1/2 , Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Dollars 2 to Dollars 50 5/8 and United Technologies Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 55 7/8 . One gainer in the Dow was Walt Disney, which rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 43 after reporting fourth-quarter earnings of 42 cents per share, against analysts' expectations of 39 cents. PaineWebber shed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 13 after the SEC launched an investigation into whether the broking house had improperly sold shares in several limited partnerships to investors. Greyhound Lines was unchanged at Dollars 2 after reporting that it would take a net loss of Dollars 3.5m over about four years because of three cancelled interest rate swaps. Canada Toronto stocks posted only moderate losses in spite of the carnage in New York which was seen late in the Wall Street session amid active program selling. The TSE 300 index ended 16.16 lower at 4,058.15, while falls led rises by 557 to 240 after volume of 68.7m shares. Ten of the 14 sub-group indices were down, led by transportation, metals, industrial products and gold stocks. The golds group shed a further 0.7 per cent, failing to benefit from a 70-cent gain in the New York spot bullion price to USDollars 388.25 an ounce.</p>

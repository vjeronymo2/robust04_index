			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Compromise avoids clash in the cabinet: Nedo failed to meet original aims; 'Industrial vandalism' says Smith; Heseltine ready to reorganise IT HAD all the hallmarks of a classic Majorite compromise. Depending on which camp you asked yesterday, the abolition of the National Economic Development Council represented a victory for Mr Norman Lamont's economic liberalism or the foundation stone for Mr Michael Heseltine's promised industrial activism. In political terms it was a neat way of defusing a potential clash between two of the most powerful figures in the cabinet over how the government should conduct its dialogue with industry. Mr Lamont, who has long been sceptical about the highly publicised and politicised setpiece discussions in the NEDC on broad economic strategy, could justly claim that he had abolished the last vestiges of 1960s corporatism. It was the chancellor who instituted the post-election review of the council's future, in effect pre-empting any move by Mr Heseltine to increase his influence over its deliberations. Mr Heseltine has long advocated that sponsorship of the NEDC should move to the department he took over after the general election. He has also made clear that the Department of Trade and Industry will adopt a much higher profile in championing the cause of British industry. Mr Lamont was determined from the outset of the review that the council should be scrapped - underlining his view that macro-economic policy, and above all the priority given to the defeat of inflation, could no longer be regarded as a legitimate subject for tripartite debate. But the Labour spokesmen who claimed yesterday that Mr Heseltine had been outflanked by the Treasury were only half right. With Mr Major brokering the negotiations, the great survivor of British politics made sure that the deal included an enhanced role for the DTI in overseeing the government's contacts with industry. In a remark that reflected the obvious tensions between the two figures, Mr Lamont yesterday emphasised that only a few officials from the National Economic Development Office would be switched to the DTI. Nor could Mr Heseltine expect extra money. That will not stop the president of the Board of Trade from attempting to recreate within the DTI the intensive contacts between government and industry that were provided by Nedo's sectoral working parties. Mr Heseltine has already said he will reorganise the DTI's industrial divisions along sectoral lines. Under plans he intends to announce next month, more of the department's efforts will be directed towards identifying areas where the government can help specific industries. Mr Heseltine is particularly keen to find out where British companies are weak in competing with overseas rivals so that export assistance can be more closely targeted. The Treasury, ever suspicious of such policies, will no longer be able to claim that such a strategy would be an unnecessary duplication of the work done by NEDC's working parties. More broadly, Mr Heseltine is pushing ahead with a strategy designed to give the DTI a much stronger role in co-ordinating across Whitehall policies that affect industry and trade. He is not interested in the classic interventionism of the 1960s and 1970s but he does believe that he can establish himself as industry's champion in the government. There are clear limits to his ambitions - not least the prospect of a tough public spending round in the autumn and the instinctive suspicions of many in the Conservative party about his activist instincts. Some of his friends, though, were feeling confident enough yesterday to remind journalists of the title of the book in which he first advocated a more prominent role for Nedo - Where There's a Will.</p>

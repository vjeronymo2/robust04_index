			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (5): A thin smile only - Humour / While it sounds promising, Lucy Kellaway finds a new anthology of European jokes disappointing Have you heard this one? An anthology of European jokes Europublic, Pounds 3.95 56 pages Heaven is where the police are British, the chefs French, the mechanics German, the lovers Italian and it is all organised by the Swiss. Hell is where the police are German, the chefs British, the mechanics French, the lovers Swiss and it is all organised by the Italians. This the first joke in a book that promises to fill a gaping hole in the market. Think of all those people who give European speeches every year, and think of their desperation to find appropriate jokes to fill them with. This anthology of European jokes should be an answer to their prayers. Even for those who do not have speeches to write, the anthology sounds promising - cracks about other nation- alities are about the funniest around  -infinitely better than those other two hack- neyed themes: the mother-in- law and the wife. It is therefore both a shame and a puzzle that barely one of the jokes in this slim volume brings more than the thinnest smile to the lips. After the first joke, which is moderately amusing if a little aged and no longer accurate, they fall increasingly flat. The problem is that the book comes from the wrong stable. Europublic, the organisation behind it, is more federally minded than Jacques Delors himself, and is therefore not prepared to publish jokes that might offend or ridicule any partic- ular country. This is fatal, as the whole point about nat- ionality jokes is that they are offensive - at least to anyone touchy enough to be offended by them. The most risque jokes in the collection gently suggest that another nation might be just a tiny bit silly. Funnier than some of the cracks is the commentary that goes with them. Take this one: three prisoners of war are to be tortured to make them talk. The French- man talks on the first day. The Englishman talks after a week. The Italian never talks. When finally released, he is questioned about his bravery. 'But 'ow could I talk with my hands tied behind my back?' he replies. The joke is acceptable enough, but the commentary is hilarious. 'Think about it a bit, and you realise that, far from making fun of the Italians, these jokes ack- nowledge that Italians are, or at least may be, cleverer than the rest of us,' it says. Again and again, jokes are excused by the editors on the grounds that the victims themselves think they are funny, or because it is possible to swap the names of the countries around to use them against a different nationality. There is some unexpected information to be gleaned from the book. The Spanish, we are told, are the funniest nation of all, and have you rolling in the aisles without even trying to be amusing. To prove it we are given this example of their witty folk wisdom: 'If your wife tells you to throw yourself out of the window, pray God it's a low one'. One can only reflect that humour is a subjective thing. Even more puzzling is the extraordinary revelation about Swedes. A Swede, a Norwegian and a Dane are caught in a snowstorm, so the joke goes. They find a cave to shelter in but are put off by the stench from a half-dead goat. The Nor- wegian goes in first but comes out after five minutes asphyxiated by the smell. Then the Dane goes in. After 10 minutes he crawls out and expires. Finally the Swede goes in and, 15 minutes later . . . the goat comes out. It is not clear what this joke means. Could it be that the Swede was even smellier than the goat? But that does not tally with one's imp- ression of Scandinavians, and if true, would surely have been vetoed by the collection's even-handed editors. The anthology, though a disappointment, is not with- out its uses. Each joke is in English, Dutch, French and German, which not only offers a painless way of improving colloquial use of those languages, but might come in handy for those speeches. Take the tame joke about the Englishman who returns from a holiday in France saying that he had no prob- lem with the language but the French did. This might go down quite well told to a French audience by a Brit who could say the joke in perfect French memorised from the book.</p>

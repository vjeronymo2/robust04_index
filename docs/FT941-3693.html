			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Walt Disney prepares to share the pain: Restructuring at the European park For the past two weeks a team of executives from Walt Disney's Los Angeles headquarters has been holed up in a Paris lawyers' office trying to piece together a rescue deal for Euro Disney, the stricken European leisure group. Their efforts were rewarded on Sunday when the Disney negotiators and a steering committee of Euro Disney's banks, signed an outline agreement for a package worth roughly FFr13bn (Pounds 1.5bn) that should save Euro Disney from the receivers. But the critical questions are what the restructuring means for the finances of Euro Disney and its US parent? When Walt Disney first mapped out a European version of its hugely successful US theme parks, it calculated it would make a profit from its opening year. Instead, Euro Disney, which opened in April 1992, produced a net loss of FFr188m in the year to September 30, 1992, and thudded into a bigger deficit of FFr5.3bn the following year. Euro Disney had some operational problems, aggravated by the economic recession which meant that, although attendance levels were almost in line with expectations at around 11m in the first year, expenditure at the park fell below expectations. But the crux of Euro Disney's difficulties was its financial structure. Disney had financed EuroDisneyland's construction through the flotation of the remaining 51 per cent stake and through loans. Euro Disney had originally expected to reduce its debt by selling property around the park, but the recession forced it to abandon this. Meanwhile the high rate of French interest rates raised the cost of servicing its remaining debt. Early last year the company hoped to restructure its finances by persuading its bankers to relax the terms of their loans. But when the recession deepened it realised that more drastic action was required. In November Disney summoned the banks to tell them it would support Euro Disney until March 31 but that, unless a rescue was agreed, it would pull the plug and Euro Disneyland would close. The two sides have since been thrashing out an agreement. The main elements are a FFr6bn rights issue and a FFr1.4bn transaction whereby Disney will lease two of the theme park rides. - the Temple of Doom and Discovery Mountain. The US group will also waive its rights to royalties and management fees for five years: while the banks will accept an 18 month interest holiday on their loans. This package should halve Euro Disney's debt from FFr20.3bn to FFr10bn. The company should also save FFr800m a year in interest charges and FFr450m in payments to Disney. Euro Disney now hopes to break even next year. Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in London, is less optimistic. She forecasts a net loss of FFr1.5bn in the year to September 30 and another loss of FFr140m next year before Euro Disney returns a net profit of FFr450m in 1995/96. However, analysts say the deal is positive for Walt Disney and its chairman, Mr Michael Eisner, and while the parent is going to have to suffer its share of Euro Disney pain, along with other investors and lenders, the burden is well within the range Wall Street was expecting. The fresh equity injection of Dollars 520m (Pounds 356m) will be in a company with a better structured capital base, and which therefore stands a chance of eventually making a return on the investment. Ms Jessica Reif, of Oppenheimer &amp; Co, believes that the lease financing deal, together with the equity, will take Walt Disney's total new financing commitment up to around Dollars 750m 'and we think over the long term Disney will more than recoup that'. Disney's loss of royalties and management fees will not hurt much either. These only amounted to Dollars 36.3m last year, a small sum relative to Walt Disney's Dollars 1.7bn of operating income, and no one on Wall Street had expected them to survive the restructuring. On the positive side, the deal removes a large element of investor uncertainty over the fate of Euro Disney, and the financial implications for Walt Disney. The uncertainty has been hanging over the US company's stock for months, undermining an otherwise strong earnings outlook. Walt Disney reported a 34 per cent jump in first quarter net income, to Dollars 368.6m, or 68 cents a share, and analysts said yesterday's outline settlement would have no impact on their full-year earnings per share forecasts of Dollars 2.10 to Dollars 2.15, up around 30 per cent from last year. The strongest earnings growth will come from the film business. The Lion King, an animated movie due for summer release in the US, is expected to be a big success, as will the release on video of Snow White. Disney's US theme parks should also see renewed growth, helped by the opening of more attractions. Mr Christopher Dixon, at New York brokers PaineWebber, says that these factors 'and a final solution to the Euro Disney mess should go a long way to restoring investor confidence'. Walt Disney shares, he believes, 'are well positioned to move up from here'. Adds Ms Reif: 'Disney has more positive catalysts than any other company I follow over the next six months.'

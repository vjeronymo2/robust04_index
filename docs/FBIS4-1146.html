			<p>BFN     [Text] The minister for foreign affairs, Alhaji Babagana  Kingibe, says the Federal Government is still committed to its  decision that the controversy over the ownership of the Bakassi  Peninsula can be resolved in accordance with the Charter of the  Organization of African Unity, OAU. The minister was speaking  today in Abuja when he received the OAU fact-finding team on the  Nigeria-Cameroon border dispute. He pointed out that Cameroon  has been unwilling to (?resolve) her contention with Nigeria in  accordance with the provisions of the OAU and UN Charters. The  minister expressed the hope that the visit would strengthen the  spirit for a peaceful resolution to the Bakassi dispute.    In his response, the leader of the team and assistant  secretary general of the OAU, Ambassador (M.T. Matunga), said  the team would not only look for facts but also explore ideas  from both countries on a peaceful resolution of the dispute.</p>

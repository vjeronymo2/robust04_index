			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LAGUNA NIGUEL'S NEW LEADERS EXPECT A SMOOTH TRANSITION TO CITYHOOD  </P> <P> Always the bridesmaid but never the bride, this community has finally made it  to the altar.  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel, which struggled for three years to get the question of cityhood  on the ballot, on Dec. 1 will become Orange County's 29th city.  </P> <P> It's a big change but one the community is ready for -- and has been carefully  planning for -- Councilwoman-elect Patricia C. Bates said Wednesday.  </P> <P> She also marveled at the size and scope of Tuesday's election mandate for  cityhood: "It was overwhelming. We're all still in a state of euphoria."  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel voters gave a thundering approval of nearly 89% for cityhood  Tuesday, with a vote of 8,463 to 1,058. The pro-cityhood turnout, she noted,  surprised even the most optimistic of incorporation boosters.  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel becomes a county city with a montage of images: a picturesque,  planned community of expensive homes dotting undulating hills; a city whose  Main Street is fast, sleek Crown Valley Parkway; a city whose best-known  architectural work is the curious Ziggurat -- a federal building that was  constructed in a style from ancient Babylonia.  </P> <P> This elegant, eclectic community of about 40,000 residents moves from  unincorporated county to independent city in less than three weeks -- an  unusually short time span, according to the county Local Agency Formation  Commission. By contrast, LAFCO noted, Mission Viejo had almost five months to  make the adjustment, and Dana Point had about six months.  </P> <P> But Bates said Wednesday that Laguna Niguel began preparing for cityhood long  before Tuesday's climactic vote.  </P> <P> "Our Laguna Niguel Community Services District board commissioned a management  consultant team in September to outline the process for transition," Bates  said. "They are setting up the basics, such as the city's banking and insurance  -- all the housekeeping functions for a new city."  </P> <P> Bates said the new city is also ready to get off to a running start on issues  facing it. She predicted that city planning and police protection would be  among the first items under scrutiny.  </P> <P> "Land-use planning and the level of police protection -- I think those will be  things the new council will focus on," she said. "About 35% of our community  still remains to be developed, and how that is done is a concern of the  residents here. The residents also are interested in how much police service we  will contract for with the Sheriff's Department."  </P> <P> Bates topped a field of 23 council candidates. She outdistanced her nearest  competitor by about 2,400 votes.  </P> <P> On Dec. 1, five people, including Bates, will be sworn in as the inaugural City  Council. Council members will vote among themselves for mayor. The candidate  who got the most votes in the popular election usually gets that honor, so  Bates is likely to be Laguna Niguel's first mayor.  </P> <P> Bates, 49, handles personnel and community relations work for her husband's  architectural firm, John Bates Associates.  </P> <P> The other four council members elected Tuesday are James F. Krembas, 53,  principal of San Clemente High School; Paul M. Christiansen, 38, a stockbroker;  Thomas W. Wilson, 49, a program manager for Rockwell International, and Larry  A. Porter, 50, an investment broker.  </P> <P> Bates, Krembas, Christiansen and Porter are all directors of the Laguna Niguel  Community Services District, which until Dec. 1 will continue to oversee parks  and roads. Bates is also a member of the Laguna Niguel Community Council, as is  Wilson, the current president of that body. The council has been an advisory  arm to county government.  </P> <P> "All five of us elected to the new City Council have been working together for  years," Bates said. "We know each other well, and we know the problems of our  community."  </P> <P> One problem that has bedeviled Laguna Niguel has been the loss of its coastal  strip, Monarch Beach. LAFCO placed that 1.5-mile strand, which includes the  luxurious Ritz-Carlton hotel, in the proposed city of Dana Point in 1987; the  area then voted to incorporate and became a city last Jan. 1.  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel residents, furious about the loss, have two legal challenges  pending in the courts, both seeking to win back Monarch Beach.  </P> <P> "The coastal question is an issue very much before the people of Laguna  Niguel," Bates said. "We're in the courts with two lawsuits on that issue, and  we'll pursue that. Wherever we went during the campaign, we found that this  coastal issue is still very much a concern of the residents."  </P> <P> Dana Point Mayor Eileen Krause on Wednesday congratulated Laguna Niguel on  becoming a new city.  </P> <P> She said Dana Point extends cooperation and best wishes, "but Monarch Beach  remains a part of Dana Point."  </P> <P> Krause said: "One point I want to make clear. That point is that Monarch Beach  didn't belong to anyone. It was unincorporated, just as was Dana Point and just  as was Laguna Niguel. But the residents in Monarch Beach wanted to become a  part of Dana Point, and they are now a part of our city, and they will continue  to be a part of our city."  </P> <P> Monarch Beach residents themselves voted in 1987 to go with Dana Point, but  Laguna Niguel leaders protest that the advisory election was limited to an area  favoring Dana Point.  </P> <P> Dana Point Councilwoman Judy Curreri added in a separate interview: "Laguna  Niguel is going to find out that it has many things to do as a city -- a lot  more things than just trying to wage an old battle."  </P></p>

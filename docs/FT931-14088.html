			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Lower interest charge behind 41% rise at Aim AIM Group, the aircraft cabin interior maker, reported a 41 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.48m in the half year to October 31 thanks to a Pounds 460,000 reduction in its interest bill. The improvement was achieved on a lower turnover of Pounds 19.4m (Pounds 25.2m), which reflected the disposal of the unprofitable air conditioning contracting division in May. The Pounds 2.5m raised from the sale led to a cut in interest charges to Pounds 222,000 (Pounds 682,000). Earnings improved by 2p to 6.8p and the interim dividend is a same-again 1.5p. Mr Jeff Smith, chairman, said interest charges would fall again by the year-end, but the group had decided against raising the interim dividend in order to conserve cash for sharp increases in working capital requirements envisaged for 1994-95. Aim's contracts with Airbus and McDonnell Douglas had not translated into increased turnover because of the aircraft makers' cuts announced last year. The group was confident it would meet the May 1994 deadline for repaying its bankers the Pounds 6m debt they rescheduled when Aim's abortive foray into property threatened to sink the group in 1991.</p>

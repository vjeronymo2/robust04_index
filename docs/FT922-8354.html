			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: SGS advances 17% at four months SOCIETE Generale de Surveillance (SGS), the world leader in product inspection and testing services, increased turnover by 17 per cent in the first four months of 1992, Mrs Elisabeth Salina Amorini, chairman, said yesterday. This figure was boosted by the weakness of the Swiss franc against the dollar and poor business last year due to the Gulf conflict. The chairman said she faced 1992 with confidence despite the difficult international environment. In 1991 SGS boosted revenues by 9.7 per cent to SFr2.2bn (Dollars 1.44bn) with a 'marginally favourable' contribution from currency movements. Mrs Salina said the Geneva-based group would continue its policy of balancing internal growth with acquisitions of small and medium-sized companies designed to strengthen its core activities. Ascom Holding, parent of the Swiss telecommunications group, says it plans to abolish any remaining participation certificates, which have now been largely converted into registered or bearer shares. Ascom, which had a consolidated group turnover of SFr3.1bn last year, plans an unchanged dividend of 14 per cent.</p>

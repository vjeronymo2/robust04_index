			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> U.S. ASKS JAPAN TO PARTICIPATE IN $8-BILLION SUPERCOLLIDER PROJECT  </P> <P> Japan has been asked to make participation in an $8-billion superconducting  supercollider "a symbol of the global partnership" that President Bush has  offered Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, W. Henson Moore, deputy energy secretary,  said Monday.  </P> <P> After holding formal talks with Japanese officials Monday, Moore added that the  Bush Administration would be willing to raise the ceiling on foreign  participation of one-third, or $2.6 billion, of the projected cost of the  massive project if Japan and other countries wanted to make a larger  investment. The House has authorized the $2.6-billion level of investment but  the Senate has not yet acted.  </P> <P> "We in the U.S. government would prefer to receive that amount and are even  willing to discuss a greater amount," he said.  </P> <P> "Due to the size of this project, it will not be possible to build it with U.S.  funding only. It's too big for any one country. It needs to be an international  project. . . ," Moore said.  </P> <P> The U.S. government is planning to finance up to $5 billion of the cost and the  state of Texas has shouldered a $1-billion burden. A 54-mile underground tunnel  is to be built around the small town of Waxahachie, Tex., near Dallas, in which  streams of protons, guided by powerful superconducting magnets, will be shot at  nearly the speed of light to collide against each other. This will enable  physicists to learn more about the nature of matter and energy.  </P> <P> Moore said he has high hopes that Japan will join the project "because it wants  to give meaning to the agreement between President Bush and Prime Minister  Kaifu to make the U.S.-Japan relationship a global partnership." He added that  the U.S. government also believes that Japanese participation would "give  meaning and life to a global partnership."  </P> <P> The Energy Department official refused to disclose how much money he asked  Japan to contribute but emphasized that the United States wants Japan to be a  full partner in the project. Nor did he reveal how Japanese officials responded  to his invitation.  </P> <P> The next step, if Japan decides to take it, "would be for the Japanese  government to send a team of officials and scientists to the United States to  go into more detail on how the project will look," he told a new conference  shortly before leaving for Seoul. There, his team will invite the South Korean  government to join the project.  </P> <P> "There are no limitations . . . at present" concerning what companies might  build 8,150 of the 12,000 magnets that will go into the supercollider, he said.  Japanese firms are reported to be interested in bidding to build the magnets,  which will cost about $1 billion.  </P> <P> Apart from considerations of cost, some Japanese political leaders are  reportedly worried that if they decide to take part, American critics might  complain about a giveaway of American technology. Others fear that a decision  not to join will be attacked as a sign of a Japanese desire to benefit  scientifically, once the projects' results are released, without bearing a  monetary burden.  </P></p>

			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / US Money and Credit: Prices drift lower in thin trading US TREASURY bond prices moved lower across the maturity spectrum yesterday in extremely thin post-Christmas holiday trading. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year issue stood at 102 21/32 , down 15/32 from the close on December 24, to yield 7.40, up from 7.36. The falling prices continued a reversal of the Christmas week rally which saw the yield on the long bond fall to 7.34 on Tuesday night - the first time in two months that it had dropped below 7.40. However, weak demand at an auction of five-year Treasury notes helped send the market into reverse last Wednesday. Yesterday, there was no fresh news on the US economy to spur strong movement, and traders said that the negative bias stemmed from a combination of factors, including tension in the Middle East following the shooting down of an Iraqi fighter aircraft. The market was also continuing to digest last week's Treasury auctions of two and five-year notes, which attracted relatively little retail interest, leaving market traders with significant amounts of the issues on their books. Wall Street was also nervously rethinking the more positive attitude it had adopted last week towards President-elect Bill Clinton. The pre-Christmas rally stemmed largely from a growing belief that any stimulus to the economy he announced after taking office would be relatively modest, and thus would not re-ignite inflationary pressures. That thinking was coupled with hope that Mr Clinton may be more inclined than previously expected to take action to reduce the Federal budget deficit. However, some analysts yesterday expressed continuing unease with Mr Clinton's spending intentions. The market was also absorbing the minutes of the Federal Reserve's November policy-making meeting, released on Christmas Eve, which showed that it tentatively agreed to reduce its 1993 money-supply growth targets to emphasise that it wanted ' avoid any pick-up in inflation should the expansion gain momentum'. That line is consistent with Wall Street's expectation that there will be no more relaxation of monetary policy in this interest rate cycle and that the Fed may abandon its long-time bias towards easing quite soon. Minutes of the Fed's latest policy-setting meeting, held last week, will not be released for another five weeks. The market is expected to remain extremely quiet for the remainder of the holiday-shortened week, in spite of the publication of a raft of statistics, including those for consumer confidence, leading economic indicators and factory orders.</p>

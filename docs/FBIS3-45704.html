			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhou Wanxiu (0719 8001 4423)] </F>   [Text] Port Louis, 20 Jan (XINHUA) -- Qian Qichen, the  visiting Chinese vice premier and foreign minister, met with  Mauritian Foreign Minister Kasenally this afternoon.    At the meeting, Qian Qichen pointed out: Since the  establishment of Sino-Mauritian diplomatic relations, exchange  and cooperation between the two countries in the political,  economic, and cultural areas have expanded continually. The  Chinese Government has always cherished friendship with  Mauritius and is ready to work together with the Mauritian  Government in exploring new ways for mutually beneficial  cooperation.    Kasenally believed that Qian Qichen's visit would certainly  result in the deepening of mutual understanding and expansion of  cooperation, especially in the economic and trade fields,  between the two countries.    The two foreign ministers briefed each other on their  respective country's stance on the conflict in Somalia, problems  in South Africa, reform of the Security Council, and the  establishment of a new international political and economic  order.    Qian Qichen said: Under the new international situation,  many African countries are facing aggravating difficulties and  widening their gap with the developed countries. To reform the  irrational economic order and help African countries shake off  poverty is a pressing task facing the international community.  Only when the economy of the African countries shows  improvement can the global economy grow healthily. Africa's  development needs the support of the world, and Africa's  participation is also essential for the development of the world.    Kasenally pointed out: The solution to problems in Somalia  and other African nations will depend primarily on their  peoples. He said: It is necessary to bring into play the OAU's  role instead of relying on solutions imposed externally. The  establishment of an international order must be participated by  all small and big nations on an equal footing and must not be  manipulated by one or two blocs again.    Prior to the meeting, the two foreign ministers attended a  ceremony to sign an agreement on the Chinese Government's  donation of general goods to Mauritius, and signed the agreement  for their respective governments.    Qian Qichen and his party arrived in Mauritius on the  evening  of 19 January for a two-day goodwill visit to the island country  in the Indian Ocean.</p>

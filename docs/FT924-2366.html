			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Advance tax: is it legal? UNTIL THREE years ago, I would give my husband details of my income to include on his tax return. Things are different now that I am taxed separately. During the first year I paid in arrears, which my husband tells me is how it should be. Tax for the second year was demanded on January 30. This year, I received a tax demand in September to be paid on January 1. My income consists mainly of basic retirement pension and untaxed interest on Pounds 50,000 deposited with Barclays and re-invested at three-monthly intervals. Is it lawful to tax my income before I have received it all? Am I obliged to pay our estimated tax demand? Anticipatory assessments in respect of untaxed interest etc were authorised by the 1988 Finance Act for 1988-89 onwards, so the inspector is right in principle. After the end of the tax year, the assessment will adjusted automatically to the right figure. There is, however, a long-standing unpublished extra-statutory concession under which a taxpayer may defer payment of tax from new year's day until the day (between January 2 and April 5, inclusive) on which the item of income in question arises. In the circumstances, we suggest you write to the District Inspector (marking both the letter and the envelope 'For the attention of the District Inspector') asking him to ensure that the officer dealing with your assessment is aware of this unpublished concession and gives you the benefit of it. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

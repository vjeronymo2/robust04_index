			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Spending on top brass to be curbed The government is to curb excessive spending on the homes provided for senior officers in the armed forces and look for cuts in official entertainment costs, Ivor Owen writes. Mr Nicholas Soames, the armed forces minister, indicated that action would soon be taken when responding in the Commons last night to further complaints about the spending of Pounds 250,000 on refurbishing an air chief marshal's house. The minister said a report by Ms Sheila Masters of KPMG Peat Marwick into the cost of the work was near completion. Mr Soames promised to consider with Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, the 'follow-up action' required. He said that Sir Peter Cazalet, chairman of APV and deputy chairman of GKN, was conducting a review of the official entertaining undertaken by senior officers as part of their duties. Mr Soames said particular consideration would be given to whether there were alternative and more cost-effective means than the use of official service residences and other service married quarters for entertaining.</p>

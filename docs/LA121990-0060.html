			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> STRAWBERRY SEASON OFFICIALLY OPENS  </P> <P> It's time for the red and green signs of Christmas: boughs of holly, bunches of  poinsettias and baskets of strawberries.  </P> <P> While the rest of the country is dreaming of a white Christmas, Ventura County  is dotted red with its first strawberry crop of the season.  </P> <P> Representatives of the Oxnard Strawberry Festival and Miss Oxnard, official  hostess of the annual event, gathered at Kotake &amp; Sons Farm in Camarillo on  Tuesday to help pick the first ripe berries. The only person not particularly  thrilled with the trays of strawberries was Cliff Kotake, one of the owners of  the farm. "You tend to get a little sick of strawberries after all these  years," said Kotake, 34, whose father started the business more than 20 years  ago. But his 4-year-old nephew, Tachi Shudo, enjoyed taste-testing the riches  of the family business.  </P> <P> The Camarillo farm is usually the first in the county to pick the crop, said  Tsujio Kato, festival chairman.  </P> <P> Since it was first held eight years ago, the festival has grown "too successful  to accommodate the large crowds," Kato said. So this spring, the event will be  moved to College Park by Oxnard College, which is twice the size of the former  site at Channel Islands Harbor, Kato said.  </P> <P> The festival will retain the same format, he added, but now there will be more  space for parking, plus additional vendors and arts and crafts displays.

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Minding Your Own Business: The price of success - Computing TWO WEEKS ago I looked at the recently released Quattro Pro Special Edition from Borland. Priced at Pounds 49.95 and interchangeable with Lotus 1-2-3, we found it 'by far the best value for money spreadsheet on the market today.' But in its prior guise as Quattro Pro 2 the same product won top industry awards only a few months earlier. How does a market leader retailing at Pounds 395 in April 1991 manage to turn up as a modest Pounds 49 package for the home and small business user in August? To understand selling prices you must first look at cost prices. The cost price of one copy of any software package is around Pounds 5 - the box, a handful of floppy disks, and a manual. Selling a product at Pounds 395 when it cost Pounds 5 to make looks promising, but of course there are other costs, primarily the cost of developing the product. However, spreadsheet and word processing packages have been around for a long time. They are simple in structure and an experienced development team can write new ones in their sleep. With sales of the top products now in their millions, the big companies have long since recovered their development costs for DOS packages, although new Windows applications are different. Therefore, one might expect prices to fall from their Pounds 395 levels. In any normal market they would, but the software market is different - corporate buyers will not let them. By far the biggest purchasers of software packages are the 'corporates'  - big companies and institutions which buy dozens or hundreds of copies at one go. The big companies have the big money and their desire to pay absurdly high prices is legendary. They will pay Pounds 100,000 for a mainframe package when a package which does exactly the same thing running on a PC costs Pounds 1,000. They take on outside IT consultants at Pounds 600 to Pounds 800 per day without batting an eyelid. Corporate buyers are happier paying Pounds 395 for a computer package: Pounds 49 is too low - it makes them uncomfortable. If paying fancy prices makes the big companies feel better, it is the duty of the software companies to keep prices high and relieve them of their money. So successful companies such as Borland, Lotus (whose 1-2-3 sells for Pounds 475 and has sold 14m copies), and WordPerfect (whose WordPerfect costs Pounds 399 and has sold 7m copies) have kept up price levels long after development costs have been covered, and made mouthwatering profits. While the cash was rolling in, a nagging question remained. There was a mass market of newcomers to computing who could not afford these prices and would learn their spreadsheets on other, cheaper packages. It is not just computers which get programed; users get programmed too. Once a package has become second-nature people are reluctant to change. This high-price strategy might ultimately prove a blind alley. In spite of all evidence, the gullibility of the corporate buyer cannot be inexhaustible. Surely one day the penny will drop? Profits from the corporate sector would plummet and in the mass market the big companies would be nowhere. To the companies the need was obvious - to grab potential users as early as possible by developing the mass market. But if they came out with a product at a mass market price they risked compromising the image of their premier product. The conundrum seemed insoluble. The big suppliers wrung their hands, but, terrified of what would happen to their existing market if they reduced prices, did nothing. Then, in November 1990 one of the companies broke ranks. Computer Associates dropped the price of Supercalc, close behind Lotus worldwide, by 80 per cent. In the UK that meant a fall from Pounds 395 to Pounds 79. The software suppliers held their breath - was this the beginning of meltdown? Now that a leading supplier had broken ranks so spectacularly, would the corporates wake up and ask awkward questions? Several months later, at their offices in Scott Valley, California, Borland boss Philippe Kahn and his lieutenants anxiously surveyed the industry sales figures. To their surprise, market shares continued about the same. Fewer sales had been lost to Supercalc than expected. Although Supercalc's high street sales had risen, its share of corporate sales had not changed. Emboldened by the Supercalc example, Borland decided it could move into the mass market. By reducing the price so drastically Computer Associates had achieved higher volume sales, but in the process had downgraded Supercalc's image from a quality to a budget product. Borland would not make this mistake. They would offer two versions of Quattro Pro, which would be virtually identical in function but drastically different in pricing and brand image. For 'high-end corporate and power users' Borland would introduce a new version of Quattro Pro with a few extra features; then it would quietly repackage the existing version for the 'home and small business' market. Quattro Pro 3 was announced in July, recommended retail price Pounds 295. It offered interactive WYSIWYG (pronounced whizz-ee-wig), sideways printing, and 'Sound F/X technology to add fanfares, applause and more' to graphics slideshows. (Kahn and his team are not marketing smoothies but enthusiasts who come up with OTT features such as 'Turbodrive' and 'VROOMM' - Virtual Runtime Object-Oriented Memory Manager). A month later Quattro Pro Special Edition was announced at just under Pounds 50. So what will happen? We know, Borland knows, and corporate buyers know, that 99 per cent of users currently running Lotus 1-2-3 (Pounds 295-Pounds 475) or Quattro Pro 3 (Pounds 295) would find that Quattro Pro SE (Pounds 49) provides all the functions they will ever need. So will sales of 1-2-3 and Quattro Pro 3 collapse? Of course not. By selling through the high street, downgrading the packaging, and by the simple expedient of setting the price so low, Borland has ensured that the corporate buyer simply will not dare to buy Quattro Pro SE.</p>

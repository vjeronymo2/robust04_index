			<p>BFN     [Text] Nuevo Laredo, Tamps [Tamaulipas], 9 May -- The suit  filed by the U.S. AFL-CIO against Magneticos de Mexico, a Sony  subsidiary on this side of the border, for allegedly mistreating  its workers is an attempt to hinder the implementation of NAFTA  and the potential opening of new assembly plants in the country.    Ricardo Lopez Santos, president of the National Association  of the Processing Industry (Canacintra), has criticized the  "obscure interests" of the AFL-CIO and U.S. congressmen who want  to capitalize on the problem and thwart the trade agreement.    The AFL-CIO suit was supported by 25 U.S. congressmen,  headed  by Majority Leader Richard Gephardt and Majority Whip David  Bonior. According to the AFL-CIO, union delegates pressured  workers of the Magneticos de Mexico assembly plant to vote  against their favorite representatives. This suit reportedly is  the second suit filed by the U.S. labor organization since NAFTA  went into effect less than five months ago.    Lopez said: "They are expressing opinions on a problem which  they know nothing about. They are trying to capitalize on it to  halt the trade agreement and prevent other companies from  opening businesses on the border because of an apparent state of  violence." Lopez said that Sony did not pressure its workers.  The plant facilities were blocked due to union rather than  labor-management problems.</p>

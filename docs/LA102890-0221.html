			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEW FEDERAL NOISE POLICY WON'T APPLY TO AIRPORT;  </P> <P> REGULATIONS: THE LEGISLATION, PART OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET PACKAGE, EXEMPTS  FROM FEDERAL REVIEW EXISTING GUIDELINES AT AIRPORTS SUCH AS JOHN WAYNE.  </P> <P> A new national airport noise policy approved by Congress on Saturday is not  likely to upset the delicately balanced noise-control agreements that govern  air traffic at John Wayne Airport, Orange County's top airport official said.  </P> <P> As part of the complex budget bill, the House and Senate approved aviation  legislation that contained the noise-control policy and provisions for new  passenger fees to finance local airport improvement projects.  </P> <P> The legislation was written to "grandfather," or largely exempt from federal  review, existing noise policies at airports such as John Wayne, according to  local officials and congressional aides.  </P> <P> "We're real pleased," said Jan Mittermeier, manager of the county-owned  airport. "Orange County really went all out to get this grandfather provision  in there.  </P> <P> "We felt it was just not right to have the contract made with the citizens  overridden by federal provisions, so we really pulled out all the stops. Our  congressmen worked very hard to get this through."  </P> <P> But Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) has expressed concern about the  extent to which the grandfather language will protect future changes in Orange  County's noise-control plan. Cox is a member of the House Committee on Public  Works and Transportation, and lobbied against adoption of the new noise policy.  </P> <P> A noise-control agreement in effect at John Wayne Airport since 1985 bars  operation of the noisiest, or so-called Stage II, aircraft such as Boeing 747s.  The agreement mandates that outgoing flights take off no earlier than 7 a.m.  and no later than 10 p.m., while incoming flights must land before 11 p.m. The  agreement was reached as part of a settlement of a series of longstanding  lawsuits that sought to block expansion of the airport.  </P> <P> The grandfather language in the new national noise policy "is clearly intended  as an exemption for Orange County," Cox said Saturday. "But it's not perfect."  </P> <P> The new noise policy exempts from federal review all local airport noise  policies in effect on the date of the legislation's enactment. However, future  changes in local airport noise rules will escape federal scrutiny only if the  changes do not restrict aircraft operations or affect aircraft safety.  </P> <P> Cox said he could foresee circumstances under which an airline might argue that  almost any change in an existing noise policy would restrict aircraft  operations and thus make the change subject to review by the Federal Aviation  Administration.  </P> <P> Despite Cox's reservations, Mittermeier said she believes the exemption  language "will work just fine," because a future amendment to the airport's  noise-control plan "would not change any of the basic concepts of the plan. It  would change some of the mechanics."  </P> <P> David C. Coggin, the top aide to Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), who also sits  on the Public Works and Transportation Committee, agreed with Mittermeier.  Packard represents southern Orange County.  </P> <P> "They can amend the policy at John Wayne and it won't be subject to review  unless it has a safety impact, which it shouldn't, or unless it would reduce  aircraft operations, which it shouldn't," Coggin said.  </P> <P> Barbara Lichman, a member of the Airport Working Group, the county's most  influential anti-noise organization, said Saturday she is happy that John Wayne  Airport appears to be exempt from the new policy.  </P> <P> But she said she and the group remain outraged at "how the bill was passed and  what it does to other communities" that do not have existing noise restriction  arrangements.  </P> <P> "We're happy about our own situation in a parochial way, but we will continue  to fight the bill, if that means legal action, fine, or additional political  action," Lichman said.  </P> <P> Cox said overwhelming support from Orange County voters and officials helped  push through the exemptions, however imperfect they are.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration had sought both the passenger fees and the noise  policy.  </P> <P> Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner, as well as most major airlines,  argued that a national noise policy is needed to lend consistency to what  critics describe as a hodgepodge of local rules and regulations at airports  across the country. The Department of Transportation estimates that 400  separate noise rules are in effect across the country.  </P> <P> The new fees, called passenger facility charges, could amount to as much as $12  for a single, one-way trip.  </P> <P> The charges are expected to generate up to $1 billion nationally every year for  airport improvements.  </P></p>

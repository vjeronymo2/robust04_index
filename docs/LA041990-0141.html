			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> PAGEANTS STRAWBERRY BLOND;  </P> <P> A WHOLESOME MAJESTY;  </P> <P> COLLEGE SOPHOMORE SAYS HER VALUES JIBE WITH HER REIGN AS FESTIVAL QUEEN  </P> <P> The reigning monarch flipped straight to the dessert section of the menu. "I  know this is going to sound silly, but I've had a craving for something with  strawberries in it all day," said Valerie Greenhorn, winner of last year's  Oxnard Strawberry Festival's strawberry blond contest.  </P> <P> Ordering a strawberry shake, wearing a strawberry pin on her dress and pushing  her strawberry blond hair away from her face, Greenhorn had the appearance of a  true strawberry queen, but she is not one to put on airs. "Beauty contestants  are stereotyped as being prissy and conceited," she said. "But most of the ones  I know are nice, normal people." In fact, Greenhorn works part time in the  Ortega eatery at UC Santa Barbara and performs a variety of plebeian tasks such  as cooking and cleaning.  </P> <P> A sophomore at UCSB, Greenhorn, 19, has competed in several pageants and she  remembers the strawberry blond contest as the most fun. "It's not the  full-force competition you find in pageants," she said. "It's not so much about  appearance or perfection. There's no swimsuit segment or an evening dress  competition. It's more about just who you are, your personality."  </P> <P> Wearing a dress that came down well below her knees and buttoned at her neck  and wrists, Greenhorn said she's very modest. "I know that sounds strange  coming from a girl who parades on stage in front of judges while wearing  nothing but a bathing suit," she said. "It's hard to explain why that doesn't  bother me. But, for instance, I wear a bikini on the beach. And that's OK  because it belongs there. And wearing a swimsuit for a pageant is OK because it  belongs there too."  </P> <P> The bathing suit competition is included in most pageants because, Greenhorn  said, the contestants are judged on their overall image. "Personality and poise  are the most important," she said. "But a girl has to care enough about herself  to stay in shape. And appearing in a bathing suit is really the best way for  the judges to see if a contestant has muscle definition or if she's a couch  potato."  </P> <P> Greenhorn acknowledged that some people think beauty contests exploit women  because, as they see it, women are compared and judged on their beauty and  figures, therefore implying that these are their most important attributes.  "First of all, beauty is not the most important thing in the contests,"  Greenhorn said. "But yes, that is a part of it. The judges are looking for an  all-round representative, someone who is poised, talented and nice-looking. So  if a girl is extremely talented or academic or whatever, a pageant may not be  the best thing for her. But for girls who might or might not be outstanding at  any one thing, but are balanced, then this might be the place where they can  really show themselves."  </P> <P> Greenhorn considers herself an advocate of feminist concepts because she  believes women shouldn't face job discrimination and that they should get equal  pay for equal work. But she also believes there are certain differences between  men and women.  </P> <P> "And pageants give women a chance to show off the feminine side. We can show  our prim and proper, our young lady side, which we don't have a chance to do  every day."  </P> <P> Greenhorn, who plays the piano, flute and tenor saxophone, plans to graduate as  a music major and then get married and raise a family. "I want to have three  children," she said. "That always seemed like a good number. And I want at  least one little girl so I can dress her up in little dresses and little socks  and little bows. But if once she got older she decided she'd rather dress like  a tomboy, I'd let her. I'd be heartbroken, but I'd let her."  </P> <P> The daughter of a military employee, Greenhorn was born in Okinawa, Japan, and  spent most of her early years in Guam. It was there that she first started  attending church.  </P> <P> "My basic values were instilled in me at that time." she said. "My parents  aren't Christian, but I accepted Christ when I was only 8. Actually, I was too  young then to know what it was all about. But now Christ is the center of my  life.  </P> <P> "I don't believe in sex before marriage. I don't believe in drugs or excessive  alcohol. And I don't swear. I also refuse to go to a party where there will be  drugs. But I will go to a party where there's alcohol. If I avoided everyone  who did things that I don't do, then I wouldn't have any friends."  </P> <P> In addition, Greenhorn said that as a Christian she feels she must set an  example. "I feel I have an image to uphold so I can't let loose," she said.  "But that's OK. I enjoy working toward a goal and having the stability and  self-control to be the kind of person I want to be."  </P> <P> Her beliefs usually aren't a factor in pageants, she said. But it may have been  an advantage for the strawberry blond contest. "After all, I'm representing  Oxnard's strawberry industry. They're looking for someone with a pure and  wholesome image," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ENTRY FORMS  </P> <P> Applications to compete in the strawberry blond contest are due Friday.

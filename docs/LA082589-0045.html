			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> PAC BELL WINS ON DIAL-PORN  </P> <P> Pacific Bell is one step closer to pulling the plug on so-called "dial-a-porn"  telephone services after a favorable ruling in federal court, a company  spokeswoman said. A federal judge in Washington ruled that Pacific Bell, as a  private business, has the right to disconnect dial-a-porn services under  federal laws. However, the utility must now determine if it has the same rights  under state laws and filed a suit in San Francisco Superior Court, naming 13  dial-a-porn companies as defendants. Past efforts to ban dial-a-porn services  have been blocked by First Amendment guarantees of free speech. "As a private  business, Pac Bell should have the right to choose who we want and don't want  to do business with," Pacific Bell spokeswoman Kathleen Flynn said.  </P></p>

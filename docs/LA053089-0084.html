			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAYTAG AND HOOVER: HEAVEN FOR HOUSEKEEPING AND APPLIANCE MAKERS  </P> <P> When Maytag bought Hoover earlier this year, it was a homemaker's dream -- the  marriage of two businesses that started out producing appliances to make  housekeeping tasks easier in the early years of this century.  </P> <P> The two are similar in other ways as well.  </P> <P> In 1907, Frederick L. Maytag, owner for many years of a farm implement business  in a small Iowa town, began manufacturing the Pastime, a wooden, hand-cranked  washing machine.  </P> <P> In 1908, William H. Hoover, owner for many years of a leather goods and harness  factory in a small Ohio town, started making the Model O electric suction  carpet sweeper.  </P> <P> The Maytag washer and the Hoover vacuum cleaner soon became household words --  Maytag in this country, Hoover throughout the world as well. Hoover opened its  first foreign plants in Canada in 1911 and in England in 1917.  </P> <P> It was J. Murray Spangler, a cousin of Hoover's wife, Susan, who invented the  Hoover vacuum cleaner. Spangler, a janitor who suffered from asthma, was  troubled by dust when he swept carpets.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Models for $450  </P> <P> So he mounted an electric fan on a floor sweeper and twisted the fan's blades  to create suction. He put a pillowcase around the contraption to catch the dust  it sucked up. Spangler patented the device and sold the patent to Hoover.  Hoover improved on the design and made Spangler the production manager of his  new company, Electric Suction Sweeper Co.  </P> <P> The first Hoover vacuum cleaner weighed 40 pounds and sold for $59. Today, the  most expensive models sell for about $450. Hoover's newest machine -- the Elite  300 upright -- weighs less than 12 pounds.  </P> <P> According to Brian Gridlestone, Hoover North America's 42-year-old president,  Maytag wanted Hoover "because Hoover is one of the world players in the  appliance industry." Maytag paid Chicago Pacific Corp. $961.5 million to  acquire the Hoover operation and five furniture companies, although it later  said it would sell the furniture companies to pay off part of the long-term  debt it assumed as a result of the merger.  </P> <P> Maytag, with record sales of $1.9 billion last year, was looking for a company  such as Hoover so it could become a global player, explained Daniel J. Krumm,  62, Maytag's chairman and chief executive.  </P> <P> "This is particularly important to us," he said, "because it is our first major  step in expanding Maytag's strategy for appliance growth to overseas markets.  Appliance companies here and abroad are actively developing ways to play on  each other's turf.  </P> <P> "We needed to position ourself . . . for the upcoming changes in the European  market in 1992, when all trade barriers between countries in Europe are  scheduled to be dropped, making Europe an even bigger appliance market than the  U.S."  </P> <P> Hoover, whose sales exceeded $1 billion for the first time last year, is the  largest company in the $2.5-billion U.S. floor-care industry through its  production of vacuum cleaners and other home products. Overseas, where 69% of  its revenues are generated, Hoover is big not only in vacuum cleaners, but also  in washers, dryers, refrigerators, dishwashers and microwave ovens.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Microprocessors, Robotics  </P> <P> Hoover has 14 manufacturing facilities in the United States and abroad with a  total of 15,100 employees, including 3,000 at its headquarters and factory  here. It also has factories in Scotland, Wales, Canada, Australia, France,  Mexico, Portugal and Colombia.  </P> <P> Hoover's North Canton plant has undergone a $38-million modernization during  the past two years, with the installation of robotics and microprocessors  throughout -- part of a $130-million improvement program that Hoover has  conducted at its plants throughout the world during the past five years.  </P> <P> Maytag, based in Newton, Iowa, had 13,000 employees in 12 U.S. divisions before  the merger on Jan. 26. The Maytag companies now are Admiral, Ardac,  Dixie-Narco, Domicor, Heatube, Hoover, Jenn-Air, Magic-Chef, Maycor, Maytag,  Maytag Financial Services, Norge and Warwick.  </P> <P> Maytag is the nation's third-largest washing machine company -- after Whirlpool  and General Electric. Other Maytag products include refrigerators, clothes  dryers, kitchen ranges, soft drink vending machines and garbage disposals.  </P> <P> Hoover and Maytag pride themselves on their ability to make high-quality  products for reasonable prices, which has helped keep Japan and other foreign  nations from getting a foothold in the highly competitive American appliance  marketplace.  </P></p>

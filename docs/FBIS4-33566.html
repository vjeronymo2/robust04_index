			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by President Carlos Roberto Reina with an </F> unidentified moderator and unidentified reporters at a hotel in  Tegucigalpa on 6 June--recorded]    [Text] [Reina] International organizations have finally and  firmly acknowledged this government's social commitment. There  have been very auspicious indications, and the government is  committed to honoring its campaign promises. We find this very  auspicious, because it is something the whole world is  witnessing as a reaffirmation of the social role of the  administration over which I am honored to preside. If you have  any questions, I am more than willing to answer.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct] in the short run, how can we  end such a situation in our country?    [Reina] I reiterate, we are undertaking enormous efforts,  not  only through international organizations but also through the  National Social Welfare Board, as well as through other agencies  involved in issues of child care. Numerous nongovernment  organizations, the prestigious NGO's, are encouraged to  cooperate in this endeavor. The number of children involved is  quite significant, but I hope that by the end of my  administration, we will have been able to demonstrate the social  progress accomplished in this issue.    [Reporter] Guillermo Molina Chocano, Secplan [Secretariat of  Planning, Coordination, and Budget] minister, said a few minutes  ago that the letter of intent will be signed shortly and that  the elimination of subsidies to the transportation system is  practically inevitable; likewise, he mentioned the situation of  the groups involved in the distribution of crude oil. In this  case, he was referring to fuel rationing.    [Reina] I would like all of you to be aware of the enormous  problems we are confronting. It is up to me to confront  poverty, corruption, and the crisis, in addition to tremendous  misunderstandings such as certain statements I heard this  morning. If one does not have support from the media and the  people, everything becomes more difficult. I am not about to  waver in this struggle, but I need allies, and I hope I can rely  on all good-hearted Hondurans.    The letter of intent will be signed, and the details will be  disclosed in due time. If we break with the international  organizations, we would be greatly harming Honduras. You have  just mentioned a classic example.    If we allow distributors to fix fuel prices, prices will  increase almost every day. If we stop them here and now, they  will deprive the market of fuel. What do we do then? We would  have no fuel, and we would continue to receive criticism from  both sides. What has to be done is what is more convenient to  the country, and that is exactly what we are doing; we are doing  this with the individuals we believe are the most capable. On  several occasions I have said I have chosen the most capable  Hondurans as my advisers; after all, the art of governing is  also knowing when to surround oneself with competent advisers.    [Reporter] But, Mr. President, when are we going to witness  those concrete decisions? The country is going through a  tremendous chaos. We have an energy crisis and a crude oil  crisis; in addition, the price of the family basket is  constantly rising. When is your administration going to take  concrete decisions? During your last presidential address you  announced you would earmark 100 million lempiras for BANASUPRO  [National Supply Agency for Basic Products], which has not yet  come through. Then we have the issue of the closed fishing  season, and the forests, and [words indistinct].    [Reina] The first concrete answer is the moral revolution.  Every government official is under supervision. Is this or is  this not the main answer? All government officials are under  investigation. Why was this not done before? Because  conditions were not given. What the people want to know are the  measures; nonetheless, I can give you a very precise answer. We  are going to create a consensus for these measures to be  accepted by all. If we do it before the consensus is ensured,  the undermined parties will turn on us. To govern is a very  serious and difficult affair.    [Reporter] But decisions must be taken in light of the  numerous conflict of interests....    [Reina, interrupting] Honduras has progressed more during  the  first 100 days of my administration than during anytime in its  history.    I think this is what must be emphasized, not negative  things. You are right, I have a program with specific measures,  and I am examining it to gain the support of all the sectors.  This week I will hold some meetings. This past weekend I also  held meetings to present the specific measures. You shall see  that the affected persons will react. You have seen the  reactions we get every time we have said that the National  Enterprise for Electric Power [ENEE] will raise the fees of  clients who spend more than 300 kilowatts! The same is true for  oil distributors. The people think that it is just a matter of  making decisions.    First one must have the moral authority and be a legitimate  government. When you say this is chaos, do you really believe  this is chaos?    [Reporter] [words indistinct]    [Reina] This is a difficult crisis, but this government is  legitimate and prestigious. Do you think Vice President Gore's  visit to Honduras just happened? Do you think it is just a  coincidence that the president of Honduras will be one of the  important figures to attend the Cartagena de Indias Summit and  the Miami summit? This is not chaos! This is a crisis, a  crisis we inherited. This country has been looted on many  occasions. My task is to rehabilitate the country and to turn  it over in much better condition. We do not have to use terms  that create much alarm; we must use appropriate terminology.  When are we going to have specific measures? We are discussing  them with the country's various sectors to gain general  acceptance. Following the moral revolution, I proposed a  convergence. We are planning to produce that convergence in  four months. I am sure that the important sectors will accept  it and support it.    [Reporter] Some business sectors are already visibly  desperate. [Honduran Chamber of Commerce President] Eduardo  Facusse said in El Salvador, where he recently participated in a  meeting of presidents of chambers of commerce, that the Honduran  Government not only does not get started, it is also undecided.  I interpreted this reference to a crisis as a reference to your  leadership of the country. How do you respond to this?    [Reina] It is absurd to put in doubt the people's mandate.  No one is above the people, and the people gave me a mandate.  Any questioning of this mandate means betraying the people. It  is like saying: I am above that mandate. What happens is that  some people use inappropriate terms, and this is what makes the  news. The deputies issued a letter containing three  inappropriate words, and those words were the news. Mr. Facusse  has spoken in favor of the government on many occasions, but he  makes the news the moment he utters this statement, which in my  opinion was unwise, about the country not having a guide, about  hesitation. How does he know this? He represents some  interests, and the interests of that sector do not represent the  interests of the entire country. He would like for me to have  accepted the 10 percent-on-sales proposal from the very  beginning. I am not going to do it.    [Reporter] Are you upset over of what he said?    [Reina] No, no, no. I do not want to get involved in any  argument with individuals who are my friends. I am simply  explaining in general terms how inadequate it is to use certain  terms.    Today a man who I believe is in Congress, said things in  favor of seizing the government, as if this would resolve  everything. This is simple-minded, a vulgarity. I am not going  to continue using terms to describe this person.    [Reporter] Who are you talking about, Mr. President?    [Reina] About any person who uses terms that go against a  legitimate government, against a president who deserves the  respect of the Honduran people, a president who has national and  international moral authority. When anyone makes a caustic  remark against him, this is news, this is the source of  commentaries and of questions. I think this shows a lack of  maturity.    [Reporter] Mr. President, you spoke about the country having  been plundered. The people want to know who did the plundering,  now that you have used this term. They want to see the looters  in prison. Another question: The teachers want a 100-percent  salary increase. This could become a trend and other labor  unions could make similar demands.    [Reina] Three things: The people know the names of the  persons who have plundered this country. Right now there are  legal structures for announcing those names soon. I assure you  that soon a dozen names will be made known to you. Documents  are being investigated. There is no reason to rush things and  become impatient.    About teachers wanting a 100-percent salary increase, I  think  they could be somewhat correct in doing so. The problem is:  From where are we going to get 800 million lempiras to give  them this increase? The matter is being negotiated sensibly,  quietly, and very capably. The negotiators are seeking equity  to give teachers a reasonable increase within the government's  possibilities.    Regarding the last part of your question, we are about to  announce a salary increase that I think is fair, and not only  the minimum salary will be increased.    This is part of the national consensus. Everything is on  the path toward improving this country. Everything is on the  path that indicates the respect Honduras has acquired in the  international community will be advantageous to our people. I  will never fail my people.    [Reporter] Good morning. As for the current energy crisis,  it is said your government has been negligent to a certain  extent, especially in light of the Canadian atomic plant and the  Chinese plant.    [Reina] There are two separate issues here: Canada and the  atomic plant. Do you know what it would mean to build a nuclear  plant in Honduras? Those who have criticized me have no idea of  what they are saying. What would we do with the toxic waste?  Would we send it to the poor people of Honduras, as was the  case when industrialized nations wanted to send us toxic waste?  They wanted to send us toxic waste to finish poisoning us.  Where are the technicians to build this atomic plant? My name  always appears in the newspapers linked to all kinds of  ridiculous things.    [Reporter] What about the Chinese plant?    [Reina] As for the Chinese plant, bringing one from China  would cost a fortune and would take too long.    [Reporter] And Mexico?    [Reina] A plant is already coming from Mexico, and I have  already thanked the Mexican president. Two plants are coming.  We are wisely and carefully facing these problems. The  impatience... [pauses] these hesitations are not hesitations. I  have no doubts whatsoever that I am doing the right thing.  Should I have any doubts, I would hesitate.    [Reporter] Is it possible to negotiate with China to have  China finance the shipment of the plant, because the Chinese are  willing to donate it to us?    [Reina] I believe it is negotiable. However, our country  must find its own solutions. There are many countries that are  willing to assist us, and capable people are reviewing this  assistance. I am about to review the membership of certain  commissions to guarantee their efficiency.    [Reporter] [words indistinct] was already covered?    [Reina] This is a question that I [words indistinct] part of  the measures we are going to take. We cannot continue to  appraise the value of the dollar. We can no longer accept high  levels of inflation, which must be controlled, because this is  the worst tax levied on the poor people of Honduras. These are  the measures I will announce at an important news conference I  will hold in the near future.    [Reporter] How soon?    [Reina] Be patient.    [Reporter] That is very kind of you, Mr. President.    [Reina] [words indistinct]    [Moderator] This concludes President Reina's news  conference.    [Reporter] Could you ask President Reina what he thinks  about  the statements by Byron Suazo, La Paz Department Liberal deputy,  who has charged Jorge Arturo Reina is doing nothing for this  government? Suazo maintains that Jorge Reina only goes to the  National Congress to collect his paycheck, and he also questions  the moral revolution, which he has called the mortal revolution.  Suazo says only friends and relatives of the Reina family are  reaping benefits. He also has claimed that the country is on  its way to anarchy, because the current administration is only  helping its friends and relatives.    [Reina] I give you my word that these charges are false, but  I do enjoy Suazo's comments.    [Reporter] The media today reported that your environment  minister has personally benefited by placing the Environment  Ministry in a building he owns.    [Reina] This happened in the previous administration. He  requested my permission to remain there -- in a building that  meets all requirements. I gave him my permission.    [Reporter] How do you view Suazo's remarks on the moral  revolution?    [Reina] He belongs to another party. There can be no  complicity, because the contract for the building is valid.    [Moderator] [words indistinct] The president has said he  will answer no more questions.</p>

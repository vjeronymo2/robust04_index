			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Accountancy Column: Profession has a new and sympathetic friend - The corporate affairs minister is happy for accountants to handle accountancy THE UNINSPIRING exterior of the Department of Trade and Industry offices in Victoria Street, London, may not much resemble the marbled facades of Britain's accountancy firms, but the differences rapidly start to fade inside. By the time visitors reach the tenth floor, home of the minister for corporate affairs, the decor is beginning to resemble that in the offices of many accountancy firms' senior partners. Discussion with the new minister rapidly dispenses with any remaining gap. The bright red bow-tie and the frequent grins may distinguish him from Mr John Redwood, his predecessor. But in Mr Neil Hamilton the accountancy profession has found a new and sympathetic friend. A little more than seven months into his new job, Mr Hamilton is finding his feet with the issues vexing the accountancy profession, and little, he seems to believe, is in demand of much reform. The MP for Tatton, Cheshire, has survived a job as a government whip and after nine years in parliament has reached a significant ministerial position at a time of great change. Until now Hamilton has been perhaps best known for allegations against him and Mr Gerald Howarth for their alleged right-wing extremism in the infamous 1984 BBC Panorama TV programme 'Maggie's Militant Tendency'. The BBC settled out of court, and the two men were awarded damages of Pounds 20,000 each plus costs. His ideological reputation is certainly dry to the point of being Saharan. He apparently remains an unreconstructed 1980s Conservative, a defender of Mrs Margaret Thatcher to the last in the leadership challenge, and a resolute anti-Maastricht campaigner. He has already given indications of his reluctance to see greater government involvement. Over the summer, for example, he rejected calls by Names on the Lloyd's insurance market for external regulation. Now he is at work on an anti-bureaucracy drive throughout Whitehall departments. His other responsibilities include insolvency, deregulation, competition policy and company law. Hamilton evidently has many calls on his time beyond accountancy, and is unlikely to devote too much time to the subject during his period in office. But he is at last beginning to make public his views. He chose a speech in London last week to the Henley College of Management to make some of his first remarks on accountancy, tucked away behind calls for new legislation to update the 1985 Companies Act. He expanded his thoughts in an interview with the Financial Times. He strongly defends the work of the Accounting Standards Board, the Auditing Practices Board and the Financial Reporting Council. He cites the representation of users of accounts on the bodies, and the need for gradual progress to allow time for debate to settle the complex issues they involve. 'I personally think the progress being made is impressive,' he says. 'The calibre of the individuals concerned is very high.' On the subject of the system of self-regulation of accountants by their own professional bodies, he sees little reason for change and dismisses the tension some have claimed between the institutes acting as both trade associations for their members and regulators in the public interest. 'There is no evidence to show there is any conflict between (the two roles),' he says. 'There is a possibility of conflict. But the great merit of self-regulation is that it uses experts. If someone can come forward and produce an example of how a judgement has been perverted I'm prepared to consider whether it is inadequate.' 'There are some voluble, colourful critics,' he says in a reference to Mr Austin Mitchell, the Labour MP for Great Grimsby. 'But most of the causes for complaint refer to the past rather than the present or the immediate future.' On the proposals for abolition of the mandatory audit requirement for small companies, Hamilton offers greater prospects for change. 'We are consulting (on the subject) for the third time in six years,' he says. 'We keep it constantly under review. As deregulation minister, I am very keen that we should get rid of requirements which serve little purpose.' 'We have to weigh the protection for shareholders and creditors against the costs of audit,' he says. 'For those companies with very small turnover, paying very large amounts serves very little purpose. The money would be far better spent on getting decent financial advice.' He stresses that abolition is not entirely within the remit of the DTI. It would have an impact on other departments such as the Inland Revenue. But he says: 'I have to say we've heard all the arguments. Personally I am very keen. As the principal deregulatory department we are keen to ensure that costs are proportional to the benefits. For the smallest companies we do have some scope for some liberalisation. I hope we can move pretty quickly.' He appears highly sympathetic to accountants' concerns over the escalating costs of legal liability. He sees no need for any legislation to overturn the Caparo judgement in the House of Lords, which limited auditors' duty of care to the company and the shareholders collectively. He says he has received no pressing case for its reform, and points to the fact that there are no such recommendations in the interim Cadbury report on the financial aspects of corporate governance. 'Caparo seemed reasonable to me,' he says. 'If auditors' liability is extended indefinitely, and they can insure only at prohibitive cost or not at all, the knock-on effects are very serious. It could threaten the viability of the auditing system.' He says it is too early yet to assess the lessons of Maxwell but cites, as proof of action when necessary, the DTI's recent endorsement of the Bingham report's conclusions on BCCI that auditors should be required to report fraud to regulators. 'I hate to think that because of one Robert Maxwell all other company directors are going to have to assume disproportionate responsibilities,' he says. 'We have to think how much of an inhibition on the wealth creating process is a system of regulation which imposes relatively high costs for relatively small benefits.' He could have said that - and probably did - when he first came to the Commons in 1983. Accountants worried about radical reforms facing their profession will certainly not find them coming from the current DTI.' I hate to think that because of Robert Maxwell other company directors are going to have disproportionate responsibilities'</p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Russians take reform battle on to streets: Yeltsin's call for elections rebuffed THOUSANDS OF demonstrators, braving wind and rain, carried Russia's battle between conservatives and reformers on to the streets of Moscow yesterday as rival political groups held public meetings to commemorate the second anniversary of the failed hardline coup. Two years ago, Mr Boris Yeltsin was hailed as a national hero for defying hardliners from the roof of a tank parked on the steps of the White House, Russia's parliament building. Yesterday afternoon, more than 6,000 Muscovites gathered on those same steps, chanted that their president was 'a Judas' and carried bold red banners trumpeting their support for parliament. Mirroring the stalemate at the apex of Russian politics, a roughly equal number of Yeltsin backers held a rival rally on the same spot later. Mr Yeltsin yesterday asked the country's conservative parliament to agree to early elections as part of his long-running struggle with the legislators. However, the request was a largely formal gesture which was immediately shrugged off by parliamentary leaders. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the chairman of parliament and one of the president's most powerful opponents, said the legislature would not even debate the president's request. Although Mr Yeltsin claims to have a 10-week plan to force an autumn vote, his legal options appear limited. During the April referendum in which voters endorsed his market reforms, they also rejected the idea of early parliamentary elections. Russia's constitution also makes no provisions for premature elections. Next week, Mr Yeltsin is expected to pursue one of his tactics for out-manoeuvring the parliament. He has summoned regional leaders to Moscow on Monday for a meeting of the newly-created Federation Council. Mr Yeltsin hopes the council will develop into a Russian version of the Bundesrat, the German upper house which comprises representatives of the country's Lander, or states. By expanding the authority of the council, an embryonic organisation comprising Russia's regional leaders, Mr Yeltsin hopes to dilute parliament's power.</p>

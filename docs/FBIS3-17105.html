Hrynyov Are </F> Preparing a Party"]    [Text] On 15 March, the attention of journalists became  focused on a well-known organization, which has been  particularly active on the eve of the elections: The  Interregional Bloc of Reforms [MBR]. A news conference of the  MBR cochairmen Leonid Kuchma and Volodymyr Hrynyov was held in  the lecture-hall of the Union of Industrialists and  Entrepreneurs.    According to them, a few days ago, at the second regional  MBR  conference in Dnipropetrovsk, 389 out of 500 representatives of  23 Ukrainian oblasts joined the bloc, and V. Hrynyov and L.  Kuchma signed an appeal to the people of Ukraine calling upon  them to attend the elections and, of course, give support to the  candidates of the MBR. "If, on 27 March, you do not come to the  elections, this will mean that you do not want changes. If you  do not come to the elections, the policy, which has placed the  people on the verge of extinction, will continue. If you do not  come to the elections, that would mean that you deserve your  present standard of living. We call upon you to say, on 27  March, "no" to the isolationist and adventurist policy and "no"  to the collapse of the economy and to the impoverishment of the  people. We call upon you to say "yes" to Ukraine's future!"  reads the appeal.    At the beginning, as expected, the program, goals, and  principles of the MBR were discussed and, toward the end, the  personality of L. Kuchma was "dealt with." Many people were,  for example, surprised to read the article on the need to grant  equal status to the Ukrainian and Russian languages in Ukraine.  However, the two cochairmen of the MBR look upon this problem  in a quite simple and calm manner: Why should we argue about  such "petty matters" now that the economy is nearing total  collapse? In the opinion of the MBR, contacts with Russia must  be restored, and Ukraine must become a full member of the  economic CIS union. "We are convinced that Russia and Ukraine  must become strategic partners and allies," said Hrynyov.    The MBR also considers combating crime to be one of its  future tasks. According to the MBR, the method of struggle is  simple. "All power must be concentrated within a single center,"  said L. Kuchma. L. Kuchma's explanation of the so-called  Crimean issue was quite interesting: "If the wages in the  Crimea is $21 and in Russia -- $81, the striving of the Crimeans  is clear and understandable. It is necessary to grant more  freedom to regions, but this does not mean that it is necessary  to create 25 Crimeas in Ukraine." Hrynyov, for example, believes  that there must be free economic zones, but not many of them.  "I do not think that people will refer to a good place as a  "zone" [prison camp]," said L. Kuchma. "If we create a zone,  the rest of the oblasts will do everything to have such a zone  fail." L. Kuchma sees a solution to the Black Sea Fleet problem  in leasing it, together with the infrastructure, to Russia, but  doing as like normal civilized countries do -- on terms  advantageous for ourselves.    The MBR leaders are in no hurry to propose themselves as  candidates for the post of Ukrainian president. In V. Hrynyov's  opinion, it is, first, necessary to create a stable faction in  the parliament, since a future president, if he wants to work  successfully, must gain the support of the overwhelming majority  of the population and of a parliamentary majority.    The MBR leaders plan, in the case of a favorable alignment  of  forces in the parliament, to transform the MBR into a regular  political party. However this, according to them, will be  decided at the third conference, which will be held shortly  after the elections. At present, L. Kuchma is going to tour  Ukraine's electoral districts in order to win over votes for his  bloc.</p>

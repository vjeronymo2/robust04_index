			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Investors snap up Y150bn Eurobond offer from Italy THE Republic of Italy took another step forward in its international borrowing campaign yesterday with the launch of a Y150bn, 10-year Eurobond issue. Dealers said the issue was snapped up by institutional investors, many of whom were keen on the relatively high coupon and wanted to get into long-dated yen-denominated bonds ahead of a possible interest rate cut. There is plenty of speculation that the Bank of Japan may ease soon, even though the official discount rate is already at 2.5 per cent, and some investors appear to be looking for further appreciation of the yen against the US dollar, dealers said. Italy, which has an A1/AA credit rating, last tapped the Euroyen sector in 1987 with a Y150bn issue that matured last year. Yesterday's deal was priced to yield 72 basis points over the widely-followed No 145 JGB (which has a nine-year maturity), or 62 basis points over the No 157 government bond which has a 10-year maturity. Nomura, the lead manager, said the bonds traded up from the re-offer price of 99.474 to 99.50-99.52 by late afternoon. Other dealers said the coupon of 5.125 per cent was seen as attractive by investors, giving a yield of 5.2 per cent at the issue price. The lead manager looked at comparable long-dated Euroyen issues from Spain and Finland when pricing Italy's bond - these borrowers have nine-year issues trading at yield spreads of 52 basis points and 62 basis points respectively over the JGB. Among the handful of new issues in the international bond market, a Eurolira offering from UBS Finance raised some eyebrows because of its aggressive pricing. UBS Finance launched a L250bn, seven-year bond with a coupon of 9.25 per cent - the lowest coupon seen so far this year in the Eurolira sector, which has only recently grown accustomed to the idea of coupons below 10 per cent. At the re-offer price of 99.50, investors obtained a yield of 9.351 per cent, which is seen as far less generous than the yield on recent triple-A issues such as the EBRD's latest deal. Deutsche Bank London, which is joint lead for the issue with UBS, admitted that 'not every bank is pleased with the price'. However, it claimed that with the joint leads' very strong retail network, the deal would be placed 'almost entirely' with retail investors.</p>

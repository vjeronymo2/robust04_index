			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Conforming changes are made in other paragraphs of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;617.19, most significantly including a combining of the provisions of clauses (3) and (4) of paragraph (c) into a revised clause (3), and deleting the proposed clause (4). This revision makes clear that waiver revocations are determinations to which &sect;&sect;617.50 and 617.51 apply, and that such determinations shall include all of the information required for determinations under paragraph (a), including notice of appeal rights.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 35.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Waiver revocation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The NYDL commented on &sect;617.19(a)(2)(iv), which mandates inclusion of the statement that the ``waiver will be revoked at any time suitable training becomes available.'' This statement would be appropriate only for waivers issued because suitable training is not currently available; however, there are numerous situations in which training may become available and yet a revocation of waiver would not be appropriate. Accordingly, the NYDL recommended the following statement as more appropriate: ``This waiver is subject to review at 30 day intervals.'' This would afford the states the needed latitude to assess the continuing validity of a waiver should training become available but remain inappropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department agrees that the qualifying wording is too narrowly focused, but does not agree on affording States the broad latitude suggested by the NYDL. Accordingly, &sect;617.19(a)(2)(iv) is revised by deleting the term ``suitable training'' and inserting in place thereof ``appropriate and feasible training'' as provided in amended section 231(c)(2) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 36.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Waiver reasons. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The UAW commented that &sect;617.19(b)(2)(i) as drafted should be of substantial assistance to State agencies in administering this provision. The UAW suggested that, for clarity, the Department repeat the criteria that ``the worker is so situated as to be able to take full advantage of the training'' at this point in the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department believes that &sect;617.19(b)(2) adequately covers the reasons for issuing a waiver when training is not feasible or appropriate. The UAW's point is covered under the criteria for approval of training. Therefore, no change is made in the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 37.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Training limitation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Nebraska Department of Labor (NDL) commented that &sect;617.19(b)(2)(ii)(B) indicates that a course of training is not appropriate if the duration of training exceeds the individual's maximum entitlement to TRA payments. This would seem to limit appropriate training to a duration of 52 weeks when initial UI eligibility is 26 weeks. If this is the actual effect, it ignores the fact that an individual may enter training during the initial UI benefit period. When the individual enters training during the UI eligibility period, a training program of up to 78 weeks might be completed before exhausting TRA benefits. It seems further to preclude the possibility for an individual who enters training during the first 13 weeks of UI to be eligible for needs based payments under EDWAA during the portion of a training period which might extend beyond the end of TRA eligibility. If this section in fact has these effects, they may be unintended, and should perhaps be reconsidered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The TAA provisions of the Trade Act authorize the State to approve training for a worker for up to 104 weeks; however, the maximum combined duration of UI and TRA payments generally is 78 weeks. If a training program longer than the worker's remaining eligibility for UI and TRA payments is being considered, the State administering agency should ensure that the individual has the financial resources to complete the training program after TRA payments expire. If such an assurance cannot be made, a training program of shorter duration should be considered for approval. The Department therefore agrees that the regulation is too strictly worded, and &sect;617.19(b)(2)(ii)(B) is clarified in these final regulations. (See discussion in item J. above, on Revision of &sect;617.22(a)(5).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 38.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reasons for waiver. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The VDET, commenting on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;617.19(b)(2)(ii)(C), concerning reasons for issuing a waiver, asked why, after 26 weeks of UI, a person with skills for suitable employment has not become reemployed already. Simply allowing a waiver to be granted at this point in a person's unemployment seems to be at odds with the intent of all of the recently enacted Federal retraining legislation, and may actually exacerbate a situation where the worker has not been receiving the proper services which would result in new employment. The VDET recognized that there may be some circumstances where it would be unfair to the worker not to receive a waiver based on this condition. However, the VDET recommended making this condition an extreme one, by not specifically identifying it as a reason to grant a waiver.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department agrees that waivers should only be issued on a limited basis. As reflected in the VDET comment, however, there may be situations where such waivers are properly warranted. For example, when a firm agrees to employ a worker in the foreseeable future, no purpose would be served by having the worker enter training to learn other occupational skills. Therefore, the Department sees no need to make any change in the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

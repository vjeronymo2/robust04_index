			<p>BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, May 6 (XINHUA) -- Members of a United  States expedition in search of the wreckage of an American B-25  bomber met Wednesday [4 May] in Xiangshan County, Zhejiang  Province, with Chinese citizens who rescued American pilots 52  years ago.    The 19-member expedition, headed by Bryan Moon, former  vice-president of Northwest Airlines of the United States, has  ended its search of the wreckage of the No. 15 bomber in the  Xiangshan Bay.    Commanded by General Doolittle, a squadron of U.S. bombers  launched America's first air strike on Tokyo during World War II  on April 18, 1942.    The bombers were scheduled to land at the airport in Quzhou,  Zhejiang Province, but lost contact with the airport while  returning from their mission.    The airmen had to parachute from their planes after they ran  out of fuel.    It has been verified that six bombers crashed in Zhejiang  Province and that 27 airmen were rescued by local residents and  returned home, while three died.    Three bombers crashed in the sea off Xiangshan County near  Ningbo city. Ten airmen in bombers No. 7 and No. 15 were  rescued by local residents, and returned home.    Two airmen of No. 6 bomber were drowned and three others  were  rescued. While escorting the pilots to the rear, ten local  residents were shot dead by Japanese soldiers.    Attending the meeting on May 4 were seven local residents  participating in the rescue operation 52 years ago and three  descendents of the rescuers.    Two of the seven rescuers are 82 years old and two are  women.    Also attending was Henry Potter, 76, a pilot in the squadron  commanded by General Doolittle. Potter is a member of the  American expedition.    On behalf of the rescued pilots, their families and the  American people, Moon extended sincere thanks to the Chinese  rescuers and their descendents.    Two American expedition members read two letters of thanks  on  behalf of Ted Lawson, a crewman with the No. 7 bomber, and  Griffith Williams, a crewman of the No. 15 bomber, respectively.    Other members gave the rescuers badges in commemoration of  the friendship between the Chinese and American peoples.    The expedition members and rescuers vowed to carry forward  the friendship cemented 52 years ago.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Ha Chun-u: "The MND's (Ministry of National Defense) </F> Reaction to North Korea's Acceptance of Nuclear Inspections"]    [Text] With North Korea's acceptance of nuclear  inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA],  attention is now focused on whether the ROK and U.S. Governments  will suspend the Team Spirit exercise since North Korea has  demanded the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise as a  precondition for the settlement of the nuclear matter.    Regarding this, the ROK Defense Ministry, the department in  charge of the exercise, is taking a prudent attitude.    The Team Spirit exercise is a large-scale military mobile  exercise that has been staged every year since 1976 and has  played a major role in weakening North Korea's will for war.  Ever since the United States won the Gulf war by mobilizing  ultramodern weapons, North Korea bears in mind that the odds are  in favor of the United States in case a war breaks out on the  Korean peninsula. Furthermore, North Korea, terming the Team  Spirit exercise as a war exercise for northward invasion, is  learned to have been greatly menaced by the exercise, and  assumed emergency alert posture while the annual exercise was  conducted.    Such being the case, the MND maintains that the question on  calling off the exercise is certain to be an effective  bargaining chip for resolution of the nuclear issue.    The MND assumes a stance that North Korea's acceptance of  nuclear inspection cannot be seen as the resolution of the  nuclear issue but, at best, a return to the situation before it  announced its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty. Its reason is that there are other problems that need  to be solved, including the inspection of undeclared sites, to  prove its nonpossession of nuclear weapons. In a nutshell, the  MND thinks the time is not ripe to discuss the issue at the  present stage,    The MND sees that the suspension of this year's Team Spirit  can only be discussed when IAEA inspections are actually carried  out in North Korea and the exchange of North-South special  envoys gets good results.    Only when these demands are met, the MND maintains, should  there be the ROK-U.S. joint announcement on the suspension of  the Team Spirit exercise, along with the agenda for the third  round of North Korea-U.S. talks.    The MND has also made clear that an expression of the will  to  suspend the exercise does not correspond to the suspension of  the exercise. This means that it will announce the skipping of  this year's exercise only when tangible achievements are seen in  IAEA nuclear inspections and the exchange of special envoys.    Judging that IAEA inspection will take at least two weeks.  The MND notes that if North Korea shows a sincerity in  negotiations for North-South mutual nuclear inspections and the  third round of high-level talks with the United States during  this period, it may announce the suspension of this year's  exercise.    Before the final decision is made, chances are high that its  intention to call off Team Spirit may be expressed through a  government-level channel toward the end of February or early  March, however, this is eligible to change during the  negotiating process with the North.    Taking into account that North Korea has employed a  foot-dragging tactic in negotiating inspection-related issues  until now, the MND predicts that North Korea is much likely to  express its intention to receive nuclear inspections before the  IAEA Board of Governors' Meeting slated for 21 February for the  moment and then delay inspections of undeclared sites to the  extent that Team Spirit cannot be conducted. This is what the  MND is concerned about.    In this perspective, the MND position is that the question  on  whether to cancel the exercise or not is effective in resolving  the North Korean nuclear issue and that it should be used as a  final bargaining chip to the maximum until North Korea clears  its attitude.    It was learned that the MND is discussing with the United  States whether or not the ROK may make the final decision on  suspending or conducting the Team Spirit exercise, at least this  year, instead of sharing the decision with the United States.</p>

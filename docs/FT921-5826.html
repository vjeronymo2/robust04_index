			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Survey of North Oxfordshire (7): Stay here, but go there - Prospects for the tourist industry CHARLES I occupied Banbury after the battle of Edgehill in 1642. The town supported Parliament, but the castle sided with the king. The difference of opinion, which prompted the king to move his headquarters to Oxford, cost Banbury most of the monuments which would have made it a tourist centre. The Puritans pulled down the Banbury Cross mentioned in the nursery rhyme and the castle was destroyed after King Charles was executed. Subsequent generations showed no more regard for their historic sites. Banbury's medieval church, known as 'the cathedral', was demolished in 1790 and most of the timber-framed houses were engulfed by fire. With few major sites of their own, Banbury and the nearby towns of Bicester and Kidlington have developed a tourist industry which relies on attractions outside the immediate district. The towns are marketed as pleasant places to stay for those whose main destination is Stratford-upon- Avon, Oxford or Warwick. The lack of accommodation in Oxford and Warwick is seen by Cherwell district council as a good opportunity for the region's hoteliers. The council maintains that there are attractions worth visiting, including the Civil War battlefields and stately homes such as Broughton Castle. Certainly, there is no shortage of hotel rooms. Occupancy rates have fallen by over 10 per cent since 1989, a survey by the Thames and Chilterns Tourist Board shows. The number of tourist trips to the region declined by 250,000 in the same period, says the survey. The downturn has forced the Banburyshire Tourism Association to close. Mr Michael Nugent, manager of the Whateley Hotel in Banbury, says the association members were having to spend so much time trying to keep their own businesses afloat that they couldn't do anything for tourism. Concerned at the fragile state of the tourist industry, the council has adopted a three-pronged strategy to attract more visitors to the Cherwell region. First, its brochures continue to publicise attractions outside the area to promote Cherwell as an alternative place to stay. These non-Oxfordshire attractions include George Washington's ancestral home in Northamptonshire and the Cotswolds to the south-west. Secondly, the council wants to attract more visitors on day trips and weekend breaks. Among its rural attractions, the council lists the Oxford canal, a popular waterway for pleasure boats, which it calls a 'linear park'. But weekend breaks and promotional literature pale into insignificance against the third area where Cherwell sees tourist potential: business trips. With direct motorway access to London and Birmingham, North Oxfordshire wants to attract more business visitors. 'We are well placed for the conference trade,' says Mr Grahame Handley, chief executive of Cherwell district council. Confident of an upswing in business tourism, the council has given planning consent for two new hotels near the Banbury junction on the M40 and consent for one near Bicester. North Oxfordshire's existing hotels are not waiting for an upturn before pursuing conference business. Of the 21 hotels listed in the district council's tourism brochure, 20 already cater for conferences. They range from the three-bedroom Duke of Cumberland Inn at Deddington, charging less than Pounds 15 a night, to the 74-room Whateley Hotel offering facilities for up to 120 people and a room rate starting at Pounds 77. At the top end of the scale, Cornbury Park is flourishing. A large private estate north of Woodstock, it includes Britain's largest remaining royal hunting forest. Businessmen can book a day's shooting for up to seven marksmen. Most 'corporate days' end with 400 birds in the bag at a total cost of about Pounds 7,600. But Cornbury Park's formula is unlikely to be taken up elsewhere in North Oxfordshire. 'We are not in that kind of business,' says Mr Handley. 'What we want is a tourist industry which caters for the hotel and conference requirements of other businesses. 'But in the end we have to face it: tourism is not a major industry in this area.'</p>

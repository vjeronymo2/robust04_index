			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Franc rises after Bank of France cuts interest rates FRANCE yesterday pulled off a double coup, after months of monetary rigour, when it cut its official interest rates and saw the franc rise on the foreign exchanges. The cuts by the Bank of France - in its intervention rate from 9.10 per cent to 8.75 per cent and in its five-10 day repurchase rate from 10 per cent to 9.75 per cent - reflected recent declines in domestic money market rates. Further cuts, essential to reviving France's stalled economy, would have to follow similar moves by the Bundesbank, economists in Paris agreed. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the finance minister, hailed the 'very favourable' performance of the franc which closed in Paris at FFr3.378 to the D-Mark. But he acknowledged this reflected the fact that the official interest rate cuts just 'consolidated' movements on the money markets since the centre-right came into government last month. Later today Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, is due to put the finishing touches to a draft statute to give the Bank of France autonomy in monetary policy. At the weekend he indicated that one possible difficulty had been resolved by his decision to leave responsibility for supervising commercial banks with the French central bank, in contrast to the system in Germany where banking control does not lie with the Bundesbank. But when he holds his first meeting with German chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn on Thursday, Mr Balladur will be able to press his case for closer Franco-German co-operation by arguing that France is well along the institutional road towards a German-style monetary policy. Shares on the Paris bourse in fact fell slightly. Bank economists said it would take a bigger drop in rates to persuade French investors to start switching their savings out of money market funds into equities but that such a switch was necessary for the big privatisation programme planned by the government.

			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: 'TOON TALK  </P> <P> Happiness Is a Warm Petit Chien: Cartoonist Charles Schulz drew lofty praise  from the keepers of French culture Tuesday as they lavishly celebrated the 40th  birthday of America's favorite floppy-eared dog, the irrepressible Snoopy. The  beagle was glorified with a giant retrospective at the Decorative Arts Museum  in the northern wing of the Louvre complex.  </P> <P> The show, which features 300 stuffed Snoopies dressed by the world's leading  fashion designers and original "Peanuts" drawings, opened to the public today  and runs through April 22. French Culture Minister Jack Lang named Schulz a  Commander of Arts and Letters, one of France's highest awards for excellence in  the arts. Lang told Schulz, "Your character is both mythical and hedonistic and  he has taken over our collective consciousness and become a part of our  everyday lives." Negotiations are under way to bring the exhibit to the Los  Angeles County Museum of Natural History. Claudia Puig  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAMMER'S MUSEUM  </P> <P> Knight's criticism of Hammer is unjust and unfounded. When the Daumier  collection was housed at LACMA, the director could not be bothered to see that  titles and captions were correctly translated; you never knew what hideous  howler would greet you (I remember "Une Meprise a l'Odeon" given as "A Wicked  Man at the Odeon" instead of "A Mistake at the Odeon").  </P> <P> LACMA's gross negligence cannot be hidden by continual and continually  uninspired construction.  </P> <P> Mr. Hammer has done what any intelligent man would do -- he has taken his  Leonardo codex, his Daumiers and his Van Gogh from a place where they were not  wanted.  </P> <P> C.

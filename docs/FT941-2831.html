			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bekaert recovery continues Bekaert, the Belgian wire and steel cord producer, yesterday announced net profits of BFr2.2bn (Dollars 60m). The result marked the second year in which Bekaert had succeeded in breaking out of its former loss-making position, after the BFr1.05bn sale of its shares in a Japanese steel cord joint venture had boosted its total profits last year to BFr2.71bn. Without this item profits were ahead 35 per cent. Baron Jean Charles Velge, chairman, said although the market for steel and wire cord continued to suffer from falling prices and currency devaluation, Bekaert had boosted profits by expanding into key niche areas. The board has proposed a dividend of BFr300 per share, up from BFr250 in 1992. CBR, the Belgium cement company, announced that operating profits before depreciation had risen by 5.7 per cent last year to BFr10bn. But with most of the rise due to improvements from its US operations and profits from its newly acquired East European cement works, the group admitted it had experienced a difficult year in Western Europe. As a result the board proposed the dividend per share should fall to BFr604, down from BFr606 the previous year. The results were the first indication of the group's performance since Heidelberg Zement, the German construction group, bought a 43 per cent stake in the company from Societe Generale de Belgique last September.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Just as several other publications have recently  done, the DIENA newspaper today published the names of the  possible KGB five who in their time collaborated with the State  Security Committee. They are: [Latvian minister without  portfolio] Edvins Inkens, [Latvian Foreign Minister] Georgs  Andrejevs, Roberts Milbergs [member of the For the Fatherland  and Freedom group], Andrejs Silins [a Latvian Way group deputy],  and Aivars Kreituss [a Democratic Centre group deputy].    In an interview with DIENA, Romans Apsitis, associate  chairman of the Commission on Mandates and Ethics, declined to  either confirm or disprove this information. But there is more  about this in today's issue.</p>

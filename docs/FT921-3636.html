			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Move to asset finance as EFT advances 40% EFT GROUP, the Scottish financial services company, has pulled out of corporate finance activities and is to concentrate on its asset finance operations. It reported pre-tax profit up 40 per cent at Pounds 1.07m for the year to December 31. Revenue rose almost 10 per cent at Pounds 7.55m. Mr Peter Stevenson is stepping down as chairman to become a non-executive director. Mr Hamish Grossart, group managing director, is to become chairman with part-time executive responsibilities. The moves are a further scaling-down of the ambitions of EFT, which only two years ago still hoped to become a mini-financial conglomerate and spoke of adding a London office to its ones in Edinburgh and Glasgow. EFT was created in 1987 by Mr Grossart and Mr Hugh Barry, who had earlier worked for Noble Grossart, the Edinburgh merchant bank chaired by Mr Angus Grossart, Mr Hamish Grossart's uncle. They took control of Edinburgh Financial Trust, a quoted investment trust which gave up its trust status, and acquired teams of asset finance specialists and fund managers to complement their own skills in corporate finance. In early 1989 Mr Barry left and was replaced as chairman by Mr Stevenson, a former Noble Grossart director. However the corporate finance operations suffered from lack of business with the downturn in the economy, and last January Glasgow Fund Managers, the fund management operation, was sold. The corporate finance operation made a profit of only Pounds 72,000 in 1991 and was closed in January. Net outstanding receivables for the asset finance operation, which concentrates on leasing and hire purchase involving vehicles, were up 22 per cent at Pounds 47.9m while borrowings were Pounds 34.7m. After write-offs, provisions amounted to 1.61 per cent of outstanding receivables (1.15 per cent in 1991). The group recorded an extraordinary item of Pounds 150,000 consisting mainly of provisions for the fall in value of investments offset by gains on the sale of investments. Earnings per share were 2.22p (1.62p) and the proposed final dividend is 0.77p making a total of 1.1p (1p).</p>

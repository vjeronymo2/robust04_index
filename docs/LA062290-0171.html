			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MANDELA URGES U.N. TO MAINTAIN ITS SANCTIONS  </P> <P> Nelson Mandela, symbol of black African liberation, urged the United Nations  today to maintain sanctions against South Africa until apartheid is abolished  and warned of danger from armed white racists.  </P> <P> Calling apartheid a "crime against humanity," Mandela said, "We strongly urge  that there should be no relaxation of existing measures.  </P> <P> The sanctions that have been imposed by the United Nations and by individual  governments should remain in place."  </P> <P> In remarks to the U.N. Committee Against Apartheid, Mandela also issued a  warning against white racists among civilians, the army and police in South  Africa.  </P> <P> "There are many among our white compatriots who are still committed to the  maintenance of the evil system of white minority domination," he said. "Some  are ideologically committed to racism, while others fear democratic majority  rule."  </P> <P> Mandela arrived to a standing ovation at the United Nations for what was  generally regarded as the most important address of his U.S. tour.  </P></p>

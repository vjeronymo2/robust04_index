			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARTY PROPOSES RADICAL CHANGE IN SOVIET SYSTEM  </P> <P> The Soviet Communist Party on Saturday proposed reforms that would transform  the country's highly centralized political and economic system into one based  on federalism with extensive freedoms for its constituent republics and  regions.  </P> <P> A crucial element in the broad reforms now under way here, the move will  reshape the Soviet Union, according to the party's policy document on ethnic  issues, and it calls for extensive negotiations to reach a new constitutional  formula for the country.  </P> <P> Although the new system is intended primarily to pull the Soviet Union out of  its current crisis over inter-ethnic relations by giving the scores of  non-Russian minorities greater autonomy, the break with the past will be so  sharp -- "a radical change," in the words of the party statement -- that other  political, economic and social reforms will also be accelerated and expanded.  </P> <P> "Solving ethnic problems is crucial for perestroika and the future of the  country," the party statement declares. "Such a solution can and must be found  only in the course of a revolutionary renewal of Soviet society. . . .  Harmonization of inter-ethnic relations on a new basis is a supreme goal of the  party's nationalities policy."  </P> <P> The policy statement, approved at last week's meeting of the party's Central  Committee, calls for negotiations to reach a new balance of powers between the  central government and the 15 constituent republics and proposes the drafting  of a new "founding document" for the Soviet Union to replace the one adopted in  1922.  </P> <P> The negotiations would attempt to transfer into the political forum the sharp  ethnic conflicts that have disrupted the country for the past 18 months and  left nearly 300 people dead.  </P> <P> But their scope would reach far beyond resolution of the demands of Estonians,  Latvians and Lithuanians for the independence of their republics or of  Armenians and Azerbaijanis over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.  </P> <P> In the process of resolving the relationship between the central government and  the constituent republics, of the republics among themselves and of small  minorities within this new framework, the process of political change would  grow, Soviet commentators acknowledged in presenting the policy statement.  </P> <P> With a new constitution under discussion by the Congress of People's Deputies,  the new national assembly, these negotiations would give the new charter a  focus much different from the present constitution.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Central Government's Powers  </P> <P> The party proposes that the central government have the legislative power  necessary to "define priorities in economic and political development" of the  country as a whole, to provide for its security and defense, to conduct foreign  policy and to undertake agreed tasks in the management of the economy, culture,  science and human rights.  </P> <P> But the republics, largely formed on the basis of ethnic groups around the  periphery of the old Russian Empire, would retain full authority in all matters  except those that they agree to delegate to the central government. In the  event of disputes, they would be able to appeal to a constitutional court.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union's present pyramid of political power gives the central  government -- and the party leadership above it -- virtually absolute authority  on any issue. Although the constituent republics legally formed the Soviet  Union, the working reality has been that they are creations of the Communist  Party and of the central government and thus subservient to them.  </P> <P> The policy document stresses that each of the republics would maintain its  "sovereignty and independence" under the new federal system, which would be  based on their "voluntary association" to form the Soviet Union. The party says  that it intends to move away from the current constitutional framework in which  such rights exist -- but only on paper.  </P> <P> The republics range in size from the giant Russian Republic with a population  of 148 million to Armenia with 3.5 million and Estonia with only 1.6 million  people. Each person would be a citizen of both his own republic and of the  Soviet Union, a measure intended to answer criticism of past Soviet policy as  "Russification" and forced assimilation.  </P> <P> The new policy would give the republics primary responsibility for their own  economies, and it encourages them to move more boldly into market socialism.  They would own the natural resources in their territory and would operate the  industrial and commercial enterprises that are now state-owned. They would be  required, however, to pursue economic efficiency, full employment and "social  justice."  </P> <P> The Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania won permission from the  Supreme Soviet, the national legislature, to move next year onto a new economic  footing in which they will operate on a profit-and-loss basis independently of  the huge central ministries that control most of the Soviet economy.  </P> <P> With their new authority envisioned in the party's policy statement, the  republics would be able to legalize the other political parties that are  rapidly emerging and to adopt different governmental systems to replace the  identical "Soviet socialist republic" models they now have.  </P> <P> They would also be able to maintain their own contacts with foreign countries  and international organizations, according to the policy statement.  </P> <P> To protect minorities, the party plans to push for adoption of further  constitutional guarantees of individual human rights and for greater authority  for those autonomous regions where minority groups live. Religious observance,  which will be protected by a new law on the freedom of conscience, would be  able to play a far greater role than it has in the past in the republics and  autonomous regions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Small Ethnic Groups  </P> <P> In addition, the central government would continue its development efforts  among the small ethnic groups of Siberia, the Arctic region and the Soviet Far  East.  </P> <P> The party calls in its policy statement for the use of local languages as a  basic right as well as for the protection of ethnic cultures, but it says that  Russian should be kept as the national language countrywide for ease of  communication.  </P> <P> On Saturday, the Central Asian republic of Kirghizia, following similar actions  by Kazakhstan and Tadzhikistan, made its local language, Kirghiz, the  republic's official language. There were heated objections from Russians and  others who wanted to retain Russian, now relegated to the status of "the  language of inter-ethnic communication."  </P> <P> In the country's continuing unrest, three more people were reported killed and  five injured in renewed clashes between ethnic Russians and Kazakhs in the  Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan. The official news agency Tass said that  groups armed with sticks, stones and metal bars fought in the town of  Semipalatinsk on Thursday.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COWBELL CONCERT?  </P> <P> Bill Kohlhaase's June 19 review of the Playboy Jazz Festival was lacking in its  coverage. Every artist was mentioned except guitarist Larry Carlton.  </P> <P> I would rather read about Carlton (who gave one of the day's strongest  performance) than Bill Cosby's interest in playing the cowbell.  </P> <P> JOHN L.

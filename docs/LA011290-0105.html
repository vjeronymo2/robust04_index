			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONE SUIT FILED, ANOTHER OKD TO OPPOSE PRISONS  </P> <P> Although Los Angeles County contributes about 40% of the state's prison  population, local officials in two separate actions Thursday opposed proposed  state prisons for an industrial area near the Civic Center and in the Antelope  Valley.  </P> <P> Carrying through on their threats, Los Angeles city officials and Eastside  activists filed a lawsuit in the morning to block construction of a 1,450-bed  facility on a 20-acre site next to the Los Angeles River. Later in the day, the  county Board of Supervisors voted to sue to block a similar facility on  county-owned land in Lancaster.  </P> <P> "Nobody wants these prisons," explained urban planner Frank Villalobos, head of  a Latino coalition that opposes the downtown prison next to the Los Angeles  River at Santa Fe Avenue and Olympic Boulevard.  </P> <P> At present, there are no state prisons in the county. The two proposed sites  were part of a delicate compromise worked out in the Legislature several years  ago. They were linked after Democratic lawmakers from Los Angeles complained  that Republican constituents in rural parts of the county ought to accept equal  share of the prison burden.  </P> <P> Under a legislative compromise, neither prison could be occupied until  construction is begun on the other.  </P> <P> But that did little to quell opposition to either proposal.  </P> <P> The lawsuit filed Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court, for example, is but  the latest move in the five-year fight against the prison by Latino activists  and others who contend that Eastside neighborhoods have more than their share  of jails.  </P> <P> The suit said the state Department of Corrections violated state guidelines by  ignoring environmental considerations concerning the proposed prison. Although  an environmental impact report was approved for the site, the suit argued that  the EIR was inadequate because it ignored the impact on the character and  social fabric of the surrounding neighborhoods.  </P> <P> The suit said state planners also failed to study possible soil contamination  from toxics in the area.  </P> <P> The lawsuit challenged the constitutionality of SB18, the compromise bill that  authorized the two prison sites in the county.  </P> <P> "By authorizing two different prisons, neither one of which could be passed  without the other in the same legislation, passage of this bill . . .  constituted classic 'logrolling,' in violation of the California Constitution,"  the suit said.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for the Department of Corrections said she regretted the  lawsuit's filing.  </P> <P> "We are disappointed that the city of Los Angeles did not see fit to work with  us on this much-needed project," spokeswoman Christine May said from  Sacramento. "We feel confident that the environmental impact report will pass  any scrutiny."  </P> <P> City Councilwoman Gloria Molina, a longtime prison foe, said it hurt her to  review the 113-page lawsuit as it was filed in the downtown County Courthouse.  </P> <P> "It was very painful because, as I'm reading it, I'm reliving all of those  years of protests against it," she said. "It's painful to see the utter  disregard for this community, which doesn't want this prison."  </P> <P> State Sen. Art Torres, Assemblywoman Lucille Roybal-Allard and City Councilman  Richard Alatorre, all local Democrats, are also plaintiffs in the lawsuit.  </P> <P> The county supervisors, on a 3-0 vote, agreed to sue the state to block the  Lancaster prison at the urging of Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who termed as  "frivolous" the lawsuit against the downtown site.  </P> <P> The supervisor said he opposes the Mira Loma site in Lancaster because the  county has owned the 232-acre parcel of land for 42 years and now needs it to  provide the fast-growing Antelope Valley with expanded hospital, police  protection, probation, animal care and other services.  </P> <P> "Of all the places, they picked the one owned by the county for 42 years,"  Antonovich said. He said the state's acquisition of that site for a prison  would amount to "double taxation," in that county taxpayers would have to pay  for land to replace the Mira Loma site, which is located at Avenue J and 60th  Street West in Lancaster.  </P> <P> Antonovich would not say when a suit would be filed by the county, which can  legally challenge the prison environmental impact report until Jan. 29. He and  fellow Supervisor Deane Dana suggested that the state move the prison to  state-owned property in Hungry Valley, a remote area west of I-5 and south of  Gorman.  </P> <P> The Lancaster City Council last week voted to authorize a lawsuit to block the  Mira Loma prison site but has not yet filed it.  </P></p>

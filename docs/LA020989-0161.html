			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA STARS DECIDE TO HEAD NORTH  </P> <P> Many Southland high school football stars signed letters of intent with  colleges outside of Southern California Wednesday, with three Pacific 10  schools leading the way.  </P> <P> Stanford scored big in the Southland, signing five local players including Bob  Whitfield, Wilmington Banning's 6-foot-7, 285-pound offensive lineman.  </P> <P> "I based my decision to go to Stanford on the total package of the school,"  Whitfield said Wednesday night. "I liked the school's academic and athletic  program, along with the area it is in."  </P> <P> Looking back at the last two years of being heavily recruited, Whitfield said:  "At times the whole thing could be strenuous. I am glad that it's over."  </P> <P> Other local players joining Whitfield at Stanford are 5-8 kicker Paul  Stonehouse and safety Jimmy Klein of L.A. Loyola; quarterback Ron Redell of  Encino Crespi, and center Rick Pallow of Santa Ana Mater Dei.  </P> <P> California signed seven local high school seniors and four local junior college  players.  </P> <P> Among the seniors signed was Carson quarterback Perry Klein.  </P> <P> "I was hoping when I committed to Cal more than a month and half ago that I  could help influence others with their decision," said Klein, who led the Colts  to the City 4-A Division title.  </P> <P> Klein said he talked with Russell White before the Crespi running back decided  to attend Cal.  </P> <P> "I think that I really did help influence Russell and Kevin Kelly (of Santa  Monica, who also signed with the Bears) with their decision," Klein said. "Cal  is a school that has a football program that is going in the right direction."  </P> <P> Other high school players who signed with the Bears are tailback Greg Zomalt of  Moreno Valley Canyon Springs, defensive lineman Todd Steussie of Agoura,  offensive lineman Chris Lippincott of Huntington Beach Edison, quarterback  Perry Klein of Carson, offensive lineman Andy Gonzales of Banning, and  defensive back Darryl Brown of Playa del Rey St. Bernard.  </P> <P> The junior college players are tight end Ken Griggs and offensive lineman,  Darryl Pessler of Orange Coast College, offensive lineman James Richards of  Antelope Valley, and defensive lineman Steve Smock of Cerritos.  </P> <P> Arizona boosted its ground game by signing two local running backs, Errol Sapp  of Carson, the City player of the year, and Lamont Lovett of Franklin, the  City's leading rusher last season with 2,201 yards.  </P> <P> Arizona State signed quarterback David Walsh of Palos Verdes, linebacker Jason  Martin of Hacienda Heights Los Altos, and tight end Brian Ryder of Huntington  Beach Edison.  </P> <P> Washington State signed six local high school seniors -- running backs Phillip  Bobo of Moreno Valley and Takim Brown of L.A. Washington, linebacker Christian  Elias and lineman Brandon Griman of Apple Valley, linebacker Anthony McClanahan  of Bakersfield, and linebacker Vince Saldivar of Anaheim Servite.  </P> <P> Oregon State got St. Bernard linebacker Doug Nelson and Banning defensive back  Paul Montgomery.  </P> <P> The University of the Pacific recruited well in Orange County, signing  all-county quarterbacks David Henigan of Fountain Valley and Troy Kopp of  Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> Henigan was named the Southern Section Division I co-player of the year after  leading his team to the Division I title. Kopp, who was second-team all-county,  led Mission Viejo to the Division III semifinals. Pacific also signed running  back Rob Kerns of Atascadero High, offensive lineman Chad Barron of Fontana,  fullback Samila Manu of Carson, offensive lineman Fred Clark of Santa Monica  College, and nose guard Jim Garvisch of Fountain Valley.  </P> <P> Pacific also signed El Camino College linebackers Deren Brady and Edwin  Ulufanua, running back Brian Connors and defensive lineman Donnie Humphrey.  </P> <P> San Diego State signed three Banning players, defensive lineman Carlton  Leomiti, offensive lineman Tom Siufanua and defensive back Eric Williams.  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton signed 22 recruits, headed by San Fernando defensive backs  Howard McCrary, and Keary Johns. The Titans also signed wide receivers Johnny  Lawrence of Banning and Shawn Facione of Placentia El Dorado.  </P> <P> Colorado signed Dorsey quarterback Roman Foster and defensive lineman  Marcellous Elder of Long Beach Poly.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Donna Carter contributed to this story.  </P></p>

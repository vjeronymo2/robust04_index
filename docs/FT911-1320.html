			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / International Company News: SocGen to take Lodestar stake SOCIETE Generale, the French private sector bank, is planning to make a debut in the US mergers and acquisitions market by taking a minority stake in Lodestar, a Wall Street takeover specialist. The deal, for an undisclosed sum, brings SocGen alongside Yamaichi Securities, one of the four big Japanese securities houses, which took a 20 per cent stake in Lodestar's M&amp;A advisory business on the US group's formation two years ago. It comes after a year in which French companies have made several large US acquisitions, such as glass-maker Saint-Gobain's purchase of Norton, the industrial abrasives group, the hotel company Accor's takeover of Motel 6, a chain of cut-price hotels and the takeover of Edgcomb, the steel merchant, by Usinor Sacilor. SocGen will buy an undisclosed amount of shares both from Yamaichi and from Lodestar's partners, who own the remaining 80 per cent of the equity. There would be no issue of new capital, the French bank said. The US Federal Reserve Board's approval is needed. Lodestar and SocGen aim to combine forces to find purchasers for companies for sale in their respective territories, though their M&amp;A teams, which are of similar size, will remain separate. Lodestar's 20 M&amp;A specialists advised on Dollars 2.8bn of acquisitions last year. SocGen's 22 specialists in Paris, London and Frankfurt, advised on FFr4.7bn (Dollars 796m) worth of deals involving French companies last year, according to PF Publications, the French mergers magazine. Lodestar, one of the growing number of Wall Street investment banking and takeover specialists, was formed by Mr Ken Miller, former head of M&amp;A at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets and Mr Tull Gearreald, former managing director of corporate finance. They later attracted Mr Robert Baldwin, former chairman and president of Morgan Stanley, to come in as partner and chairman.</p>

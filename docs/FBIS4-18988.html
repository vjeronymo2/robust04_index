			<p>BFN     [Text] Before ending this bulletin we return to the story  with which we began -- the bombing of Serb positions near  Gorazde by NATO planes. The Foreign Ministry has told Spanish  Television that this bombing was of a limited warning nature and  has the support of the Spanish Government, which is always in  favor of UN resolutions being fulfilled. We have just received  some statements made by Defense Minister Julian Garcia Vargas,  who, apart from confirming Spanish support for NATO's action,  said that the Spanish soldiers serving with the United Nations  are in no danger. The Spanish soldiers are fulfilling their  missions with complete normality away from the bombing.    [Begin Vargas recording] Therefore, what has been done is to  extend to that town the threat that was issued at the time for  Sarajevo, although in the latter case at the last moment it was  not necessary to carry out the threat. I think this was a  correct decision and shows that the United Nations is adamant  that the agreements should be respected, the resolutions should  be applied, and that the conflict bit by bit should be  channelled along the road of negotiation. It is a combination  of negotiation supported by force. And I repeat that the most  important way is the political way, the way of negotiation, but  if at times it has to be reinforced with the use of force then I  think that this is reasonable.

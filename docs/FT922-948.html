			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Kenwood just over-subscribed THE PUBLIC offering of shares in Kenwood, the kitchen appliance manufacturer which will begin trading on the market next week, was only just over-subscribed, Schroders, the merchant bank sponsoring the flotation said yesterday. Subscribers will therefore be allocated only slightly less than they wanted. Some 11.61m shares were on offer. The same number of Kenwood shares were placed with insititutions at 285p on June 17, valuing the group at Pounds 104.5m. Schroders said it was aware that there was institutional demand for shares at the placing stage which had not been immediately satisfied. The same institutions did not, however, appear to have applied in any great scale for additional shares in the public offering. Analysts said the relatively low subscription level and the soggy nature of the market in general might lead advisers to other imminent flotations - like MFI, Taunton and Anglian Windows - to reconsider their pricing in order to avoid leaving shares with underwriters. The Kenwood placing was structured in such a way that institutions which applied for shares in the placing also participated in underwriting the public offering. Analysts said that given the current gloom pervading the stock market, the institutions declined the public offering because they were nervous they might be left with an undersubscribed offer. Depending on conditions in the stock market, the institutions could try to build the stakes they require in the aftermarket once the shares start to trade on July 1. Analysts do not expect the shares to open at a significant premium to the flotation price.</p>

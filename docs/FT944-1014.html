Mining losses rose to Pounds 781,000 (Pounds 5,000), although the car dealership made profits of Pounds 77,000. Group turnover grew to Pounds 5.46m (Pounds 1.57m) and losses per share were 3.95p (0.26p). The next accounting period will be for nine months ending December 31. In order to keep central costs to a minimum and maximise resources available to the Millenium Rover division, the salary of Mr Gerald Davison, chairman, will be cut by a third to Pounds 20,000, while Messrs Honychurch and Pritchard have resigned as directors.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The clique has once again accused Uganda, with the  aim of claiming to the world that that country had attacked  Rwanda, so that the world community would feel pity and  expresses support for them. They hope for a repetition of the  situation in 1990, when the same lies were used and gave France  a pretext to come to their rescue. Sindikubwabo and his friends  should know that we are no longer in 1990. We are now in 1994,  when lies and pretexts are no longer reasons, nor are they  easily accepted, since the Rwandan issue is already known.  There is no need to try to regionalize the problem -- that is  not the disease from which our country is suffering.</p>

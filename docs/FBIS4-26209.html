			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 15 Jun (XINHUA) -- The General Office of  the CPC Central Committee [CPCCC] and the State Council General  Office recently issued a circular on exercising strict control  over lottery ticket markets and on prohibiting approval to issue  lottery tickets without proper authorization.    The circular says: In disregarding the relevant regulations  of the CPCCC and the State Council, a small number of localities  recently issued lottery tickets without the authorization of the  State Council. The departments concerned are now dealing with  this problem. To safeguard the overall state of the national  economy, to ensure social stability, and to exercise strict  control over lottery ticket markets, the General Office of the  CPCCC and the State Council General Office, with the approval of  the CPCCC and the State Council, hereby issue the following  requirements:    1. The 1991 "Circular of the State Council Concerning the  Strengthening the Management of Lottery Ticket Markets" and the  1993 "Circular of the State Council Concerning the Further  Strengthening the Management of Lottery Ticket Markets" clearly  stipulate that only the State Council has the authority to  approve the issuance of lottery tickets, and that no other  localities and departments have such authority. The handling of  lottery tickets whose issuance has been approved should be  carried out in accordance with the plans approved by the State  Council. The number of such lottery tickets issued or the  methods of their issue should not be changed without  authorization. Lottery tickets whose numbers are freely chosen  by purchasers (including "six-number combination lottery  tickets," "four-number combination lottery tickets" and "lottery  tickets with numbers from 1 to 10,000") shall not be issued.  The issuance of lottery tickets that are jointly sponsored by  Chinese and foreign enterprises on China's territory shall be  stopped. Relevant agreements reached with foreign partners  concerning the lottery tickets are null and void. The circular  issued by the General Office of the CPCCC and the State Council  General Office reiterates that all localities and departments  should conscientiously carry out this circular. They should not  violate it for any reason.    2. All localities should conduct a self-examination drive to  consolidate local lottery ticket markets. Rectifying measures  should be taken in a set period for any lottery tickets that  were issued by localities and departments, including lottery  tickets whose numbers could be freely chosen by purchasers and  lottery tickets that were jointly sponsored by Chinese and  foreign enterprises on China's territory. In addition,  conscientious efforts should be made to handle the problems  arising from the cancellation of these lottery tickets. If  localities and units still ignore orders and prohibitions and  continue to approve or issue lottery tickets or purposely  postpone the self-examination drive to consolidate the lottery  ticket markets, their responsible leaders should be dealt with  severely.    3. Printing firms not possessing the authorization to print  lottery tickets are not allowed to print them. Printing firms  which are assigned to print lottery tickets should not print any  lottery tickets without first getting authorization from the  State Council or from the departments authorized by the State  Council. People's governments in all localities should organize  local public security bureaus, industrial and commercial  administrations, people's banks, and other relevant departments  to strengthen the supervision and inspection of printing firms  so as to exercise strict control over them.    4. Relevant departments of the State Council should  strengthen their supervision and management of lottery ticket  markets. The People's Bank of China is an organ under the State  Council that is in charge of matters relating to lottery  tickets. The People's Bank of China, with help from the  Ministry of Civil Affairs, the State Physical Cultural and  Sports Commission, and the State Administration for Industry and  Commerce, should try to do a good job of managing lottery ticket  markets.</p>

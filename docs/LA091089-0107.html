			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PROBLEMS OF GROWTH  </P> <P> Regarding Tom Gorman's story on the school shortage ("Students, Students  Everywhere and Nary a Place to Sit," Sept. 5).  </P> <P> Amen, Amen and Amen again -- there are not enough schools available for all the  new homes being built in San Diego. Builders march merrily over hill and dale,  constructing houses cheek-by-jowl, selling them for astronomical sums, and  leaving behind shortages not only of schools, but of libraries, parks and other  public amenities, not to mention increases in traffic on our already distressed  system.  </P> <P> Enter Prevent Los Angelization Now, a group (formerly known as Citizens for  Limited Growth) which is sponsoring an initiative to ensure that new  development pays for itself.  </P> <P> PLAN! stands for more than merely growth management. One of our aims is to  focus the efforts of many disparate groups who see the deterioration of their  neighborhoods, the raping of the environment and the lack of concern for  current residents which growth impinges upon their quality of life. Unpaid-for  development costs current residents not only peace and contentment, but money.  </P> <P> However, any such ordinance requires understanding by all San Diegans. It needs  to be discussed, argued, modified and accepted by a majority if it is to  achieve its goals. PLAN! wishes to join with other community organizations in a  grass-roots effort to solve these problems and others.  </P> <P> CATHERINE A. STROHLEIN  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

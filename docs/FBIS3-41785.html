All market places were opened on Tuesday [14 September]. Only  the street trade in pies and beverages is banned.    However, the quarantine introduced on Monday has not been  lifted. Lessons in schools have been interrupted until Friday,  but day care centers continue to function.    According to the civil aviation department, charter flights  have been stopped to Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, India,  and the United Arab Emirates, as well as to Uzbekistan,  Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and South Kazakhstan. There have been  no restrictions in other directions.    The acting chief of the city epidemiological service,  Aleksandr Kim, announced that the 152 passengers who arrived by  plane from Karachi, Pakistan last Thursday were isolated as  suspected cholera patients. They are in satisfactory condition.    The chief of the sanitation service of the city, Anuar  Talkimbayev, reports there are 16 cholera patients in  Kazakhstan, 8 of them in the capital. Treatment is active and  there is no reason to fear for the lives of the patients.    However, experts from the Kazakh anti-plague center claim  that the type of cholera brought from Pakistan differs from the  classical form and is difficult to treat by conventional means.</p>

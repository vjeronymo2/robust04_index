			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bertelsmann's Vox TV unit fails Bertelsmann, one of the world's largest media groups, suffered a serious setback yesterday when the Vox private television channel collapsed. 'Our intensive efforts to save the channel have not so far produced an acceptable result,' the company said. The group said on Monday that it was in last-minute negotiations with Walt Disney in the hope that the US group would take a 49 per cent stake. Bertelsmann held a 24.9 per cent stake as the only remaining shareholder needed to find investors. A purchase of 49 per cent by the US group would have left 26.1 per cent held on trust. Walt Disney refused to confirm that it had been in talks with Bertelsmann and would not comment on why the talks had failed. Liquidation proceedings will start on April 1, but Vox said the channel would continue in roughly the same format. An estimated 300 employees will be made redundant under a plan agreed with the workers' council. Bertelsmann suggested that new shareholders might be found once liquidation proceedings and the cost of buying a stake had dropped sharply. The channel's collapse is blamed on strategic miscalculations at Bertelsmann, which masterminded the channel's launch in January 1993 and is regarded as one of the world's most successful media groups.</p>

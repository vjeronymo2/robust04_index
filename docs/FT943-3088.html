			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / International Company News: HK's Morning Post slips 4% South China Morning Post Holdings, the publisher of Hong Kong's leading English-language newspaper, has reported a 4 per cent drop in annual net profits to HKDollars 564m (USDollars 73m) from HKDollars 586.4m for its first year under the control Malaysian millionaire Mr Robert Kuok. Results for the year ended June 30 1993 were swollen by an exceptional item of HKDollars 92.4m, from the sale of investment properties. There were no exceptional items in the latest financial year. Earnings per share slipped in line with profits, down 4 per cent to 37.61 cents from 39.09 cents. But the dividend is to be maintained at 13 cents a share. Circulation figures show a 4 per cent rise to 105,458 copies for the flagship daily paper, and Mr Kuok says the entry of a third English-language newspaper - The Eastern Express, which launched earlier this year - has not adversely affected either revenues or circulation. Mr Kuok paid USDollars 349m to Mr Rupert Murdoch for control of the Post last September.</p>

			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / A revolutionary idea The most important single fact about the election of President Clinton, as far as the rest of the world is concerned, is that the new US administration intends to give its top priorities to domestic issues. This clear message of Mr Clinton's election campaign was underlined in his inaugural address last Wednesday, which contained only the scantest allusions to foreign policy, and no specific reference at all to America's European allies. Some sceptics question whether things will really pan out like that. But it would be prudent for the rest of the world, starting with the Europeans, to take Mr Clinton at his word. For the probability is not merely that Mr Clinton means what he says, but that his preferences are consistent with the undertow of forces operating in the world today. There is no doubt that Clinton would prefer to give foreign policy a lower profile than it had under George Bush, or indeed most recent presidents. The question is whether international events, the expectations of other people, and America's undeniable position as the only remaining superpower, will permit him to rearrange America's traditional priorities. Take the flare-up of the conflict with Iraq, with which George Bush signed off his presidency. Before the handover, Mr Clinton showed no hesitation in endorsing the actions of the outgoing president. After his inauguration, he vowed to continue the Bush policy. 'We are going to stay with our policy,' he said. 'It is an American policy.' Maybe the crisis (and President Bush) gave him no choice, unless he wanted to be blackened as a wimp. But the bottom line is that the Clinton presidency has started out looking like a strange continuation of the Bush presidency, with a military engagement by the US in the Middle East, but without a credible endgame strategy. The temptation to play on the world stage may prove permanently seductive, sceptics claim, if only as an elevated form of escape from intractable domestic problems. It will always be easier to bomb Saddam just one more time, than to do anything, however small, about the budget deficit. Finally, the international community will demand global leadership and no one else can provide it. This is the greatest challenge to Clinton's chosen priorities, according to Leslie Gelb of the New York Times. 'Today, there is no alternative to Washington's leadership and no substitute to US military power,' he says. 'If Mr Clinton fails to lead in Somalia, Bosnia, Iraq, etc, no other country can or will.' The trouble with these arguments, is not that they draw too much on nostalgia and wishful thinking (though of course they do), but that they take too little account of changes in the real world. The 1991 Gulf war appeared to exemplify the ultimate paradigm of American political leadership and high-tech military power, at the head of a broad-based international coalition, under the aegis of a truly United Nations, in the service of a new world order. The reality is less comfortable. There is no new world order, especially not in the Gulf; the US does not have the resources, military or financial, to sustain its old international pre-eminence; it does not have any master geostrategic plan, in the follow-up to the cold war, with which to exercise its leadership; and the real world is much too turbulent and unpredictable to admit such a master plan. Even under President Bush, who was strongly focused on foreign policy, the US was starting to abdicate its leadership role from some of the most pressing problem areas. The marines were sent to Somalia, and bombs and missiles launched at Iraq; but the US has stood right back from the civil war in what was Yugoslavia, and it is doing much less than western Europe to help the struggling countries of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Some nostalgics cite the case of Nato, which has no obvious purpose in the post-cold war world, but which nevertheless seems to be getting a second wind. Last year allied governments, including France, agreed Nato could play new roles in peacekeeping; right now Nato headquarter units are helping humanitarian aid in Bosnia; and France and Germany have agreed their new Euro-Corps could fight under Nato orders. All this looks like a modest new lease of life for an Atlantic alliance which is the creature of American leadership. These innovations, no doubt valuable in their way, do not reverse the tide of history, however. Nato's central purpose, to deter a massive attack by the Soviet Union, has disappeared and cannot be replaced by a little peacekeeping on the side. Even under Bush, the US planned to cut its forces in Europe by two-thirds; under Clinton, the cut must surely be deeper. No European government wants the US to go home; the fact remains that the end of the cold war leaves a gaping hole in the heart of Nato and western strategy, it weakens the cement of western unity, and removes much of the need for US leadership. If Mr Clinton is as bright as they say, he will heed the advice of Leslie Gelb, and try to persuade other countries to share the burdens of strategy. But the price of shared burdens would be shared leadership; it is not yet clear that the US or its allies are ready for such a revolutionary idea.</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Corporate Names to get more power Lloyd's of London yesterday introduced new voting rules, significantly increasing the power of new corporate members in the insurance market. More than 16 new corporate Names - investment trusts and companies and insurance companies - are injecting some Pounds 850m into the market and will provide backing of about Pounds 1.5bn in 1994, just under a fifth of the total. The rules allocate votes proportionate to allocated capacity (the amount of premiums syndicates are permitted to underwrite). Individual Names, whose assets have traditionally supported the market, will have voting rights proportionate to their allocated capacity - but this has been divided on a 'one-member-one-vote' basis. The new voting arrangements are transitional. It is envisaged that voting at general meetings will ultimately be weighted in proportion to capacity. Lloyd's also announced new mandatory qualifications for active underwriters and underwriting agency directors. Active underwriters appointed after December 31 next year must be associates of the Chartered Insurance Institute - instead of the current requirement that they obtain a Lloyd's Market Certificate.</p>

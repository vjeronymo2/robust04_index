Today he held talks with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev and met the chairmen of both chambers of the Federal  Assembly.

A solid  package of agreements will be prepared for it, inter alia a  political document.    Han Sung-chu told journalists it was expected that during  the  upcoming Russian-South Korean summit issues of bilateral  cooperation and international problems, including the situation  in northeast Asia and in the Korean Peninsula, would be  discussed. The heads of state, he said, will exchange opinions  regarding cooperation not only on the bilateral basis, but on  the multilateral basis within the framework of international  organizations.

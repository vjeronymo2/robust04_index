			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Survey of London Docklands (1): May the best dream win - After serious setbacks for London Docklands - a Pounds 10bn, world-class experiment in urban regeneration - recent events seem to indicate that the worst may now be over LONDON DOCKLANDS has always needed its visionaries and dreamers. The last three years, however, have been more likely to generate nightmares. The 5,000-acre riverside sprawl to the east of the British capital, a world-class experiment in urban regeneration and a marble-clad totem to the forces of free enterprise, was born at the dawn of Britain's entrepreneurial renaissance. The economic boom years of the 1980s gave it a flying start as it set about showing the sceptics and the small-minded how government and business could unite behind a Pounds 10bn budget to transform dereliction and decay into a 21st century, wealth-creating community. But as the debate intensified over the logic of a strategy which built skyscrapers first and roads second, so the swift transition from economic boom to recession piled problem upon problem down in the docks. The story of how golden promise turned to dark despair has been well catalogued. An upstart rival to the centuries-old City on its doorstep, dockland's ability to usurp the traditional role of the Square Mile was always in question. The collapse of the UK economy - and in financial services and the south-east, in particular, seemed to provide the answer. Land which had doubled in value between 1986 and 1987 was now unsaleable, along with the apartments which had boasted jacuzzis and six noughts on the end of their asking prices. Companies which had been on the brink of moving in, pulled back; new development ground to a halt as the inventory of empty space rocketed, The crisis of confidence seemed to spread to those with responsibility for docklands, both within the London Docklands Development Corporation and in Whitehall. The Department of the Environment, having raised expectations, decided against moving its own staff to the area. The spectacular collapse of Canary Wharf, the most grandiose property scheme from the world's most ambitious property developer, also threw into doubt the future of the crucial, Pounds 1.8bn Jubilee line underground extension. The government expressed regret - from the sidelines. 'Last September was the low point,' recalls Mr Eric Sorensen, LDDC chief executive. 'There seemed to be very little more that could be added to our problems. Beyond Docklands, the public impression was that the entire project had shut down, that the area was set to revert to a wilderness. Yet the doom and gloom about what was always going to be a long-term project, with its fair share of ups and downs, may always have been a bit overdone. In Dockland's darkest hour, more than 61,000 people were living there, a similar number were employed there and 2,500 businesses were operating there. The economic fault lines could not detract, either, from the sheer physical achievements of some of the most enterprising developers and designers. But the statistics were of little comfort in the immediate crisis. Mr Sorensen says, however, there was 'no point in whistling the wind.' The best contribution was to press on with efforts to ensure that the all-important transport links were developed - 'it was not just about physical construction; it was psychologically important for the whole area that we should make progress,' he adds. THE LDDC has worked hard in helping to get the Jubilee line extension back on track and, following agreement by the European Investment Bank to inject Pounds 98m into the project, believes an important corner has been turned. A final go-ahead, however, is still awaited. Other, recent events have conspired to offer some hope that the worst really might be over. Canary Wharf could soon be out of the hands of administrators, while the ill-fated docklands light railway is improving its unreliable image and expanding its network. The opening this month of the controversial docklands highway, a dual carriageway running from the city to the London City Airport, will transform access, although there are fears of serious congestion around Tower Hill. The airport itself is set for a significant expansion of its continental services, though the complex remains a loss-making enterprise and operators, Mowlem, have failed to find a partner to help them bear the cost. Its claim of being a 15-minute taxi ride from the city should now, at least, be met. There are also hopes that the end of recession will more generally stimulate economic activity and allow Docklands to put its worst period behind it. Caution prevails but there are some straws in the wind. Local housing agents say that there has been an improvement in interest among potential buyers and the commercial property market - sagging under the weight of unwanted floorspace - is being encouraged by the arrival of some significant occupiers. Texaco, the US-owned energy group has just moved 1,000 headquarters staff from London's west end into Canary Wharf while Credit Suisse First Boston has brought in another 1,500. Canary Wharf, the giant 'white elephant,' now has 6,500 people working in it. Other arrivals include Peat Marwick, Morgan Stanley and Tower Hamlets council, with its 800 staff. Mirror Group Newspapers is also said to be considering a move into Docklands. The LDDC itself says it is no longer keeping its head down on the development front. As the authority vested with ownership of 550 acres of local land, it is again marketing some of its sites in a new air of optimism. It intends to release 25 small building sites this year and is brushing off previously aborted plans for an exhibition centre close to the Royal Docks. The corporation is also keen to pursue ambitious plans for an urban village on a 70-acre site in the same locality. It could ultimately be home for up to 5,000 people. Housing developers are also back in business, with Barrett London and Fairview New Homes developing nearly 400 new homes between them. The emphasis, in contrast to the 1980s, is going to be on lower-cost housing, with prices on one of the developments starting at only Pounds 39,000. Foreign investment interest is also perking up, with the Bank of China recently completing the purchase of a block of 48 apartments on the Isle of Dogs. New efforts to attract inward investors from overseas are being made by the LDDC. The position of Docklands as a vital, commercial bridgehead to the east of London was recently endorsed by the government when it announced plans for a 'golden corridor' of development running along both sides of the Thames as far as Tilbury and Sheerness. The proposals were immediately welcomed by the LDDC as evidence of the government's commitment to building up the economy to the east of the capital. Mr Michael Howard, the Environment Secretary, slapped down 'critics and doom mongers' to suggest that Docklands will resume its growth once the economy gets under steam. He was announcing the creation of a task force to spearhead long-term economic development along the so-called East Thames Corridor. The intention is to have a planning framework in place by March 1994. Already, however, there are critics of the proposals, who point out that such a strategy could suck development away from the west of London. They also stress that much of the relevant land to the east of the capital has been ravaged by years of industrial misuse. Though Mr Howard spoke of docklands as a 'great success story,' his plans for further expansion to the east clearly revealed that lessons have been learned in high places. A key to the plans will be in ensuring that the development of the corridor co-incides with an extensive infrastructure programme. A more flexible strategy will also mean less concentration on office developments and the provision of a broader range of integrated projects. The minister envisaged 100,000 new homes and 100,000 extra jobs in a decade. Virtually the same targets are shared by Docklands itself. May the best dream win.</p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / International Company News: Telecom Italia to run Pirelli telecoms Telecom Italia, Italy's state-controlled telephone company, is to manage all national and international telecommunications services at Pirelli, the Italian industrial group which is one of its main suppliers of cables. The agreement, announced yesterday, strengthens the ties between the tyre and cable manufacturer and Telecom Italia. The companies said the deal would lead to immediate savings at Pirelli. It is the first such deal struck by Telecom Italia since it was formed earlier this year from the merger between Italy's main state-owned telecoms operators. The value of the accord was not disclosed. Telecom Italia will initially work on a 'virtual private network' linking Pirelli headquarters in Milan with 90 units around the world, using existing national telephone systems. Telecom Italia will also build a dedicated network for Italy, the US, Brazil, Argentina, France, the UK, Spain, Germany and Switzerland - the nine countries which account for the bulk of Pirelli's telephone traffic. Mr Marco Tronchetti Provera, Pirelli's managing director since 1992, emphasises strong internal communication. The videoconference links he is putting in place throughout the group, to connect both management and research units, will now be Telecom Italia's responsibility. As a customer, Stet, Telecom Italia's state-controlled parent company, accounts for less than 2 per cent of Pirelli's overall turnover, and between 3.5 per cent and 4 per cent of the group's cable sales. Mr Tronchetti Provera has said he is eager to collaborate with Stet on the development of telecoms and multimedia technology worldwide, using, for example, Pirelli's high-technology fibre-optic cables. However, Pirelli has denied it plans to take a direct or indirect stake in Stet in the next phase of privatisation, due next year.</p>

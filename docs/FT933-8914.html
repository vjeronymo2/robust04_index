			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Balladur calls for monetary reforms to beat speculators REFORM OF the international monetary and financial system to clamp down on currency speculation was called for last night by Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister. Mr Balladur, who also confirmed plans to cut income tax next year to revitalise the French economy, said he intended to stick to his firm economic policy of protecting the franc. He was speaking after the Bank of France released figures showing the country's foreign reserves were hit hard by its intervention to support the franc in the recent currency crisis. The central bank was left with a deficit of more than FFr180bn (Pounds 20.3bn) in its foreign exchange holdings. The French premier blamed currency speculators for the crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism which led to the fall in the franc's value. 'The crisis wasn't due to concern about the franc itself, but to a desire to destroy the European monetary system,' he said, in a television interview from his holiday home at Chamonix. 'Speculators want all the world's currencies to float freely so they can make more money.' Mr Balladur said that France planned to put forward proposals to curb speculation and to stabilise the monetary system, although he did not specify what they would be, how they could be implemented or in what forum they would be made. 'We can't allow a situation to continue where so much money can change hands in a very short time and threaten a nation's security,' he said. His remarks follow speculation in Germany about the possibility of EC countries reintroducing some capital controls, although Germany has denied that such a move is under discussion. The French premier said he planned to discuss the monetary situation with Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, when they meet in Bonn on August 26. He said that the European Community member states needed to bring their economic policies closer together. On the domestic front, Mr Balladur said the main beneficiaries of tax cuts would be the middle classes, who support the RPR and UDF parties that dominate his coalition government. He said he also planned to streamline the income tax system by reducing the number of tax brackets. The tax cuts will form part of the 'second stage' of the government's policies to be finalised on September 23. Employment law reform is also expected to feature. Mr Balladur said: 'We have got to find a way of ensuring that economic growth leads to job creation.'

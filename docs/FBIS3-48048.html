			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jan 21 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Malaysian  Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamed has blamed the United Nations  (UN) for the suffering of the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  ticking off the international body for what he described as not  discharging duties entrusted to it.    In another of his strong speech criticising the  international  community over the plight of the Bosnians, the prime minister  said UN had not only put its integrity in question but also the  sincerity of the so-proclaimed champions of human rights.    At a function where he received a standing ovation from a  group of Bosnians now taking shelter in Malaysia, he also  expressed his sadness that the international community had  chosen to stand by and watch the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina  continued to face the merciless aggression of the Serbs.    If we accept what is happening to the Bosnians now as  legitimate and right, then our civilisation is coming to an end,  he said when launching the books Voices of Malaysia, Suara  Keperihatinan Malaysia and Bosnia: Testament To War Crimes As  Told By Survivors here Thursday.    At the ceremony, attended by corporate leaders, senior  government officers and politicians, more than RM1 million  [Malaysian currency] was collected for the Bosnian fund which Dr  Mahathir said, proved that they were still humans, symphathising  for the Bosnians.    In criticising the UN, Dr Mahathir said it was clear that it  was the United Nations that was holding down the Bosnians with  its policies of arms embargo over Bosnia-Herzegovina, over  protecting the UN troops and failing to apply pressure against  Serbia.    The embargo had left the Bosnian Muslims defenceless against  the Serbs, he said, adding that it was apparent that the Western  powers did not want their soldiers even to get hurt, and not to  mentiom killed and that they did nothing to protect the Bosnians  Muslims.    What good are they called soldiers. We might as well call  the  civilians or small children to do their jobs, he said.    Prominent social worker Dr Alijah Gordon, who edited the  book  Bosnia: Testament To War Crimes As Told By Survivors, criticised  UNESCO for failing to protect priceless manuscripts in Sarajevo  from being destroyed by the Serbs.</p>

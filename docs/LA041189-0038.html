			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NO CHANGE IN TACTICS ON INTIFADA, SHAMIR SAYS  </P> <P> Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Monday that his government has no  plans to change the way it is handling the uprising in the occupied territories  as part of its latest bid to bring peace to the region.  </P> <P> "It doesn't depend on the Israeli government," he told a news conference during  a visit here with Midwestern Jewish leaders. "The existing tension is a result  of acts of violence carried out by the people of the intifada (the Arabic name  of the uprising).  </P> <P> "The moment this violence will stop or be reduced, then the tension will  disappear," he said.  </P> <P> The uprising, now 17 months old, has taken more than 400 lives, the great bulk  of them Palestinian.  </P> <P> Shamir has proposed elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip for the  selection of negotiators who would deal with Israel on the permanent status of  the areas.  </P> <P> The Palestine Liberation Organization and the Arab League both rejected  Shamir's election proposal Monday. In Tunisia, a PLO spokesman said the idea is  "totally unacceptable" since the elections would be held "in the shadow of  Israeli occupation."  </P> <P> The PLO said that elections should be held under international supervision  after Israel has withdrawn.  </P></p>

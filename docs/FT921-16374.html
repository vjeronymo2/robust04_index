			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Genscher urges EC to open joint embassies in republics THE 12 member states of the European Community should agree to open joint embassies in each of the ex-Soviet republics, and urgently develop a new form of EC treaty to accommodate them, according to Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German foreign min-ister. At the same time, he called on Nato to hold an emergency meeting of its newly formed co-operation council, at foreign minister level, to admit the ex-Soviet republics in place of the Soviet Union. Mr Genscher also urged their inclusion in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) before the end of this month. Mr Genscher spelt out his ideas for an urgent reassessment of western policy towards eastern Europe and the ex-Soviet Union, the newly formed Commonwealth of Independent States, in a newspaper interview published today. He called on all EC member states to agree on joint embassies in the former Soviet republics, as a way of promoting a common foreign policy in a concrete way, and answering their immediate need for a string of new missions. 'If all 12 (EC members) are not ready for such a step, then we are determined to undertake such a step along with individual member states,' he told the Mitteldeutsche Zeitung, published in his home town of Halle. 'I think it is necessary for Germany to be represented in all these republics,' he said. Meanwhile Russia said yesterday it was prepared to represent other republics at the former Soviet embassies it has taken over all around the world.</p>

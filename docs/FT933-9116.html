			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Bonn cabinet backs cuts: Waigel presses on with social spending curbs IN THE FACE of a continuing storm of criticism from both left and right, Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, yesterday pushed the draft laws for tough cuts in social spending through the German cabinet. The DM21bn (Pounds 8.3bn) package of cuts in next year's spending, rising to DM27bn in 1995 and nearly DM29bn by 1996, still faces a rough ride through the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament. Not only the opposition Social Democrats, but also the Free Democrats in the ruling coalition, want amendments. Mr Waigel insisted that the cuts would not undermine any recovery from the economic recession, pointing out that federal government spending would still be DM20bn higher in 1994 than in the current year and the budget deficit constant at DM67.5bn. He was slightly more cautious than Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister, in forecasting an economic growth rate of just 1.0 per cent in 1994 (compared with Mr Rexrodt's 1.5 per cent). But he was less pessimistic on unemployment, suggesting a rise from 3.5m to 3.7m, instead of the 4m total seen by the economics minister for the end of the year. The main element in the Waigel package is a cut of three percentage points in a range of social benefits, including unemployment benefit and social security payments. There are to be curbs on child allowances, abolition of special 'bad weather' payments to construction workers, and a clampdown on social security fraud. Coming when unemployment is rising sharply - up from 7.0 to 7.5 per cent last month in west Germany - the package has aroused opposition fury. Mr Oskar Lafontaine, deputy leader of the SPD, called it a 'violation of economic reason and social justice'. Ms Monika Wulf-Mathies, leader of the public sector workers' union, called it a social explosive, which parliament must defuse. The German trade union movement has announced protests for the autumn. At the same time, the FDP has served notice that it wants to delay abolition of the bad weather subsidy for the construction industry, saying it could undermine the national house-building programme. The industry maintains the government will end up paying as much in unemployment benefits to building workers laid off in bad weather as it currently pays in the job subsidy. The SPD enjoys an effective majority in the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament, but only a small part of the total package can be blocked. More than 90 per cent of the package does not require Bundesrat approval, and can therefore be confirmed by a majority in the lower house.</p>

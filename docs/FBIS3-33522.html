			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sao Paulo -- The PT [Workers Party] executive board  will meet today to discuss the first draft of the party's  platform without having been able to reach a consensus on  controversial proposals such as the issue of a moratorium and  the Armed Forces. President and candidate Luis Inacio Lula da  Silva yesterday appealed for an understanding: "We can only  promise what we can implement," Lula said. Besides taking the  debate on the program to the PT grassroots, Lula wants to extend  the discussion to include forces from outside the party. The  purpose is to get rid of the ideological character of the  discussion and be able to elaborate a program on goals. In the  next few months he intends to intervene more often in the debate  on the platform, even if it is only to avoid what he calls  "political exploration of the project with a text that is not  definitive."    Lula spent the day yesterday meeting with some of the people  who cooperated in formulating the program such as sociologists  Francisco Weffort and Maria Victoria Benevides, economist Jorge  Matoso, Vice President Rui Falcao, and Secretary General  Gilberto Carvalho. He wanted to know the status of the program  and which are the points of disagreement. According to Lula,  "we are not interested in avoiding controversial items."    Moratorium -- The dissemination of the first draft of the  program where the PT defends a moratorium on the foreign debt  did not please Lula. He has been defending a political  renegotiation of the debt in more than 60 meetings with  entrepreneurs. "The foreign debt must be transformed into a  political issue and discussed by governments face to face, not  between ministers and IMF experts," Lula said. According to him,  the draft should not talk about default. "We do not know how the  country will be in 1995. This is why there is no reason to speak  about moratorium."    Despite the incisive defense of a renegotiation, the issue  of  a moratorium is one of the points on which there is no  agreement. Two proposals should be included in the first  official draft of the program: The suspension of payments to  give way to an audit and a renegotiation with creditors  guaranteeing the payment of the commercial debt; and a  renegotiation of the debt without excluding the possibility of  not paying what is not considered legitimate debt.    Armed Forces -- The treatment that the Armed Forces will  receive, if the PT wins the election, is also controversial. The  draft will include two proposals. The first proposal will defend  the Armed Forces modernization; the second proposal -- supported  by pacifists -- proposes changes in the concept of the Armed  Forces organization and opposes investments to modernize it  because they are of the opinion that the natural trend points to  its disappearance. The only point of agreement is the creation  of a Defense Ministry. Lula supports better treatment for the  Armed Forces but he also thinks that the matter is not a central  issue and should be discussed after talking with military  commanders.    Another matter that is still a subject of controversy is  whether the party platform will stipulate limits to the agrarian  reform program. Another subject of discussions is the stability  of public servants. PT Secretary General Gilberto Carvalho  yesterday denied that there is disagreement on the issue of  privatizations revision. He said the program proposes an audit  to identify corrupt officials and to see if there were  under-evaluations of privatized public companies. "We will try  to find ways to punish corrupt officials and compensate the  state for damages," Carvalho said. The PT is opposed to the  privatization of strategic companies, such as those in the areas  of energy, oil, and telecommunications.    During today's meeting between the party National Executive  Board and members of the party bloc in Congress at the Comodoro  Hotel, Lula and party leaders will also define the participation  of the federal congressional bloc in the constitutional revision  process. There is a widely supported proposal to liberate PT  legislators to participate in the revision of the most important  issues.</p>

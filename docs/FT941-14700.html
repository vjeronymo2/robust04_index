			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Observer: Safe with them William Waldegrave, the British cabinet minister charged with clearing away the cobwebs of secrecy in Whitehall, has a problem. His elegant room in the Cabinet Office contains a large, impregnable steel safe. Does it contain some of Whitehall's darkest secrets? He has no idea; he can't open it because the key has mysteriously disappeared. The Cabinet Office could take a leaf out of the Treasury's book. The instructions for changing the combinations on the locks to that ministry's safes are so complicated that hardly anybody bothers. Most prefer to retain the safes' original, identical numbers. No wonder the Treasury gave up budget purdah.</p>

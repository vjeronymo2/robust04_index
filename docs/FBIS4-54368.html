			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- The Bank of Japan is trying  to confirm a bottom to the economic downturn, Governor Yasushi  Mieno indicated Friday [27 May].    He said, in a Tokyo speech sponsored by KYODO NEWS SERVICE,  that he is closely monitoring economic activities since April to  determine whether recent signs of improvement were one-time  factors to the March-end of fiscal year.    "The basis for movement toward recovery is being prepared,"  he said. But he could not rule out the effect of fiscal  year-end factors.    Among the recent bright signs in Japan's economy, Mieno  cited  improving consumption and production trends, but said more time  is needed to see if they continue and spread to a general  recovery.    The economy is in a better position than a year ago, when  hopes of recovery were dashed by such factors as the soaring yen  and bad weather, Mieno said, citing corporate stock adjustments,  the support of fiscal and monetary stimulus and global economic  improvement.    But he repeated concerns about volatile currency movements,  employment and continuing balance-sheet adjustments, which he  said are only half-way through. He noted that capital spending  continues to decline and said he could not rule out an economic  effect from the long delay in enacting the fiscal 1994 national  budget.    Mieno also denied that leading industrial nations have a  secret agreement to coordinate their interest rate policies,  saying finance leaders of the Group of Seven (G-7) countries  have been misunderstood.    Within the broad goal of promoting sustainable growth  without  inflation, each G-7 central bank determines credit policy based  on its own country's economic conditions, he stressed.    G-7 finance ministers and central bankers agreed at a recent  Washington meeting to stay in close contact and cooperate on  their common aim, but Japan is "absolutely not following any  other country's monetary policy," Mieno said.    Market players have interpreted recent rate hikes in the  United States, cuts in Germany and the Bank of Japan's guiding  of market rates to record lows as a concerted effort to boost  the dollar and curb the yen and mark.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik discussed at a  news conference held in Bratislava today the results of his  official visits to France and Slovenia. Regarding the security  situation in Europe, he stated that refusal to accept the Baltic  state as members in the Partnership for Peace program will mean  a violation of the fundamental principle underpinning the  initiative, which is an individual approach and an equal  opportunity for all states. According to Jozef Moravcik, the  granting of special status to Russia will not be favorable for  the countries of Central Europe, and it will signify to a  certain extent a return to the idea of the division of the  sphere of interests between Russia and the countries of the  European Union or NATO. He added that if Slovakia were to be  accepted as a member of the North Atlantic Alliance then the  special status of Russia will not matter to us at all.</p>

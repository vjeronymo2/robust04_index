			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Amber Day chief executive resigns after four months The revolving door for executives at Amber Day Holdings, the discount retailer, took another spin yesterday with the resignation of Mr David Thompson from the board after only four months as chief executive. Mr Thompson, who joined last year as finance director, is the latest to depart from the controversial group, which runs the What Everyone Wants retail chain, and has had three different chairmen in the last 15 months. Mr Peter Carr, who became executive chairman in August, said Mr Thompson's resignation arose from the reduced scope of the company's activities and the concentration of its administration in Glasgow to where, for personal and family reasons, he felt unable to relocate. Mr Thompson has resigned as a director, but will remain with the company until April 30. Although Mr Thompson was on a three-year contract and had a salary of Pounds 180,000, Mr Carr said he would receive no compensation payment, but would retain options on 400,000 shares. Amber Day's shares closed 1p higher at 63p. Amber Day's institutional shareholders have been concerned by the size of previous pay-offs. Mr Philip Green stepped down as chairman last September with a golden handshake of Pounds 1.13m. Mr Stacey Ellis, a former Inchcape director who replaced Mr Green but left after a boardroom tussle with Mr Carr in August, received Pounds 500,000. Mr Carr yesterday told the group's annual meeting that Amber Day was currently in discussions with its advisers over the injection of new funds into the company. A rights issue seems most likely, at least partly backed by Warburg Pincus, the US investment institution which has a 12 per cent stake. Write-downs and provisions have reduced the balance sheet, and gearing currently stands at about 80 per cent. The chairman said the overriding objective of his five-year plan for the company was to develop as the leading discount store operator in the UK. Since August, six new stores had opened, bringing the total to 58, and he intended to open at least another four by July. Mr Carr said the UK retail sector did appear to be experiencing a gradual recovery and the business was well positioned to benefit from any further upturn. 'To that end, we plan to approximately double the current number of outlets and to expand the company's geographical spread on a national scale over the period.'</p>

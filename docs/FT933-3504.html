			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Israel and the PLO: We are today giving peace a chance - Rabin The following are extracts of speeches made at the White House ceremony yesterday. Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin 'This signing of the Israeli-Palestinian declaration of principles here today, it's not so easy, neither for myself as a soldier in Israel's war, nor for the people of Israel, nor for the Jewish people in the diaspora who are watching us now with great hope mixed with apprehension. 'It is certainly not easy for the families of the victims of the wars, violence, terror, whose pain will never heal; for the many thousands who defended our lives in their own and have even sacrificed their lives for our own. For them, this ceremony has come too late . . . 'We have come from Jerusalem, the ancient and eternal capital of the Jewish people. We have come from an anguished and grieving land. We have come from a people, a home, a family that has not known a single year, not a single month, in which mothers have not wept for their sons . . . 'Let me say to you, the Palestinians, we are destined to live together on the same soil in the same land . . . We are today giving peace a chance and saying to you - and saying again to you - enough . . . '. . . our inner strength, our higher moral values have been derived for thousands of years from the Book of the Books, in one of which, Koheleth (Ecclesiastes), we read: 'To every thing there is a season and a time to every purpose under heaven. A time to be born and time to die, a time to kill and a time to heal, a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to love and a time to hate, a time of war and a time of peace. 'Ladies and gentlemen, the time for peace has come.' PLO chairman Yassir Arafat 'Mr President, I am taking this opportunity to assure you and to assure the great American people that we share your values for freedom, justice and human rights - values for which my people have been striving. 'My people are hoping that this agreement which we are signing today marks the beginning of the end of a chapter of pain and suffering which has lasted throughout this century. 'My people are hoping that this agreement which we are signing today will usher in an age of peace, co-existence and equal rights. . . 'Now as we stand on the threshold of this new historic era, let me address the people of Israel and their leaders, with whom we are meeting today for the first time, and let me assure them that the difficult decision we reached together was one that required great and exceptional courage. 'We will need more courage and determination to continue the course of building co-existence and peace between us. This is possible and it will happen with mutual determination and with the effort that will be made with all parties on all the tracks to establish the foundations of a just and comprehensive peace.</p>

			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISCOUNT BROKERS  </P> <P> We real estate agents are not all alike. Firms are just as different as two  separate dry cleaners or restaurants. Usually, if you don't like the looks of  the place, the sound of the proprietor or the initial service you get, you find  another one. You don't decide to dry clean your own clothes or never go out to  eat again!  </P> <P> A bad experience with one agent usually means a lack of communication between  the principal and agent or even a personality clash. Perhaps the seller wanted  too much for the property and the agent gave an honest, professional, truthful  opinion.  </P> <P> The public needs to understand that real estate agents are not "sales people at  heart." We are service people. Our goal is to bring the buyers and sellers  together and act as a communicator. In addition to being compensated for the  hard work involved, there's a tremendous amount of satisfaction in seeing  homeowners happy!  </P> <P> With so much risk in these days of lawsuits, I can't imagine a professional,  licensed agent (discounters) recommending that innocent, and most times  ignorant, buyers and sellers take on the responsibility of transferring  ownership of homes.  </P> <P> ROBERTA VOSS  </P> <P> Hermosa Beach  </P> <P>  Voss is with Century 21 Coast Properties.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CINEMA SOUNDS  </P> <P> Sound effects editors do more than just "gather" effects. Today's  sound-conscious directors demand the "sound that no one has heard before."  </P> <P> To service that demand, many sound editors have become sound designers,  generating and pre-mixing special sound effects as well as supervising and  organizing the thousands of "normal" effects.  </P> <P> Some of our craftspeople, the Foley artists, perform sound effects, "live" to  filmed picture on a specialized recording stage, and their contributions go  unrecognized.  </P> <P> DAVID STONE, Editor, VANESSA AMENT, Publisher, Moviesound Newsletter  </P></p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Fiat searches for a model solution: Italy's largest private sector company is counting on a new range of cars to regain momentum Mr Giovanni Agnelli, chairman of Fiat, Italy's biggest private sector company and one of the world's largest automotive groups, will today reveal the financial health of the group in his annual letter to shareholders. In contrast with previous years, when the letter has contained mostly good news, this year is different. The document comes at a testing time for Fiat, which is controlled by the Agnelli family, and for its 71-year-old chairman who will hand over to his younger brother, Umberto, in June 1994. The handover will come while many of the challenges facing Fiat, founded 93 years ago by Mr Agnelli's grandfather, remain unresolved. Today's letter will make sombre reading. Many industry observers expect preliminary 1992 results to indicate a small loss at the group's main Fiat Auto cars subsidiary, which accounts for almost half its L60,000bn (Pounds 26bn) annual turnover. The car business includes Lancia, Alfa Romeo, Ferrari and Innocenti. Problems with other sectors, notably its Iveco commercial vehicle subsidiary  -in loss for the past two years - and with its tractors and earth-moving equipment operations, remain pressing. Group earnings have been falling steadily since their peak in the late 1980s. In spite of big one-off gains from the sale of non-core subsidiaries, net profits after minority interests in 1991 declined by more than 30 per cent to L1,114bn from L1,613bn in 1990 - itself a sharp fall from the L3,306bn made in 1989. While many leading car makers are experiencing hardship because of the economic downturn, Fiat's problems run deeper than most. Its dominance of Italy's private sector makes the question of whether it can resolve its difficulties a matter of national importance. The state of Fiat's financial health affects more than the Agnelli family, which still owns almost 40 per cent of the company. Fiat and its subsidiaries account for about 11.4 per cent of the capitalisation of the Milan stock exchange, while the group's 300,000-strong workforce makes it one of the biggest employers in Italy. The group's problems are concentrated on the car side. In 1988 and 1989 it was challenging Germany's Volkswagen group for leadership of the west European new car market. But by last year Fiat had fallen to fourth place behind VW, General Motors and Peugeot. In 1992 Fiat sold an estimated 1,605,000 cars, 7.4 per cent fewer than in 1991. By contrast, VW, GM, Peugeot and Renault all increased their sales. The impact has been greatest in the domestic market, once Fiat's uncontested domain, where foreign competition has undermined its earlier dominance. The main cause of its difficulties is an ageing model range. Although the small Uno hatchback, launched in 1983, has hung on to its position as the best-selling car in Italy, demand has been dented by newcomers such as Ford's Fiesta, Renault's Clio and the Peugeot 106. Other Fiat models, such as the facelifted big Croma saloon, now more than seven years old, and Lancia's flagship Thema model, which dates from late 1984, are also showing their age. 'The group virtually missed an entire generation of new cars,' says Mr John Longhurst, European motor analyst at James Capel, the London stockbroker. Even more recent models, such as the mid-sized Tipo hatchback, have proved disappointing. The Tempra saloon, closely related to the Tipo and introduced in 1991, has done much less well than expected, while recent models from Lancia and Alfa Romeo have also turned in average performances. Fiat's share of its home market has shrunk to 44.3 per cent from a peak of about 60 per cent in 1988. In an effort to arrest its decline and regain market share Fiat has sliced profit margins with cut-price financing deals and generous trade-ins. The problem of the group's car business will be exacerbated by the expected downturn in domestic demand this year. After Italian car sales reached a peak last year, the market, Europe's second-biggest after Germany, looks set to falter as recession bites. Sales in November fell by 11 per cent - the first double-digit percentage point drop for years - while December sales were 6 per cent down on the previous year. Meanwhile, foreign manufacturers have mounted an unrelenting attack. Ford's Fiesta now vies with the Fiat Panda as the second-best-selling car in Italy. VW and GM have also benefited at Fiat's expense - sales of the Volkswagen marque rose by almost 21 per cent last year, while GM's Opel soared by almost 34 per cent. Now Fiat faces an additional challenge from Japanese production in Europe mainly by Nissan, Toyota and Honda in the UK. Although imports of Japanese-built cars to Italy are restricted by a long-standing bilateral agreement, the new EC-produced models are not subject to such curbs. Nissan's sales, founded on its UK-made Primera, leapt by nearly 51 per cent to more than 26,000 in 1992, albeit from a relatively small base. Late last year, the company started selling in Italy its Sunderland-built Micra small car, a model aimed straight at the heart of Fiat's main market. Before long, UK-made Toyotas and Hondas will be following Nissan. Fiat's answer has been a huge investment drive to update its range. The group has earmarked L40,000bn in spending between 1992 and 1999 to renew its models and build factories. Within the next six years it plans to unveil 18 new models (a figure which includes the Cinquecento minicar and Alfa 155 saloon brought out last year). No model will be more important to the fate of the car business than the 'model B', which will replace the Uno. Scheduled to be unveiled at September's Frankfurt motor show and to go on sale later this year, it will be a crucial factor in improving the group's fortunes, with output of 600,000 units from three plants a year. The first cars will start rolling off the assembly line at Fiat's big greenfield facility at Melfi in southern Italy in the second half of the year. The factory, which will turn out 450,000 cars a year at full capacity in late 1994, is aimed at matching the productivity of its rivals. Also in the south, at Pratola Serra, Fiat is building an engine works which will produce 3,600 engines a day for Melfi and other facilities. Though the factories will be highly robotised, they will avoid the occasional over-reliance on automation seen at Fiat's showcase Cassino plant in the 1970s and 1980s. The investments have been accompanied by the closure or restructuring of smaller or less efficient facilities such as the Desio and Chivasso works in northern Italy. Finally, the group is also looking to new markets to reduce its dependence on Italy and provide growth which is no longer obtainable in its main west European markets. Crucially, it still has to crack its perennial problems in the UK, where it captures barely 2 per cent of the market. Outside western Europe, it bought 90 per cent of FSM, Poland's biggest car producer, last year, with which it has had a long-standing relationship. FSM is the sole source for the Cinquecento and may, in time, produce other new Fiat models. The company has also tried to take a stake in Russia's VAZ cars group - whose models are derived from old Fiat products - though the deal is stalled because of Russia's political uncertainties. The need for huge investment in plants, models and foreign ventures, combined with customer incentives to regain market share has bitten deeply into Fiat's cash reserves. The group has been forced to raise its borrowings while turning increasingly to asset sales to generate one-off profits to tide it over until new models are in the showrooms. Today's results are expected to show that the group's net financial position has deteriorated to a deficit of more than L3,500bn - at least L1,000bn higher than the L2,510bn reported in the 1992 mid-year accounts and compared with L270bn at the end of 1991. The pressure on Fiat's financial resources has taken its toll on its credit rating. Earlier this month, Moody's Investors Service, the US credit rating agency, downgraded the rating on the short-term debt of some Fiat subsidiaries from Prime-1 to Prime-2. Fiat's short-term answer has been asset sales. In 1991, it made an estimated L500bn through selling its Telettra telecommunications subsidiary to Alcatel Alsthom, the French engineering and telecoms group. Last year's group profits will be boosted by a further extraordinary gain of about L700bn from the sale of its 25 per cent stake in the Italian company formed from the merger of Telettra and Alcatel's Italian operation. Brokers are now openly discussing what Fiat will sell next. Mr Giovanni Agnelli himself raised the pitch late last year when he said the Rinascente retailing business, Toro insurance and Cogefar-Impresit building and civil engineering arms were 'not strategic'. Each is substantial. Rinascente, best known for its department stores, is Italy's biggest retailer, with net profits of L101bn on sales of L4,595bn in 1991. Toro, a leading Italian insurer, made net profits of L134bn on premiums of L2,083bn in 1991. Cogefar Impresit is Italy biggest construction group, with net profits of L31bn on sales of L1,698bn in 1991. All three could prove appealing to domestic rivals wanting to gain market share or to foreigners seeking to break into the Italian market. Although Cogefar Impresit has been hurt by the downturn in the Italian construction sector and the country's growing scandal over kickbacks to political parties and speculative buying on the hope of takeovers has pushed up shares of all three companies. But will asset sales be enough to staunch Fiat's cash haemorrhage? Two important and unexpected factors have worked in its favour in recent months. The lira's devaluation last September and subsequent exit from the European exchange rate mechanism means Italian exports are now about 20 per cent cheaper against the D-Mark and most of the currencies of Italy's main industrial European rivals. The devaluation 'has put the clock back to 1987', says one senior Fiat executive. The 20 per cent drop compensates for four years during which Italy's competitiveness declined by an annual 4 to 5 per cent against its main trading rivals, he says. With inflation running at an annual rate about 5 per cent higher than that of France and Germany, Italian goods were becoming steadily less attractive abroad. The lower value of the lira is likely to force importers to raise their prices in Italy, although few have done so yet. Higher prices from competitors will allow Fiat to increase margins at home by eliminating expensive customer incentives. 'We now believe we can keep our market share without being blooded in terms of margins,' says the executive. The cheaper lira will also enable Fiat to cut prices abroad, potentially allowing it to sell more cars. Or it could maintain existing prices but improve its profits thanks to the cheaper lira. The signs are that it will choose the latter course. 'We don't think a price cut will let us gain market share in such difficult conditions,' the executive says. 'We are not there to start a price war.' Fiat's second piece of good fortune came with last July's agreement between employers and trade unions to abolish the scala mobile wage indexation system. The agreement should help to limit the high domestic labour costs which employers have cited as one of their biggest competitive disadvantages. The agreement was 'a victory', according to the Fiat executive, 'but only one which has brought us back to previous competitive levels'. The two developments may have taken some of the pressure off the Fiat group, especially on the cars side. But the benefits will take time to come through. Much will still depend on selling assets, especially if the car market deteriorates further and pushes Fiat's auto operations deeper into the red. The Fiat executive does not exclude such sales, but stresses that no negotiations are currently under way for any of the retailing, construction or insurance subsidiaries. In any event, Fiat will not undertake a 'fire sale', he stresses. He also dismisses persistent reports in the Italian press of the sale of a stake in Fiat itself to a leading Japanese car maker - the most often mentioned contender being Toyota. 'I've got fed up denying it and treat it now as a joke,' he says. Ultimately, it is on the success of its new models that Fiat's fate depends. Pending the introduction of the Uno replacement, this year's outlook for the group remains 'dismal', according to one industry observer. Demand for cars is expected to become more depressed, especially in Italy, while competition will probably intensify. Fiat will continue to be affected this year by the lack of appealing new models while one-off financial costs stemming from plant closures and the possibility of related labour disruption in the face of continuing job cuts and short-time working may worsen. Even assuming the models restore Fiat's status in the west European market and its fortunes at home, the group faces at least two more taxing years.</p>

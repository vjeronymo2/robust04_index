			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US boosts timber sales to Europe EXPORTS of US hardwood timber to Europe have risen sharply to Dollars 435m, an increase of 17 per cent. Latest figures released by the US Department of Commerce show that last year 25 European countries accounted for 45 per cent of US lumber exports. Germany leads the European field, buying Dollars 80m worth of sawn timber, up from Dollars 53m in 1991. There were also increases in the value of lumber shipped to Italy, up 12 per cent, Belgium, up 8 per cent, the Netherlands, up 29 per cent, and Spain, up 31 per cent. Total US hardwood timber export receipts in 1992 amounted to Dollars 1.9bn, compared with Dollars 400m four years ago. Sawn timber exports accounted for Dollars 974m, up 13 per cent. Exports now represent about 10% of all hardwood produced in the US. Mr Michael Buckley, European director of the American Hardwood Export Council, said environmental pressures on timber sources elsewhere in the world were working in favour of the US. It had been able to demonstrate the existence of strict legislation and controls in harvesting hardwood, coupled with evidence of a long history of sustained yield management and regeneration.</p>

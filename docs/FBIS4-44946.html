			<p>CSO     [Text] Bangalore, April 28--The Bangalore-based National  Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) has designed and developed an  Integrated Flight Data Processing (IFDP) system at a cost of Rs.  40 lakhs [rupees] for all types of Digital Flight Data Recorder  (DFDR), commonly known as Black Box in aviation parlance, and  Quick Access Recorder (QAR) used by Air India.    According to Dr K.N. Raju, NAL director, the system,  developed in a record time of nine months, is based on Tata  Unisys U600/60 mini computer. It could be used to acquire data  from four known sources of DFDRs and QARs simultaneously to  speed up data acquisition.    The system is also capable of processing the raw data,  acquiring data from a specific GMT, data transcription,  conversion of engineering units and display of selected  parameters. It could also check on various parameter limit  "exceedencies" during a selected flight.    Dr Raju said the system developed at Air India's behest  could  also reply and analyse flight data recorded either on DFDR or on  performance monitoring recorders (PMRs) to provide vital clues  during investigation of accidents or incidents. It would now be  available to other air taxi operators in the country following a  Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) directive that it  would be mandatory for these operators to have data from DFRs  for at least three months.    Stating that most of the private operators were not even  maintaining the Black Box properly, Dr Raju said an additional  feature of the system was that it contained a special event  search monitoring and analysis software.    The software sets up a database of all the detected events,  allowing them to be interrogated by time period and aircraft  registration with the output used to assess which operating  techniques or other characteristics were causing erosion of  safety margins. The routine information generated by this  analysis was complementary to the assessments by pilots and  would enhance air safety. The IFDP had provision to achieve the  processed data on a mass storage media for potential  applications such as engine health monitoring flight operation  analysis and fuel efficiency monitoring.    According to Dr Raju, the IFDP had a good export potential  as  it would cost 50 to 60 per cent less than the available data  readers abroad. Further, it would also help the aircraft  operators to get readouts of the black box within the country,  as at present they had to seek sources from abroad for such  readouts.    According to Dr S. Nagabhushana, head of the Aerospace Lab  of  NAL, the laboratories had over the past five years developed  expertise in the readout and analysis of both the Black  Boxes--the DFDRs and the Cockpit Voice Recorders (CVRs) of  aircraft including Boeing 737 and 747, Airbus A300, A310 and  A320. The system for the Sundstrand Universal Flight data  recorder (UFDRs) used by the 737 Boeings with air taxi services  which would be available in a month's time.    Dr Nagabhushana said though DFDRs generally confirm to the  Aeronautical Radio Incorporated (ARINC) 573 standards, each  aircraft was fitted with DFDRs of different makes, necessitating  tailor-made systems both in terms of hardware and software.    NAL had specialised in addressing these problems and had  acquired indigenous capability to develop sophisticated readout  systems.    The related future plans before NAL included four  dimensional  flight path reconstruction, analysis of damaged tapes (accident  investigation), realtime satellite data links using Inmarsat and  development of solid state DFDRs used in Boeing 747--400s.    The IFDP would be handed over to Air India here on May 4.</p>

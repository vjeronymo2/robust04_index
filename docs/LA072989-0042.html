			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CLARK IS COSTIC TO PITCHERS IN 12-3 PANORAMA CITY WIN  </P> <P> Adam Clark has always admired the talent of Tim Costic, his former teammate at  Monroe High and now a fellow member of the Panorama City American Legion  baseball team. Clark batted behind Costic all season at Monroe and was in the  same position in Friday's second-round Area 6 playoff game against  Westlake-Agoura at Birmingham High.  </P> <P> As usual, it seemed nobody wanted to pitch to Costic, while they were  practically lining up to take a shot at Clark.  </P> <P> Yet Clark came through to lead Panorama City to a 12-3 win and into a 12:30  p.m. showdown today with District 20 rival Woodland Hills West, also unbeaten  in two Area 6 playoff games. Westlake-Agoura (28-5-4), the District 16  champion, was eliminated after being outscored, 23-3, in two games.  </P> <P> With a runner on second and Panorama City (23-6) trailing, 2-0, in the fourth,  Costic was intentionally walked. Clark followed with a two-run double off the  center-field fence. In the fifth, Costic was thrown four unhittable pitches --  amounting to another intentional walk -- and Clark again doubled, driving in a  run to give Panorama City a 4-2 lead.  </P> <P> "When they walk a guy ahead of me like that, I get pumped up to hit," Clark  said. "I really just try to put the ball in play."  </P> <P> Right-hander Roland De La Maza (8-0) threw a nine-hitter, struck out 10 and  walked none and Joe Cascione had four hits for Panorama City.

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Economic Watch: East German output increases East German industrial output rose sharply by 10.7 per cent in September from August and increased by 14.2 per cent compared with a year ago, the German economics ministry reported yesterday. The ministry said the end of the summer holidays was a contributing factor, but several recent studies from leading economists have said the recovery in eastern Germany was 'widening'. Manufacturing, which bore the brunt of the restructuring over the past five years, rose 16.3 per cent in September from August and 19.6 per cent year-on-year. Construction output rose by 5.1 per cent in September from August and was up 11.4 per cent from a year earlier. Mining output rose by 15.1 over the same period, although it had declined by 10 per cent on a year-on-year comparison. Belgian year-on-year inflation dipped from 2.12 per cent to 1.99 per cent in November, the first time it has been below 2 per cent since December 1988. The annual growth of Greece's M3 money supply aggregate decelerated to 9.7 per cent in September from 10.6 per cent in August, and M4 slightly accelerated to 10.7 per cent from 10 per cent.</p>

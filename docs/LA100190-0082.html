			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH'S POPULARITY FAILED TO PROVIDE CLOUT;  </P> <P> POLITICS: THE PRESIDENT WAS FORCED TO MAKE COMPROMISES DESPITE HIS HIGH  APPROVAL RATING. HE COULD ALSO FACE A BACKLASH FROM GOP CONSERVATIVES.  </P> <P> With his approval rating topping 70% and the nation rallying around his Persian  Gulf policy, President Bush seems at the apex of his popularity. But to reach  an agreement on the federal budget, he was forced to make major concessions.  </P> <P> Bush dropped his insistence on "no new taxes" just to get the budget  negotiations started, and he was forced to abandon his plan to reduce taxes on  capital gains to bring them to a close.  </P> <P> In-between, he also gave in to Democratic demands for some $33 billion in  increased taxes on upper-income taxpayers, including a complicated limit on tax  deductions, increased luxury taxes and an increase in tax charges for Medicare.  </P> <P> The result illustrates the limits on how far a President can translate  popularity in foreign affairs into political clout at home. And it also  demonstrates the marked difference between Bush and his predecessor, Ronald  Reagan, who refused opportunities to take a similar deal to reduce the deficit  because of his insistent opposition to higher taxes.  </P> <P> Democrats also faced limits on their power. As Senate Majority Leader George J.  Mitchell (D-Me.) noted, it remains unclear whether leaders of either party will  be able to get their followers to ratify the politically unpopular compromises  that the budget deal comprises.  </P> <P> "Now comes the hard part," Mitchell said as the budget agreement was announced  in the White House Rose Garden.  </P> <P> Less than four weeks ago, when he spoke to a joint session of Congress, Bush  tried to use support for his Persian Gulf policy to leverage votes for his  position on the budget. Strength abroad required strength at home, he told  members of Congress. And strength at home, he said, would require a budget plan  along the lines he wanted.  </P> <P> The gambit was chancy. Past presidents had "never been able to translate  support for foreign policy into support for a domestic agenda," conservative  political analyst Kevin Phillips pointed out at the time. President Franklin D.  Roosevelt, for example, was forced to give up much of his New Deal program  during World War II.  </P> <P> Bush fared no better. During his speech, as on numerous occasions before and  since, Bush specifically said that a budget agreement would have to include a  capital gains tax cut -- an issue he had advocated during his 1988 presidential  campaign and one that he had pressed ever since.  </P> <P> But Bush could not budge Democratic leaders, who resisted on grounds that  cutting the capital gains taxes favored the rich. In the end, over the last  week, key Republicans, led by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.),  abandoned him as well.  </P> <P> "Sometimes you just don't get it just the way you want," Bush said as he  announced the budget deal. "This is such a time for me."  </P> <P> Bush did obtain some items that he and his advisers wanted. The agreement  includes new tax breaks for the oil industry, an issue for former oilman Bush,  and new tax credits for research and development, which Bush and his aides  believe will increase economic productivity.  </P> <P> The deal also provides an enforceable limit on spending for domestic programs  -- a step that will require congressional Democrats to make difficult choices  over the next several years as constituencies clamor for more federal aid.  </P> <P> Above all, there is the deal itself, which will substantially reduce the  federal budget deficit and which, at least for now, would break the deadlock  over fiscal policy that had threatened to paralyze federal decision-making.  </P> <P> But the fact that getting the deal, in the end, did come before everything else  underlines a central element of the Bush presidency. Unlike Reagan, who had a  set of issues in which he believed strongly and on which he was unwilling to  compromise, Bush, as his aides say, is basically interested in "process," not  ideology. There are few specific things the President will not sacrifice to  achieve a compromise.  </P> <P> That approach makes it far easier to reach deals. But Bush's style has costs as  well. More ideological members of his own party already are angry at the  President for giving up on causes they believe in. And the compromise on taxes  -- which remains one of the most potent political issues of the era -- will  deprive Republicans of a potent weapon as the fall congressional campaigns head  into their final five weeks.  </P> <P> One indication of the problems Bush may face was the conspicuous absence of  Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), a leader of conservatives in the House, as the  budget agreement was unveiled Sunday afternoon. Without the support of Gingrich  and his followers, Bush will have to rely ever more heavily on the majority  Democrats -- a source of support that could prove increasingly shaky if Bush's  overall popularity slips.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOW DEFICIT WILL BE CUT  </P> <P> In billions of dollars  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.65IN:1.56IN:1.67IN:1.67IN:1.67IN:1.67IN:1.67IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="7"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1991-  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1991  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1992  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1993  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1994  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1995  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1995  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Discretionary programs  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 9.8*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 22.6*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 34.8*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 53.2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 62.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 182.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Mandatory programs  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 12.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 20.9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 23.9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 28.8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 33.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 119.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Tax increases  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 16.2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 26.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 27.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 32.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 31.8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 133.8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Reduced interest costs  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6.5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 12.2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 18.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 25.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 64.8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> TOTAL DEFICIT REDUCTION  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 40.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 76.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 97.9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 132.5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 152.8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 500.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> *Defense savings.  </P> <P> Source: Office of Management and Budget  </P></p>

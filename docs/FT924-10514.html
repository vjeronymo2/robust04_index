			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: Swiss National Bank to ease syndicate rules THE Swiss National Bank will continue to require lead managers of Swiss franc bond syndicates to have a local domicile after the planned creation next year of the European Economic Area (EEA). Mr Hans Meyer, a director of the Swiss central bank, said the country would be obliged to liberalise its syndicate rules next year if the Swiss people ratified the EEA treaty in a referendum on December 6. However, the bank had learned that many other European countries were not about to liberalise completely their syndicate rules, and so Switzerland would not either. Currently all members of a Swiss bond syndicate are required to have a Swiss domicile. Mr Meyer said in future all members other than the lead manager could be based in other European countries.</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Exceptional lifts Whitecroft to Pounds 8.7m Whitecroft, the Cheshire-based lighting, textiles, building products and medical cotton fibres group, yesterday reported a sharp increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.82m to Pounds 8.74m for the six months to September 30. However, Pounds 5.91m of this came from the disposal last April of Whitecroft's option to renew its lease on a Stockport office block. Stripping this out gives a fairer picture of Whitecroft's success at restructuring, after its near-collapse in the recession. Operating profits were 55 per cent ahead at Pounds 2.83m, on turnover only 10 per cent up at Pounds 66.7m (Pounds 60.8m). Earnings per share were boosted to 16.7p (3.6p) as a result of the exceptional item, which accounted for 11.7p. The remaining 5p, however, has encouraged Whitecroft to pay its first interim dividend - 1.5p - since the recession caught the company badly exposed in property markets. By stressing the exceptional nature of the results, Whitecroft is dampening expectations that however successful it is in its normal markets, the company may not be able to match this financial performance next year. It has given its investors a roller-coaster ride for the last four years, but is stressing that future profit fluctuations should be temporary or technical. Mr Mike Derbyshire, chief executive, said disposals and sales from Whitecroft's written-down property portfolio have reduced borrowings to under Pounds 10m and gearing to 29 per cent. A year ago, gearing was 119 per cent and borrowings Pounds 30m. All divisions made operating profits, with lighting the star performer at Pounds 2.32m (Pounds 1.89m). Medical cotton fibre - used in tampons and medical products - made only Pounds 567,000 (Pounds 1.06m) because of a 50 per cent rise in world cotton prices. Passing some of this on to customers saw sales volume drop by 7 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "National Alliance Sharp on Rumoured </F> Bribesville Moves"]    [Text] (ANSA) Cagliari, June 18 -- The National Alliance  (AN) representative at the Justice Ministry this morning  signalled that his rightist group, one of the three main  government partners alongside Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia  and the Northern League, will fight a rumoured legislative  solution to the Bribesville crisis as outlined in today's press.    Referring to press reports that Justice Minister Alfredo  Biondi (of the Centrist Union, a close Berlusconi ally) is  looking at an extension of plea bargaining and other measures,  Justice Undersecretary Gian Franco Anedda said he was  "absolutely against any reform of the penal code that will have  the effect, or may be interpreted as having the effect, of  easing the position of defendants being tried for crimes against  public administration. All the more so if, in order to save them  from jail once their guilt has been proven, an attempt is made  to frame legislation that is preferential to all."    "I clearly manifested my opposition, in harmony with the  National Alliance line, when the Minister tasked the ministerial  offices with drafting an organic proposal on the subject, which  must still be examined and discussed. I therefore deem  absolutely immature the possibility of a bill being presented to  cabinet. Unless Minister Biondi means to take the initiative  upon himself alone, something which I rule out."    L'INDIPENDENTE, a paper normally seen as sympathetic to the  government, featured most prominently this morning the latest  alleged version of a "judicial solution" for the nationwide  kickbacks scandal that has shaken the political and business  establishments. "Biondi's Solution for Bribesville" was its  main headline, over a summary of "a bill on extending plea  bargaining, to be put to the cabinet shortly."    Among the measures listed were: "plea bargaining extended to  crimes carrying sentences up to three and a half years;  defendants have six months to confess their guilt; kickback  offenders are barred from public office for five years and  forced to pay back their ill-gotten gains."    "These norms will be valid for those who have already been  sentenced under existing laws," it also highlighted.    A collection of law adjustments seen by opponents as letting  offenders off too lightly, by proponents as offering a  much-needed "political solution" to Bribesville, was slapped  down by a national "whitewash" outcry and President Oscar Luigi  Scalfaro's refusal to endorse it at the height of the scandals  about 15 months ago.    Roughly 1,000 people, mostly politicians and businessmen,  have been caught up in the Bribesville probes. The vast  majority of the cases have yet to come to court, and magistrates  are themselves in favour of streamlining procedures to avert  what many fear will be serious system overload.</p>

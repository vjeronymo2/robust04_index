			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Observer: Easy access Who said resigning has gone out of fashion? Not in New Zealand it hasn't, where Jeff Chapman has given up his job as auditor general, following TV reports that he has defaulted on credit card payments of NZDollars 23,000 (about Pounds 8,850). The serious fraud office is also looking into dealings involving up to NZDollars 60,000 of audit office funds. Chapman was responsible for scrutinising the financial statements of government departments, local authorities and most government-controlled corporations, boards and companies. All over New Zealand, the sound of calculators can be heard, clicking late into the night. . .</p>

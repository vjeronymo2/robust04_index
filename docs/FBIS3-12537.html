Diplomats said this was yet another gesture of good will on  the part of the Syrian Government in a bid to improve its  relations with the United States and promote the peace process  in the Middle East. [passage omitted]    Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres stated yesterday that Israel  still needs a gesture on the part of the Syrian president that  will prove the seriousness of his intentions with regard to  peace.    "If we are talking about confidence-building measures, then  these measures are too small to build the necessary confidence,"  Peres commented yesterday.    "The release of Jews or the willingness to issue them  passports are nothing new. We would like to see something more  serious, along the lines of a public declaration such as: `I  want to make peace with Israel,' as al-Sadat did; or conversely,  a visit to Israel or public negotiations on all levels," Peres  said.

			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Fokker plans big job cuts FOKKER, the Dutch aircraft builder, yesterday announced plans for deep job cuts in response to the continuing malaise in the civil aviation market. The company, which is due to pass into the control of Germany's Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), is to eliminate 2,118 out of 12,500 jobs this year, mostly through compulsory redundancies. Fokker said it did not expect demand for new aircraft to begin reviving until 1995. The job losses had been expected, particularly after the company said several weeks ago that it was again reducing output to match lower sales prospects. Production of the 50-seater turboprop Fokker 50 is to be cut to 20 a year from 27, while the number of new 100-seater Fokker 100s is to fall to 40 from 59. Fokker said that the job losses and other cost-cutting moves will generate annual cost savings of Fl 270m (Pounds 103m). Wages represent some 70 per cent of Fokker's production costs. The company is also proposing to freeze the wages of its remaining workers.</p>

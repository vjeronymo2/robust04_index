			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Bellway rises 73% and sees further growth Shares in Bellway rose 11p to 249p yesterday after the housebuilding group reported a 73 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 5.79m to Pounds 10m in the six months to January 31. Turnover rose 44 per cent, from Pounds 56.1m to Pounds 80.7m, and margins increased from 8.9 per cent to 11.4 per cent. The number of homes sold was 45 per cent higher at 1,212 (833), while the average selling price increased from Pounds 63,000 to Pounds 65,000. Mr Kenneth Bell, chairman, said: 'With the evidence that the market place has improved, we are optimistic that a similar rate of growth can be attained this year.' Mr Bell said there were a few signs of temporary overheating in land prices, but the group was fortunate in having a land bank extensive enough to be able to temper its level of land purchases for a period. Bellway, which had a Pounds 33.6m rights issue in March last year, reduced its cash from Pounds 44.3m last July to Pounds 6.5m by January. In addition, borrowings increased from nil to Pounds 6.7m. Mr Bell said this substantial cash outflow was caused primarily by an increase in land and work in progress, required to fuel expansion plans. 'On January 31 1994, the group had some 10,500 plots of land with planning permission. Our plans are to continue to increase our land holdings which should enable us to meet our future targets.' The group mainly attributed the improvement in margins to more reasonable levels of profitability in its north London and north-east of England subsidiaries. Mr Bell was optimistic about prospects. 'The group is now starting to benefit from the expansion of our established divisions during recent years and, additionally, from geographical expansion into Wessex and Yorkshire. This year, we have also started a further division in south Wales which should contribute to the group's results next year.' Earnings per share rose by 59 per cent to 5.9p (3.7p). The interim dividend goes up 10 per cent to 2.2p (2p). COMMENT These results were well ahead of expectations, hence the share price rise in a falling market. Bellway was one of the first housebuilders to tap the market last year, enabling it to build up enough of a land bank to cover up to four years' building. But although partly protected from the current overheating in land prices, Bellway is not immune and, like any other housebuilder, would suffer if interest rates were to rise. The shares have had a good run, increasing 64 per cent since the beginning of last year. On forecast full-year profits of Pounds 24.5m. they are on a prospective multiple of about 17, which looks reasonable.</p>

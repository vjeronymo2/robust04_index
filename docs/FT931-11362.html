			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / New shape to old proposals: Customs and tax THE GOVERNMENT'S revenue-raising agencies yesterday re-packaged a number of existing initiatives to offer as part of the Department of Trade and Industry's deregulatory initiative. HM Customs &amp; Excise was singled out under five areas: Substantial reduction in forms, as a result of the single European market. Abolition of duties on mechanical lighters and matches. Increased thresholds for value added tax and cash accounting. Review of the registration and licensing requirements for excise and inland customs. Proposals to decriminalise many excise offences, and the introduction of an independent appeals system. The Inland Revenue was highlighted under three areas: Pay-and-file of corporation tax by which companies assess their own liability, to be introduced this October. Consultation for the reform of the taxation system for the self-employed, with the introduction of the pay-and-file system, allowing taxpayers to assess their own tax as soon as the 1996 tax year. Extending the number of companies which can submit abbreviated, three-line accounts for assessment, from turnover of Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 15,000 a year. In addition, officials yesterday stressed a number of other areas in which it has been active in reducing red tape. These include extensive 'customer' surveys to understand the needs of the self-employed, employees and employers and a continual review and re-writing of tax forms and information leaflets to make the system more understandable.</p>

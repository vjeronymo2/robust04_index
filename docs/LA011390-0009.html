			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REBUILDING THE COLISEUM FOR THE L.A. RAIDERS  </P> <P> I root for the Raiders. George Blanda and Dave Casper, and then Jim Plunkett  and Coach Tom Flores and Marcus Allen taught me to root for the Raiders.  </P> <P> But when it comes to a test between Al Davis and the Los Angeles Coliseum, I  forget all about the Raiders. The Los Angeles Coliseum is the next greatest  thing in California to the Golden Gate Bridge.  </P> <P> I rarely advocate lynching; it is quite uncivilized. Tearing down the Coliseum  would be as uncivilized as lynching. May the people considering it get the  point.  </P> <P> GILBERT S. BAHN  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks  </P></p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (20): French performance slows Payment performance in France has deteriorated markedly over the past year, in spite of government initiatives to deal with the problem. According to the EU small business association Europmi, 48 per cent of French companies report difficulties in collecting monies owed them. A survey by the UK accountancy group Grant Thornton found that only 4 per cent of French firms interviewed reported an improvement in payment performance by their customers over the previous year. The recession is partly to blame for trading customers' reluctance to settle their bills on time. Many have themselves suffered from poor sales and a shortage of income with which to pay suppliers. Another factor may have been the high interest rates that prevailed during recent years, as the French government battled to maintain the value of the Franc against the Deutsche Mark. Bruno Wattenbergh, administrative secretary of Europmi, says delays worsened during 1993 as small firms began to pile up debts to their suppliers even faster than large companies had done. A study commissioned this year by the French government warns that payment delays will undermine competitiveness in the domestic market and weaken French firms' ability to take advantage of the EU single market. The government responded by launching further studies and putting pressure on industries to sign professional agreements setting out payment norms. Credit information group Dun &amp; Bradstreet identifies a number of long-term trends that may have contributed to the increased number of payment delays and insolvencies. Privatisation in the banking sector means banks are tightening up on overdrafts and loans, putting pressure on customers short of cash. Insolvency laws in France impose fewer penalties on the directors of failed companies than on those in other European states, giving those facing difficulties less incentive to battle on to try to save their firm rather than shutting down and setting up afresh. The generation that founded many family firms during post-war economic recovery is now retiring, selling up or handing over the reins to offspring. For many in the new generation of small company bosses, this recession is their first and they often lack the experience to cope.</p>

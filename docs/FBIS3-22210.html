			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Dmitry Litvinov, coordinator of the </F> Greenpeace of Russia organization, by Dmitry Ukhlin:  ``Greenpeace: We Will Work With Any Party'']    [Text] Q.: What event marked the start of  Greenpeace's involvement in Russia?    A.: In the USSR we began in Kiev with the Children of  Chernobyl project. In 1990 our vessel sailed to Novaya Zemlya to  protest against nuclear testing. At that time we were held in  custody for more than two weeks. The second time we sailed there  was last year to document the Russian Navy's dumping of nuclear  waste and spent reactors from nuclear submarines in the sea. Our  boat was arrested and our ship Solo was fired on and captured,  moreover, in international waters. We were again held in custody  for a week. As a result, a governmental commission was formed  under the chairmanship of Alexei Yablokov, adviser to the  President on matters of ecology. We secured what we wanted to  achieve. Today, Greenpeace of Russia stands already quite firmly  on its feet.    Q.: Whose money does Greenpeace owe its existence  to?    A.: The system of our financing took final shape in the  mid-1980s. We take no money either from governments and private  companies or from any funds whatsoever. Individual donations  account for 99 percent of Greenpeace's money and 1 percent comes  from the sale of T-shirts and souvenirs. Every national  organization, collecting individual donations in its own  country, allots 22 percent for Greenpeace International. This  money is distributed among the others, mainly those who are just  beginning their work and do not yet have considerable funds of  their own as in Japan, for example. Or else it is apportioned  for large-scale international acts--today the biggest of them is  under way in Britain where we want to close down the Thor  factory used for recycling nuclear weapons. Huge sums have been  allotted for this purpose, and victory is already just around  the corner.    Q.: What are Greenpeace's priorities in Russia?    A.: We protest against the production of plutonium in the  course of recycling used nuclear fuel. In general, nuclear power  engineering is a threat for the whole world, not only for the  inhabitants of areas adjacent to nuclear power plants.    Q.: In other countries Greenpeace is fighting against  the dumping of toxic wastes. They are taken to Russia--and here  Greenpeace doesn't let them in. Am I right?    A.: Quite right. We want to make sure that there should be  no  toxic waste in general. And this is quite feasible as technical  ways to solving the problem already exist.    Q.: It is impossible to carry out serious ecological  work in a country without getting in touch directly with its  power structures. How does it take place in Russia?    A.: We are continuously working with the authorities. And,  while not being a political organization, we secure any  ecological victory we can at a political level. We worked with  the Supreme Soviet and we will also work with the new structures  in all the regions. If a person responsible for the adoption of  one or another bill does not listen to our arguments, there is a  need for recourse to pressure--through the press or from among  that person's constituents. But for me it is absolutely  unimportant what political views this or that deputy may have.    We are delighted by the Constitution's adoption because  presidential power has been very weak in responding to our  actions. This is particularly visible in the localities where  the governor appointed from Moscow has absolutely no idea about  local problems and is not interested in their solution--in  contrast to the now dissolved local Soviets. However bad they  might have been, they were closer to the region's population.    Q.: The following opinion of your organization exists:  Greenpeace is good, of course, they are young enthusiasts, but  they are often drawn into not altogether clean games, being used  either in rival ``settlements'' or in politics. How do you  respond to this?    A.: Well, of course, in America Greenpeace is a ``hand of  the  KGB'' and in the USSR it used to be a ``hand of the CIA.'' In  Sweden we are in general a ``hand'' of both the KGB and the CIA  simultaneously. All this is rubbish. In this organization I have  never encountered dependence on any political or economic  situation whatsoever. Russia's Ministry of the Nuclear Power  Industry says, for example, that Greenpeace wants to close  Russian nuclear power plants in favour of German ones. For those  who know how hard we have ``worked'' on German atomic power  stations this is simply ridiculous.    Q.: And the last question: what is the biggest headache  for Greenpeace today?    A.: The ozone hole. The latest information from American  satellites is such that in 1993 it has increased more than was  predicted. No way out has yet been found. For the time being we  are not working on this issue in Russia although its  ``contribution'' to the problem is enormous.</p>

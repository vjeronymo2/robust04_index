			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Margin of error The question of how to measure an insurance company's financial health will no doubt figure prominently in any inquest into Municipal Mutual (MMI). It is clear that tinkering around with the solvency margin - net assets as a proportion of non-life premiums - does not provide a particularly satisfactory solution. Premium income can be an unreliable proxy for risk in a competitive pricing environment, while the ratio as presently calculated fails to take into account the gearing effect of any movement in investments or claims reserves. At the end of 1991, for instance, investments and reserves amounted to respectively four and three times the combined shareholders' funds of the five quoted composites. Perhaps refinements are possible, such as a more sophisticated weighting of assets as is already done for the banks. Regulators in the US have taken steps in this direction. Risks might also be better differentiated, so that employers' liability, for instance, is given a more demanding rating than other mundane types of business. Quarterly reporting (not least in the light of MMI's delayed and heavily qualified annual report) and verification of claims reserves by qualified actuaries might also help, though there is a danger of adding to companies' administrative burdens. As things stand, though, the Department of Trade and Industry ought to have sufficient information available, hence suggestions that it was slow to act. The building society regulator, by contrast, seems to be rather more adept at picking up problems before it is too late.</p>

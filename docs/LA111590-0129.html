			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITIES WANT TO DRAW UP OWN REDISTRICTING  PLAN  </P> <P> Dissatisfied with the political splintering of the San Gabriel Valley under a  court-sanctioned redistricting plan for the county Board of Supervisors,  several cities are collecting money to hire experts to draw up their own plan.  </P> <P> The San Gabriel Valley Assn. of Cities wants to place most of the area in one  supervisorial district, and to enlarge the board from five members to seven.  </P> <P> The proposed redrawn lines would be submitted to the Board of Supervisors next  year for consideration during reapportionment.  </P> <P> Thirty-two cities have been asked to contribute $500 each to hire National  Demographics Corp. of Claremont -- at a total cost of $22,500 -- to draw  proposed supervisorial boundaries using 1990 census data. Donations also are  being solicited from a number of corporations.  </P> <P> Cities that have agreed to contribute include Alhambra, Arcadia, Azusa,  Glendora, La Puente and San Dimas.  </P></p>

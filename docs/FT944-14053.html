			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: EVC This year's bottom line at EVC, the PVC business being floated by Enichem and Imperial Chemical Industries, will not make pretty reading. On a pro-forma basis, losses of Fl 22.6m will be exacerbated by a Fl 477.5m extraordinary charge. But investors should not be dismayed. Profitability, at least in the short term, should be robust as a result of rationalisation and the cyclical upturn. The potential for cost-cutting is large: though EVC is Europe's largest PVC maker, it has a long way to go before it is the most efficient. If the management can reduce costs, particularly in politically charged and unionised Italy, the benefits will fall quickly to earnings. It is hard to gauge where EVC's earnings will peak in this cycle. That is not just because yesterday's prospectus failed to include earnings at the last peak. The main concern is that additional environmental legislation may curb demand, while the return of East European imports could increase supply. Another concern is that EVC has not spelt out how buying its raw materials from companies which will no longer be its parents could affect its cost base. Investors also need to take account of the fact that EVC's tax charge will rise rapidly after 1997, as the tax benefit of recent losses comes to an end. All this means that earnings are likely to move ahead strongly in the short term but the long-term prospects are probably dull. For those who buy in the float, the timing of profit taking will prove critical.</p>

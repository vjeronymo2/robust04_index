			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 11 KYODO -- South Korean President Kim  Yong-sam said Saturday [11 June] relatively lengthy U.N.  Security Council discussions on sanctions against North Korea  may help Pyongyang return to the negotiating table, Japanese  officials said.    Kim, meeting Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, called  such discussions a meaningful process for urging North Korea to  make its nuclear program more transparent, the officials said.    Kakizawa met the president in the evening and they confirmed  the importance of cooperation among Japan, South Korea and the  United States on the issue, and of China's role in settling it,  they said.    Earlier in the day, Kakizawa and South Korean Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu held a meeting and confirmed that  sanctions against North Korea over the nuclear standoff are  aimed at encouraging Pyongyang to hold dialogue for a negotiated  solution.    The two sides also pledged close bilateral cooperation in  dealing with North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development  program.</p>

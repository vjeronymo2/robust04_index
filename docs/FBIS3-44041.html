That program, which  is to be implemented as soon as possible, was approved at a  meeting in Maputo of the technical subcommission of the Joint  Mozambique-Malawi Defense and Security Commission. According to  a note received today, that program is to be analyzed during the  sixth Joint Mozambique-Malawi Defense and Security Commission  session to be held in Maputo at a date yet to be determined.

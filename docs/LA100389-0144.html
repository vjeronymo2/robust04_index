			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FERRANTI LOSES ONE-THIRD OF VALUE ON LONDON MARKET  </P> <P> British defense contractor Ferranti, shellshocked by apparent fraud at its U.S.  unit which has cost it almost $300 million, lost about a third of its market  value today when its shares resumed trading on the London stock exchange.  </P> <P> Shares in Ferranti International Signal PLC opened at 81 cents, 32% below the  $1.19 price at which they were suspended Sept. 11 when the scandal broke.  </P> <P> Within seconds, the shares dipped even further but then recovered to stabilize.  Last February they touched their high for the year at $1.83.  </P> <P> The company, which specializes in military electronics, has been rocked by what  it said was a costly fraud involving contracts of its U.S. subsidiary, ISC  Technologies, based in Lancaster, Pa.  </P> <P> Ferranti has alleged that it inherited three fraudulent contracts when it  bought ISC, a weapons firm selling mainly to Third World customers, in 1987.  </P> <P> As a result, the British company will have to write off 185 million pounds  ($299 million) and halve its stated 1988-89 profits.  </P> <P> Ferranti has said it is discussing a range of options to bring in new capital,  including a complete takeover, a rights issue and a minority partner.  </P> <P> But some analysts believe a predator could strike before Ferranti management  clinches its own rescue deal.  </P> <P> "If you wanted to build a stake in Ferranti, today provides a good opportunity  to snap up stock without drawing too much attention," one dealer said.  </P> <P> Ferranti topped the actives list with more than 70 million shares changing  hands in the first hour of trading.  </P> <P> The opening share price valued the whole of Ferranti at $605.4 million, down  from its market capitalization of $890 million at the suspension date.  </P> <P> Market analysts said the share price was higher than expected and predicted  that it will eventually settle at between 65 cents and 73 cents.  </P></p>

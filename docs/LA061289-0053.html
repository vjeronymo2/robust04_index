			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRABERT IS HAPPY TO SEE U.S. MEN'S DROUGHT END  </P> <P> Tony Trabert isn't sorry he is no longer the answer to a trivia question.  </P> <P> Q: Who was the last American to win the French Open?  </P> <P> A: Until Sunday, it was Trabert.  </P> <P> Trabert, who won back-to-back in 1954 and 1955, watched from the television  booth at Roland Garros as Chang became the new answer.  </P> <P> "I'm very, very happy for him," said Trabert, who broadcast the final for an  Australian network. "I think he played exceptionally well. As a matter of fact,  I said before we went on the air that I thought he'd win."  </P> <P> As the failures of U.S. players in the French Open grew, Trabert achieved a  sort of annual notoriety as the last American to win it. Trabert found that  distinction amusing.  </P> <P> "After all, I haven't had anything to do with the other Americans not winning,"  he said.  </P> <P> "Let's face it, John McEnroe should have won it. That would have ended all this  stuff."  </P> <P> McEnroe lost the 1984 final to Ivan Lendl after winning the first two sets.  </P> <P> Coming into the tournament, Trabert had handicapped the U.S. hopefuls, but he  didn't include Chang.  </P> <P> "I certainly didn't think Michael would win," Trabert said. "In fact, I didn't  think any American would do it this year. John pulled out, Andre Agassi wasn't  in the best physical condition. I thought Michael didn't have all the guns to  do it."  </P> <P> Trabert said he considers the French Open the most demanding of the four Grand  Slam events because each point on clay takes so much energy to play.  </P> <P> "But Chang showed a lot of courage," Trabert said. "When things were going  badly for him, it would have been very easy for him to slide into the twilight.  </P> <P> "Both he and Stefan wanted to win. The question was who didn't want to lose the  most." THOMAS BONK  </P></p>

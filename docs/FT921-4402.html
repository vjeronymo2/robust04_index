			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / International Company News: Euroc to cut payout as profits fall to SKr151m EUROC, the Swedish building materials group, yesterday reported a 73 per cent fall in profits after financial items to SKr151m (Dollars 24.9m) for 1991 due to the recession in the construction industry. It proposed cutting its dividend from SKr3.60 to SKr2 as it predicted earnings could continue to decline this year. Euroc blamed most of the profit fall on lower results from foreign operations, including Castle Cement in the UK, Valenciana in Spain and Scancem International in the US, which account for half the company's sales, which fell by 9.5 per cent to SKr10.4bn. Restructuring costs also increased from SKr39m to SKr115m as it eliminated 1,800 jobs in 1991, which reduced its labour force to 7,500. It plans to cut another 500 jobs this year. Euroc's cement business reported the biggest earnings decline with a 93 per cent drop to SKr39m, while profits for building materials were halved to SKr204m.</p>

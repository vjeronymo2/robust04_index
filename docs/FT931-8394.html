			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Letter: Missing an HDTV trick Sir, Your article 'Searching for a clearer picture of the future' (February 11) did not mention that Britain's high definition television ideas are probably the best in the world, though their implementation lags the US. Americans who read my evidence on digital television - presented to the UK home affairs committee in 1988 - saw an opportunity, invested in it and are now looking for the pay-off. UK broadcasters took less notice; the EC supported HD-MAC. US digital television has taken a lead from the Japanese, who encourage fast-track development by a mix of inter-company competition and co-operation. In a few days we will find out which of the four remaining teams of US engineers have designed the best new HDTV system. We should spare a thought for the original front-runner in this race, the Japanese, who have paid royalties to the US for their own use of the existing 40-year-old American colour TV system. Ten years ago they set aside public funds to develop a home-grown HDTV system to redress this balance. The Europeans did the same. It would appear neither strategy has paid off because both camps have ignored newer ideas. Is public funding the common element that induces selective deafness in those whose creativity was once beyond reproach? Brian T Evans, Tantara Tek, 19 Cassiobury Park Avenue, Watford WD1 7LA</p>

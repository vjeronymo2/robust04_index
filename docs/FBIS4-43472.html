			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Henrik Qvortrup: "Social Democrats the Worst"] </F>   [Text] Holger K. Nielsen, chairman of the Socialist  People's Party (SF), has issued a companion volume to Liberal  Anders Fogh Rasmussen's topical book. The two are more in  agreement than one might have thought.    SF chairman Nielsen declares that he is still a Marxist.  Nevertheless he agrees with Rasmussen about many things and the  respect is mutual.    Allow me to present the new Christiansborg [parliament  building] partners: Holger K. Nielsen of the Socialist People's  Party and superliberal Anders Fogh Rasmussen.    They disagree enormously politically, and their styles are  unusually different. But at the same time they share so many  attitudes and viewpoints that one ventures to make the assertion  anyway:    Nielsen and Rasmussen are joined in a strange alliance.    In the next few months Danes will be able to see for  themselves. The two will travel around the country on a joint  lecture tour, and while the obligatory disagreements will  undoubtedly be aired once again, the two politicians will also  stress their favorite common themes to an equally large  extent:     -  The political debate has become mushy.    -  Too few  people today have the courage to take a clear ideological  stand.    -  The Social Democrats are the worst offenders.     Before the tour of Denmark begins, BERLINGSKE TIDENDE made  an  appointment to meet the two politicians. To talk about visions,  but also about their topical books:    Rasmussen's highly ideological book, Fra Socialstat til  minimalstat [From Welfare State to Minimal State] came out  last fall. And Nielsen's book of the same cast and appearance,  but with a somewhat different final result, Frihed i  faellesskab [Freedom in Fellowship], will be available in  bookstores on Tuesday [26 April]. And you have to look closely  at what is written on the book jackets because the two books are  almost indistinguishable.    The two have the same publisher -- Samleren -- and the dust  jackets are practically identical. And as if that were not  enough, there is actually an advertisement for Rasmussen's very  liberal book on the back of Nielsen's book.    Both authors now hope the books can be sold together as a  kind of package solution.    Future purchasers of this odd book package can read about  Rasmussen's frontal assault on the welfare state. And if the  same readers then open the second publication in the package  they can become acquainted with Nielsen's total repudiation of  Rasmussen's social views.    Actually, Nielsen himself says he has written a Marxist  book.    However that is not the point, both authors agree.    For if all the external trappings are peeled away, one thing  remains: Both Nielsen and Rasmussen are full of praise for each  other's work.    "Actually, you have written a pretty good book, Holger,"  Rasmussen says and continues:    "I notice that you bury the class struggle. Perhaps somewhat  guardedly, but you do."  <H5>  Marxism </H5>   Normally this kind of praise -- especially when it comes  from  a Liberal -- would be somewhat doubtful for an SF man. And lest  Rasmussen think a miracle has occurred, Nielsen makes sure to  point out:    "I am a Marxist. Socialism may have a low status  in many quarters, but it still exists in my mind."    But after that has been established Nielsen does not want to  lag behind Rasmussen. The SF chairman also has praise for his  political opponent:    "I like Anders' book because it is clear. I tried to prove  that ideology is not dead. And Anders does the same. I like him  for that," Nielsen says.    The easiest thing, of course, would have been to dismiss  each  other's book. Rasmussen could have zeroed in on Nielsen's  continued profession of Marxism. Similarly, Nielsen could have  focused exclusively on the Liberal ideologist's praise of  private initiative.    Instead they have chosen to do almost the opposite. Of  course  they have to taunt each other, but each will also get the praise  he deserves.    Rasmussen: "I make it a point to emphasize my agreement with  Holger. I think people are tired of the brick wall that many  political books run into. Surely we can afford to agree with  each other even if we are political opponents. The most  important thing is that political thinking occurs at all. So we  should not go around sniping at each other's book."  <H5>  The State </H5>   Rasmussen likes the very title of Nielsen's book:    "Freedom in Fellowship brings back a lot of  memories of my days in VU [Liberal Youth]. Our slogan was  exactly the same back then. So that is definitely a good  beginning."    Nielsen promptly repays the compliment:    "I would also like to praise you, Anders. In you and your  book we see for once a politician who goes into depth about  something ideological. That is also the reason why the book is  so much fun to rebut."    And so he does -- the SF chairman. With the characteristic  half-affectionate, half-teasing undertone that conceals great  respect as a rule, Nielsen tackles Rasmussen's most central  assertions:    First and foremost the one about the excellence of the free  market mechanism.    "There is a difference between a market economy and  democracy. Your view is just too primitive, Anders."    Rasmussen: "I attack the socialists because they believe  that  political management is faultless. I call for some humility  there. The market economy is the only system that gives people a  free rein to strive for the good life."    So much for the market economy, but there are plenty of  points on which the liberal and the socialist speak the same  language and understand each other.    Such as the question of the state, for example. In his book,  Nielsen maintains that there are limits, after all, to growth in  the public sector.    Rasmussen: "That is a very important realization, Holger.  You  should spell this out for your support troops. It is interesting  and very encouraging that you come to grips with the concept of  the state. You want to shift tasks from the state to `civil  society.' That is what I call private initiative. But the words  should not keep us apart."  <H5>  Freedom </H5>   The concept of freedom is another example of what they have  in common:    Nielsen: "It is very important that SF not lose the concept  of freedom to the nonsocialists. It must not be said that the  Liberal Party has a monopoly on freedom, while we are left  behind, representing everything authoritative."    Rasmussen: "The very fact that you found it necessary to use  the word `freedom' in your title confirms that the socialists  find it necessary to argue on liberal terms."    But probably the most important similarity is their strong  shared belief in the value of always expressing standpoints  clearly.    Both politicians loathe colleagues who shrink from  ideological and long-range discussions in favor of the familiar  Christiansborg pragmatism. Both Rasmussen and Nielsen fear that  Danish politics will become a little boring with no one  underlining clear standpoints.    "The kind of discussion where it is hard to tell if a Social  Democrat or a Conservative is speaking is deadly. The whole  thing becomes a confrontation between mush and mush."    Nielsen and Rasmussen agree that the Social Democrats are  the  worst -- the mushiest.    Nielsen: "With the exception of Ritt Bjerregaard there are  no  real thinkers in the Social Democratic Party. For them it has  become a question of power for power's sake -- and otherwise  they are indifferent to substance. There, in my opinion, they  differ sharply from their fellow parties in Sweden, France, and  Germany."    Rasmussen: "On this point I agree 100 percent. It is  striking  how all the political mush is found in the opposition -- among  us and the SF people. The Social Democrats managed to create a  welfare state in the course of a few decades and then came to a  complete standstill in other respects. Today they regard  defending what they once created as their sole and highly  distinguished task."    The covers of both books display pictures of trees on green  fields against a background of blue sky. But -- despite the  similarity -- there are differences:    Nielsen's field appears to be more ecological than  Rasmussen's, which primarily gives the impression of being very  well watered.    And there is only one tree -- though a very lovely one -- on  Rasmussen's book. Nielsen's book is decorated with several --  though they are hardly as resplendent.    What should we infer from that?    First Nielsen:    "Anders probably chose the single tree to show the  possibilities of the individual. I would rather stress that the  individual is connected with the community."    Rasmussen: "I must first note that Holger's group of trees  looks somewhat bedraggled. That must say something about the  fact that when trees -- or people -- shade each other they  become small and somewhat stunted."    And they can continue in this way in the months ahead --  Danish politics' new fast friends, Holger K. Nielsen and Anders  Fogh Rasmussen.</p>

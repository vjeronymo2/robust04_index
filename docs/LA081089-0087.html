			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LONG BEACH REVOKES BALLROOM'S LICENSE IN WAKE OF COMPLAINTS  </P> <P> Acting on complaints of noise, littering and drug use and drug sales, the City  Council has voted unanimously to revoke the business license of Fender's  International Grand Ballroom, which showcases heavy metal and punk bands on  weekends.  </P> <P> The city's Department of Financial Management recommended the action. A  department report said the owner of the downtown nightspot, John Fender, failed  to comply with repeated requests from the city to halt rowdiness allegedly  caused by patrons.  </P> <P> The council also revoked licenses for two party rooms and Player's Sports Bar,  a bar and grill that Fender owns on the same block. The ballroom is at 521 E.  1st St.  </P> <P> "This man has stomped on his neighbors; he's raised havoc," Councilman Wallace  Edgerton said. "If he would have been in my district, I would have shut him  down a year ago."  </P> <P> Nearby residents complain that they have been harassed by patrons loitering in  the area and littering.  </P> <P> Last year, rock fans outside Fender's skirmished with Long Beach police who had  cut off further access to a concert in an overcrowded room.  </P> <P> Fender has contended that patrons have not caused all of the problems. "We're  in downtown Long Beach and have only one show a week, while the area's got  problems seven days a week," he said last month in an interview.  </P> <P> Fender left the hearing last week saying: "It isn't over yet."  </P> <P> His attorney, M. Lawrence Lallande, said he plans to seek a Superior Court  order to force the City Council to schedule another hearing for Fender.  </P> <P> Lallande said Fender has been preoccupied by a five-week criminal trial that  recently concluded when a jury convicted Fender of helping steal more than  $141,000 from Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank in 1987. He had been accused of  conspiring with a bank teller to cover his overdrafts with bogus deposits.  </P> <P> Fender, who is scheduled to be sentenced Aug. 22, faces a prison term of up to  five years.  </P></p>

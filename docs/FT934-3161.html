			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / N Korea plans to initiate reforms North Korea faces serious economic problems, it admitted yesterday, and indicated it plans to adopt reforms. The unprecedented communique was issued as the country's parliament began a two-day session to announce important changes in the country's political leadership and economic administration. Pyongyang said its third seven-year (1987-93) plan had failed to achieve its industrial production goals, especially in electric power, steel and chemical fibre. 'The pace of growth and economic scale envisaged under the third seven-year plan must be adjusted downward,' a report to the ruling Korean Workers' Party said. But it claimed industrial output during the period increased 1.5 times, growing annually at an average 5.6 per cent. The plan had established an industrial production goal of 10 per cent annual growth. The South Korean central bank estimates the North's economic growth was stagnant during the late 1980s before shrinking at an annual 5 per cent during the past three years, primarily due to energy shortages. Pyongyang blamed the poor economic performance on the collapse of the Soviet Union and east European communist countries, which deprived it of economic assistance, such as oil supplies, and trade. In what is regarded as a key shift in economic policy, the government will concentrate on developing agriculture, light industry and foreign trade at the expense of heavy industry. 'The economy must be restructured in a way that ..develops our foreign economic relations so that the economy can adapt to the changing international environment,' the report stated. But the governing principle of juche, or self-reliance, must also be maintained. 'This policy could be in response to Chinese pressure forcing North Korea to adopt reforms or face the prospect of having China end its economic support of the North,' one western diplomat said. China, the North's main outside source of food and fuel, has been urging Pyongyang to adopt market reforms similar to its own.</p>

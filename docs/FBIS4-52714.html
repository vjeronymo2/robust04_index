			<p>BFN     [Text] According to Seoul radio reports, while conducting  a joint tactical exercise for the first half of this year, on 11  May the U.S. imperialists and the puppet clique mobilized  tactical planes of the puppet Air Force and the U.S. Air Force  to conduct a takeoff, landing, and sortie exercise on an  emergency airstrip in South Korea.    That day, the U.S. imperialists and the puppets were  frenzied  in a war exercise for a Northward invasion, including aerial  mobile exercises and weapons supply exercises, by mobilizing  various military planes, including F-16's and F-4's.    The U.S. imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam nation-selling,  traitorous clique are accelerating the provocative war exercise  for a Northward invasion, amplifying the new war danger on the  Korean peninsula.</p>

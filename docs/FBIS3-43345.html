			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pretoria Jan 5 SAPA -- Police investigations into  the Heidelberg tavern attack indicated the attack could have  been planned and executed from Transkei, Law and Order Minister  Hernus Kriel announced on Monday.    Mr Kriel said in a statement there had been a "major  breakthrough" in the police investigation and the matter should  now be taken up by the Transitional Executive Council (TEC) "as  a matter of urgency".    "Investigations have established a direct link between the  perpertrators of the Heidelberg tavern atrocity and the  territory of the Transkei. Furthermore, these investigations  have also established that the Heidelberg tavern and other  attacks could indeed have been planned and executed from the  Transkei," Mr Kriel said.    The minister said ballistic tests had confirnmed that the  weapons used in the Heidelberg attack and the weapons used in  the St James Church massacre were identical. Gunmen burst into  the tavern last Thursday night, killing three women and a man.    In the St James Church attack early last year, armed  attackers killed 12 people, including several Russian sailors.    Transkei military ruler Maj-Gen Bantu Holomisa has said he  is  prepared to hand over suspected attackers if the South African  authorities can identify them.    Mr Kriel said on Wednesday: "Investigations have reached the  stage where a joint investigation between the South African  Police [SAP] and Transkei Police be considered a top priority.  This would include the formation of a joint SAP/Transkei Police  investigation team as rapidly as possible and the SA Police is  ready to implement this."    South Africa last year sent soldiers into Transkei to pursue  suspects in several attacks in South Africa. The soldiers  attacked a home of a Pan-Africanist Congress member, killing  four youths. The incident sparked a political and diplomatic row  in which South Africa's ambassador to the homeland was expelled.    In his statement on Wednesday, Mr Kriel said: "Intensive  investigations have resulted in a major breakthrough by the SA  Police which now makes it essential that this matter be taken up  as a matter of urgency by the Transitional Executive Council.  It is a matter of extreme urgency that the TEC...Give advice on  how to deal with the problem of dealing with suspects who take  refuge in independent states. Speedy action is vital if the  perpertrators are to be brought to justice without delay. It  would be obstructive for the Transkei to insist on adhering  strictly to a rigid and formal process of extradition in these  areas."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Defense: GEC Renounces Ferranti </F> Takeover"]    [Text] GEC has just renounced its takeover bid on the  British defense electronics specialist saying that an  examination of Ferranti's books had revealed a much worse  financial situation than anticipated. GEC had offered one penny  per share, or 10.1 million pounds (some 90 million French  francs) in addition to taking over the Ferranti's debts,  estimated at 140 million pounds.    Following GEC's withdrawal, Ferranti has been put into  receivership. The receiver will try to sell off the company's  assets in an attempt to pay off creditors. Operations may be  sold off one by one, which would enable GEC or others to take  over only the most attractive activities (for example, the sonar  operation managed through a joint company with Thomson-CSF)  without Ferranti's debts. During the first quarter of the  fiscal year, Ferranti recorded a loss of 19.4 million pounds for  revenues which fell by 17 percent to 91 million pounds and an  order book worth 165 million pounds. GEC, for its part, has  just concluded its first quarter with a 2.9 percent increase in  revenues (4.38 billion pounds) and pretax profits totaling 360  million pounds.</p>

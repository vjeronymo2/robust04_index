			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Amsterdam - Other Markets The Dutch market, which had a difficult time at the start of last week under Wall Street's influence, is expected to be a beneficiary of the Fed's rate rise and the better than expected M3 figures. On the corporate front, Nedlloyd's third-quarter figures are due Wednesday and Amev's nine-month figures on Thursday. Looking at the longer term, the Amsterdam market has been put on the overweight list by European strategists at Merrill Lynch, which said that relative to other European markets, p/e valuations appeared to be attractive. Company earnings were seen to be growing strongly in 1994, and there was no reason why this upward trend would not continue, especially as inflation was forecast to remain 'subdued'. However, Merrill warned, while there was nothing in particular to concern investors there was also little to get excited about, and expectations of a growth in earnings had largely been discounted.</p>

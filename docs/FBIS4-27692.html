			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Rosebud" column by Joe Alejandrino: "A Tale of </F> Two Ramoses"]    [Text] Two years ago, several men met at a restaurant in  Lisbon to discuss the holding of an international conference on  East Timor, one of them was Jose Ramos-Horta. Unknown to these  men was a blue-and-white delivery van parked across the street  from the restaurant with a long-range listening device that  recorded their conversation. Inside the van were agents of the  Indonesian Secret Service who were tailing Ramos-Horta, a  well-known leader of the resistance movement of East Timor.    The plan was to hold the conference somewhere in Asia in  November 1993 to coincide with the anniversary of the 1991 Dill  massacre. It would be held under the guise of discussing human  rights, but its real objective was political: to turn East  Timor into a major international issue to force the Suharto  government to grant self-determination to East Timor and push  the Indonesian people to overthrow military rule in favor of a  democratic government. At the end of the conference, a  declaration would be issued condemning the Indonesian Government  for the violation of human rights in East Timor and urging all  nations to follow suit and impose sanctions.    The conference in November had to be postponed, probably  because of funding difficulties but most likely because the  organizers could not find an appropriate venue to hold it in  Asia. The National Democratic Front which maintained contact  with dissident movements worldwide and which was unhappy about  the peace and amnesty proposals of the Ramos government that had  driven a sharp wedge through their ranks, suddenly had a clever  idea. Why not hold it in Manila? The Philippine Government  would then be faced with the unpleasant prospect of stopping the  conference and violating the constitutional provisions on free  speech and free assembly or damaging its close ties with Jakarta  and breaking up ASEAN. Either way, it would be a no-win  situation for Fidel V. Ramos.    In their meetings with Ramos-Horta in Bangkok and Sydney,  Renato Constantino Jr. and Cecilia Jimenez, both known for their  leftist sympathies, broached the idea of holding it within the  premises of the University of the Philippines (UP). If the  Ramos government objected, the UP faculty and students would  rise to defend their academic freedom and autonomy. The  conference was scheduled for May-June 1994. To add an aura of  prestige to the conference, it was decided to invite  international personalities like Danielle Mitterand, the wife of  the French President who was a human rights advocate. This way,  if Fidel V. Ramos tried to stop the conference it would prove an  embarrassment to the Philippine Government.    The Indonesians, who were closely monitoring the situation,  were feeding intelligence reports on a regular basis to Gen. Joe  Almonte, the national security adviser. Thus the question of  the conference was taken up by Cluster E that deals with  security matters. Cluster E concluded there was really nothing  the Philippine Government could do short of violating the  Philippine Constitution.    Jakarta was unhappy. It could not understand why a  conference with clear political overtones aimed at subverting  Indonesian territorial integrity was being allowed by Manila in  a state-subsidized university. Had not Indonesia been a good  and loyal friend? When the Philippines suffered an oil crunch,  it was Indonesian oil that bailed it out. When it was struck by  a natural calamity, Indonesian help was the first on its way.  When the Muslims wanted to secede from the Philippines,  Indonesia acted as a moderating influence in international fora.  In fact, both countries were not only the closest of allies,  they were bound as brothers by race and were together in ASEAN.  Hence Jakarta viewed Manila's lack of firm action as a stab in  the back. What it did not know is that Fidel V. Ramos was  looking quietly and patiently for a legal solution to the crisis.    To show its displeasure, Jakarta postponed the round of  talks  with the MNLF [Moro National Liberation Front] that was being  held in the Indonesian capital as well as its investments and  participation in the East ASEAN Growth Area business conference  in Davao. Manila sent a three-man diplomatic mission led by  former foreign secretary Raul Manglapus to Jakarta to explain  the Philippine position and to reaffirm its full support for the  territorial integrity of Indonesia. The Ramos government,  Manglapus assured the Indonesian foreign minister, would explore  all legal avenues to contain the damage that would be caused by  the East Timor conference. But Jakarta was not appeased.    The furor created by the conference was not lost on the  French whose embassy in Manila kept Paris updated. If General  Suharto was prepared to break with General Ramos over East  Timor, there was no reason why he would not do the same with  Francois Mitterand if Danielle attended the conference. And the  French could not afford such a break given the fragile political  situation in France and its investments in Indonesia. France  was a major supplier of arms to Indonesia and the French  armament industry was in the doldrums due to the end of the Cold  War. It would be in the French national interest that Danielle  stayed out of the conference.    Jakarta stepped up its pressure. It forbade Indonesian  students to participate in any meeting in Manila and its  gunboats arrested Filipino fishermen in Indonesian waters. It  hinted that Filipinos working in Indonesia would lose their jobs  and be repatriated back to Manila. Indonesian NGO's  [nongovernment organizations] threatened to convene a conference  that would affect Philippine territorial integrity. The subtle  message conveyed by Jakarta was that any persons or countries  that would harm Indonesia would be responsible for the harm to  their own people. While aimed specifically at the Philippines,  the message was really addressed to all nations alike.    No right-thinking government could ignore such a message.  The acts of a few would not be allowed to affect the interests  of a whole nation, particularly if they are foreigners acting to  manipulate a situation that serves only their personal ends.  This was the rationale behind President Ramos' decision to ban  foreign participants to the East Timor conference in Manila and  the government had a perfect right to do so. Filipinos could  discuss what they want at that conference since they are  protected by their constitutional rights, but no foreigners have  the right to damage the good relations between countries of  which they are not citizens.    It is understandable that Indonesia reacted the way it did.  Any country with a sense of dignity and sovereignty would have  done the same. When Harvey Firestone tried to separate Mindanao  from the rest of the Philippines in the early 1900's to benefit  the American rubber industry, Manuel L. Quezon threatened to  lead a revolt against the United States. The bill sponsored by  Representative Bacon of New York died a quiet death in the House  Committee on Insular Affairs.    President Ramos' decision to ban foreign participants was  clearly in the national interest. Countries that are poor  cannot afford to eat on principles by being the world policemen  of human rights. Nor can one affect change by isolating  Indonesia, as Jose Ramos-Horta proposes to do. Had Fidel V.  Ramos not done what he did, the damage to the Philippines would  have been incalculable. History would surely have branded him  as a traitor for the hardships brought upon his people.  Something that the local convenors of the East Timor conference  would do well to reflect on.</p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Questions of life and Aids - An HIV test may still signify high risk in spite of a new ruling The tough discrimination policy of UK life offices against people who have been tested for the HIV virus, which is thought to cause Aids, was apparently relaxed this week and should lead to rate cuts for life assurance policies and endowment mortgages. But insurers may still regard those who have sought the test as high risk. Although the information would not be on the proposal form, it is readily available from applicants' GPs. The controversial questions on HIV testing, introduced in 1987, asked if the applicant had ever had a test for HIV or sexually transmitted diseases. The Association of British Insurers this week said that insurers should withdraw this question and instead ask if the applicant has ever had a positive test result or undergone treatment for HIV or sexually transmitted diseases. The ABI said it was prepared to change the wording because Aids-related claims since 1987 - estimated at Pounds 50m - were much lower than expected. Men and women who voluntarily sought the HIV test were classed as high risk and either had to pay much higher premiums or in some cases were refused cover. In 1988, when insurers' fears about Aids-related claims reached fever pitch, premiums for young single men rocketed, whether or not they had been tested. In that year the premium for an Allied Dunbar 10-year convertible-term assurance policy with a sum assured of Pounds 100,000 for a 30-year-old man rose from Pounds 8.16 to Pounds 22.16 per month - an increase of 270 per cent. The same year Scottish Life doubled its monthly premium rates for younger men while Friends Provident rates rose by 180 per cent. The ABI says it expects some insurers to reduce these inflated rates now that the need for large reserves was less critical. Shopping around for the best value is still essential. Allied Dunbar now charges Pounds 14.80 for the policy mentioned above and existing policyholders benefit from the reduction, as well as new applicants. Although you no longer need to answer the question on the life insurance form asking whether you have had an HIV test, do not expect the company to tell you that unasked. Our straw poll of companies the day after the ABI announcement showed that most were uncertain about what they would do to implement the change. 'Our underwriters will accept a questionnaire from an applicant who has scored through the HIV/ Aids questions,' said Clerical Medical, but they have not yet decided how salesmen should approach the subject. Abbey Life will be sending a circular to its salesmen and they can meanwhile refer questions back to head office. Legal &amp; General plans to reconvene its Aids working party, and with charming candour said that the speed of its own reaction would depend on whether the competition seemed to be moving faster. Even when insurers produce new forms which drop the question about Aids-testing, they will still be able to find out whether you have had an Aids-test from your GP's medical records. Ivan Massow, an independent financial adviser who specialises in insurance for gay men, said: 'GPs naturally will ask tested patients about their sexual history and number of partners and this will go on file. All this information will be available to the insurers.' Every life insurance proposal form asks for permission to contact the prospective client's GP - a practice condoned by the British Medical Association (BMA) provided the patient has given consent. 'People have no choice on the matter. You simply cannot get life assurance if you refuse permission. A handful of GPs do not co-operate with insurers' requests but most willingly oblige. With this right of access, insurers don't need to rely on the proposal form - they can find out anyway,' said Massow. Massow urged those who, for peace of mind, want an HIV test to continue to use sexually transmitted diseases clinics where confidentially is protected by criminal law.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Regular weekly interview with Eduard Shevardnadze by </F> correspondent Nato Oniani; place not given -- live]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Batono [polite form of address]  Eduard, last week you visited France where you signed two most  important documents -- a treaty on mutual understanding,  friendship, and cooperation between the two countries and the  Charter of Paris for a New Europe. How would you assess the  results of this visit in general?    And another question. When we talk about relations between  Georgia and Iran, Georgia and Turkey, or Georgia and Russia it  is clear that this is about regional problems and regional  interests. However, what political interests can Georgia and  France have in common?    [Shevardnadze] Those who had the opportunity must have heard  some of the assessments I made on the plane and at a news  conference in Paris. I can state again now that the visit was  very important. As you know, this was the first official state  government visit. And the main result, as you said, was the  signing of those two documents, which laid the foundation of  law-based relations between Georgia and France. Without this  foundation, there can be no extensive economic, cultural,  scientific, or other kind of cooperation, which is something our  society is so interested in.    You know well from our history that in their quest for  independence guarantees, our ancestors would often turn to  France. I cannot say that the situation is the same today but,  probably, one of the most important challenges for all countries  on our continent is the art of building good relations with a  country such as France as well as other countries.    I think the fact that France is a permanent member of the  Security Council is very important. The settlement and  resolution of such complex issues as the conflict in Abkhazia as  well as other conflicts in the entire [?Caucasus] region and the  planet depend on France's position. It was very important for  us to see for ourselves how they understand us in France and  whether or not we should count on France's support in this  regard. I must say that there cannot be two opinions that  France understands Georgia's problems of territorial integrity  and state unity as well as we do. They take our problems close  to heart and understand them very well.    Now, if we look at this in the context of other countries,  why, after all, do Georgia and France have common interests? I  would give a very general answer. This is because they are  equally interested -- perhaps, we are interested even more -- in  the building of a new Europe. [passage omitted]    [Oniani] The treaty you signed in Paris is not an ordinary  treaty.    [Shevardnadze] You noticed that and told me on the plane  [from Paris to Tbilisi] that this treaty was slightly different  from some other treaties. That is right, since it reflects the  Paris Charter, which we have just joined. As I have said  before, it was the second time I signed it, but now in a  different capacity [reference to the signing of the Paris  Charter by Shevardnadze as Soviet Foreign Minister]. This time  I did it in Georgian, which is also important.    Apart from that, there are direct interests, such as  economic  relations with France. Forget everything else, we now subsist  on EC credits. Once we received 70 million ECUs, then 40  million was allocated. There is now hope for another 10-15  million. We can have some hope for the future. We should not  forget that EC credits do not fall from the sky. They are the  resources of these European states. The FRG's share in this is  60-65 percent. I again want to remember with gratitude  Chancellor Kohl's special appeal to the EC leadership to  allocate credit to Georgia, which will get us through some more  time. We should also not forget that France's share in this  exceeds 20 percent. When I told Mr. Mitterrand that we are in  economic hardship, he reminded me that France has done what it  could by contributing its share and supporting the Georgian  appeal. [passage omitted]    I think it was a timely visit and a useful visit. Perhaps it  came a little too late. However, neither the French nor  ourselves are to blame for that. There were simply some  objective reasons.    [Oniani] Thank you. Batono Eduard, you have said that your  position toward the ruble zone will become clear after your  visits. There have already been two visits. There were visits  to France and Turkey. In France, you met with representatives  of financial circles. You met with Economics Minister  Alphandery and with Jean-Claude Paye, secretary-general of the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Has your  position toward the ruble zone become clear?    [Shevardnadze] No, when I said: After the visits, I did not  have only the visit to France in mind. First of all, I had in  mind Boris Yeltsin's visit to Georgia and meetings with him and  his colleagues. A lot will be decided here. However, this is  not all either.    I am planning a visit to the United States, to Washington,  which will probably take place in the next few weeks [dekada].  There will be contacts with the administration, which, of  course, will be very important. However, my meetings with the  Monetary Fund and the Reconstruction Bank will also be very  important. If we receive some kind of a guarantee regarding the  creation of a stabilization fund, we will then be able to  struggle with more determination for our national currency, for  the strengthening of the national currency, and so on. If such  guarantees are not received, then we should look for another way.    Therefore, all options are gradually becoming clear in the  course of these visits. I have options but I think it is too  early to speak about them.    I do not know whether or not we will return to this topic  but  I would like to point out in a couple of words the importance of  our meetings with regard to the conferment on Georgia of the  status of a developing country. I do not know if you have a  question on this. I would say that it was our first contact  with this institute [not specified], whose headquarters is in  France. The main result is that we agreed that a large group of  representatives of this organization will visit Georgia. We  also agreed on the approximate time of the visit. [passage  omitted]    I would like to remember with special gratitude my meeting  with UNESCO Secretary-general Federico Mayor. [passage omitted]    [Oniani] You had a busy schedule in Paris. There were 15  official meetings in the course of two days as well as beautiful  ceremonies [words indistinct]. On the second day of the visit  you met with Swiss Ambassador Brunner. At the end of the second  day UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali arrived.    We remember that prior to your departure for France you had  a  rather difficult debate in parliament in connection with  Abkhazian issues. Did your position toward Abkhazia change  after the meetings with Mr. Ghali and Mr. Brunner? Or perhaps  you became even more convinced that your position was right.    [Shevardnadze] These were extremely important meetings. They  were followed by my request to the minister of foreign affairs,  Mr. Chikvaidze, and a similar request made today to Georgian  negotiator Sandro Kavsadze, and Zurab Erkvania, chairman of the  Abkhaz Council of Ministers, to travel to Moscow. My conclusion  is that some of our approaches are to be sorted out with Russia.  Russia has its own version of a UN Security Council draft  resolution. However, judging by our talk with the secretary  general, there is a lot of work to be done on this draft. We  must by all means prepare our own draft. We worked late into  the night yesterday and it has already been prepared.    For me, the purpose of this meeting was to find out how the  UN secretary-general perceived the peace process and its stages.  The main element in this process is the adoption of a new  Security Council resolution. It is important how specific it  will be and how it will reflect the interests of Georgia as a  whole, including, of course, the interests of Abkhazia.    I must say that many of my colleagues look in a simplified  way at the adoption of resolutions. Meanwhile, it is a most  complicated process. The secretary general told me that we  should not look at this as if Georgia was guaranteed the passage  of a resolution which would bring peace in a very short time.  It will be very difficult. There are various drafts. Three or  four possible drafts were listed, each of which could be  adopted. However, major and serious work is necessary for that.  Not only with the secretary general. He gave me a guarantee  that he would struggle for it to be a perfect resolution which  will determine the future of peace in Abkhazia. At the same  time, major work must be carried out with permanent members of  the Security Council. A plan of how to carry out this most  difficult activity was also outlined.    Of course, I became convinced again that discussing with the  secretary general any other way of solving the Abkhaz conflict  but a peaceful one would be simply absurd. And I think that  rejecting a peaceful way today would rejecting one's own self.  It is impermissible even to talk about it. Even talking about  it must be ruled out. If any of the above-mentioned drafts is  adopted, it will mean that there is a realistic way of  settlement.    I must take issue with some. Those who talk most of a  military solution think the least about it. Those who think  that such a solution is possible talk the least about this  option. That is how it is in general.    I think that behind many such statements -- I do not mean  people who are embittered, those who were persecuted and  tortured, perhaps this is how they feel -- are partisan and  selfish interests, which overshadow a realistic attitude toward  conflict settlement in Abkhazia.    I attach extremely great importance to this meeting. It was  a warm and constructive meeting.    [Oniani] You have just mentioned in your answer that after  the talks with Butrus-Ghali and Ambassador Brunner it became  clear that we must agree our position with Russia. [Words  indistinct] financial circles in Paris suggested to us that our  relations with European countries would to a large degree depend  on how good our relations with Russia are, whether we like it or  not. You had talks with many politicians, including the  president. Does Europe perceive and see the threat which exists  in Russia? I mean the personnel changes, the increased activity  of profascist forces, for example, in relation to the French  president. Mr. Zhirinovskiy spoke in terrible terms about  Francois Mitterrand. How well do they perceive the profascist  threat in Russia?    [Shevardnadze] I think that behind some politicians'  statements that Georgia should build normal and good relations  with Russia, is a great desire to see stability in Georgia. The  French believe that normal relations with Russia, as we say, new  relations, are some kind of a guarantee of stability. And not  only the French think so. In general, Western business circles  believe that good relations among the countries of the former  Soviet Union -- and I am talking about Russia's new role in this  connection; I will return to this subject some other time -- are  some kind of a guarantee of stability. Business does not work  without stability and it is natural that financial circles are  interested in stability. This is the main interest of  businessmen.    Second, as far as the coming to the fore of profascism is  concerned, which you have just mentioned, my impression is that  France as well as other countries in Europe and the world are no  less concerned about this than we are. During our meetings in  France we again expressed the wish that the democratic way of  development should be supported in any possible way [words  indistinct]. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Raphel Ruffle"] </F>   [Text] While the rather coy statements of Ms Robin Raphel,  U.S. Assistant Secretary of State, are pleasing to hear, one  need not be surprised if the tenor of her statements is found to  be boundary specific. Ms Raphel is expected to proceed to  Pakistan immediately after her India trip. It will be very  surprising if Ms Raphel does not once again change track and  start harping on her favourite theme of human rights abuses in  Kashmir and question the territorial integrity of India. Should  this happen, it would be most unfortunate. The inability of the  world's two largest democracies to see eye to eye has created a  somewhat anomalous situation. In the economic sphere, India's  relations with the United States seem to be on a perfectly even  keel. The commerce department had designated India as one of the  ten major emerging markets in the world to receive special  attention as the United States formulates its worldwide export  strategy. The United States continues to be the largest market  for India's exports, accounting for 20 percent of what we sell  abroad. The United States is also the largest foreign investor  in India with investments in 1993 representing as much as 42  percent of the over $2 billion approved by the Government of  India. Apart from these interesting facts, the newly formed  India Interest Group, reflecting the views of 20 major American  corporations which include such well-known names as General  Electric, American Express, AT&amp;T, IBM, Coca Cola and  Citibank,  is doing a wonderful job in raising the visibility of U.S.-India  bilateral relations with policy and decision-makers in  Washington. As far as the liberalisation policy is concerned,  the U.S. support seems well defined.    But it is the inability of the two countries to strike  rapport in political matters that has been a cause for concern.  Strategic alliances here seem thicker than economic  opportunities. The inability of the foreign-policy-makers in  Washington to understand the psyche of Indian and Pakistani  suspicions of each other's intentions which are deeply rooted  and thus not easily dissipated, and their trigger-happy  secretaries talking about human rights abuses without  understanding the ground realities have led to their shooting  off their mouths, souring not just bilateral relations between  India and Pakistan, but also among India, Pakistan and the  United States. Two important reasons as to why India and  Pakistan are not able to thrash out differences are: Pakistan's  inability to overcome the fact that it lost Bangladesh because  of India and so retribution via Kashmir; second, the United  States' inability to put the sub-continent's priorities over its  own strategic policies, leading to ambiguous mouthings,  convenient to boosting its own image and interests.  Unfortunately, both India and Pakistan have been playing into  the hands of the United States by each trying to win over the  super power. If the same will and initiative was shown in  resolving differences between the two countries, so much more  would have been achieved and the Raphels of the world would not  have been ruffling our feathers. It is difficult to accept Ms  Raphel's statement that the United States is not siding with  Pakistan over the Kashmir issue and that the Clinton  administration has no quarrel with the territorial integrity of  India. If that be the case, Ms Raphel owes India an apology for  all her utterances. Indian policy-makers have, for once, taken  the offensive in saying that they do not want to have talks on  Kashmir. That is how it has got to be. They should also be  prepared to hear in a short while, Ms Raphel switching to her  familiar role of India bashing, the moment she leaves our  shores. The firm stand taken by the External Affairs Ministry  and the Home Ministry should send definite signals to  Washington about their misplaced South Asia policy. Also, India  is fully within its rights not to discuss what is an internal  matter with a third country. So, lay off Raphel. If, as she  says, the Clinton administration really wants a strong and  productive relationship with India, the most important thing to  do would be for her to save her energies and remain silent. The  less you talk, the fewer mistakes you commit. That is the moral.</p>

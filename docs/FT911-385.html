			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Outdoors: Violets, lovely violets - An almost-forgotten flower variety SOME YEARS ago a friend gave me a violet which he called Wellsiana and told me he regarded it as the best variety he knew for growing in the garden. At first I thought the name must be wrong because this was clearly not a wild species but a garden plant, a selection of the sweet violet, Viola odorata, and it is unusual - indeed against present rules of plant nomenclature - to use names in this botanical style for garden varieties. However, it did not take me long to establish that Wellsiana was a valid name for it is used by Roy E. Coombs in his authoritative book Violets published by Croom Helm in 1981. It was given this name by its raiser, Mr Wells of Fern Hill, Windsor, and in 1884 he was awarded a first class certificate for it by the Royal Horticultural Society, the highest award it has to give to a garden plant and one sparingly used. Clearly Wellsiana must have been special. It was predicted then that it would become the most widely cultivated of all violets grown from cut flowers. Yet despite this triumphant start Wellsiana now seems to have almost faded away, in fact I cannot recollect ever having heard of it until my friend showed it to me. So what went wrong? Was it not as good as at first appeared or did it develop some fatal fault along the way and is my friend wrong in still rating it so highly? It is even possible that the plant he has acquired under this name is not the original Wellsiana. Mistakes when propagating free-growing plants can occur and unless there are other correctly named stocks around for comparison, memory can fade and it can become impossible to recollect the subtle differences that distinguish one garden variety from another. This is one reason for establishing national collections of ornamental plant varieties and for taking urgent steps to see that the plant names in these collections are checked while there are still people living able to recollect them clearly. All I can say with certainty is that the plant I am growing as Wellsiana is a good one. It was particularly attractive this spring, filling the air with its perfume and covering the ground rapidly and densely with healthy green leaves so making a fine carpet to smother weed seedlings. The flowers are fairly large, their colour deep violet blue, their scent strong and sweet and widely spread. The plant is sturdy and easy to propagate simply by pulling it apart at almost any time of the year. In fact it is weather more than season than matters most as it is best divided when conditions are moist and likely to remain so for a few weeks. However, that is a difficulty that can be overcome by watering and shading. This violet has never been attacked by red-spider mites in my garden, often the most troublesome pest of these plants, living on the undersides of the leaves in vast numbers and sucking the sap from them so that they turn from green to dull bronzy yellow. However, that may be due partly to the moistness of my soil and air for these mites thrive where it is hot and dry and frequent syringing with plain water is often the most effective, and certainly the cheapest, way of keeping them away. However, I suspect that the vigour with which that Wellsiana grows would give it considerable resistance. So what did go wrong? I do not know for certain, but just about the time that Mr Wells was raising his Wellsiana the great 19th century French violet breeder Armand Millet of Bourg-la-Reine near Paris, was breaking what had until that time been the top limits of violet flower size and flower stem length. At that period violets were in great demand as cut flowers and many thousands of small commercial growers were employed in supplying them to the flower markets. Not only are large, long-stemmed violets more effective when cut but it is easier and quicker to pick and bunch them. So it is natural that varieties such as Princesse de Galles - always known in Britain as Princess of Wales - which has larger flowers and longer flower stems than those of The Tsar, captured this market before the newly arrived Wellsiana had a chance to establish itself even in the private side. What does alarm me is that it seems to have become so much forgotten that I cannot find it listed in The Plant Finder, the latest edition of which has just come to hand. It is enlarged to include 50,000 garden varieties and is available through any bookshop, for Pounds 9.99, published by Headmain.</p>

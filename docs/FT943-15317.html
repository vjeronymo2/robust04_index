			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Sport: South Africans happy to emphasise freshness - Cricket Twenty-nine years after they made their last tour of England, the South Africans are back on English soil - and are happy not to rush straight into a Test match. Weather permitting, they will have played five county games before the first Test, on July 21, at Lord's. When I watched them play and lose the first of these, a shortened match against Kent at Canterbury, I could see why their manager, Mike Procter, wanted a long stint of 'real, tactical cricket' before a Test. 'It's better and easier like that. County cricket gives us a chance to practise, to get everyone used to English conditions, to choose our players.' At Canterbury the South Africans looked as if they needed practice, although their two medium-pace bowlers, Craig Matthews and Hansie Cronje, looked tailor-made for the English game. Matthews bowled off a straight run-up close to the stumps and got some late movement, mostly into, but also a bit away from, the batsman. In the overcast Kentish warmth he looked threatening, although he did not claim a victim. In the next game, against Sussex, he was upstaged by off-spinner Pat Symcox, taking five county wickets for 29 on the last day. Procter was not excited by his country's spin, which he rated as a minor weapon. I have only seen Tim Shaw, not Symcox, and when I saw him he was slow without much guile. It will be interesting to see how the visiting spinners develop next to their more acclaimed faster companions on this tour, especially on unpredictable wickets like the one at Canterbury, which sent occasional balls zipping through low and fast, surprising batsmen and wicket-keepers. The two fastest South African bowlers, Allan Donald and Fanie de Villiers, have both played in England before, Donald for Warwickshire and de Villiers first for Kent in 1990, unsuccessfully, then in the Devon League. They are familiar with English conditions. Against Kent, Donald bowled fast and, at times, loose. Against Hampshire, he bowled well enough to win the man of the match award, taking 5 for 58 in the first innings. The South Africans like to emphasise their freshness and freedom from the strain of international cricket. This freshness does not mean youth. One of the striking differences between this summer's two visiting teams is the age of their new players. Matthew Hart and Adam Parore, two of New Zealand's 'young guns', are 22 and 23 respectively. South African Daryll Cullinan, fresh rather than a young gun, is 27. Procter had sensible answers ready for suggestions that his country had to rely on older players because its younger ones were so inexperienced. 'Age by itself isn't an issue. It is important to educate players into the game. We need a balance between experience and youth, not one or the other,' he says. His is a generous definition of youth, in modern cricketing terms. He named Cullinan as a young batsman he would like to see doing well on this tour. At Canterbury, Cullinan made a time-honoured start to his late English blossoming when he was caught for nought off the bowling of Dean Headley, one of Kent's lively agents of the fast medium. In that match nearly all the South African batting had an impulsive element and it relied on wicket-keeper David Richardson to lead it from 64 for 6 to 221 for 7, nearly saving the game. After an orgy of batting practice at Hove - 613 for 8 declared - the South Africans scored in robust style at Southampton until captain Kepler Wessels was out for 31, and the free-hitting Jonty Rhodes went for 77. A score of 227 for 6 slumped to 264 for 9 declared. Wessels is almost too important a presence. He played Tests before South African cricket was sentenced to solitary confinement and he is its embodiment of international experience. He is said to be a personal and spiritual mentor of Cronje, the young batsman who failed at Canterbury but scored 94 at Hove. Cronje finds Wessels' strong leadership invaluable, but it can be a weighty burden to carry and there is a danger of team collapse if the leader fails. Glamorgan are sometimes liable to depend too heavily on Hugh Morris, their captain, and South Africa must be careful that Wessels encourages, rather than overwhelms, the players in his charge. As one who remembers some of his dogged innings in the past, I find it hard to think of him as what the official tour programme calls 'inspirational' and was relieved to hear Procter describe his batting as 'stolid'. Procter then pointed out how important it was for every team to have one stolid occupier of the crease. A view confirmed by cricket poets: 'As the run grafters stay in nice and slow, nice and slow, Oh, my Wessels and my Boycott long ago' (Thompson/McLean). Oddly enough, I found myself wondering at Canterbury whether South Africa's famous fielding might also be, at times, a heavy inheritance. Rhodes took a breath-taking catch in the covers, leaping fast and high, to remove Neil Taylor. He obviously revels in the comparisons made with Colin Bland, the superb 1960s South African fielder. Most of the South African fielding was fast, with excellent throwing, but it had lapses, like those of a side tired of its subject. I saw several failures to stop and to pick up. I am all for dynamic fielding, but not if it comes at the cost of the Wesselian virtues of steadiness and concentration. Those have never been South African specialities. South African cricketing strength has usually been extreme and, if broken, it can fall into extreme weakness. One among many examples is Graeme Pollock in the 1960s, a devastating batsman but a vulnerable starter. As the man next to me in the lunch queue at Canterbury put it: 'I like South Africa because they have always been a bit potty. They don't play their cricket by halves. I hope they'll be good to watch this summer and all-or-nothing to beat. Good luck, Atherton]'</p>

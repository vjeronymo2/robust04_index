			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Risky roads out of recession: UK insurers are reeling from storms and economic slowdown The IRA has joined the weather, recession and crime as the bugbears of British insurers. After last month's bombings in London, UK insurers are bracing for another round of claims likely to approach Pounds 1bn. 'Partitions and suspended ceilings had collapsed, lights were blown,' said Mr Nicholas Balcombe, a loss assessor, after surveying the damage caused to buildings in the City by shock waves from the bomb which exploded outside the Baltic Exchange on April 10. 'I've never seen damage like that before in England,' added Mr Balcombe, whose company spent much of last year examining the aftermath of war in Kuwait. His comments could apply equally to the state of the UK insurance industry. The IRA bombs have underlined the harsh fact that UK insurers  - criticised for their mistakes overseas - are now being humbled in the market they know best: the UK. Although they are putting a brave face on recent losses, their balance sheets have been badly hit by their worst trading results. Financial weakness is also inhibiting the insurers' capacity to take advantage of the European single market and exposing them to potential foreign predators. Last year the pre-tax losses of the UK's five leading composites - companies which insure a mixture of general and life business - totalled more than Pounds 1.2bn, double the loss reported for 1990. UK underwriting losses for the 10 leading general insurers - which include the composites - were Pounds 3.4bn, up from Pounds 2.2bn in 1990. Sun Alliance, the biggest of the composites, was the worst-hit. Last year, its UK underwriting losses amounted to Pounds 713m, contributing to pre-tax losses of Pounds 466m. What has gone wrong? First, insurers are suffering the effects of a round of fierce price competition which is still continuing in some sectors of the market. Competition from continental Europe has provided an important stimulus. Companies from Germany, France, Switzerland, the Netherlands and elsewhere have stepped up their UK activities to take advantage of the single European market next year. French companies in particular have competed fiercely by cutting rates to win a share of the lucrative, high-margin insurance bought by business rather than by individuals. In response, UK companies in the late 1980s pushed for growth, making market share the main priority. As a result, some risks were rated at unrealistically low premiums, and underwriting losses increased. 'Companies allowed their underwriting standards to slip,' says Mr Robin Mitre of Credit Suisse First Boston, the securities house. Second, the industry has been hit by a sharp increase in weather and recession-related claims. Mr Mitre says: 'Go back two years and no one would have dreamed it would have been so bad.' Mr Paul Hodges, of James Capel, another securities house, says the scale of the insurers' difficulties was 'wholly unpredictable. The companies have been utterly luckless. Everything that could go wrong has.' The weather: Storms and subsidence caused damage of more than Pounds 3bn between 1990 and 1991. International reinsurers now judge the UK to be as risky as the hurricane-prone Caribbean. Sun Alliance, which insures one in four householders, paid out some Pounds 117m in subsidence claims in 1991, compared 1980s. Mr Scott Nelson, Sun Alliance's general manager, expects claims to stay at the higher level through the 1990s. The recession: A combination of rising interest rates, higher unemployment and falling house prices has proved a lethal cocktail for insurers specialising in domestic mortgage indemnity business, in which insurers cover mortgage lenders against losses they might make on the sale of repossessed properties. Repossessions have climbed from 15,810 in 1989 to more than 75,000 in 1991. Domestic mortgage indemnity claims, and provisions against future claims, are expected to total nearly Pounds 2bn for 1991 and 1992. Sun Alliance, Royal Insurance, Eagle Star and Legal and General, which underwrite about 70 per cent of all mortgage indemnity contracts, are expected to be most affected. The recession is also linked to an increase in claims related to arson and theft. During 1991, claims for thefts payments came to Pounds 907.3m, a 52 per cent increase on 1990, according to the Association of British Insurers, a trade group. 'Theft losses have now reached epidemic proportions,' commented the securities house S G Warburg in a recent note for clients. Arson accounted for nearly half the Pounds 1.02bn in fire claims reported last year. Legal awards: Liability claims have increased. Insurers of surveyors, for example, face record claims from homeowners who have lost money as a result of faulty valuations. The UK's two legal expenses insurers - which pay legal costs - made big losses in 1991. More generally, the British are picking up the American habit of turning to the law for redress following, for example, injuries at work, the failure of companies because of bad advice and the purchase of defective products by consumers. Insurers are tackling this array of problems in several ways. Rate increases have been imposed on most personal insurance - some motorists are paying up to 50 per cent more for policies than two years ago. In home insurance, the industry has responded to subsidence by introducing a system of zoning, in which householders living in subsidence-prone areas, such as the south-east, pay rates twice as high as counterparts elsewhere. Insurers are also adopting cost-cutting measures. Staff numbers, which grew rapidly in the 1980s, have been slashed by about 10 per cent as composites trim the numbers of clerical staff and middle managers. Branches have also been closed to cut costs, which for the top 10 groups rose from 29.9 per cent of premiums in 1986 to 33.9 per cent in 1990. These measures alone may be enough to restore profitability in the short term but some critics question whether they are sufficient to bring long-term strength. Mr John Ginarlis, of PA Consulting, the management consultancy group, says: 'It is not just a question of putting the rates up all the time. Ways of doing business have to change.' Mr Ginarlis and others suggest insurers must win more control over their distribution channels to reduce costs and establish closer relationships with customers. This could involve moves to bypass high street brokers, the industry's traditional retail outlet for motor business. It may also mean that insurers will renegotiate deals with building societies which sell most homeowners' policies in return for commission payments of more than 30 per cent. Insurers should examine methods of selling direct to the public either by exclusive agents, as is common in mainland Europe, by direct mail or by telephone, says Mr Ginarlis. Analysts believe direct sales could account for as much as 50 per cent of the market within five years, a share already reached in the US and Australia. For instance, Direct Line, a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland, is a pioneer of direct telephone sales of motor insurance in the UK. In 1990 it made profits of more than Pounds 10m, reflecting its good underwriting results. Motor and household insurers also need to take action to control the cost of repair work, which frequently inflates claims. Domestic &amp; General, a small family-owned company which insures domestic appliances such as fridges and central heating systems against breakdown, administers the cost of repairs directly. It has consistently recorded profits in a sector in which the composites lost money in the early 1980s. Companies such as D &amp; G are in tune with consumers' growing concern to obtain quality of service, even if this is more expensive, Mr Ginarlis believes. He argues that insurers must establish long-term relationships with customers and move from individual products to the provision of what he calls 'an all-embracing customer protection service'. While UK insurers are thus responding positively to criticism, their room for manoeuvre is limited. Recent losses have eaten into their capital base, making them vulnerable to foreign predators and undermining their ability to expand abroad. Since 1990, asset values have plummeted. The decline in overall stock market values in 1990 knocked between 30 and 40 per cent of the value of the composite companies' shareholders' funds, eroding balance sheet strength. For two years, companies have met losses and financed dividend payments from reserves, further eroding their capital base. Sun Alliance, for example, saw its solvency ratio (the yardstick which measures net assets as a percentage of non-life premium income) fall from 119 per cent at the end of 1989 to 63 per cent at the end of 1991. Other companies have been hit harder; Royal Insurance's solvency ratio falling to 34 per cent at the end of last year, well over twice the legal minimum but just four points above a level considered to be adequate by the industry's regulators. This decline has been accompanied by a sharp fall in insurers' share prices. The market capitalisation of Royal, the worst-hit company, has sunk by two-thirds in two years to less than Pounds 1bn. The strongest, Sun Alliance, has seen its capitalisation dwindle to about Pounds 2.2bn, less than a quarter of the capitalisation of Allianz, Germany's and Europe's biggest insurer. Mr Claude Bebear, the chairman of AXA, the second-largest French insurance company, last week reiterated his interest in acquiring a UK composite, whose prices he believes are now attractive. Other companies, such as Zurich of Switzerland, and UAP and AGF of France, will also be watching UK developments though they are not yet prepared to launch hostile bids. There are signs, however, that UK composites may be viewing the intentions of foreign rivals more sympathetically. Last year, Royal agreed to set up a joint venture with two other European insurers - Fondiaria of Italy and AMB of Germany. Although limited in scope at present, the move appears designed to protect each company's independence. In the long term, other UK insurers may be tempted to explore similar options with European partners. Despite recent improvements, their current trading conditions may leave them with few alternatives. If they fail to ally themselves with stronger partners, names such as Guardian Royal Exchange may become extinct.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Top 10 general                Pre-tax     UK underwriting insurers                      losses          losses                               1991        1991        1990                               M pounds    M pounds    M pounds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sun Alliance*                 466         713         461 GRE*                          210         332         250 General Accident*             172         342         231 Royal*                        373         545         313 Commercial Union*              69         227         145 Eagle Star*                   394         637         405 Norwich Union                 268         277         168 Prudential                     88         157         170 Cornhill*                      40          55*          6** Co-operative                   83         159          86  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Includes life profits **Includes investment income  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

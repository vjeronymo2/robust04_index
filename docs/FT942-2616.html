			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Talks on Severn crossing sackings Talks between management and unions are due to take place today in an effort to resolve a dispute that has halted work on the Pounds 300m second Severn crossing between England and Wales. More than 700 construction workers, who are seeking higher bonus payments, were dismissed on Thursday when they took part in a 24-hour strike after a ballot. Laing-GTM, the UK/French main contractor, said yesterday that the men had been in breach of contract, but would be invited to reapply for their jobs on Monday under the existing terms and conditions. Today's meeting will be held with Ucatt, the construction union, and the TGWU and GMB general unions. Mr Graham Read, of Laing-GTM, said: 'We've no wish to shut down dialogue with union officials.' A picket line was mounted yesterday outside the site of the privately financed bridge, which is due to open in spring 1996. The unions are complaining of low basic pay for work which they say is often skilled, arduous and dangerous. GTM-Laing said existing bonuses were at least compatible with those in other parts of the industry, and that workers had accepted terms and conditions jointly agreed by management and unions on the project.</p>

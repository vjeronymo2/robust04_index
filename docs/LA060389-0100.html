			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Trump Files Suit Over Name: Billionaire Donald J. Trump sued in federal court  to ensure that when you hear the words "Trump Shuttle," you think airline --  not moving company. Trump, who bought strikebound Eastern Airlines' shuttle  service and plans to relaunch it as the "Trump Shuttle," won a court order  temporarily barring a Washington-based company from using the same name. U.S.  District Judge Shirley Wohl Kram issued a temporary restraining order barring  International Trading &amp; Finance Corp. and its owner, Michael Fracassi, from  using the disputed name until at least later this month, when another hearing  is scheduled in Manhattan. Trump agreed to purchase Eastern's Washington to New  York to Boston air shuttle in October, 1988, and incorporated under the name  Trump Shuttle Inc. a month later in New York. Meanwhile, ITFC registered the  Trump Shuttle mark in New York in April and filed for rights to the name with  the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.  </P></p>

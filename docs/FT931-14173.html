			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Thais seek new foreign investors THAILAND, facing a sharp fall in inward foreign investment, yesterday announced plans to attract new investors and ease congestion in Bangkok by refining tax incentives and putting more emphasis on development in the provinces. Approaches by foreign investors to the Board of Investment (BoI) fell for the third year in a row in 1992, with the value of foreign capital registered in new applications dropping to Bt12bn (Pounds 304m) from nearly Bt25bn in 1991. The total value of proposed investments in domestic and foreign applications fell by a quarter to Bt213bn. Although actual investment in 1992 remained high - reflecting earlier applications - Thai officials are anxious to ensure a steady inflow of foreign money to finance the next stage of the country's industrial development. BoI officials are proposing a number of changes to Thailand's incentive scheme for investors, including benefits for companies which move factories away from Bangkok and increased incentives for investments in the provinces furthest from the capital. The plan, according to Mr Staporn, is to put the emphasis on location rather than export promotion when it comes to granting BoI privileges to potential investors. The BoI board chaired by Mr Chuan Leekpai, the prime minister, will consider the proposals later this month.</p>

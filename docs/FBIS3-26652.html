			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Chu Wei-ching (2612 0251 4552) from Beijing: </F> "Due to Pressure From Central Television Station Through the  State Council, the Sports Channel of Beijing Television Station  Suspends Broadcasting as of Today"]    [Text] The sports channel of Beijing Cable Television,  which mainly broadcast overseas sports events, will suspend  broadcasting as of today according to an order issued by the  State Council. On the surface, this was because the channel  violated the satellite television transmission management rules.  In fact, this was because the sports programs broadcast by the  Central Television Station met with a challenge.    The sports channel of Beijing Cable Television was  originally  designed to relay the sports events broadcast by the United  States' ESPN, and the channel broadcast programs from noon to  0300 next morning every day. Although the Central Television  Station has also broadcast overseas sports events for a long  time, it mainly broadcasts recorded and edited programs, so its  effects were not as attractive as the live broadcasting via  satellite by the cable television channel. The sports-loving  audience was attracted to the cable television channel, and this  threatened the programs broadcast by the Central Television  Station. So it exerted pressure on Beijing Television through  the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television of the State  Council. It is learned that because the Central Television  Station is directly subordinate to the Ministry of Radio, Film,  and Television of the State Council, while Beijing Television is  subordinate to the Beijing Municipal Government, the lower-level  local institution cannot match the power of the upper-level  central institution. In such circumstances, the sports channel  of Beijing Television which relays live broadcasts of overseas  sports events was suspended on the grounds that the relay was  not approved and thus violated the satellite television programs  management rules.    Last August, Chinese mainland authorities promulgated the  rules on managing satellite transmitted television programs,  which prohibit people and institutions from installing satellite  television antennas to receive foreign satellite programs  without the approval of the authorities concerned. Those who  violate this rule may be fined 5,000 yuan. A few days before  the suspension of Beijing Cable Television's sports channel, the  screen continuously printed the State Council's order on  suspending the broadcasting of the channel. Because the  suspension was an abrupt action, the cable television station  did not give any explanation.</p>

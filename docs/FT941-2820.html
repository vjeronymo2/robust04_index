			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Japanese groups form multi-media venture Four Japanese companies have formed a multi-media venture that could prove a strong force in advanced communications in Japan. Tokyo Power Electric, Mitsubishi and Mitsui, the trading companies, and Tokyu, a railway company, are to work together on a project to use cable TV networks for telephone services. The project will test the possibility of linking an optical fibre cable network with a cable TV network to offer multi-media services. The TV link is operated by Tokyu Cable, part of the Tokyu group. The project will initially look at technical and marketing problems, but will eventually study bringing together broadcasting, telephonic and interactive video services. Tokyo Electric Power, Mitsubishi and Mitsui also have stakes in a cable network. The alliance is widely seen as creating a foundation for a telecommunications network which could compete effectively with the industry leader, NTT. The move comes amid de-regulation of Japan's telecommunications and cable TV industries. The ministry of posts and telecommunications recently said it would allow cable TV companies to offer telephone services on their lines. The project also highlights growing expectations in Japan that the multi-media business will offer huge prospects for growth. Until recently, multi-media and the information super-highway in Japan were considered over-regulated. However, the Japanese authorities have recognised their economic potential and taken cautious steps to ensure the country does not fall too far behind the US. Earlier this week, a government panel forecast that multi-media business would be a Y70,000bn (Dollars 662bn) industry in the near future.</p>

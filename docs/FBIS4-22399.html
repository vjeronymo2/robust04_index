			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by I.M. under the rubric "Parliament": "`Not So </F> Hot' Fact and `Pushbutton Hooligans'"]    [Text] With a brisk step, the prime minister almost  boyishly ran up to the rostrum and, once there, as if  restraining his drive, with deliberate calmness, clearly  enunciating every figure, began to explain to the audience why  the government chose the 30-percent tax on profit over the  20-percent proposed by the deputies. He described in detail the  mechanics of the so-called zero-sum situation, into which we may  slide otherwise. He gave examples from the practice of other  states, including civilized ones. I will not bore the reader  with details, because I saw that the deputies, too--many either  found it unnecessary to get into the fine print or were  incapable of doing so, or perhaps already had made up their  mind. In any case, they did not heed the prime minister's words  and did not accommodate the president's requests enunciated in  his "comments" to the draft laws under discussion: "On Tax on  Land" and "On Tax on Profit." The situation in the "kitchen" did  not require great analytical abilities to understand the  underlying motive that guided both parties. As usual: The  government protects the interests of the state, and the  deputies--the interests of the people. In this particular  case--the business segment. And why not--strangling business  with such a tax--30 percent--means strangling it to death. The  "threat" that the danger lies in something else--that under the  20-percent tax a jump in inflation is inevitable, that every  taxpayer thinks that the tax is too high, and that we should be  guided by the interests of the entire state and not just one  population stratum--did not bring the desired effect. The  speaker--who, by the way, spoke before the prime minister and  seemed to have barely restrained himself from spoonfeeding his  "flock" regarding what is what and what is not in the business  at hand--namely, in the "president's amendment": nothing is  outside the law; it is in the interests of each and every  person; on Tuesday evening, after a meeting, members of the  cabinet and the presidium, worn out and tired, still found  enough willpower to stay up and work, arriving at the nonsense  [as published] of the "30 percent" necessity; and so on, and so  on--did not produce any effect either. As well as the deputy's  attempt to explain to the "listeners" that the point is not the  figures but the substance. Neither did the government correction  help: that it is not simply the "numbers"--it is precisely the  substance, because the question under discussion does not stand  alone but is part of the general development program. In short,  despite the concentrated firepower, "the enemy was stopped" and  "we won." Please forgive the seeming frivolity of this phrase. I  permitted it because during a smoking break a high-ranking  government official confessed to me with the smile of one who  had made a discovery: "You see, the Supreme Soviet assumes  everything that comes out of the cabinet to be evil. If they  manage to `nix' a proposal, they celebrate victory. For them,  the important part is to beat us. They just cannot comprehend  that besides the notorious `counterbalance,' we should all be  guided by common interests." During the next smoking break, with  the smile of one who had made a startling discovery, a  commission head confessed to me that the best the government can  do is liquidate itself. That everything it proposes "at best  does not result in the direct and final demise of the state.  That even seemingly sensible proposals are not thought through  in detail, are not well argumented, are not accompanied by a  mechanism for implementation, which leads to even greater chaos."    On our way home, one deputy of my acquaintance comforted me  philosophically: "Everything is normal. Do you really think that  in civilized countries relations are better between parliament  and government?" I really do not know, never having had a chance  to observe closely, but... But it is still different over there:  There is an adopted constitution, working laws; there is no  murderous time pressure, which allows them, while heatedly  debating each amendment, to calmly relish it before permitting  it to be put to use; the procedure for budget and program  approval is fine-tuned; and anyway, how can it be that the  budget is approved and the program is not?!    In short, the impression I was left with after these three  days is depressing. As if all the charge had been spent during  the battle for the budget and they are now performing, so to  say, a filler. Since it was announced in the promotion, it has  to be played. No more than that. Although taxation laws cannot  be considered insignificant no matter how inwardly relaxed one  may be. Perhaps the reason for this painful impression was the  expectation that--well, they must finally get to the most  important; we have reached the limit; so many laws are waiting  their turn, and they... I do not know, perhaps, another proverb  fits here: Do not judge and you will not be judged, and they,  the deputies, know better what and when, within what timeframe,  and why secondary--to the uninitiated eye--issues should be  brought into finer shape, and... The question of the minister of  light industry, which at least for us--reporters and  readers--could become a "burning" issue, was also left hanging  in midair. By the way, this situation is particularly  depressing. If the "suspect" official is indeed a villain, such  procrastination around the matter only gives him the opportunity  to continue his villainy with greater enthusiasm for whatever  time he has left. If the opposite, and he has simply been  slandered, most likely he will be paralyzed by the knowledge of  the stupidity of the whole thing. In any case, delay in  resolving this matter only aggravates the situation. In the end,  everything was completely jumbled. It suddenly turned out that  the quorum had been provided by apparently "dead souls." That  is, deputies push buttons for their colleagues who are absent.  Two "pushbutton hooligans" were even identified by name. They  took the floor. Started a lively argument with a pretense to  sarcasm. Everybody's spirits rose. The implacable time kept  ticking. Deputies suddenly jumped from their seats and rushed to  the exit, disregarding the chairman's attempt to call them to  order. Somebody said that this kind of behavior enables them to  avoid putting something to a vote, but...    I have no doubt that later some will argue heatedly that  behind all this are the games of the "top echelons," that the  destabilized situation of the last few minutes, and not only  that, was aimed at derailing, or rather, not putting to a vote  the most interesting issues, and so on, and so on. But, hell!  One would think that the rules of the game had been learned by  now--why go through the same hoops every time?!    Still, there was one cheerful point in all this--7 April was  made a holiday by law. Congratulations!</p>

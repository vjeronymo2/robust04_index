			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Nalgo delegates back plan for merger LEADERS of Nalgo, the local government union, said yesterday that delegates at a special conference had overwhelmingly backed plans for the creation through merger of Britain's largest union by the summer of next year. Motions to block the plans were withdrawn and the union's leadership said that the passing of amendments on the way the union collects subscriptions was unlikely to delay the merger significantly. The conference's decision to retain branch collection of subscriptions will irritate Nupe and Cohse, the other unions involved in the merger. Both collect subscriptions nationally and want the same system in the new union. However, yesterday's decision will allow branches to opt for central subscription. Nalgo believes this would enable it to forge a compromise with the two partners. Mr Alan Jinkinson, Nalgo general secretary, said he expected the merger plans to go to a vote of his 1.4m members by autumn. An amalgamation could then go ahead in July next year.</p>

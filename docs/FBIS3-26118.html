Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, Feb. 3 (CNA) -- Preparations are under way  for Taiwan to attend a ministerial-level meeting of the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Morocco April 15, an  economics official reported Thursday [3 February].    Tsai Lien-sheng, a section chief of the Board of Foreign  Trade under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, said that Taiwan  has been invited to attend the meeting, in which the 112 GATT  contracting parties will sign the agreement reached during the  Uruguay Round talks in mid-December.    The GATT meeting will also make a final decision on the  exact  time for the establishment of the World Trade Organization  (WTO), Tsai pointed out.    Under the Uruguay Round accord, all GATT signatories are set  to become members of the WTO, which will be given tougher  enforcement powers to supersede GATT.    GATT members have attached great importance to the Morocco  meeting, Tsai said, noting the European Union and the United  States will reportedly send 200-member delegations.    Economic Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang is expected to lead  the  Taiwan delegation to the meeting, Tsai said.    Taiwan, accepted as an observer of the Geneva-based world  trade regulating body in September 1992, hopes to become a full  member by the end of this year.</p>

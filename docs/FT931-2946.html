			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Thorn in demand Surprisingly bullish figures from the US music industry for last year brought a couple of strong buy reiterations on Thorn EMI, the shares bounding ahead 13 to 872p in chunky turnover of 1.2m. According to US industry figures published yesterday, the value of music sales grew 15 per cent. Leisure specialists had been expecting around 8 per cent growth. NatWest Securities and Hoare Govett both renewed their buy stances on the stocks. Mr Mark Finnie at NatWest said: 'These figures demonstrate the recovery potential of the music industry, and the value inherent in Thorn shares.' Utilities specialists were not taken unawares by the proposal to end zero-rating for VAT on domestic fuel and power, which will be raised in two stages, to 8 per cent from April 1, 1994 and to 17.5 per cent from 1995. Power generators were seen by marketmakers as vulnerable to the news, as were the regional electricity stocks. But analysts said the domestic customers' initial reaction to the imposition of VAT would be to save fuel. 'It is not good but it is manageable,' said one utilities analyst, who added that the market had already braced itself to expect some form of windfall profits imposition. National Power dipped 4 to 335p, as did PowerGen, to 336p, while the 'recs' showed Eastern 9 1/2 off at 468p and Southern, the only 'rec' in the FT-SE 100 Index, 10 cheaper at 480p. Water issues were lower across the board but falls were restricted to 5p at the worst. Thames declined that amount to 535p, as did Anglian, to 522p, while Severn Trent eased 2 to 506p. Several drinks stocks responded well to the chancellor's decision not to increase whisky duty. Analysts said Highland Distilleries would be the best beneficiary as it derives a large proportion of its revenue from the UK. The shares jumped 16 to 286p. Invergordon added 9 at 275p, Guinness 10 at 490p and Allied-Lyons 5 at 573p. Cider shares reacted with relief that a rumoured tax on the product was not to be levied. Taunton Cider rose 13 to 195p, Merrydown 3 to 273p and Bulmer 10 to 404p. A couple of large sellers in Whitbread 'A' held back the stock and it fell 8 to 484p. There was further speculative buying of Hammerson and the 'A' shares advanced 5 to 366p and the ordinary 15 to 402p. British Land, up 7 at 267p, was again being mentioned as a possible predator. A sell recommendation issued by Credit Lyonnais Laing (CLL) hit Willis Corroon shares, which dropped 8 to 200p. Mr Charles Coyne, CLL's insurance broking specialist, said he expected further losses from the troubled Sovereign business as more data on reinsurance recoveries becomes available, and that negative cash flow and a stretched balance sheet mean the shares should be sold. Monday's excellent figures continued to boost Jardine Insurance Brokers, which rose 4 to 188p. Life assurance stocks were said to have been given a push by one of the market's leading securities houses, with Legal &amp; General, expected to report sharply higher preliminary profits tomorrow, 4 firmer at 480p. Composites, where the market adopted a much more relaxed view of potential losses arising from the latest storms affecting the east coast of the US, had General Accident 14 higher at 618p and Commercial Union 12 better at 619p. The chancellor's moves on stamp duty and his proposal to lower the rate of mortgage tax relief failed to disturb a very strong building materials and construction arena. George Wimpey shares were up and running from the outset, eventually closing 10 higher at 136p after the group revealed a very heavy Pounds 113m write-down, losses of Pounds 112.4m and a halved dividend, but accompanied the news with a bullish view of house sales in the current year. Elsewhere in the sector, Wolseley rose 13 to 597p, Tarmac 6 to 118p and Amec 10 to 91p. BAT Industries climbed 17 to 973p as the market continued to be cheered by Monday's news of a joint venture in the Ukraine. UK airports operator BAA was in demand, appreciating 11 to 807p amid speculation, later confirmed, that the UK chancellor would approve the Pounds 300m Heathrow Airport rail link project in his Budget speech. Shares in Simon Engineering had a volatile session as the company announced a steep fall in full-year figures. The shares ended a penny firmer on the day at 114p. Automotive and engineering products manufacturer BBA Group moved ahead 7 to 171p after announcing the disposal of its 57 per cent stake in Pacific BBA for Pounds 59m.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA notes that some commenters opposed requiring every  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employee to have first-aid training because of the transient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nature of the logging industry. OSHA finds that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters' argument does not support the position that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fewer employees should be trained. If there is high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employee turnover, it may be the trained employee who is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employed any longer. If work continues without a fully-trained person while a first-aid replacement is being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trained, employees may be at great risk. By contrast, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> work has to be stopped until a replacement can be trained,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the employer could incur costs which could be prevented by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> having adequate first aid coverage in advance. If all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees working in the logging industry are required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have first-aid training, a pool of trained employees will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> always be available to employers for hiring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fifth, requiring that each employee be trained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eliminates confusion and may be less administratively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burdensome than making a daily check and rescheduling of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> work assignments to assure that supervisors, fellers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some additional number of employees in each operating area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hold current first aid training certificates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ease the training burden for employers, the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule does not require that the first-aid training be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided by the employer. Rather, the final rule requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the employer assure that each employee performing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> logging operations receives or has received first-aid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training and that the first-aid training/certificate is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current. For example, as one means of complying with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule, the employer could make first-aid training a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition of hiring or continued employment. The employer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be free to hire only those persons who had previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtained first-aid training and kept their certificate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current. In addition, when there is employee turnover,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trained employees will be able to bring their first-aid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> skills from one workplace to another and thus relieve the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training burden for the new employer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA is aware that some employers currently provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first-aid training and most likely will continue to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such training. OSHA is also aware that a number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organizations and schools provide first-aid training that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would meet the requirements of Appendix B. For example, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> American Red Cross, the Mine Safety and Health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administration, State extension services, community  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> colleges, and adult education programs all provide first-aid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training that includes CPR. As such, OSHA does not believe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the requirement of assuring that all employees have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received first-aid training that remains current will pose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an unreasonable burden on any employer or employee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Elements of first-aid training. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice, OSHA requested comment on the specific elements,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as CPR, that should be included in first-aid training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the proposed rule OSHA did not specify the basic elements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in which supervisors and fellers must be trained. Rather,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA proposed that first-aid training meet the requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of courses provided by the American Red Cross, MSHA or an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent training program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

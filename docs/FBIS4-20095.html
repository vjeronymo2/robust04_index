			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Wim Kok, Labor Party leader, by Frank Van </F> Emel; place and date not given: "Kok, the Changed Labor Party  Leader"--first paragraph is Rotterdam NRC HANDELSBLAD  introduction]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Wim Kok only comes into his  element when he starts talking about content. He can speak  passionately about the new approach the outgoing government had  to the environment, the Treaty of Maastricht, and social  renewal. His approach is based on convincing people, on finding  support within society, rather than on rules and regulations  imposed from above. Kok wants to continue in this way during the  next term of government. His outline says a great deal about  the way he wants to govern the country. "Traditional policy, as  pursued in this country," the PvdA leader says, "is too often  based on implementing a couple of objectives laid down in a  government pact. It is rare for a process-based approach to be  adopted, with the question "what do you want?" being immediately  linked to the question "how are you going to do it? I am in  favor of such a process-based approach for the next government.  If we form the new government in a couple of weeks time, I will  press for a new style of government along these lines."    [Empel] What does that mean specifically?    [Kok] I am convinced that if we state that we are going to  help thousands of the long-term unemployed to find a job, it  remains a nonstarter if you do not simultaneously try to  implement such a project from the ground up. Specifically, this  means that divisions between institutions, the employment  office, social service, and various training institutes must be  removed and that room must be created for initiative and  creativity.    [Empel] That is like the approach adopted by Bill Clinton  and  Al Gore in the United States: Reinventing government.    [Kok] Yes. I discussed this recently with Frank de Grave.  An excellent man, De Grave (VVD [People's Party for Freedom and  Democracy] alderman for finances on the Amsterdam city council  -- NRC HANDELSBLAD editor's note). When forming the Amsterdam  city council, several parties were in favor of further  developing the "Jan Schaefer school of thought," namely the  productive use of benefit money to create jobs in the care  sector, public supervision, etc. We came to the mutual  conclusion that we must be through with bureaucracies. And this  requires a project-based approach: If you do not decide to do  this when forming a new government, then you may as well forget  about it altogether. That is my aim when forming a new  government. [passage omitted]    [Empel] Over the last 18 months, without being aware of it,  we have been presented with a new Kok. Can this Kok, for  example, also get on with D66 [Democratic 66] leader Hans van  Mierlo? Or is Van Mierlo still wary following the 1989  government?    [Kok] I don't think so. It is so long ago. Three matters  were involved when forming that government: The number of  ministers, the furious opposition to the D66 by the CDA  [Christian Democrat Party] which feared its own position of  power would be compromised and our own strong preference to  simply get on with running the country. The danger that such a  government with the PvdA would not be achieved weighed very  heavily among the PvdA faction. Since then, relations between  the D66 and the PvdA in general, and between Hans and myself in  particular, have sufficiently normalized to be able to look to  the future with a great deal of confidence.    [Empel] Your consensus approach does not always have the  desired effect. Things went seriously wrong over the WAO [Law  on Labor Disability] with the previous government .    [Kok] The WAO was a different kind of matter. In that case,  it was not enough to set a course and to acquire the widest  possible support. Something of this nature applies to major  infrastructure projects: the extension of Schiphol airport, the  Betuwe line. There also you are facing fundamental conflicts of  interest, which you cannot overcome with conviction alone.    You often hear calls for a better presentation. Hans van  Mierlo is very good at that. I then say: If that leads to  saying "we need more time" -- when you know very well that there  is no alternative -- then you are avoiding your responsibility  to make decisions which will have to be made sooner or later.  The D66 does that more often. In the case of the Betuwe line,  Schiphol, and the WAO.    [Empel] What do you think needs to change in the next  government?    [Kok] Governing over the next four years is not a matter of  business as usual. We must perform better on a number of  points. Is the citizen getting sufficient value for his money?  We must set ourselves a task. Not fine sentences laid down in  a government pact but an action plan. And if bureaucracies have  to be brushed aside to make room, so be it. That is the only  way to restore trust to the citizens. If such a new approach  results in recognizable results, the citizen will once again  believe that the government is there for him and not that he is  there for the government.</p>

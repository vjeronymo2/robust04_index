			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / The Long View: When prudence vanishes The pensions business is a natural breeding ground for swindles. You pay your money now but do not find out what benefits you are getting until many years hence. Meanwhile, the information you receive is, at best, actuarial gobbledegook. If you are really out of luck, your trustee turns out to be Robert Maxwell. The particular financial scandal in the headlines this week has concerned the mis-selling of personal pensions after they became available to employees (rather than the self-employed) in 1988. The government and its regulatory watchdog, the Securities and Investments Board, turned a blind eye when armies of salesmen fanned out across the country. Up to the present, around 8m personal pension plans have been sold to employees. Now, SIB's penny has dropped. It has discovered that some of these people were misled by commission-hungry intermediaries and has outlined its plans for redress. About 350,000 priority cases will be re-examined and another 1m-odd could be affected. Unfortunately, there has never been an inquiry into a comparable pensions disaster of the early 1980s. In the recession, many British companies declared hundreds of thousands of long-serving employees to be redundant and fobbed them off with frozen deferred pensions. The already-inadequate real value of these has now halved. It is asking for trouble to allow provision of pensions to be controlled by economic agents - employers, life companies, sometimes even governments - which do not have the interests of the beneficiaries primarily in mind. Company schemes were designed to achieve corporate objectives - basically, to reward long service and promotion - but companies had little regard for employees once they had left. It required legislation to improve matters; meanwhile, occupational schemes got a bad name, especially among the young and mobile. That gave the personal pensions' salesmen an opening - encouraged by the government, which itself was motivated primarily by a desire to reduce the cost of the state earnings-related scheme (Serps). As for the life companies, by the late 1980s the most successful of them had become dominated by their sales forces. Their ethos was that they were selling unquestionably desirable products in life assurance, savings and pensions. You could not have too much of these good things. So, the increasingly high-pressure sales methods, and rising commission rates, were considered to be means justified by ends. Disclosure of commissions and other costs at the point of sale, which might have disrupted this sales drive, was resisted successfully for many years; its imminent introduction, in January, is throwing the life industry into turmoil. In selling the new-style personal pensions to employees, however, life companies were not just marketing products - inevitably, they were offering advice. Customers could stay put in their company scheme (by then, with better protection for early leavers) or in Serps or, alternatively, they could opt for a personal plan. But you cannot reward advisers satisfactorily by paying them commission on product sales. Biased advice is sure to result. What was SIB doing at the time? It was re-writing its rule-book and devising its core principles, or '10 commandments'. These say firms must observe 'high standards of integrity and fair dealing' and that the customer should be given 'any information needed to enable him to make a balanced and informed decision'. Meanwhile, the government was delighted at the success of its personal pensions' promotion. To a degree, things have improved. The regulators have come down from the ethical stratosphere. They have fined many of the erring life offices. Two of the subsidiary regulatory bodies have been merged to form the new Personal Investment Authority, which is supposed to apply more consistent controls. At the same time, you would have to be irrepressibly optimistic to believe similar problems could not recur. The combination of aggressive marketing by myriad investment firms, and bureaucratic investor protection, is prone to huge blind spots. These happen when particular market trends (such as the 1980s' house price boom, which produced the home income plans' scandal) or fashions of political correctness (such as personal pensions) override normal prudence and judgment. Bailing people out of trouble is all very well, but it brings a clear risk of moral hazard: that small investors will come to believe they will be compensated if anything goes seriously wrong and, consequently, they will be drawn more readily into risky and unfamiliar products. The responsibility of clients, as opposed to salesmen, is ill-defined. As it unpicks the personal pensions' tangle, SIB should think laterally and wonder why there is so much investment risk in British savings products. Why are investment companies not falling over themselves to offer low-risk products based upon the remarkable 9 per cent gilt-edged yields now available? Instead, there is a plethora of complex guaranteed and high-income products based upon futures contracts. The answer, as with personal pensions, is that high commissions are distorting advice. Interestingly, the left-of-centre Committee on Social Justice this week suggested a National Savings Pension Plan - which would offer very low-cost, index-linked gilt funds and index-tracking equity funds  -to set a cost benchmark for the competition. The puzzle is why such funds do not exist already or, where they do, have so little impact. The explanation is that it does not pay intermediaries to recommend them. There is a fine line indeed between regulating the market and interfering with it. Here is a motto for SIB: a little bit of the latter might remove the need for a lot of the former.</p>

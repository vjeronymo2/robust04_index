			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion of Options <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _The following discussion outlines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> options considered by EPA in proposing today's system to grant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credits for the destruction or transformation of controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances. The initial discussion focuses on options for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destruction credits. This is followed by a summary of how the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same arguments pertain to a parallel system for granting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transformation credits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Options for Destruction Credits <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _The Agency considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many factors in analyzing how to provide incentives to destroy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substances in the post-phaseout period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA envisions granting destruction credits to people who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destroy controlled substances that were recovered from use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems, as well as controlled substances that were produced or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imported for intended emissive uses. The Agency believes that as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the phaseout goes into effect on January 1, 1996, an increasing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of people will retrofit or switch from use systems that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use class I controlled substances to use systems that occupy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other chemicals or processes less damaging to stratospheric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ozone. However, in the near term the Agency anticipates a period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of transition in which some people continue to use equipment that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupies class I substances. To meet the needs of people with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment designed for class I controlled substances after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> phaseout, EPA presumes market demand will engender a service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry to recover the phased out substances from existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment, such as building chillers, commercial refrigeration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units, and automobile air conditioners as this equipment is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retrofitted with alternative chemicals or is taken out of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commission. EPA anticipates that much of the recovered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substances will be recycled or reclaimed and stored  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (banked) to meet the near term needs of people still using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment that requires phased out substances. At this point in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time, it is difficult to project what the future supply and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demand for controlled substances will be once the post-phaseout  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period begins (January 1, 1996) and how long the transition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period will last.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing destruction credits to encourage the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destruction of controlled substances when the supply of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances exceeds the demand. In time, the demand for class I  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substances should fall as the majority of equipment is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> converted to alternative chemicals or new systems replace old  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems. The Agency presumes this will occur as alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances, retrofits and new equipment are brought into wider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use throughout all sectors, obviating the need for banked class I  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substances. Under this scenario, when the supply of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> class I substance being banked for the period of transition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeds the demand, the price will drop and the existing stocks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will become ``unneeded,'' as mentioned in Decision IV/24 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Parties to the Protocol cited above. When the substances are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unneeded, the demand for phased out controlled substances may no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longer even warrant storage. A person with a stored quantity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> class I controlled substance that no longer has a market due to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the conversion and replacement of equipment should be encouraged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through a meaningful incentive system to destroy the substance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Without such an incentive, individuals may continue storing these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substances, increasing the risk of leaks, accidental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> releases or intentional releases to the atmosphere. EPA believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destruction should be encouraged to prevent such releases into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the atmosphere.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed system encourages the destruction of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substances that are unneeded as demand shifts from one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific substance to alternatives or other types of equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The system of granting destruction credits allows market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexibility in meeting demand by allowing inter-pollutant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfers of destruction credits at the same time that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides an incentive to destroy the excess supply of a given  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substance that might potentially be released into the atmosphere.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a hypothetical example, CFC&hyph;11 might be recovered from several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use systems and banked during the first years after the phaseout  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (January 1, 1996) to meet demand during the period of transition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> But as alternative substances and/or equipment are brought to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market to replace the need for CFC&hyph;11, the supply of CFC&hyph;11 that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was banked would become unnecessary. Today's proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destruction credits would encourage the destruction of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excess supply of CFC&hyph;11 and the credits could be used, through an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inter-pollutant transfer, to produce or import a different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substance in the same Group of controlled substances,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as CFC&hyph;12, to satisfy a still unmet demand for CFC&hyph;12.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As under the current regulation, the Agency will grant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credits equal to 100 percent of the volume destroyed (minus the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offset) for controlled substances that are completely destroyed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (using the current definition of completely destroy). For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substances destroyed at less than a 98 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destruction efficiency, EPA will grant allowances commensurate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with that percent of destruction efficiency that is actually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieved (minus the offset).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another factor considered in proposing an incentive system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was the general technical destruction characteristic of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chlorinated and brominated compounds regulated under the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. Due to the chemical composition of these ozone-depleting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances, the by-products of destruction are often corrosive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acids. The corrosivity of these destruction by-products may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> influence the maintenance costs for approved destruction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologies. Increased rates of destruction of controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances could increase the frequency with which operators of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved incineration technologies would need to replace the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liners of their incineration units. Therefore, operators will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> probably continue to charge high prices for the destruction of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

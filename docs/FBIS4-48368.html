			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] A tense standoff is developing between Charles  Taylor's NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] faction and  the Armed Forces of Liberia [AFL]. Yesterday, AFL Commander  Lieutenant General Bowen issued a stern warning to Taylor's men  about problems in Harbel, the site of the giant Firestone rubber  plantation, and now ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African  States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] have taken action to try to  stop things getting worse, as Nii Nartey Allison reports in this  telex from Monrovia.    Two truckloads of African peacekeeping troops moved into  Harbel today to stave off war between the AFL and Charles  Taylor's NPFL. A spokesman for the African peacekeeping forces  said that the deployment in Harbel was a preventative and  precautionary measure. He called on Harbel residents to remain  calm as the situation was fully under control.    The chief of the AFL, Lt. Gen. Hezekiah Bowen, yesterday  threatened to wage war against the NPFL if it did not withdraw  from AFL positions in the Harbel area. However, the NPFL  liaison officer in Monrovia, John Richardson, today dismissed  Bowen's threats as no threat to the NPFL but rather a threat to  the peace process and the Liberian people. He said Bowen should  take his case to the cease-fire violation committee set up and  provided for under the Cotonou peace accord.    Meanwhile, a Russian vessel, the M.V. Volotitsa, has been  detained here at the free port of Monrovia for illegal entry and  bringing in 81 aliens. A Justice Ministry statement said 11  immigration officers assigned to the free port have been charged  with negligence of duty. The ministry said the ship arrived  here two weeks ago and unloaded 81 aliens believed to be  mercenaries. They disembarked and disappeared before immigration  officers at the port knew what had happened. Neither the  nationalities of the aliens nor its last port of call have been  revealed.    ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia]  leader Roosevelt Johnson accused Alhaji Koromah and his Mandingo  supporters of hiring the mercenaries to help fight his Krahn  faction. Koromah dismissed the Johnson claim as baseless,  untrue, and mere fabrication designed to cause confusion.</p>

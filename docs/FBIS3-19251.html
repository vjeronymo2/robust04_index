			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Guenter Bannas: "`The Greens Aren't Going To </F> Find a Partner for That'--The SPD Distances Itself From the  Red-Green Possibility"]    [Text] Bonn, 28 Feb -- Following the party congress  resolutions of the Alliance 90/Greens on security and energy  policies, the leaders of the SPD [Social Democratic Party of  Germany] see a confirmation of the correctness of their strategy  not to burden their campaign with the announcement of a  red-green coalition. The Greens' demand for a "political  initiative for the disbandment of NATO" and for the abolishment  of compulsory military service, as well as their assertion that  all German nuclear power plants could be shut down within two  years, would otherwise have prejudiced SPD Chairman Scharping's  strategy for broadening the voter spectrum of the SPD with  signals of domestic policy reliability and foreign policy  continuity. The party congress of the Alliance 90/Greens does,  however, provide him with a basis for defending, if it comes to  that, the failure of red-green coalition negotiations following  the Bundestag election against the left wing of the SPD, which  wants "red-green."    Following the conclusion of the party congress of the  Alliance 90/Greens, SPD national business manager Verheugen  called their resolutions "unrealistic dreams." "The Greens will  find no partner for this platform." It is above all the  resolution calling for the disbandment of NATO which is being  opposed in the SPD. The remark by the chairman of the Young  Socialists, Westphal, viz. that "we want to resolve something  similar at our next party congress," is approved by only a  minority even among SPD left-wingers. In disagreeing with this  remark, Verheugen stated: "To demand NATO's disbandment at a  time when the Central and East European countries would like  nothing more than to join it is not only unrealistic, it is also  intrinsically wrong."    Of course, the SPD leadership does not already now want to  rule out a red-green coalition following the Bundestag election.  It is not sure if the party congress resolution of the Alliance  90/Greens on foreign policy will be made a condition in  coalition negotiations. In this case, they assure us, the  coalition talks would fail. If, on the other hand, Alliance  90/Greens were ready to compromise, the party would suffer a  "credibility gap." In view of this, Verheugen termed their  resolution "astonishing." The executive committee spokeswoman of  Alliance 90/Greens, Birthler, sought to modify the consequences  that the resolutions would have on coalition policies with the  remark that no one had demanded "that NATO immediately vanish  into thin air." She called attention to the formulation which  called for NATO to be absorbed by a system of mutual security  and a restored CSCE.    That could create some leeway for negotiations. Verheugen  said that, following the election, the SPD--assuming a favorable  outcome of the election--would talk with all democratic parties,  thereby excluding the Republikaner and the PDS [Party of  Democratic Socialism] as conversational partners of the SPD.  However, democratic parties, in Verheugen's opinion, are not to  be excluded from the outset from talks for reasons of their  platforms alone.    The, at best, basic candor of the SPD leadership serves not  only the purpose of winning over voters who in the event of a  commitment to the Alliance 90/Greens might vote for the current  coalition or--to assure their entry into the Bundestag--to the  Alliance 90/Greens. It is also an expression of the tensions  existing between proponents and opponents of a red-green  coalition. The left wing of the SPD wants to give red-green  cooperation "a solid programmatic foundation above and beyond  the pure arithmetics of a coalition." It was in this vein that  the chairman of the Young Socialists, Westphal, warned the SPD  leadership against branding the Greens as "incapable of making  politics." Standing on the other side is the labor union wing of  the SPD. IG-Chemie Chairman Rappe advised the SPD leaders "to  ignore the signals of the Greens and to stop striving for  red-green coalitions." Otherwise, the competence of the SPD in  the economic and foreign policy arenas will be jeopardized.  Rappe outlined his preferences last week in the NEUE  OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG: "Given a choice, I view red-green as the  worst possible of all conceivable coalitions. In that case, I  would prefer the FDP [Free Democratic Party] or the CDU/CSU  [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] every time."</p>

			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / EU Summit: Serbians warned of tighter sanctions Sanctions against Serbia will be tightened unless it cedes some conquered territory to Bosnia, European Union leaders warned at their summit. But they invited the Serb, Bosnian and Croat leaders to meet their foreign ministers in Brussels on December 22, to take up what the summit conclusions described as 'now a real possibility of achieving peace' in Bosnia. The special meeting is also aimed at averting what the summit called the 'humanitarian disaster. . . . threatening Bosnia-Hercegovina this winter', because of the warring parties' failure to comply with undertakings their political and military leaders gave to the Twelve in Geneva on November 29, to allow unimpeded passage to aid convoys. The Union, which on November 22 threatened to use military force to get the convoys through, warned in the conclusions that the factions 'must adhere strictly' to what was agreed in Geneva. Next week's meeting was convened under German pressure, in spite of nervousness by the current Belgian presidency of the EU that new peace talks could fail. Even Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister, put chances of success at 'still 50-50' but Chancellor Helmut Kohl said: 'I can only hope that, a few days before Christmas, we will see some more reason and humanity' in Bosnia. The Twelve appeared to agree with Lord Owen, the EU's negotiator on Bosnia, that a breakthrough may be possible if real pressure is applied to the warring parties. There was also concern among some delegations that Greece, which takes over the rotating EU presidency from Belgium next month, might be seen as less than impartial because of its traditional sympathies towards Serbia. But Mr Theodoros Pangalos, the Greek alternate foreign minister who will chair the Council of Ministers from January, told the FT on the eve of the summit that he thought the Serbs would agree to the land-for-peace formula the EU offered in Geneva. 'Nobody should be tempted into waiting for a spring offensive' in an effort to secure more land, he warned. The summit conclusions underlined that 'the Serbs must be aware of the responsibility they take upon themselves should they continue adopting an inflexible attitude. They must realise that only real territorial concessions by them in Bosnia-Hercegovina and acceptance of the modus vivendi in Croatia will induce the European Union to work, as it promised to do in Geneva, for the progressive and conditional suspension of sanctions in line with implementation.' Earlier attempts, led by Germany, to get sanctions toughened, were softened into an EU commitment to 'promote a more rigorous application of sanctions' against Serbia until a peace settlement requiring it to cede 3-4 per cent of the territory it holds in Bosnia. At the summit, Lord Owen was warned by EU external relations commissioner Mr Hans van den Broek against giving Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic the impression that he could secure more territory if he ended the war.</p>

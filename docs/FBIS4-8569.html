			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Keith Damsell: "Black Market Helping Boost Czech </F> Economy"]    [Text] Black marketeers, crooks and tax evaders could be as  responsible for the Czech economic miracle as is Finance  Minister Ivan Kocamik--if a recent report published by Prague's  Center for Economic Research and Graduate Education is to be  believed.    In a 26-page report on small business and private  entrepreneurship in the Czech Republic, CERGE associate  professor Dr. Vladimir Benacek concludes that illegal business  activity operating outside the taxman's reach is helping fire  the Czech economy.    "Every small businessman cheats," Benacek said. "The tax  burden is levied on the honest; they have no incentive to do  business. Those who are more clever cheat."    Benacek said the Czech economy is fueled by hidden economic  forces: a "black economy" including violent crime, drug dealing,  smuggling and extortion, and a "shadow economy" of entrepreneurs  who hide their business activities to avoid paying taxes. He  bases his conclusion on a number of mysterious anomalies in  Czech economic statistics.    --Empty unemployment lines. Between January 1991 and April  1992, some 450,000 workers--representing at least 6 percent of  the Czech labor force--either quit their jobs in state-owned  companies or left school without registering for unemployment  benefits or reporting themselves as employed.    "It is assumed that these people to a large extent  `disappeared' into the black and shadow economies," Benacek  writes. "Without doubt, this trend continued during 1993."    Benacek suggests that some of these workers may have  disappeared into fringe areas of the economy such as part-time  and temporary labor. In addition, he says, the privatization  scheme allows for more hidden employment, since company managers  "have used the environment of weak ownership control to find for  themselves a safe niche allowing them to exercise their own  shadow entrepreneurial activities."    Sources in the business community back up Benacek's  assertions.    Milan Mercl, project director of the management consulting  firm Mercl Consulting, said that in his research he often comes  across employees who conduct their own private, unregistered  business on company time.    In addition, some firms will transfer funds to a sister  company; the transferred funds are then recorded as profit.  "There's a higher profit recorded on paper and you're able to  pay management more--even though it's not justified," Mercl said.    --Unfilled vacancies. Benacek calculates that 30 to 60  percent of the people who have registered for unemployment since  1990 may actually be working. He bases his conclusion on the  fact that some businesses are unable to fill vacancies even in  areas where official unemployment figures are high.    In Bohemia, for instance, officially unemployed workers  outnumber job vacancies by nearly 2-1, and in Moravia by more  than 7-1. If all these people are unemployed, Benacek asks, why  aren't they filling the vacancies?    --Undeclared commuters. At the end of 1992, some 76,000  Czechs were registered as workers who commuted abroad (to border  countries such as Germany and Austria) for their jobs.  Unofficial estimates, however, put that figure as high as  100,000. The Bavarian Chamber of Commerce estimates that Czech  commuters can earn as much as 300 million DM per year, or $180  million, from Bavaria alone.    --Hidden productivity. Between 1990 and 1993, the Czech  gross  domestic product (GDP) reportedly fell 26 percent. In a Western  economy, a plummeting GDP would normally mean a deep depression,  massive layoffs, strikes and poverty. Yet Czechs remain  optimistic about their economy, unemployment is near zero in  Prague and expats continue to find gainful employment.    How is this possible?    Benacek suggests that as much as 30 percent of the country's  GDP is hidden or undeclared to avoid taxes.    As proof, he notes that 15,541 of the Czech Republic's  limited liability companies, which have stringent reporting  procedures, generated 84 percent of the country's official GDP,  while the country's 670,000 entrepreneurs contributed just 16  percent. He suggests that those figures hint at under-reporting  by the entrepreneurs.    --Tax evasion. In 1993, tax fraud amounted to at least 5  billion Kc from petroleum sales, 1 billion to 1.5 billion Kc  from tobacco excise tax evasion, 1.3 billion Kc from evading  taxes on smuggled clothing and 2 billion Kc from evading taxes  on antiques and art objects smuggled abroad.    Miroslav Tera, the deputy for taxes for the Ministry of  Finance, refused to discuss the issue. The government is unaware  of any unregistered business activity, he said, and if it was  aware of it, would put a stop to it.    "Why are you calling us? You should call the companies that  aren't paying their taxes," Tera said.    When asked about tax evasion, consultant Mercl laughed. Of  course many business-people regularly cheat on their taxes, he  said, because the tax rates are too high.    According to Benacek, business conditions are such that it's  nearly impossible for an honest entrepreneur to survive and  prosper. Corporate income taxes amount to 45 percent of profits,  while social and health insurance taxes total 36 percent of  gross payroll. That is in addition to the money spent on  corporate licenses, loans and real estate.    To navigate this business minefield, entrepreneurs often  have  no choice but to pay bribes and pocket what they can along the  way, Benacek said. The strong Czech tradition of  entrepreneurship, having been stirred after 40 years of  totalitarianism, allows little guilt over bucking the system.    The results are mixed: Most untaxed income is poured back  into the economy and stimulates further business activity,  Benacek said. But at the same time, decreased government  revenues mean "long-run damage" to the public goods sector.  Infrastructure, education and the soon-to-be-privatized  health-care system all suffer.    Not everyone agrees about the size of the problem, however.    David Roach, senior tax partner at Price Waterhouse, said it  is "extraordinarily difficult" to assess the impact of  unregistered business activity.    "Yes, there's a thriving black market. But the question is  how big it is," Roach said. Bribery of state employees is "not  totally endemic, but is more commonplace than jurisdictions in  other countries west of here."    Steven Kelly, a partner at KNO Worldwide management  consultants, countered that illegal business activity must be  limited, because complex documentation is necessary to make any  monetary transactions.    But bribing government officials to speed up slow service,  especially for telephone and utility installation, is "rampant,"  he said.    "There's money that official types are getting. That's  definitely going on and not being declared."</p>

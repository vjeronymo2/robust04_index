			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Anatoliy Belozertsev report: "Opposition Wins"] </F>   [Text] Elections for the Federation Council and the oblast  Duma have been held in Chelyabinsk Oblast. A. Starikov, general  director of the Magnitogorsk Metallurgy Combine joint-stock  company, and Professor M. Isayev, a prominent Urals economist,  were elected to the upper chamber of the Russian legislature.    Unfortunately, Army General V. Varennikov, Hero of the  Soviet  Union, who was nominated by the oblast's communists, could not  garner the requisite number of votes. But the southern Urals'  voters were wise enough to vote down the candidate of the  extreme right -- Conservative Republican Party Chairman L.  Ubozhko, a staunch anti-communist.    In the oblast Duma elections, supporters of the "For Urals  Revival" opposition movement under P. Sumin, former Russian  people's deputy and chairman of the oblast council, won a  majority of votes. The oblast legislature will be clearly Soviet  both in its lineup and its spirit.</p>

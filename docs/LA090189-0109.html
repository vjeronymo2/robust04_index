			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BID TO AMEND INITIATIVE SUFFERS SETBACK  </P> <P> A politically charged Democratic effort to amend the so-called "speedy trial"  initiative to assure that women's abortion rights are not tampered with  suffered a potentially fatal setback Thursday in the Senate.  </P> <P> Sen. Barry Keene (D-Benicia), the Democratic floor leader, failed by a wide  margin when he asked the Senate to permit a quick committee hearing on the  legislation. Without a prompt hearing, the Legislature cannot consider the  proposal before adjourning for the year Sept. 15.  </P> <P> The issue has taken on heavy political overtones because the speedy trial  initiative is backed by U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, who is expected to be the  Republican nominee for governor next year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Opposed by Sponsors  </P> <P> One of the Democrats who would like to challenge Wilson, Atty. Gen. John K. Van  de Kamp, has been leading the attack on the speedy trial initiative. Van de  Kamp charges that provisions of the initiative repealing privacy rights granted  to prisoners also would throw out the same privacy principles that have  established abortion rights in California.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner came up with the idea of a second  initiative that would not have the offensive language in it, thereby allowing  pro-choice Democrats to support the anti-crime measure.  </P> <P> But Keene's measure was opposed by sponsors of the speedy trial initiative, who  claimed that Van de Kamp's interpretation is legally unsound and politically  motivated to embarrass Wilson.  </P> <P> What Keene wanted Thursday was the Senate's waiver of a provision of the state  Constitution that requires a 30-day public notice before any legislation can be  considered by a committee.  </P> <P> He introduced his proposed constitutional amendment -- nearly identical to the  initiative backed by Wilson, except that it does not contain the controversial  wording that some view as a threat to abortion rights -- only last Friday. And  with the Legislature scheduled to adjourn Sept. 15, Keene does not have time to  wait the legally required 30 days to have his bill heard and still make it  through both houses of the Legislature.  </P> <P> The vote was 17 to 15. But Keene needed 30 votes, or three-fourths of the  40-member house, to waive the rule. Keene couldn't round up a single Republican  vote in support of his effort.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Keene Challenged  </P> <P> Keene argued that his legislation is needed to "clarify" the disputed language  of the speedy trial initiative.  </P> <P> But opponents of his measure challenged Keene's contention and also said they  suspected that he was simply trying to undermine Wilson.  </P> <P> Sen. Bill Leonard (R-Big Bear), one of those who voted against the rule waiver,  said, "The privacy provisions of the initiative are very important to law  enforcement in California. . . . I don't think it's a threat to abortion  rights."  </P> <P> Sen. Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco), who also voted against Keene, said the  Democratic leader's motives were "transparent" and a "ploy" to damage the  initiative and Wilson.  </P> <P> After Keene lost the vote, he said he would "go back to the drawing board." But  he acknowledged that his failed effort to waive the 30-day hearing rule was  probably the Democrats' "last shot" at getting a hearing on the alternative  measure before the end of the year. He said he did not know whether he would  try again in January.  </P></p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading The futures market was enlivened just before the official close by talk of a tussle between two securities houses surrounding expiry of a large tailor-made option, writes Peter John. Dealers said that an OTC - an option contract containing details drawn up specifically for one client - expired just before the official close of Footsie futures and options dealing at 4.10pm. Goldman Sachs and Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull were pinpointed as the two houses most closely involved, although both houses denied any knowledge. The expiry was also said to have been behind weakness in the leading health and household stocks - Glaxo, Wellcome and Zeneca. In any event, it provided a flurry of interest in an otherwise quiet day which began with a narrowing of the premium between the FT-SE 100 Index and the Footsie Futures contract which expires in December. Concern that talks on the Gatt world trade agreement were not going as well as previously hoped gave an opportunity for some arbitrageurs to sell the December contract. Then, late in the day, heavy buying in the underlying cash market saw the premium end the day at only 8 points, a return to more manageable levels. December closed at 3246.5 on turnover of 9,924 lots. Turnover of only 29,697 traded options was enlivened by hefty volume of 6,284 contracts in Hanson. One house bought Hanson calls and sold puts, a bullish stance which takes the view that the underlying shares have fallen as far as they are likely to following disappointing figures at the end of last week.</p>

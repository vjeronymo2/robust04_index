			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Natalya Gorodetskaya report under the "Conflict" rubric: </F> "Russian Federation President Urges Ingushis and Ossetians Not  to Let Themselves Be Provoked. Ingushetia Accuses Temporary  Administration of Inaction"]    [Text] Vyacheslav Kostikov, the Russian president's press  secretary, circulated a statement yesterday regarding extremist  statements and actions that have become more frequent in the  Ossetia-Ingushetia conflict zone. The statement says that  extremists on both sides are trying to involve in the conflict  the Russian soldiers and officers performing a peace-keeping  mission. "The Russian authorities do not intend to tolerate the  crude violations of human rights and legality in the zone  subject to the state of emergency rule," the statement points  out. Urging the citizens of North Ossetia and Ingushetia "to  resist provocations," Boris Yeltsin draws attention to the fact  that the law and order forces in the state of emergency zone  have all the necessary powers and equipment to suppress  manifestations of extremism and to protect civilians from  violence, the statement says.    In the meantime, Ingushetia President Ruslan Aushev's chief  of staff Ruslan Pliyev has stated that it is the Temporary  Administration, or rather its inaction, that is to blame for the  worsened situation in the state of emergency zone. In his  opinion, the taking of six Ingush hostages by Ossetians on 19  May is a logical consequence of this inaction. In his opinion,  the leaders of the Temporary Administration in the state of  emergency zone should be replaced, and its headquarters should  be located on neutral territory rather than in the capital of  North Ossetia, Vladikavkaz.    The Ingushetia president's press service addressed another  statement to "Ostankino." The statement says: "People have  been held hostages for the fifth day running in conditions of  constant threat to their lives. In the meantime the central  mass media and the "Ostankino" channel have been relaying  various reports from North Ossetia, but there has not been even  a word about Ingushi hostages." Glossing over facts and  one-sided information, in the view of the press service, does  not promote stability in the state of emergency zone.</p>

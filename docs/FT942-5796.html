			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Belgium (5): The fight goes on - Industry's bid to contain costs Like most other countries in the European Union, Belgium is only just emerging from a long and hard recession. With the fragile recovery has come a revival of hope in the country's manufacturing sector. But the problems for heavy industry are far from over. The sector remains a robust and important part of the Belgian economy. Manufacturing accounts for roughly a quarter of gross domestic product, and employs about 28 per cent of the labour force. But exceptionally high social security costs have made industrial employers fear that Belgian enterprise is pricing itself out of the market. 'We are the only country in the world where we still have automatic and general indexation of salaries, even during a recession,' says Georges Jacobs, president of UCB, the chemical and pharmaceutical group, and head of the Federation of Belgian Enterprise. 'We have the most generous social security system in the world.' The problem has become something of a fixation with Belgian industrialists. According to another prominent company president, workers in Antwerp are 20 times more expensive than workers doing the same thing just over the border in Rotterdam, Holland. Prompted by the pain of recession, the government last year took action to lower employers' costs. This included a BFr75bn cut in social security expenditure and a pay increase limit of 2 per cent for the next three years, effectively a freeze on wages once inflation was taken into account. But the Federation for Belgian Enterprise argues that the measures were inadequate. 'The government has done something, but it has not gone far enough,' says Mr Jacobs, head of the FEB. 'They are not doing enough to encourage Belgian enterprise.' If ever there was a time for the government to assist the overburdened manufacturing sector, last year's company results show that today is the ideal time. According to figures from the FEB most industrial sectors experienced their first rise in production in December last year, for the first time since the end of 1992. But for the whole of 1993, figures were negative virtually across the board. A sectoral breakdown shows: METAL, ELECTRICAL: deliveries dropped by 3.4 per cent in 1993, although excluding cars, the drop was a more worrying 7 per cent. The financial health of the sector is meanwhile threatened by the high number of restructurings undertaken last year and a rise in bankruptcies. Orders from other countries, however, picked up towards the end of last year and should help the sector stabilise in this. STEEL: action by the European Union to stabilise steel prices should help the Belgian steel sector recover from the recession, although high social security costs continue to diminish the competitiveness of this sector against other EU producers. CHEMICALS: This year is likely to be better than the last, following a stabilisation of production in the fourth quarter of 1993. Prices have stopped falling and in certain sectors prices have begun a timid rise. TEXTILES: production dropped by 7.6 per cent in the first half of the year and by 5 per cent in the second. However, exports of carpets - in which Belgium leads the world - rose a spectacular 58.9 per cent measured by volume in 1993, principally thanks to exports of cheap carpets to Eastern Europe. According to the companies themselves, the worst is over. Solvay, the chemicals company, and Belgium's second biggest enterprise, suffered particularly badly from the world recession. Cheap imports of soda ash from Eastern Europe and the US also prompted the need to restructure. As a result, 11 consecutive years of profit came to an end in 1993 with a spectacular annual loss of BFr6.9bn. Almost Bfr3bn of the loss was caused by restructuring costs after the closure of several plants last year including two soda ash plants, one in Belgium and one in Germany, and a PVC plant in Austria. Now, however, the company is hoping for a better year. It expects a very slow recovery this year, and faster growth next year. The pick-up will be assisted by the start of production of hydrogen peroxide at a new plant in eastern Germany. Prospects are also rosier at Petrofina, Belgium's largest industrial group. Like Solvay, the company was hit by the global recession,although it managed to stay in profit last year. The group has refocused on core activities, abandoning those where the company was not competitive, such as coal, shipping, insurance, and property. It now expects a 5 per cent gain in productivity this year through investment and the gradual shedding of 2,000 jobs since 1991. A BFr26bn upgrading of its Antwerp refinery should be complete by September, and the company expects oil and gas output to go up 15 per cent this year. At UCB, Mr Jacobs is sanguine about prospects for his enterprise. He describes the company, which concentrates on a fairly narrow range of pharmaceuticals, films and packaging, as 'the small, clever guy'. Following a 17 per cent drop in profits last year, he now predicts that profits will be 'at a good level' this year. So overall, Belgium's manufacturing sector can probably expect a reprieve this year from the doldrums of 1993, even if growth remains unimpressive. Mr Gert Lambrecht, a senior economist at Kredietbank, one of Belgium's biggest banks, says activity will be weak, but it won't fall further. 'It is also likely that wage costs will remain under control,' he says, adding that lower short term interest rates and a bounce back from two years of falling capital investment will boost growth in the manufacturing sector. Furthermore, the far reaching restructuring undertaken by many of Belgium's big industrial companies such as Solvay should start to pay off this year and next, restoring prosperity to the sector.</p>

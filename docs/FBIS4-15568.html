			<p>BFN     [Text] Members of the All-Union Communist Party of  Bolsheviks today picketed the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. In the  opinion of the pickets, the authorities in the United States,  Japan, and South Korea are conducting a provocative policy  toward the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The party  members believe socialist Korea is sticking in the throats of  various reactionary forces in the world, and so all progressive  people on the planet should show solidarity with the heroic  people of North Korea.</p>

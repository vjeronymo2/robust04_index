			<p>BFN     [Text] On 7 April, the International Trade and Industry  Ministry Patent Office disclosed that Japan's official  development assistance (ODA) program will be expanded and  applied to a private training program on industrial property  rights. The aim of private training programs using ODA funding  has so far been to promote exchanges of technology. But  additional ODA funds will now be used to support a training  program on Japanese industrial property rights, which will be  carried out from this fall by the Japan Institute of Invention  and Innovation [JIII] (an auxiliary organization to the Patent  Office). This is in response to the agreement on Trade Related  Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIP) reached in the  Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, which urges  developing countries to establish an industrial property system.  Tokyo plans to assist developing countries mainly in Asia in  establishing the system, thereby exporting Japan's system of  protecting property rights to those countries.    The training program will be carried out mainly by the  Industrial Property Patents and International Cooperation  Training Center, which was established by the JIII on 1 April.    The center will dispatch Japanese private sector patent  specialists to foreign countries and also invite specialists  from foreign companies so that Japan's patent application system  for such products as computer circuits and semiconductors will  take root overseas.    ASEAN will be a main participant in the project. The project  will be funded by a portion of an ODA subsidy (which totals 9  billion yen in fiscal 1993) provided to the Japan Overseas  Development Council (JODC) and the Association for Overseas  Technical Scholarship (AOTS). The subsidy will cover one-third  to one-half of trainees' living expenses during their stay in  Japan.    Developing countries have been trying to establish an  industrial property system following the Uruguay Round  agreement, which obligates them to establish one. The United  States and the European Union have been working to export their  own industrial property systems to developing countries in a bid  to help private companies make inroads into those countries in  the future. Similarly, Japan's training program is aimed at  conforming an industrial property system in Asia to Japan's to  back Japanese companies in making inroads into developing  countries in Asia.</p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Yeltsin seeks crackdown on crime: Russia's 'mafia' is terrorising business and ordinary citizens Russia's President Boris Yeltsin paid a symbolic visit to a crack paramilitary division outside Moscow at the weekend. Coinciding with a string of bomb blasts in the capital, the Russian leader last week issued a barrage of instructions giving the security forces unprecedented powers for a law-and-order crackdown. Condemned as unconstitutional by the parliament and liberal media, these new powers include the right to detain suspects for up to 30 days without charge, to search without a warrant the premises and examine bank accounts of any companies and to use in court evidence gathered by undercover methods such as phone-tapping and infiltration of criminal gangs. On Saturday, Mr Yeltsin told the regiment named after Felix Dzerzhinsky, the hated founder of the Soviet secret police: 'I am counting on your willpower, honour and courage. Preserve and multiply what has always distinguished the forces of law and order - constant vigilance, military-readiness, and strong military discipline.' Russia's so-called 'mafia' - a term used to describe anything from organised crime bosses to small-time racketeers and violent criminals - is terrorising both the business community and ordinary citizens. A successful crackdown on Russian society's number one scourge would yield priceless political benefits for Mr Yeltsin, whose unpopularity is at an all-time low. In a front page editorial, Izvestia recognised an overwhelming public desire for law and order when its commentator wrote: 'I am sure that the decree would have received an even warmer response had it provided for summary executions on the spot, without trial or investigation.' But the criminals' close links to corrupt officials and police are the strongest reason to doubt that this crackdown will yield its intended results. Mr Vladimir Tsekhanov, a senior official of the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service, recently provided a telling illustration of the scale of corruption within the security forces. He claimed that Russia's equivalent of the FBI had 'uncovered a wide criminal group' including Interior Ministry officials and Moscow police officers 'who took large bribes to release Moscow mobsters under investigation on charges of robbery, smuggling, illegal possession of firearms, or at least to scale down their prison terms.' Izvestia went on to warn that the security organs' repressive traditions, inherited from the Communist-era police-state, could easily backfire against the healthy businesses Mr Yeltsin says he wants to protect. 'From now on, a law-enforcement official may uncover a commercial secret, disrupt the privacy of investment, inviolability of banking and financial documents. . . Can anyone guarantee that interference in a business will be dictated by the fight against crime or a bribe given by competitors?' Under pressure from Mr Yeltsin's initiative, parliament on Friday tried to speed up its own discussion of a separate law on fighting crime. It failed not only to adopt this law, but even to agree a resolution demanding that President Yeltsin rescind his decree's unconstitutional provisions. It settled instead on sending its best wishes to the Russian soccer team as the World Cup opened in the US. Waging war against crime in these circumstances will require not just political will at the highest level - which Mr Yeltsin appears to be displaying - but utmost caution in its prosecution.</p>

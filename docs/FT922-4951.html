			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / FT Law Report: Reinsurer can dispute claims IN RE A COMPANY NO 0013734 OF 1991 Chancery Division: Mr Roger Kaye QC sitting as a deputy High Court judge: April 30 1992 A WINDING-up petition brought against reinsurers by an insolvent reinsured for non-payment under reinsurance contracts in respect of settled or actuarially valued but as yet unpaid insurance claims, will be struck out despite contractual wording which in a simple case would impose an obligation on the reinsurers to indemnify for unpaid claims, if they dispute liability in good faith and on substantial grounds raising issues inappropriate for resolution on the petition. Mr Roger Kaye QC sitting as a deputy Chancery judge, so held when granting an application by the reinsurer company to strike out a winding-up petition presented by the reinsured. HIS LORDSHIP said that the reinsured was in liquidation, having been ordered to be wound up by the Supreme Court of Bermuda on May 17 1985. It claimed Dollars 122,244 against the company under two reinsurance contracts. The sum represented Dollars 43,119 settled claims, and Dollars 87,498 claims which had not been settled but were calculated following an actuarial valuation of the underlying contingent claims against the reinsured. The valuation was carried out in a manner approved by order of the Bermuda court. The company argued that no liability to pay had arisen. It said the petition should be struck out because the debt on which it was based was disputed in good faith and on substantial grounds. The reinsured contended that there was no bona fide or substantial dispute. Under the two contracts, the company's liability was to 'pay the excess of an ultimate net loss' over specified limits. By article 6 'ultimate net loss' meant 'the sum actually paid by the reinsured in settlement of losses or liability'. The article must be read in conjunction with articles 15 and 16. Article 15 provided that 'all loss settlements made by the reinsured including compromise settlements' were binding on the company 'upon reasonable evidence of the amount paid being given by the reinsured'. Article 16 provided that the reinsurance was subject to the same terms as the original policies 'and shall pay as may be paid thereon'. To avoid a protracted liquidation the liquidators arranged actuarial valuation of the contingent claims, approved by the Bermuda court. Mr Chivers for the company submitted that the reinsured was not entitled to call for payment unless and until the original claim was actually settled and paid. He said there was no evidence that the settled or the actuarial claims had been actually paid. Mr Millett for the reinsured argued that the combined effect of articles 6, 15 and 16 was that all that was necessary was to show the amount of the company's liability, which was established in the form of settled claims or, in the case of the actuarial claims, by the Bermuda order. The latter, he said, amounted to a 'loss settlement' or 'compromise settlement' binding the company under article 15. The first issue was whether it was a precondition of the company's liability that the reinsured should actually have paid the assureds. The issue related to both settled and actuarial claims. Article 6 referred to sums 'actually paid'. Article 15 referred to 'reasonable evidence of the amount paid', and to 'loss settlements'. Article 16 referred to the requirement to pay as might be 'paid'. The material word used was 'paid'. At first blush therefore, on the language of the reinsurance contracts, the court would have been inclined to favour Mr Chiver's interpretation. Nevertheless, the authorities cast considerable doubt as to whether, at least in the case of an insolvent reinsured, that approach was correct. In Re Eddystone Marine Insurance (1892) 2 Ch 423, Mr Justice Stirling upheld a contention by liquidators that, notwithstanding that the reinsured had not actually paid the assureds, the reinsurer was liable to indemnify it. The case concerned a 'pay as may be paid clause', but did not deal with an 'ultimate net loss' clause of the type reflected in article 6. That type of clause came under consideration in Home v Overseas Insurance v Mentor Insurance (1989) 1 Lloyd's Rep 473,480. There, plaintiff reinsurers argued that the loss clause was so clear that they could only be liable after the reinsured had actually paid the assureds. Mr Justice Hirst rejected the submission. He said it was 'unjust and discordant with commercial good sense that, by reason of the accident of a reinsured becoming insolvent, the reinsurer (who had accepted premiums) should go scot-free'. Were it a simple matter of construction and the only issue was whether settled (albeit not actually paid) claims fell within the terms of the reinsurance contracts, the present court would have refused to strike out the petition. There was considerable force in the reasoning of Mr Justice Stirling and Mr Justice Hirst. It did seem a matter of plain common sense that in the context of a winding-up 'paid' must mean 'liable to pay'. However, it would not be right to allow the present petition to go forward on the first issue. The factors leading to that conclusion included the following: It was not the only issue in the case. Other issues might have a significant bearing on the construction of the reinsurance contracts. The reinsured was being wound up in Bermuda. It was not clear which law governed the contracts. That might have a bearing. It was clear from the number of authorities considered in Mentor that the matter was by no means simple and straightforward, particularly where the reinsured had become insolvent. Also, there was the additional complication of the actuarial claims. It might be that the company (which contended it had no notice of the claims calculations) could intervene in the Bermudan proceedings to challenge the methodology leading to calculation. Those factors raised serious and complex issues which were not appropriate to resolve on an interlocutory motion or on the hearing of a winding-up petition. The court could not say that the company's argument had no rational prospect of success, or that the reinsured's argument could not be seriously questioned. On that basis alone therefore, the company showed that the reinsured's claims were bona fide disputed on substantial grounds. The second issue was whether valuation of contingent liabilities in accordance with the Bermuda order was a 'loss settlement' or 'compromise settlement' for the purposes of article 15. Mr Chivers said it was not, because inter alia the company was not a party to it and the Bermuda court did not purport to settle claims by the reinsured against the company. Mr Millett submitted that it was, because inter alia the company had every opportunity to be aware of it and did not challenge the method of valuation. He said it did not matter that the company was not a direct party to the order. Again, the court was satisfied that the company showed that that part of the petition debt which was dependent on actuarial valuation was bona fide disputed on substantial grounds. There was a serious issue to be tried as to whether the Bermuda order was indeed a 'loss settlement' for the purposes of article 15. The third issue was whether the reinsured had provided 'reasonable evidence' of the claims for the purposes of article 15. Its figures had already been challenged and corrected, and it was impossible to say that they could not be seriously questioned when examined in the full light of discovery and forensic examination. The petition should not be allowed to go forward in the present state of the evidence. It did not make it clear beyond peradventure and without more, that the company was indebted in the sum claimed. For the reinsured: Richard Millett (DJ Freeman). For the company: David Chivers (Paisner &amp; Co).</p>

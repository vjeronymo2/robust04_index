			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Letter: No tears for the NEDC Sir, We should not shed too many crocodile tears over the demise of the National Economic Development Office. It was established in circumstances and an environment quite different from that faced today. The challenge to the Department of Trade and Industry in its new role will come from strong and intensifying competition as European and global markets become increasingly integrated. To promote the future competitiveness of the UK economy will require radical thinking and original policy developments by the Department of Trade and Industry. These will depend for their success on unbiased, well-researched empirical facts and analysis. I hope such independent research will play an increasing role in the development of policies appropriate to the national and international environment of the 1990s.

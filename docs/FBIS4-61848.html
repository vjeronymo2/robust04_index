			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Andrey Nikolayev report under the "Airwaves" rubric: </F> "Government Intends to Stop Paying for Commercial Television and  Promises to Communications Workers Preferential Electricity  Rate"]    [Text] Anatoliy Nazeykin, chairman of the Russian  Federation Communications Workers Trade Union Central Committee,  has stated in a press conference that the Russian Government  will look at the problems of radio and television at one of its  next sessions. According to him, this session is supposed to  determine a specific duration of state programming and the sums  to be earmarked for it.    According to Anatoliy Nazeykin, Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin,  speaking at a recent conference on the operation of Russian post  offices and problems of the television and radio broadcasting  complex, held with Communications Minister Vladimir Bulgak and  acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin taking part, already let  it be understood that "the government intends to appropriate  money only for state-ordered programming," meaning those  programs that society needs most of all in the opinion of the  country's leadership. As has been made clear, such would be  children's programs, sports, general education,  information-political, and a number of other programs of  educational importance. The broadcasting of ads and commercial  programs will be done "for the finances of those who need them."    In this question, as the trade union leader thinks, Viktor  Chernomyrdin completely shares the position of the  communications workers, who have repeatedly demanded that air  time taken up by ads and commercial broadcasts be excluded from  the state-order time and be paid for at negotiable prices, and  that the resale to other customers of the air time meant for  state-ordered programming and paid for from the federal budget  be prohibited. Viktor Chernomyrdin also expressed readiness to  solve the question of a preferential rate of payment for  electricity for communications enterprises.    The government session is also expected to look at the  question of increased budget financing in a bid to preserve the  reception and transmission network of television and radio  communications enterprises on the basis of the minimal duration  of broadcasting worth up to 1.5 trillion rubles instead of the  679 billion provided for in the draft budget. Today this is one  of the main demands of communications enterprises work  collectives, "therefore the trade union's Central Committee  leaders intend to insist that it should be acted upon," Anatoliy  Nazeykin has stated.</p>

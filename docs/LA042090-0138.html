			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEW PRESIDENT TO TAKE HELM AT MEDSTONE  </P> <P> Medstone International Inc. on Thursday named Richard Ferrari as president and  chief operating officer of the Irvine-based biotechnology company.  </P> <P> Ferrari, a former executive vice president of ADAC Laboratories in Milpitas,  Calif., replaces acting president Jack Olshansky, who has filled the job on an  interim basis since November.  </P> <P> Medstone is a manufacturer of lithotripters, which are sophisticated shock-wave  devices designed to disintegrate kidney stones without surgery.  </P> <P> Ferrari's appointment is the latest in a series of top management changes at  the Irvine company. Olshansky, a representative of Medstone's largest  shareholder, Montgomery Medical Ventures, was appointed to the president's post  following the resignation last August of company co-founder Richard L. Penfil.  </P> <P> Penfil and Medstone's vice president for regulatory affairs, P. Joshua Burke,  left the company amid continuing problems in gaining Food and Drug  Administration approval to use Medstone's lithotripters as a non-surgical  alternative for treating gallstones. The FDA has approved the machines only for  treating kidney stones.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Medstone announced a net loss of $602,471 on revenue of $4.2  million for the first quarter ending March 31, compared to earnings of $358,534  on revenue of $4.1 million in the year-earlier quarter.  </P> <P> Medstone Chairman Freeman Rose blamed the lower earnings on efforts to reduce  corporate expenses and on legal costs associated with a pending class-action  shareholder lawsuit against Medstone. The suit alleges that Medstone withheld  adverse information about its prospects in order to inflate its stock price.  </P></p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Egypt tries to restart peace talks EGYPT sought yesterday to bring Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation back to the negotiating table after their talks broke down last week over Israel's proposals for implementing the first stage of the outline peace agreement signed in Washington on September 13. Mr Amr Moussa, Egypt's foreign minister, said after talks in Tel Aviv with Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign minister, he saw no reason why the negotiations should not resume on schedule next week. However, in Cairo, Mr Nabil Sha'ath, who leads the PLO negotiating team, warned Israel that if it persisted with its proposals for only a limited army withdrawal from the occupied Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho the two sides would fail to meet the December 13 deadline for the completion of the first stage of negotiations. 'We are giving a warning, a signal to the Israelis that we cannot complete our objective in two months if they continue with this concept. It is a very early signal to the Israelis. It cannot go on this way,' Mr Sha'ath said. The PLO has accused Israel of seeking to retain a military presence in over 50 per cent of the Gaza Strip instead of carrying out an almost total withdrawal. Mr Peres acknowledged before Mr Moussa's arrival that there was a crisis in the negotiations, but appeared confident that it would be resolved. The row over the the PLO-Israel talks may have deflected Mr Moussa from the main purpose of his visit which was to press for progress on the stalled negotiations between Israel and Syria. Egypt believes strongly that a breakthrough with Syria would be a powerful boost to prospects for an overall Middle East peace deal.</p>

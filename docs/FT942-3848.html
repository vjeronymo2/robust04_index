			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: R&amp;D: the crucial distinction Sir, Dr Mulvey of The Save British Science Society (Letters, June 9) and others concerned with the question of the financing of research and development, must make a crucial distinction: between the views taken by investors through the pricing of shares on the stock exchange, and what company managements believe the views of investors to be and what the stock exchange does. Many company directors are convinced that the stock exchange takes short-term views. They may therefore take actions on that assumption, for example to restrict R&amp;D expenditure, which can lead to unfortunate consequences for the UK. But evidence on the stock exchange itself is that long-term prospects, and the virtues of R&amp;D expenditure (when properly explained, which is an important point), are in fact compounded in stock exchange pricing mechanisms; the evidence is very much in that direction, although not completely so. Anyway, the stock exchange is a rational place. The solution to this problem is not for the government to act on false assumptions by taking (almost by definition) inappropriate actions. The correct response is to educate management and others in the efficient market theory. But how can this be done? The academic work on this subject is vast, based on papers which have won a Nobel Prize. Yet, for example, the Commons trade and industry committee concluded that 'research indicates that the stock market undervalues long-term investment' on the basis of one academic paper alone. How many parties to this debate can articulate the possible defects in the capital asset pricing model? This is a difficult and in some ways a non-intuitive subject. But it is irresponsible to come to conclusions without reading and discussing the great mass of statistical and logical evidence. There may, of course, be macro-economic reasons why industrial investment should be planned on a short-term basis and high dividends paid out. That may be an even more important subject for discussion. David Damant, Beaufort House, 15 St Botolph Street, London EC3A 7JJ</p>

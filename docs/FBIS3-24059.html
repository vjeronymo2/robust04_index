Petrov: "The Future Is for the APR [Agrarian </F> Party of Russia], Believe Oblast Conference Delegates"]    [Text] The regional section of the Agrarian Party of  Russia, is perhaps the youngest in the multiparty list of the  Smolensk region. Organizationally, it was formed a little over a  month ago. However, in its numbers (around 400 members), the APR  is far from being in last place. And this is understandable: Our  oblast has long been called agrarian. Moreover, the APR won a  certain authority in Russia during the elections to the State  Duma, where it received representation among eight parties and  movements. Organizations of the APR have been created in 70  regions of Russia.    This fact was reiterated at the recently held oblast  conference of the APR. The chairman of the party organization,  A. S. Ignatenkov, justifying the need for unification of  agrarians of the Smolensk region into a party, recalled the  oblast conference on agriculture which was held two years ago.  Even at that time the conclusion was drawn that reforms are  being implemented not in the interests of the farm workers. A  coordinating committee was elected, which prepared documents  containing proposals and demands of the rural residents to the  local administration and the government, organized picketing,  etc. The result was zero. Evidently, they made the rounds of the  offices and pleaded in vain. It was necessary to opt for extreme  measures--not to supply products. But, on the other hand, the  coordinating committee did not have any powers and authorities.  The creation of the party introduces the work on defending the  interests of the peasantry into a constitutional channel. This  was the specific guideline during the creation of the APR by its  founders, among which the main role belonged to the trade unions  and the Ministry of Agriculture. A. Rutskoy was also of great  help.    What is the APR trying to achieve, and what are its tasks  today? First of all, it is necessary to stop the disintegration  and the pilferage of agricultural structures which had been  decades in the making. The head of the Smolensk organization of  the APR, A. S. Ignatenkov, has long been well known, including  also outside the oblast, as the chairman of the leading kolkhoz  "Zarya" in Pochinkovskiy Rayon. The achievements of this farm in  the sphere of production as well as in the social-domestic  sphere were widely publicized not only in the local, but also in  the central press. However, in the words of A. S. Ignatenkov, it  was not necessary to do anything brilliant in order to obtain 40  quintals of grain crops from a hectare and a 4,000 liter milk  yield. The main thing was that a good material base was created  and, were it not for the reforms, not tens but hundreds of farms  in the oblast would have such indicators today. We could feed  not only ourselves, but Poland too. Yet today even the recent  "beacons" cannot make ends meet: The problem lies in selling the  produced product, in getting money for it.    The statements of farm managers F. S. Vasilyev and V. D.  Komarova, who are well known in the Smolensk region, resounded  with concern already for the near future of the farm. Oblast  leaders today have forgotten their pre-electoral promises to see  to the needs of the peasants. Despite the invitations, not one  administration representative came to the conference. To hear  them talk--everything is fine with us. Yet catastrophe is not  far away--there is simply nothing with which to sow the current  Spring planting in the Smolensk region, not to mention the  problems with equipment, spare parts and fuel. Where and for  what means are the current joint-stock companies supposed to buy  all of this, if even an excellent flax crop, for which medals  were given before, brings only losses?    The APR does not have time for political discussions. It  does  not aspire to any bright color in today's political spectrum.  Its goals and tasks are in keeping with those facing the trade  unions. And it is no accident that the trade unions are among  the founders of the party, and it is no accident that at the  conference (it was held in the oblsovprof [oblast soviet of  trade unions]) the tasks for creating and stepping up the  actions of the local APR organizations were placed before the  trade union raykom [rayon committee] chairmen.    Speaking at the conference, the oblast committee chairman of  the trade union of workers in the agricultural industry, V. A.  Yakovlev (he is also the co-chairman of the oblast organization  of the APR), noted that the APR is a party not only of farm  workers, but of everyone who holds dear the needs of our farms.  Ultimately, the well-being of everyone depends on the degree to  which these needs are met. This is specifically why the future  is for the APR. And we do not need to forcefully drag anyone  into the party, to inflate its membership numbers. The Agrarian  Party is open to constructive cooperation with all parties and  movements, but will not itself seek alliance with anyone. For  now, the agrarians are in closest contact with the communists.    A separate point on the conference agenda was the question  of  nominating candidates to the oblast duma. An agreement was  reached on support of previously nominated candidates by the  APR. It turned out that among these were also the heads of the  Rudnanskiy, Pochinkovskiy and Kholm-Chirkovskiy administrations.  The candidates for deputy in the oblast duma nominated by the  APR were P. Ye. Demyanov (Yartsevo) and V. A. Yakovlev.    An oblast organization council was created at the  conference,  and all participations were given party tickets of a pleasant  green color. We have only to hope that the Agrarian Party will  be able to help the peasants as well as us, the city residents,  to live through the current difficult times.</p>

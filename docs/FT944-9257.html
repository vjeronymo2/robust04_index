			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Charles Sidney 17% ahead to Pounds 2.87m Charles Sidney, the Mercedes-Benz truck and car dealer, outstripped the German group's performance across the UK as it lifted pre-tax profits 17 per cent from Pounds 2.46m to Pounds 2.87m in the year to August 31. Mr Raymond Edwards, chairman, said the group was looking for acquisition possibilities involving other manufacturers. He said the year had been spent making sure that shareholder value, excluding newly incurred central costs, rose satisfactorily. Further, Mr Edwards wanted the South Yorkshire business bought from the receiver and Aberdeen and Dundee Motor Group to be integrated. That done, he said discussions had been taking place with a view to making relationships with other manufacturers of trucks and cars, both specialist and volume. He was wary of spending too much and would avoid companies which used debt for trading. Turnover grew to Pounds 72.2m (Pounds 55.8m) with Aberdeen and Dundee contributing Pounds 6.16m to sales and Pounds 235,000 to operating profits of Pounds 2.84m (Pounds 2.44m). The group said that after adding back Pounds 450,000 of central costs, underlying profits from trading rose 38 per cent to Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 2.4m). Profits from trucks advanced 24 per cent to Pounds 2.17m on turnover of Pounds 43m (Pounds 35.1m) and cars contributed 61 per cent more at Pounds 1.11m on turnover of Pounds 29.2m (Pounds 20.7m). Mr John Ross, managing director, said that cars had risen so sharply largely because of the impact of the C Class, the replacement for the 190. As average profit per unit fell about 5 per cent across the group, Mr Ross said the high-margin after-sales and parts operations had become more important. Earnings increased to 8.3p (7.9p) per share and a maiden final dividend of 2.3p makes a total of 3.5p.</p>

			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / National housing bank proposals published LABOUR HAS published its plans for a national housing bank to increase the supply of homes for rent without adding directly to government spending. The bank would borrow money on the capital markets and lend it to local authorities and housing associations to build and renovate rented housing. Private landlords could also be given access to funds for rented accommodation, provided they observed tenants' rights and kept the housing in good repair. Finance could be offered to housebuilders to support social housing in mixed developments to foster balanced communities. The bank would be established as a public limited company so that it could be set up relatively quickly. Its borrowing would thus not be included in the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR), and would be free of Treasury restrictions. The bank would offer a way of recycling local authority capital receipts back into housing without adding to the PSBR. At present, spending these receipts counts towards the PSBR, and councils can plough back only a proportion of the money into housing. Money invested in the national housing bank would not count as part of the PSBR, even if it were spent on housing. The plans are likely to be welcomed by those who believe that the level of building for rent needs to be increased substantially. The scheme has been welcomed by builders' representatives. Mr John Smith, chairman of the Building Employers' Federation, said: 'Something of this sort already exists in one or two European countries. Anything which can increase the flow of housing finance without adding to inflation must be welcome'.</p>

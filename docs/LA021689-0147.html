			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA MONICA WEIGHS ASSAULT-WEAPONS BAN  </P> <P> An emergency ordinance banning the sale and possession of rapid-fire assault  weapons in Santa Monica will go before the City Council in two weeks.  </P> <P> The council voted unanimously Tuesday night to instruct the city attorney to  prepare the ordinance. Three other motions regarding firearms also were passed  unanimously.  </P> <P> Councilman David Finkel proposed the motion, which he placed on the agenda the  morning after a gunman killed five children with an AK-47 semiautomatic rifle  at a Stockton elementary school last month.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Scourge of Country'  </P> <P> Finkel called semiautomatic weapons "the scourge of the country," and he urged  Santa Monica to join a statewide effort to ban them.  </P> <P> "We can either sit back and let the debate die out, or add our voice," he said.  "The more cities that act out, the more likely the state will do something."  </P> <P> Two people spoke against the proposed ban at the council meeting.  </P> <P> Santa Monica resident Thomas E. Locke, a member of the National Rifle Assn.,  argued that instead of outlawing semiautomatic guns, the city should seek  stiffer penalties for people who injure or kill others with them. He also  proposed stricter background checks on potential purchasers.  </P> <P> "People are abusing arms," Locke said, "but there's also a need to protect  ourselves from criminals. Let's not restrict our right to bear arms, but the  right for criminals to use them."  </P> <P> E. Bruce Jochim, owner of one of Santa Monica's two gun stores, also opposed  the ban. He urged the enactment of a 15-day waiting period for the purchase of  semiautomatics. A mandatory 15-day waiting period exists for the purchase of  handguns.  </P> <P> "It's not the firearms," Jochim said. "It's the people."  </P> <P> In addition to the ban, two motions included instructions to the city's  lobbyist to study joining a statewide lobbying effort to strengthen firearm  control laws in California. A final motion suggested gun and violence  prevention programs for youths.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Christine Reed said that although she supported a ban on  semiautomatic and automatic weapons, she had doubts about the constitutionality  of the ban.  </P> <P> "I don't want my vote to be construed as instructing the city to go about  questioning the Second Amendment (right to bear arms)," she said. "I don't mind  having a battle with the NRA, I just don't want to have a battle with the  federal Constitution."  </P> <P> City Atty. Robert M. Myers said the emergency ordinance would probably be drawn  up by the next council meeting Feb. 28.  </P></p>

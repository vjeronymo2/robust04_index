			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Books: Travellers' tales THE GRAND TOUR IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY by Jeremy Black Alan Sutton Publishing Pounds 17.99, 354 pages IN A FAMOUS passage of his Sentimental Journey, Laurence Sterne mocks the travellers Smelfungus and Mundungus for the 'spleen and jaundice' with which they approach things foreign. Those who take a similarly splenetic view of travel will be encouraged in their moroseness by Jeremy Black's account of the Grand Tour, which charts a formidably diverse array of difficulties. He notes that 'tips were a constant drain' and 'venereal disease was indeed a problem.' 'Some tourists found their drivers and postilions fraudulent, others simply troublesome.' The chapter on War, Disputes, Accidents and Crime offers Black particular freedom to indulge his penchant for disaster: 'Travellers fell down stairs, had accidents with guns and ran the risk of being knocked over in Paris, where there was an absence of pavements.' The Grand Tour in the Eighteenth Century is, however, careful not to ignore those Englishmen and women who, undaunted by the dangers proliferating around them as they progressed around Europe, threw themselves into the pursuit of pleasure. Embarking on a chapter headed Love, Sex, Gambling and Drinking, Black is at first discomfited by the lack of first-person descriptions of foreign sexual adventures in 18th century letters and diaries. He suggests hopefully: 'Some obscure references in journals may be sexual.' One anonymous tourist referred to being 'introduced to 2B' in July 1754. Fortunately, such comments are supplemented by the speculations of the English press. In 1725, Mist's Weekly Journal declares that the experience of English travellers in Paris 'is generally no more than a journal of how many bottles they have drunk, and what loose amours they have had.' The London Journal of 1731 noted: 'It is highly probable that, by means of our ladies travelling, some of our noble families may be honoured with a French dancing master's son for their heirs.' Black displays surprisingly little interest in the more voyeuristic pleasures of travel. Most 18th century writings about Italy express immense fascination with the custom of cicisbeism under which a married woman was expected to form a relationship with a cicisbeo - a male companion who escorted her to social occasions and devoted much of his time and attention to her. The book mentions the enthusiasm with which Englishmen participated in this custom, and the fears of one English traveller that cicisbeism set a bad example to Englishwomen in Italy. It says nothing at all, however, about the elaborate, steamily circumlocutionary speculations of travellers as to precisely what went on between the woman, the cicisbeo and the husband. This is typical of Black's down-to-earth approach. At many points in the book, he clearly is concerned not simply with the activities of English travellers (overturnings of carriages and dalliances with opera singers), but also with prevailing impressions of particular regions ('Homosexuality was regarded in Britain as a foreign vice of Mediterranean origins, as indeed was sodomy'). Nonetheless, he never shows any inclination to analyse what Edward Said, in Orientalism, terms 'imaginative geography:' the range of themes, concepts and descriptive strategies by which one region of the world is classified as distinct from another. Black's stolid empiricism does not mean, however, that he allies himself with the old-fashioned anecdotalists who have dominated the study of the Grand Tour in the past. He is, if anything, slightly less indulgent towards the flamboyant, anecdotal digressiveness of travel writing than overtly 'theoretical' writers - who usually harbour a lurking fondness for ribald detail and striking turns of phrase. (Said, scrutinising 19th century writings on Egypt, permits himself a moment of mild hilarity at an alarmed account of the dangers of excessive 'freedom of intercourse' with the natives). In contrast to both theorists and anecdotalists, therefore, Black adopts a tone of extreme sobriety and caution. The main task which he sets himself is that of assembling evidence. His comments on his material are restrained to the point of eccentricity: in many cases, definite conclusions are drawn only when they can be assumed safely to be unchallengeable. The travellers whom he cites are themselves so ebullient and irrepressible, however, that the flatness of the commentary is, in fact, oddly successful in setting them off. This is a book to which anyone interested in the Grand Tour will turn for a vast range of carefully ordered material, most of it from sources not available to the general reader.</p>

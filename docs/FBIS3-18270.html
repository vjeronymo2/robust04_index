			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with the Assembly's Defense Commission Chairman </F> Jacques Boyon by Jacques Patoz; place and date not given:  "Jacques Boyon: `What Is Implied Is More Important Than What Is  Written"]    [Text] [Patoz] Last Wednesday [23 February] the government  submitted a white paper on defense to the Defense Commissions of  the National Assembly and the Senate . What is your overall  opinion of this document?    [Boyon] Like most of the other deputies who listened to the  prime minister and the defense minister, I was very satisfied  overall with the presentation that was made of the white paper.  In the present context of budgetary stringency, we were fearing  we might end up with a skimpy white paper. We were reassured to  see that a certain number of our national defense objectives  were confirmed. Having said this, drawing up this document was  not the most difficult part of the exercise since its aim was to  define a long-term military policy. This must now be translated  into real figures. We are now waiting to see how the government  will overcome this difficulty.    [Patoz] The white paper confirms the need for nuclear  deterrence, but it does not deal with the issue of resuming  nuclear tests. However, many members of the majority are  declaring themselves in favor of resuming such tests. What are  your feelings in this respect?    [Boyon] As regards the nuclear chapter, the white paper has  left us somewhat unsatisfied. Apparently, they attempted to  evade a number of questions which, within the cohabitation  framework, do not elicit the same response from the government  as they do from the president of the Republic. However, we must  be aware that we have, on the one hand, the white paper's letter  and, on the other, what is implied. Now, these implications are  important, and we feel this was confirmed by the prime  minister's comments.    For my part, I believe it is apparent from everything that  was said that the nuclear deterrent is still the basis of our  defense. I also believe that the government recognizes that our  nuclear arsenal must be modernized to keep pace with the  development of new threats. In my view, the government  reaffirmed -- even though this is not actually spelt out in the  white paper -- the need to resume nuclear testing at the  earliest possible date, in order to complete the development of  the PALEN test simulation system. All in all, it is true that  the white paper does not say much which is new on the nuclear  issue but, frankly, we were not expecting it to do so. In fact,  we are very much aware that the broad guidelines for the  development of our deterrent system will only be set down by the  next president.    [Patoz] As far as arms policy is concerned, the white paper  pronounces itself in favor of basing production on international  cooperation. Do you approve of this formula?    [Boyon] In my view, the white paper is not saying that  France  must give up certain programs, but rather, that it cannot do  everything on its own. The white paper says that the need to  cut back on costs requires cooperative projects to be  undertaken, except in the nuclear field, where sharing is not  possible. I believe this is the way forward. Any other  position would be totally unrealistic.    It is not a question of concentrating on a certain type of  production, and leaving some other type of production to other  countries. We are not saying "we must give up doing this," but  rather "we must do this with others." In the final analysis,  industrialists will be playing a decisive role in determining  how things will be organized.    [Patoz] The white paper seems to signal the beginning of a  certain rapprochement with NATO. Is this not calling into  question one of the great Gaullist principles?    [Boyon] Not at all. Both the white paper and the comments  made by the prime minister confirm that France will remain  outside the integrated military system. If French troops are  deployed, wherever they may be deployed, this will only happen  following a decision of the French Government. What does  constitute more of a novelty -- although, in this respect, the  white paper is not so much innovating as it is recording a fact  -- is that, whenever NATO engages in operations to maintain or  reestablish peace, and if France takes part in them, it is  normal for the defense minister to attend any political meetings  which aim to define the objectives and the framework of such  operations.    At present, there is a dividing line between the NATO bodies  in which France takes part, and those in which it does not take  part. We have simply realized that this dividing line is no  longer in the right place, but we are not erasing it. Rather,  we are moving it so that the defense minister and the chief of  the general staff can take part in discussions whenever this  proves necessary.    [Patoz] Whereas the RPR is inclined to establish a  professional army, the white paper still favors a conscript  army. What is your view of the matter?    [Boyon] The RPR did not declare itself in favor of a  professional army, but rather of professionalizing the army,  which is not exactly the same thing. However, the white paper  does confirm the principle of conscription, but I do not think  the real problem lies here. The problem today is knowing  whether we can maintain conscription in an army which must  become more professional. In fact, we are being told, on the  one hand, that the armed forces will be made smaller and, on the  other, that we will have more professionals within them.  Therefore, there will be fewer conscripts. The question is  therefore the following: Can we manage the national service  machinery -- which is very cumbersome -- in such a way as to  ensure that the principles of universality and equality are  observed, and that the service's civilian sections do not  continue to get hold of the best men, leaving the conscripts  discarded by the civilian service managers to the armed forces?  I am not sure this is possible.    The Defense Commisssion will now have to consider the  national service issue. In fact, it is apparent that the white  paper has proclaimed a principle without first ensuring that the  necessary in-depth studies had been conducted on the  possibilities of implementing it.</p>

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Books: Visions of decay - Fiction CLOCKERS by Richard Price Bloomsbury Pounds 15.99, 599 pages SAINT MUDD by Steve Thayer Viking Pounds 14.99, 383 pages A RED DEATH by Walter Mosley Serpent's Tail Pounds 7.99, 284 pages IF YOU have a vision of a United States that is sinking into an underworld of murder, drug-peddling and corruption from which it has only half-risen, here are three texts to confirm your worst fears. Taken together, they would do nicely as initial set works for a first-year course on the underclass. Just keep them out of Eng. Lit. Richard Price's Clockers takes us into the crumbling tenements of what might be Jersey City, just across from Manhattan. Price is a top screenwriter (The Colour of Money, Sea of Love) whose ability to move and hustle culminated in the pre-publication sale of the rights to Clockers for a reported Pounds 1.9m. The book is too long, but there is little difficulty in following his cinematic dialogue, once you have mastered the idiom. The title is the word for the doomed children who retail drugs; another street word, one that should be more widely used, is 'dis', meaning disrespect. The central characters in Clockers are preoccupied with a need to protect themselves against dis. Rodney, the Champ's middleman, has survived by being both merciless and cunning. He is a well-drawn personality, not easily forgettable. He will murder if he believes someone is dissing him. Strike, the anguished youth who once nearly won a scholarship and a passport out, is the corporal who works one of Rodney's street sites. Price enlists your sympathies on behalf of Strike, but he does it without preaching. Strike's every thought is recorded; his moves are those of a wild animal, trapped in the slums, unable to use his moderate talents in a respectable manner. Rocco, the middle-aged cop who gets it all wrong until the denouement, longs for the world's approbation. Clockers has merit as an eyewitness account of a great social tragedy. You could twist its substance into a metaphor for the hard core of corporate America. As a thriller, it is almost gripping. It should make a lucrative screenplay. What it is not is a great novel. Too many characters drift in and out to no apparent purpose. There are too many set-pieces, clearly contrived. The obvious comparison is with Bonfire of the Vanities, which told a not unconnected story from the wealthy side of Manhattan. Tom Wolfe is an artist; Richard Price a flawed craftsman. In Saint Mudd Steve Thayer sets out to do the same job on St Paul, Minnesota in the 1930s. He tells us it was gangster city, its corruption exposed by a brave newspaper columnist and an eventually courageous editor. Like Richard Price, who haunted the streets he describes, and Walter Mosley, who has plainly done his time in the archives, Thayer did much research for this book. He even offers a set of historical notes at the end, including the date of the death of the great madam, Nina Clifford, who ran St Paul's most prominent brothel. You get the feeling that it is all pretty accurate, without being overwhelmed by its verisimilitude. A more cleverly crafted insight into life outside the American dream is A Red Death, which is without pretension, short, and wholly satisfactory. It is set in and around Watts county, the notorious part of Los Angeles. Walter Mosley's first crime novel, Devil in a Blue Dress (recently re-issued by Pan), was set in the Watts of the late 1940s; this one takes the hero, Easy Rawlins, forward a few years. Rawlins, who hides the fact that he is a small-time landlord, makes his way in the overtly segregated world of pre-civil rights America. He duels with the internal revenue service, the Los Angeles Police Department, and the FBI, but solves the mystery and outsmarts them all in the end. As a bonus you get a subliminal picture of how Watts must have been then for it to become like it is now. This is the best of the trio. If you buy any of them, get this one first.</p>

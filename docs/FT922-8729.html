			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: The value of a name It looks as though the Lloyd's of London insurance market could now have access to limited liability capital within two to three years, much earlier than the Rowland Task Force report expected. Counsel's opinion indicates that a new act of parliament will probably not be necessary to introduce corporate Names, though negotiations with the Department of Trade and Industry and overseas regulators over the solvency implications of this could yet be protracted. With Lloyd's results for 1989 set to make gruesome reading next month, it could be that the much publicised flight of individuals will indeed jeopardise the long-term growth of the market. It would, though, be unwise for Lloyd's hastily to abandon a system that has served it well for nearly 300 years, and not just because of the unwelcome scrutiny that some of the sleepier syndicates would suffer. The reason lies in one explanation of a Hoare Govett survey last week suggesting that since the 1950s Lloyd's has generally produced higher profit margins than leading UK and US insurance companies. The argument is that Lloyd's big advantage is a more stable capital base than the companies, which holds true even through the nightmare years. While the market capitalisation of the five leading UK composites between end-1989 and end-1991 fell from Pounds 11bn to Pounds 6bn, for instance, the Lloyd's market capital contracted by only Pounds 1bn to Pounds 10bn. Part of this is the three-year accounting period, which bars quick exits. Part of it, though, may lie in the psychology of the private investor, who is less given to rushing for the door when the going gets rough. The trick in a business like insurance is to be in a position to take advantage when the cycle turns. Lloyd's could obviously do with some spare corporate capital at the moment, but it might reflect that in the long run, institutions tend to be more fickle investors.</p>

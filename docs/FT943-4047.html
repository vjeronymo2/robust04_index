			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Anyone here seen Alice? I have found some share certificates in the name of Alice Edwards (Holdings) Ltd. Does this company still exist or has it been liquidated? It changed its name to Brigray Group Ltd on June 30 1969. Brigray was wound up in May 1981 and the Inland Revenue approved the negligible value of the ordinary shares during the 1981/82 fiscal year. The Professionals: The minimum portfolio investment column in the Factfile on page V last week referred to a portfolio of equities. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

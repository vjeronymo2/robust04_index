			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Japanese banks upset by slowing of deregulation JAPANESE commercial banks expressed dismay yesterday at the slowing of financial deregulation, which has become a victim of the Tokyo stock market collapse. A package of long-awaited reforms announced yesterday by the Ministry of Finance will keep banks out of stock trading for the indefinite future and ensure that their role in bond markets is limited. Japanese brokers had argued that the collapse of stock prices damaged the industry's health, and that most houses were not fit to compete with banks in the securities markets or to take advantage of opportunities in the banking sector. Under the deregulation plan announced yesterday, the country's 10 trust and long-term credit banks will be able to establish securities subsidiaries from next April to issue but not market convertible and warrant bonds, and to deal in straight bonds. The leading 11 commercial banks will have to wait at least another year for the same, limited privileges, to be reviewed in two to three years by the ministry, which suggested that further reforms would then be announced. Officials at long-term credit banks, the Industrial Bank of Japan, the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan and Nippon Credit Bank, were frustrated by a restriction on the new subsidiaries' dealings with companies for which they are the main bank. While Japanese banks have been made wary of the stock market by the collapse of prices and trading volume over the past three years, they were hoping that the many months of negotiation with finance ministry officials would have brought more gains than were revealed yesterday. The securities houses will be allowed to establish trust banking subsidiaries with greater freedom to deal in investment trusts and currency instruments, but they were denied access to special large-lot securities trusts and special loan trusts in which public funds are often invested. Several Japanese securities houses have indicated that they may not bother to apply for trust banking licences. They are awaiting information from the ministry on the costs of entry to the business and a timetable for the further easing of restrictions. In an attempt to establish a 'fire wall' between the banks and their new subsidiaries, the ministry indicated that board members of the subsidiaries will not be allowed to return to the parent company.</p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PENTAGON SPENDING AND CLOSING BASES  </P> <P> The shameful story is a continuing record of waste by the previous  Administration.  </P> <P> Imagine buying 52,000 of an item that the military uses a whole 4 a year!  Meanwhile, this Administration has cut back on school lunches. Burbank High  School, sorely in need of renovation for many years, lacks the money to do it.  This list could go on and on. This disgraceful situation is just one of the  many indignities suffered by the poor and the middle class these last few  years. And yet the people who perpetrate these stupidities seem to escape,  often to an affluent life. Where is the justice?  </P> <P> LEN ZIRALDO  </P> <P> West Hills  </P></p>

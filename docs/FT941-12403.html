			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Survey of the World's Young People (6): Commitment to support youthful ideas and energy - The Prince's Youth Business Trust Since its birth eight years ago, the Prince's Youth Business Trust has helped almost 20,000 young people in the UK. (In a survey on youth it is worth pointing out that its president is not Prince, the American pop star, but HRH The Prince of Wales.) To do what? Mainly, to set up businesses. Some 15,000 have so far been set up or expanded with the help of the Trust (PYBT). Help comes in the shape of soft loans, grants, expansion loans, training, and marketing and business advice from a nationwide network of 4,567 advisers, all aimed at young people (18-29) with a good idea but no means to finance it. But this help is only forthcoming if the idea is viable, if the applicant has the necessary initiative and commitment, and if the money is unavailable from other sources. The Trust makes plain its commitment to help those in this age group who were born without some of the advantages that a middle-class, public school educated, budding entrepreneur perhaps might take for granted. It sees its core market as the unemployed from inner cities and areas of 'rural deprivation', the minorities, the disabled, and young ex-offenders. It calls this its 'mission,' which gives some indication of the zeal to improve that pervades the Trust's St James' Square headquarters in London (where it lives rent-free, courtesy of Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman of both the Trust and the Grand Metropolitan food group). Take, for example, Anastasis Soleas. Before he made contact with the Trust he had been made redundant; he was unemployed and broke. A Pounds 5,000 loan and a Pounds 1,500 grant from PYBT later, he set up a business making Mediterranean snacks such as houmous and taramasalata that 'taste just like the way my Mum made it for us at home.' He expects turnover to reach Pounds 24,000 after his first year of trading. Michael Evans and Peter Gotch were among those who spotted an opportunity but lacked the means to develop the idea. When the government made it compulsory for all motor cyclists to have some training before setting out on the road, they knew that training courses for motor cylists had to be a business winner. They started with a Pounds 5,000 PYBT loan and now operate from seven centres. But the going is not all easy. The PYBT's funds are limited, and its dependence on the private sector to match public contributions pound for pound means that it is especially vulnerable at times of economic difficulty. After all, charitable donations are hard to justify when shareholders are baying for a distribution of profits. The Trust describes itself as the largest business consultancy in the world which pays its consultants nothing - and estimates that it gives away Pounds 5m a year in free advice to the supported businesses. Furthermore the Department of Employment regards the Trust as wholly cost-effective in that it costs less to help a business through the Trust than it does to pay unemployment benefit. John Pervin, the Trust's chief executive, explains that things have been hard financially since the Prince launched a Pounds 40m appeal on his 40th birthday in 1988. Though the government, with all-party support, agreed to match all the money raised from the private sector, the appeal has to some extent fallen prey to recessionary pressures in the UK. Donations fell to Pounds 3.2m in the year to June 1993 - they came to more than Pounds 4m the previous year. This means that the Trust's future is under serious threat. Its success rate is by any standards 'amazingly constant', with over two-thirds of its businesses still trading after two to three years, but 'We've only got enough money in the kitty for another couple of years,' says Mr Pervin. Though Pounds 40m has been promised by government, only Pounds 23m is due to come in - because the government will not match contributions if the private sector fails to make them. Since covenanting money and paying it to the Trust, a dismaying number of supportive companies have gone into liquidation. As a result, income from the 1988 appeal, as a proportion of total resources, is diminishing fast, while the numbers needing help are rising all the time. Nearly half the number of unemployed people in Britain are under the age of 30 - a figure which has risen by 150 per cent in two years. 'We are reorganising so that we can expand our fundraising,' said Mr Pervin, who denies being overly disappointed that the Trust's financial livelihood is threatened by the downturn. The fact that the Prince of Wales is involved is bound to be a help through the difficulties that lie ahead. He has described the PYBT as 'a remarkable achievement' for a 'risk business.' He is sure to urge companies to look generously on the Trust despite financial stringency, on the grounds that some of the young people the PYBT helps are, after all, bound to rise to the top in industry or commerce themselves.</p>

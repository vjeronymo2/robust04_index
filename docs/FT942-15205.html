			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / PM's secret pals forced on display Mr John Major may be increas-ingly friendless at Westminster, but he still has some well-heeled, if secretive, friends in the business world. They struck a bizarre blow for the embattled prime minister yesterday, paying Pounds 4,212 for a two-column advertisement in The Times to honour the second anniversary of his 1992 general election victory. The advertisement consisted of a reprint of last Saturday's Financial Times editorial comment on Mr Major  - which cost the well-heeled supporters a further Pounds 350 plus VAT in syndication fees. But the stunt backfired, mainly because of the businessmen's attempts to hide their identity, signing the advertisement 'the friends of the prime minister'. The advertisement was placed by Mr Alan Gold, a London public relations consultant, for a group called Friends of the Conservative Party, based in Fortune Green Road, north-west London. The building's occupants, a professional photographer and a firm of chartered accountants, denied all knowledge of the group. Eventually, it emerged that the advertisement was paid for by Mr Benjamin Perl, a businessman who runs Foframes, a photograph frames manufacturer in Mr Major's Huntingdon constituency. Mr Perl is understood to be a friend and admirer of the prime minister. Associates said he felt Mr Major was being badly treated by MPs and parts of the press. But political observers were mystified by his choice of the FT leader as support for Mr Major. Some thought it was a hoax, partly because of a series of spelling mistakes which did not occur in the original. The leader credited Mr Major with achievements on inflation, Ireland and Europe, but also noted the humiliation of Britain's ejection from the European exchange rate mechanism, and the shortcomings of the back-to-basics and law and order campaigns. It concluded: 'Mr Major will always lack charisma and his last two years have been unfortunate, occasionally inept.' A statement issued through Mr Gold said that Mr Perl and his associates 'read and respect both The Times and the FT, but felt that the FT's editorial deserved a wider readership'. It added: 'The fact that that the editorial gave a fair and balanced viewpoint in no way diminishes their unqualified support for and admiration of Mr Major.' The prime minister appeared less than impressed by Mr Perl's efforts. Downing Street said he was 'bemused and surprised' by the advertisement.</p>

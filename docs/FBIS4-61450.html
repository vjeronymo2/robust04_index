			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F> Mikhail Melnik]    [Text] Kiev, 5 May -- "There is no crisis in Ukraine.  There is a slump in production. Those who talk of crisis are  simply following fashion," Ukraine's acting Prime Minister  Yukhym Zvyahilskyy said at a news conference today. He backed  up his viewpoint with facts. Inflation, which last year took  the catastrophic form of hyperinflation reaching 91 percent in  December, was 5.7 percent in March of this year. Prices for  basic foodstuffs are almost static. The gradual reduction of  bank credit interest rates has begun. The decision that hard  currency must be sold at a regulated exchange rate has made it  possible for a proportion of subsidies and allowances which  exporters received from the state to be recovered and for  inflation on the domestic market to be curbed.    Yukhym Zvyahilskyy said that the government has moved away  from general discussions about the need to return all hard  currency earned from exports from Ukraine to specific measures.  Checks have been carried out to ascertain whether the hard  currency receipts of all exporters have been declared fully and  promptly. A control system "customs-bank" has been devised and  is being introduced. This gives a real picture of hard currency  from exports coming into Ukraine literally every day.    And we are doing this at accelerated rates, since Ukraine in  January alone failed to receive more than $14 million, about 10  billion Russian rubles, and also large sums of other currencies,  the acting Prime Minister stressed. But today we know by name  everyone who failed to return currency on time, and we shall  take the toughest measures against them.    Measures are being taken to ensure complete and punctual  payment of taxes into the budget. In January to April alone,  evaded taxes were recovered and fines were imposed in the amount  of 1.441 trillion karbovantsi. This work is continuing. In  this way, one of the reasons for the delay in remittance of pay  to the budget-financed organizations and in financing of social  programs is being eliminated in particular.    A fundamentally new mechanism of settling accounts with the  producers of agricultural output has make it possible, without  resorting to emission of money, to supply agriculture with fuel  and lubricants, seed, and fertilizer at acceptable prices. This  in turn has made it possible to carry out the spring field work  without substantial disruption and lay the foundations of the  future harvest.    Yukhym Zvyahilskyy considers that these "measures are  ensuring control of the economic situation not by means of  vulgar administrative state interference in everything, but by  means of economic levers." Now the opportunity has appeared to  tackle nonpayments, one of the major problems to date. The main  essence of these measures consists in lowering enterprises' tax  burden, preparing for the transition to tax on profits and not  on incomes, targeting support for those who produce output for  which there is a market, liberalizing exports and the protection  of home producers, and also lowering the bank rates.    Yukhym Zvyahilskyy announced one other piece of news: The  decision has been made to increase the regulated rate of the  karbovanets to 13,100 karbovantsi to one U.S. dollar.</p>

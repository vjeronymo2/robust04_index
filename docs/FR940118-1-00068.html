The Secretary proposes to remove the latter regulations from title 34 of the Code of Regulations, revise them, and add them to the former regulations, as a new subpart E. The proposed regulations would revise the procedures and criteria under which a foreign institution establishes eligibility to apply to participate in the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) programs if the institution is comparable to an eligible institution of higher education located in the United States. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before March 4, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  All comments concerning these proposed regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be addressed to Ms. Joyce R.

L. 102&hyph;325) to parts B, G, and H of title IV of the HEA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 492(a) required the Secretary to convene regional meetings to gain public input on the content of proposed regulations. Participants at those meetings were to include individuals and representatives of the groups involved in the student financial assistance programs authorized under title IV of the HEA, such as students, legal assistance organizations that represent students, institutions of higher education, guaranty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies, lenders, secondary markets, loan servicers, guaranty agency servicers, and collection agencies. During the meetings, the Secretary was to provide for a comprehensive discussion and exchange of information concerning the implementation of the amendments made by Public Law 102&hyph;325 to parts B, G, and H, and was to take information received at the meetings into account in the development of proposed regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsequent to the regional meetings, the Secretary was to draft and submit regulations implementing the amendments made to parts B, G, and H to a negotiated rulemaking process. Participants in the negotiations process were to be chosen by the Secretary from individuals nominated by groups participating in the regional meetings and were to reflect the diversity and sizes of organizations providing financial aid services to both local areas and national markets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with these requirements, the Secretary convened four regional meetings to discuss issues raised by the 1992 Amendments to the Higher Education Act, including the eligibility of foreign institutions to apply to participate in the FFEL programs. The primary issues considered in those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meetings were: the general criteria needed for the Secretary to determine the eligibility of institutions outside the United States, how the Secretary should determine whether a foreign institution is comparable to an eligible institution of higher education in the United States, and the appropriate method for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculating examination ``pass rates'' of students or graduates of foreign graduate medical schools. (These pass rates are among a number of statutory requirements for determining the eligibility of foreign graduate medical schools.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Meetings were held in New York, New York; San Francisco, California; Atlanta, Georgia; and Kansas City, Missouri, during the month of September 1992. Participants in the meetings were invited to nominate individuals to serve as negotiators in the negotiated rulemaking sessions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Taking into account views expressed at the regional meetings, the Department prepared draft proposed regulations on the 1992 Amendments. The draft regulations were negotiated during the negotiated rulemaking sessions. The negotiators reached general agreement on the content of the draft regulations relating to the eligibility of foreign institutions to apply to participate in the FFEL programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A summary of the significant changes made by these proposed regulations to current regulations follows.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG /FTAG --></p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Moderate turnout in Irish referendum on Maastricht treaty Clement weather and a religious holiday in Ireland yesterday helped produce a moderate turnout in the country's referendum on the Maastricht treaty on European union, writes Tim Coone. The result is expected about midday today. An estimated 50-55 per cent of the 2.5m eligible voters went to the polls. The turnout was well short of the record 71 per cent in 1972, when Ireland voted to join the EC. But it was greater than the 44 per cent turnout in the last referendum in 1987, which was called to ratify the Single European Act and which was passed by a 70:30 margin. A high turnout was thought likely to produce a 'yes' vote to ratify the treaty. Party workers reported a late strong turnout by farmers, who are generally in favour of Maastricht. Polling in urban working class areas was reported to be lower than average, as was interest among young voters. There is no tradition of exit polls at polling stations in Ireland to provide a guide to the outcome.</p>

			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OTHER COMMENTARY / EXCERPTS;  </P> <P> IS WORLD READY FOR GERMANY?  </P> <P> Germans are making nuisances of themselves by moving swiftly and peacefully  toward unification, thereby upsetting diplomats who prefer the familiarity of  the status quo.  </P> <P> The Germans have been called a perpetually dissatisfied people who have a  yesterday and a tomorrow but no today. The impermanence, even unreality, of the  postwar present has been apparent in the defensive, reassuring slogan, "Bonn is  not Weimar." Bonn is not even Bonn -- not really the capital of Germany. By  being so provincial, it is ostentatiously provisional: It is the capital until  Berlin can be.  </P> <P> It will be before long. Chancellor Helmut Kohl has a reputation as a plodder,  but he has seized this moment to move toward the end of the postwar era. And  many people see in this movement the reappearance of dangerous German  volatility and vitality.  </P> <P> Volatility? Germans are only seeking rights, including self-determination, that  the West's civic religion teaches are inallienable. Political light years ago  (last May), a NATO summit communique reaffirmed the hope that "the German  people" would regain "unity through self-determination." In the distant future  (say, 1992) that may happen. That will knock into a cocked hat (where it  belongs) the banality of "Europe '92" -- Brussels as the center of the  universe, national sovereignties surrendered to Eurocrats.  </P> <P> European freedom is being enlarged because history is running against Brussels.  (And is running for Margaret Thatcher, and also for a statesman whose vision of  Europe may be vindicated in the 1990s, Charles de Gaulle.) Quickened  nationalisms may be compatible with a "broader" Europe of economic unity but  not a "deeper" unity of political integration.  </P> <P> If Europe's future belongs to producers, not warriors, that future may be made  for -- and by -- Germany.  </P></p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Books: Troubled tales GERRY ADAMS: SELECTED WRITINGS Brandon Pounds 7.95, 316 pages There is something enigmatic - many people would use a stronger word - about Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader. What is really going on behind that well-trimmed beard? Most of us have forgotten Adams's voice, too, since British law demanded that his broadcast words be dubbed. Instead we have - quite possibly to Adams's advantage - the soothing sounds of professional actors. Although most of them have appeared elsewhere, these reminiscences, short stories and political essays could not be more timely. Anyone remotely gripped by the possibility of peace in Northern Ireland following the IRA ceasefire of August 31 should read these pages, if not for their exculpatory logic then for the tone of voice beneath. Adams writes fluently and observantly, even if in his scenes of working-class Catholic life the dialogue sometimes strikes the reader as artificially rehashed. He displays a hard-edged compassion for the silent poor, the old and the down-and-out. Occasionally sentimental, these are quite clearly moral tales - and the moral is usually political. An old woman is told by a keen young parish priest to choose between her politics and her religion; an unmarried brother and sister fall out over the rightness of armed resistance. Yet there is also a portrait of a 'good' Orangeman. The unionists could do with so gifted an apologist. In the polemical pieces - particularly those explaining his political views and justifying the IRA's terrorism - the less humane voice of Gerry Adams comes through. It is the hectoring sound of 1960s-inspired revolutionary socialism and class struggle. Northern Ireland is a 'colonial statelet'; it is a police state practising South African apartheid; bombing and murder are 'physical force politics'. Adams says he deeply regrets the deaths and injuries caused by The Troubles. He talks about 'considerable moral problems in relation to armed struggle.' No doubt he means it, as he means the rest. But has he a clue how this sounds to people outside? The last essay, written this year, manages to be both uncompromising and ambivalent: 'It is desirable in practice that the consent, or assent, of as many unionists as possible should be obtained to the steps that would be practically required to bring about the ending of partition and establishing a united Ireland.' No wonder Westminster cannot read him. Are Gerry Adams and his followers now ready to settle for something short of the unification of Ireland? Here you may read and judge for yourself.</p>

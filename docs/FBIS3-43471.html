The magazine, which is to serve as a forum for people of  African descent, was launched by the former education minister,  Professor Babatunde Fafunwa. Correspondent Anne Aka covered the  launching.    [Begin recording] [Aka] Prof. Fafunwa, while launching the  magazine, called on those present to subscribe to it.    [Fafunwa] I am very very pleased to state that this magazine  [words indistinct].    [Aka] The publisher, Professor Munagi, said that the  publication of the magazine was to establish a medium to tell  the African story through the African perspective.    [Munagi] As a forum of all people of African descent, we are  determined to bridge the communication gap between our peoples  on the continent, between Africans on the continent and those  abroad [words indistinct], and between African peoples and the  rest of humankind.    [Aka] The information and culture minister [Professor Jerry  Gana], who was chairman on the occasion, was represented by his  special assistant, Dr. Bassa Musa. Prof. Gana said that the  magazine came at a time when Nigeria's voice as the leader of  the black world must be heard in the world. He expressed the  hope that the substance of the magazine would serve as example  to the Nigerian media in how to crusade for a viewpoint without  precipitating anarchy and violence, particularly now that  Nigeria is passing through its most trying period in its history.    [Musa] This administration recognizes the vital role of the  media in nation building. It seems competing areas of friction  notwithstanding, I believe we can jointly work out a meaningful  partnership for the overall benefit of our great country.    [Aka] The magazine was reviewed by Dr. Ruben Agbatsie of THE  GUARDIAN newspaper. The AFRICAN WORLD, formally known and  called THE AFRICAN COMMENTARY, was published in 1989 in the  United States. It is a general interest magazine aimed at  bridging the communication gap between Africans and the rest of  the world. It has its contributors made up of eminent African  writers, scholars, and writers of African descent. The  launching was attended by the chief of naval staff, Rear Admiral  Allison Madueke, and the representative of the inspector general  of police, Mr. Abdulahi Ziga, the Jamaican high commissioner,  Mr. Dudley Thompson, American ambassador to Nigeria, Mr. Walter  Carrington, and people from all walks of life.

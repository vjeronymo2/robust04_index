			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Hotels push up profits by tight cost control TIGHT COST control enabled UK hotels to increase their operating profits by 3.3 per cent last year, in spite of a slight fall in revenues and only a small increase in occupancy, a survey to be published by leisure consultants Pannell Kerr Forster this week shows. London hotels increased operating profits by 10.9 per cent, aided by cuts in administrative and property maintenance costs. Mr Andrew Duncan, a director of the consultancy, said hotels would have to increase maintenance spending on their properties in future years to compensate for cost-cutting during the recession. He said, however, that he did not think hotels had reduced maintenance spending to the point where it had damaged the quality of their properties. Although London hotels increased marketing expenditure last year, English provincial hotels had cut back. Mr Duncan said reductions in marketing expenditure during a downturn were misguided, as hotels should be attempting to increase market share. The survey of 229 hotels found that UK occupancy rose 2.6 per cent to 62 per cent last year. Average room-rates fell 4.4 per cent Pounds 56.55, however. Annual revenue per available room fell 0.3 per cent to Pounds 24,990. Reduced administrative, marketing and maintenance costs lifted operating income per available room by 3.3 per cent to Pounds 7,956. In London average revenues per available room increased 2.6 per cent to Pounds 33,544, although spending on beverages fell 3.9 per cent. Operating profit per room was Pounds 12,301. Average occupancy in London rose to 70.4 per cent from 65.2 per cent in 1991. The average room-rate fell 5.3 per cent to Pounds 80.92. Operating profit at English provincial hotels fell 2.4 per cent to Pounds 6,319, while profits in Wales fell 8.8 per cent to Pounds 4,784 per available room. Operating profits in Scotland rose 3.9 per cent to Pounds 7,186. UK Trends, Pannell Kerr Forster, 78 Hatton Garden, London EC1N 8JA. Pounds 250.</p>

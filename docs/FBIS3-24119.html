In the final analysis  this fact and the country's convenient location determined the  clash of the neighboring states in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan's  former president Abulfaz Elchibei is interviewed by MN observer  Sanobar Shermatova.    When you were president, Mr. Elchibey, you tried to  turn the country's political course away from Russia and towards  Turkey and the West. Did you realize that the consequences of  this course could be very serious for you?    To some extent yes. I did not think that I would hold on for  a whole year and allowed myself at the most 3-4 months. At the  same time I pinned my hopes on Russian democracy and the West. I  wanted to believe that Azerbaijan would begin to speak with  Russia not as a slave does with his master, but in the language  of civilized states.    What was your top priority during your presidency?    It was to build the economic basis for Azerbaijan's  independence and to end the war. These aims were mutually  interconnected. There was, for instance, the agreement with a  consortium of nine oil companies to lay a pipeline. According to  one proposal, the oil pipeline would pass on Armenia's  territory. This was better than running it through Iran, for it  would be 18 kilometers shorter, and Western companies prefer to  be partners with Armenia, not Iran. We had contacts with the  Armenian leadership. They were agreeable, but said frankly:  "Neither you nor we will be allowed to do this." This variant  would have enabled Armenia to get a profit of 100 million  dollars, which would have ended the war. But Russia had its own  plans for Azerbaijani oil. It proposed to lay the pipeline along  its territory and transport it through Novorossiisk port, or to  transport it through a "Friendship" pipeline.    The territory of Azerbaijan has been historically an  arena of rivalry between Russia, Turkey and Iran. Your  pro-Turkish orientation is cited as one of the regions why you  lost power.    Yes. We Azerbaijanis have a special attitude toward Turkey.  Our kinship is based on the language, common Turkic roots and  secular mentality. Besides that, Turkey to us is a window to the  West, to high technologies, and to economic prosperity. Why  should we reject all this?    It is interesting to note that when you were in power,  Azerbaijan's No. 1 foreign economic partner was not Turkey but  Iran, a country which you criticized sharply. Britain was in  second place and Russia in third. What caused your negative  attitude to Iran, with which Azerbaijan has a common border and  maintains close economic relations?    There are 20-25 million Azerbaijanis living in Iran, who  don't have a single national school. Not only are Azerbaijani  national sentiments being trampled on, but their human rights as  well. Can we tolerate the oppression of our brothers? When I  came out against the oppression of Azerbaijanis in Iran, I did  so not as president but as a member of the People's Front whose  program includes solidarity with oppressed brothers. I believe  that they will be free.    Was there any reaction to your statements against  Iran?    Naturally there was. The Iranian intelligence service worked  very actively in our republic. We felt this. The work was done  in two ways: they collected intelligence data and distributed  religious propaganda. Azerbaijanis, like Persians, belong to the  Shi'i branch of Islam, and the promotion of the way of life  adopted in Iran after Khomeini came to power was conducted in  many Azerbaijani mosques. Iran's parliament allocated 100  million dollars to conduct propaganda in Azerbaijan. We had  information that money was distributed among young people who  expressed a wish to study at religious educational  establishments. It was also used to construct mosques and  support pro-Iranian religious leaders. We knew all this, but I  did not pay serious attention to these facts. Azerbaijanis are  mainly secular people, which is one factor impeding  "Iranization." Another important factor is that, as commonly  happens, money allocated for propaganda of Iranian values simply  ends up lining someone's pockets. The Iranians allotted money  for the construction of three mosques in Baku and Gyandzha, but  the mosques have not yet been built. I think that the desire for  profits will ruin many of these initiatives.    Do you intend to come back to power, Mr. Elchibey? If  you do, do you exclude having Russia and Iran as close political  partners?    I believe that the Popular Front, allied with other  democratic forces, will come to power sooner or later; it is  only a question of time. I stand for close economic ties with  neighbors, including Russia which, I think, will in time  recognize our right to democracy and independence in  foreign-policy matters. I would also like to find states in the  West and Israel who could help balance the strong Armenian lobby.</p>

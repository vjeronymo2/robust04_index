			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime minister and </F> national unification minister, by Yu Sung-u; place and date not  given]    [Text] [Yu] On 26 February, North Korea and the United  States reached an agreement that will enable the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspections to begin in Pyongyang.    Earlier this year in its report, the National Unification  Board [NUB] envisaged that a breakthrough would be made into the  nuclear issue sometime this year and, in turn, North-South  relations would reach a turning point. Do you think such  prospect has hit the target?    [Yi] I think it is fortunate that the North Korean nuclear  issue is taking the road to peaceful settlement through dialogue  and negotiation. However, this is only a first step and,  depending on North Korea's attitude, there are various obstacles  we have to overcome. Accordingly, the time is not ripe to have  an upbeat view. Furthermore, we should remember that North  Korea, in the New York contact, opposed until the end to  committing itself in writing to the issue of realizing an  exchange of special envoys.    [Yu] In a news conference marking his one year in office,  President Kim Yong-sam said that he will push for an  inter-Korean summit. Could you tell us about the background  behind his proposal and do you think it is likely to come true?    [Yi] I think President Kim's recent proposal goes one step  further from his previous stance that the summit would only be  possible after the nuclear problem was solved. In other words,  he showed a flexible and converted view on the issue. This  reflects his will to promote North-South relations more  positively on his own initiative at a time when the  international efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue  are heading toward a positive direction. Nonetheless, this has a  condition that "only if it would help deter North Korea's  nuclear development program." So, there is not a fundamental  change in the government's stance stressing the solution of the  nuclear problem above anything else.    [Yu] Sparked by the president's proposal on the summit, will  there be a change in the special envoys' duties and the purpose  of their exchange? There is speculation that the duties of  special envoys will be detached from the nuclear issue and that  they will only discuss the issue regarding preparations for the  summit. Could you tell us more about this?    [Yi] As I have mentioned earlier, the government's stance  stressing the solution of the nuclear problem above anything  else has not changed. The president's will to go to a summit  does not necessarily mean that the duties and tasks of special  envoys would change. Accordingly, the nuclear issue should be  dealt as a priority if the exchange of special envoys was  realized before the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks.  Along with this, I expect that the issues for promoting  North-South relations, including the high-level talks and the  operation of joint committee of each field, and the holding of  summit will be discussed.    [Yu] Do you think there will be visible results in  improving South-North relations during the exchange of South and  North special envoys?    [Yi] We hope that discussions on ways to solve the issue of  separated families can be held first. At the recent U.S.-North  Korea contact, both sides agreed to hold the third round of  high- level talks on 21 March. I believe that the exchange of  South and North special envoys must be achieved before 21 March.  It will take two to three weeks for the IAEA inspection team to  finish the inspections, and another two to three weeks for it to  analyze the results. I believe that a state of flux may continue  even when the third round of talks is in progress. I hope that  during this process both sides will want to meet with each other  and reach an agreement on the issue of holding the summit talks.    [Yu] In what form do you plan to propose to the North Korean  side regarding the separated families issue, which is one of the  most important tasks the government is promoting?    [Yi] In connection with this issue, authorities in the past  have repeated revealed that "it will be promoted first of all,"  and that "it will be promoted actively." No one said that the  separated families issue will "be linked with other pending  issues." There must be concrete and visible results regarding  the separated families issue in the process of exchanging South  and North special envoys I believe that reunion of separated  families will be the first step in South-North reconciliation  and exchange. However, we do not want to put a heavy burden on  the North Korean side. I believe we can wait somewhat on the  issue of exchanging visits between the South and North.  Nevertheless, I hope that we will be able to at least confirm  the life or death of our families, establish an office to  exchange letters and a reunion office in Panmunjom, and work so  that a limited number of people can meet with each other. This  has already been proposed to the North Korean side.    [Yu] What other visible measures are there for us to take,  other than the issue of separated families, in trying to induce  North Korea to open up and show change?    [Yi] It can be human exchanges such as exchange of religious  organizations and cultural organizations. If meetings between  authorities such as the exchange of special envoys of the South  and North start sometime in March, I believe that the exchange  of people in the social and cultural fields will begin. The  government has received applications for exchange between  religious organizations such as the Chondoist in March and for  the exchange between women organizations sometime in April.    [Yu] Some people point out that inflexible principles that  linked the nuclear issue with economic cooperation have to be  reconsidered.    [Yi] We are of the principle to flexibly deal with the  economic cooperation issue in accordance with the progress in  the North Korea's nuclear issue. The stage-by-stage scenario on  economic cooperation is achieved by three stages taking into  consideration the overall situation of the South-North  relations. If we reach the third stage, I believe that the  atmosphere will be that we will be able to solve all South-North  issues. The success or failure regarding this matter is wholly  dependent on the attitude of North Korea.    [Yu] Was there a concrete message indicating that North  Korea wanted our economic cooperation?    [Yi] Up until now invitations sent by North Korea's  responsible people to our businesses amount to 40 cases.  Proposals came from North Korea to our prominent businesses to  establish plants in such and such a place, and to take part in  investment in infrastructure in the Najin-Sonbong area.    [Yu] Can you tell me your ambition and plan during your term  of office?    [Yi] Economist Max Singer wrote in his book entitled,  "Passage to a Human World," that Korea will have the second  largest gross national product in the world in the year 2064,  under the condition that reunification is achieved. I believe  in this. I will work so that all the people can restore moral  health, and persistently make efforts to foster democracy.  Also, I will sincerely work so that the we can welcome with  emotion the opening of the "era of putting into practice the  joint declaration on denuclearization."</p>

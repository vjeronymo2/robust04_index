			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Why Has the U.S. President Met the Dalai Lama </F> at This Time?"]    [Text] U.S. President Clinton and Vice President Gore met  the Dalai Lama in the White House on Thursday [28 April], and  they allegedly discussed Tibet's religious and cultural rights.    People will ask: Why has Clinton met the Dalai Lama at this  time?    Let us consult a White House statement: "The United States  cares about these problems, especially at a time when the United  States is examining the conditions for extending China's  most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status."    That is the reason! The U.S. Government once again wants to  link trade with politics, treating Tibet's religious and  cultural situations as a condition for extending China's MFN  trading status.    Concerning the issue of extending China's MFN trading  status,  the U.S. Government truly has an endless list of things to link  to it. Yesterday it wanted to link it to China's lawful handling  of the cases of Han Dongfang and Wei Jingsheng; today it wants  to link it to Tibet's religious and cultural conditions  described by the Dalai Lama; and tomorrow and the day after  tomorrow, perhaps, it will want to link it to Beijing's lawful  handling of some criminals who jeopardize the country's security  and interests. The United States likes to comment unduly on the  internal affairs of other countries, and give instructions and  orders; it has frequently used MFN status to harass and bully  other countries. This is a total violation of the basic norms  of international relations as well as an embodiment of power  politics.    Not long ago, a British Parliament's Foreign Affairs  Committee report attacked the human rights situation in Tibet,  and said that the Foreign Office was "deeply concerned" about  Tibet's "human rights" as well as "culture and religion," and  that "the world cannot turn a blind eye to the Tibet problem."  Was it because the Dalai Lama was "encouraged" by this British  report that he immediately rushed to the United States to  "report" to Clinton? Or was it because Clinton wanted to  coordinate with Britain and summoned the Dalai Lama for a  "discussion?" If that was the case, then what tacit  coordination!    Tibet is an inseparable part of China. Under the leadership  of the CPC, it cast off its extremely backward feudal serf  system and embarked upon a broad and bright road of freedom,  happiness, and modernization; its society and economy has  experienced earth-shaking changes, and its human rights  situation has completely improved.    Respect for and protection of religious freedom is a basic  policy of the Chinese Government. Departments at various levels  in Tibet have seriously implemented this policy and have won  praise from the broad masses of monks and people. During the  period of the National People's Congress in March, a Living  Buddha from Xigaze's Zhaxilhunbo Monastery said at a news  conference for Chinese and foreign reporters: "The policy of  freedom of religious beliefs currently practiced in Tibet is  protected by the constitution. In recent years, Tibet has spent  200 million yuan to repair its monasteries. At present, Tibet  has more than 1,400 monasteries, which basically satisfy the  Buddha-worshipping activities of the people in the localities."  Whoever has visited Tibet can tell you that everywhere one can  see long narrow flags with Buddhist Scripture written on them  hung by believers, piled up Buddhist stacks, and -- both inside  and outside the well-known monasteries -- crowds of believers  who kowtow, turn the Buddhist wheels, and come for pilgrimage.    Education and culture are developing very rapidly in Tibet.  The state has invested more than 1.1 billion yuan in developing  education in Tibet. The government pays all the tuition fees  for Tibetan students, from the time when they enter primary  schools to the time they graduate from universities. Some  primary and middle school students of Tibetan nationality are  also provided with clothing, food, and accommodations. The fine  traditions and culture in Tibet have been protected and have  been able to develop. The Tibetan language is used throughout  the region, Tibet's cultural relics are thoroughly protected,  and its traditional customs are widely respected. Modern  cultures and facilities are constantly coming into Tibet, going  to the households of many Tibetan compatriots.    There is a world of difference between the new Tibet and the  old one. No one can deny this.    It has been more than three decades now since the Dalai Lama  fled the country. With the purpose of splitting the motherland,  he has ignored the facts, fabricated lies, attacked China's  Tibet policy, slandered the human rights situation in Tibet,  instigated and planned disturbances in the Tibetan region, and  vigorously preached "Tibetan independence." He has not changed  his deeds after being persuaded repeatedly; rather, he has  intensified his efforts. Now he has met Clinton. Can we  believe that he has not slandered and created rumors about  Tibet's religious and cultural conditions in front of Clinton?  How pitiful if a U.S. President were to pick up several chicken  feathers (lies) from the Dalai Lama and view them as tokens of  authority for attacking China, or as a reference for when he  decides whether to extend China's MFN trading status!    According to a REUTER report, despite repeated explanations  and objections by the Chinese Government, the U.S. side still  arranged for its President and vice president to meet the Dalai  Lama. This indicates that the United States has drifted away  from its commitment to regard Tibet as a part of China and has  trampled upon the basic norm of "not interfering in the internal  affairs of other countries" when handling international  relations.    It goes without saying that businessmen in the United States  are generally optimistic about the Chinese market. They are  demanding stronger economic cooperation with China and an  unconditional extension of its MFN trading status. If those in  power in the United States ignore the wishes of the commercial  circles and the overall interests of their country, and take the  Dalai Lama's lies as a reference when deciding whether to extend  China's MFN trading status, then -- as asserted by Wu Yi,  minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation -- "MFN  status is two-sided; if the United States revokes China's MFN  status, then China can also revoke the United States' MFN  status. If a confrontation arises between China and the United  States over MFN status, neither side will be a winner."</p>

			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] HOUSING STATISTICS--The Bolivian  Government has promised to build 17,500 houses by August 1994 to  reach the goal established by the Ministry of Human  Development's plan. The project will be financed by  international organizaitons including the Inter-American  Development Bank which is negotiating $45 million in credits for  this purpose. The money is to be administered by the National  Housing Fund (FONVI). [Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS 7 Nov]    The nation's need for more adequate housing was documented  in  the 1992 National Population and Housing Census which revealed  that 50 percent of heads of households did not own their own  homes and that the number of homeowners has only increased 3  percent in the past 16 years. During this period, the number of  houses doubled in urban areas but rose only 18 percent in rural  areas, suggesting increased migration to the cities. The  country's main urban centers- -La Paz, Santa Cruz, Cochabamba,  Potosi, and Oruro--contain 89 percent of urban housing.    According to official data there are 1,692,567 single family  dwellings in the country and 8,575 collective dwelling units  (hospitals, jails, barracks, hotels, convents, etc.). Other  figures reveal that 41 percent of Bolivian single family  dwellings are overcrowded with rooms shared by three or more  people. The situation is exacerbated in urban areas especially  in the eastern departments of Beni, Santa Cruz, and Pando.  Besides overcrowding, 46 percent of Bolivian households lack  access to potable water, 57 percent do not have basic sanitary  services, and 45 percent do not have electricity. Most of the  households that lack access to potable water are in Pando, Beni,  Potosi, and Chuquisaca Departments. [La Paz PRESENCIA 13, 14  Nov]    EDUCATION REFORM, STATISTICS--Vice President Victor Hugo  Cardenas announced that the educational reform plan will be  launched in 1994 with initial financing of $150 million from the  Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank. Dr. Enrique  Ipina, undersecretary for education and culture in the Ministry  of Human Development, highlighted the main points of the plan  which is being elaborated by the Technical Support Team for  Educational Reform (ETARE). ETARE compiled the following  literacy and educational statistics to justify the need for this  comprehensive reform "unique to Latin America."     -  20 percent of Bolivians have never attended school and are  totally illiterate.    -  30 percent of adults are functionally  illiterate.    -  68 percent of illiterate Bolivians are women.    -  70  percent of illiterate Bolivians live in the countryside.    -  60  percent of rural children enroll in school. Of this figure, 70  percent never make it past the first year, with only 1.4 percent  of male children and 0.7 percent of female children finishing  secondary school.    -  87 percent of urban children attend school. Of  this number, 31 percent finish primary school.    -  26 percent of  urban female children who entered primary school finish  secondary school.       There are 67,555 teachers in Bolivia. Of these, 40,786 (60  percent) are in the cities, and 26,769 (40 percent) are in the  countryside.     -  59 percent of teachers (40,409) teach primary school.    -  15.4  percent (10,426) teach secondary school.    -  20.3 percent (13,781)  are intermediate school teachers.    -  4.3 percent (2,939) teach  preschool or kindergarten.       The teacher-student ratio is 1:18. However, since most  teachers are in the cities, there are rural and indigenous  communities without a single teacher. Furthermore, a little over  half of the rural schools offer only the first three years of  primary school. Rural children, therefore, have difficulty  finishing even primary school. [Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS FACETAS  Supplement]    According to ETARE, in the last 10 years university  enrollment has increased at 7.2 percent per year but only 4.5  percent of those enrolled in a university manage to graduate,  and the dropout rate is 15 percent. Other figures reveal that  approximately 40,000 secondary school graduates intend to enroll  in the country's 23 public and private universities (this year).  [La Paz EL DIARIO 10 Nov; PRESENCIA 22 Nov]    Under Secretary Ipina outlined some of the goals of the  first  four years of the educational reform plan (1994-97) which aims  at "transforming the educational system by 100 percent:"     -  7,200 new schools and school councils.    -  1,200 nuclear  schools and councils.    -  100 new school districts and nine  departmental directorates.    -  50,000 primary school teachers, 500  supervisors, and 720 specialists.    -  1 million children in school:  600,000 in urban areas and 400,000 in rural areas.    [La Paz PRESENCIA DEL PAIS 4 Dec]    CHUOUISACA: RURAL POVERTY, LAND OWNERSHIP--Walter Valda  Rivera, director of a Jesuit organization active among the  farmers of Tarija, Chuquisaca, and Potosi, and president of the  association of nongovernmental organizations in the area,  concluded that rural poverty in Chuquisaca Department has been  increasing for the past eight years to the point that most rural  families in the area "live on the edge of total misery" and that  the "quality of life" index is the lowest in the country. In a  seminar held by various nongovernmental organizations, he  presented a paper analyzing land ownership and production:     -  While 300,000 hectares are arable, small farmers cultivate  only 149,000 hectares, producing 285,000 metric tons.    -  Large  landholdings or "latifundios" cover 80 percent of the land, with  355 families owning 666,000 hectares, but most of this land lies  fallow.    -  Small landholdings or "minifundios" are on the increase,  with 60,000 families barely getting by with five hectares or  less.    -  Internal migration has increased from 5,276 in 1980 to  30,000 farmers leaving the department for La Paz, Sucre, or the  interior.    -  Illiteracy in many of Chuquisaca's provinces is 80  percent.       Valda blamed the "neoliberal" model for the increasing  poverty because it is "incompatible with" the farmers' "communal  lifestyle" and "fosters competitiveness, individualism, and  selfishness."

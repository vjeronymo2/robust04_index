			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Chris Jacobie: "Hereros Want Koevoet Members </F> Back"; "Mandela Has Koevoet Letter"]    [Text] The controversial issue concerning former members of  the security forces who left Namibia in 1991 because of a  comprehensive intimidation campaign against them, has landed on  the desk of the newly elected South African state president, Mr.  Nelson Mandela, amidst increasing political embarrassment to the  Namibian Government. The issue concerning the return of former  members of military units is developing into a local and  international embarrassment for Namibia after the Committee on  Defense and Security of the Frontline States advised in Windhoek  in April that the soldiers should be allowed to return to their  country of birth. Namibia was also present at the conference and  not only made proposals concerning the return of Namibians from  South Africa, but also suggested that former soldiers who left  Zimbabwe after independence should be allowed to return to their  country. In the latest initiative concerning the fate of  approximately 12,000 Namibians in South Africa, the king of the  Hereros, Mr. Kuaima Riruako, addressed the issue in a letter to  President Sam Nujoma and also sent a copy of the letter to Mr.  Mandela. Mr. Riruako emphasized that the soldiers and their  families -- mainly former members of Koevoet [crowbar; former  police counterinsurgency unit] and the territorial forces --  left the country at that stage because they could not depend on  the protection of the government.    "The Namibian Government's hesitation, even refusal, to  allow  these Namibians to return to the country of their birth is a  flagrant violation of their constitutional rights. These former  soldiers are Namibians by birth or are descendants of Namibians  and include more than a hundred Hereros and their families.  Since these people fled from Namibia it can be deduced that at  that stage they could not hope for any protection from  government. What makes things worse is that the constitution  determines that no person, as a citizen through birth or those  of Namibian descent, may be denied citizenship. This clearly  indicates that Namibians can come and go as they please. In  light of this constitutional right, the Herero king is calling  on President Sam Nujoma to honor his oath, that is, to protect  the constitution at all times. Mr. Nujoma should also respect  the rights of Namibians who want to return to their country and  he should ensure that they be allowed to return home without any  further delay," according to Mr. Riruako's letter to the two  heads of state.</p>

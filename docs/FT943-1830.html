			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / People: Downing emerges at Lehman Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, has bolstered its European business with the appointment of James Downing as head of strategic advisory services for Europe. The new head of Lehman's European M&amp;A is another high-level departure from Wasserstein Perella, the M&amp;A boutique involved in many of the most prominent transactions of the late 1980s. Joseph Perella, one of its founders, parted company in 1993, and altogether at least six senior figures have left in the past 12 months. Two of them have gone to Lehman Brothers. Francois Faure made a similar move to Downing's in June. Formerly head of M&amp;A for Wasserstein Perella in Paris, he moved to join Lehman's team covering French M&amp;A. Downing says he is moving to Lehman Brothers because of its diversity of products which he contrasts with the focused approach of Wasserstein Perella. 'It is important to broaden out,' he says. Downing joined Wasserstein Perella from CS First Boston, where he worked from 1985. He has been involved in M&amp;A since 1982 in both New York and London; he is a graduate of Yale school of management.</p>

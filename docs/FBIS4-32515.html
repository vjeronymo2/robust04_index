			<p>BFN     [Text] Banja Luka, 26 Jun (TANJUG) -- The first generation  of officers of the republic of Srpska army and the Serb army of  Krajina in Croatia was promoted at a ceremony in the Center of  Military Academies in Banja Luka today. The first officers who  attended the academy were promoted to the rank of lieutenant  colonel. The second generation of noncommissioned officers of  the two armies were also promoted.    The ceremony was attended by Radovan Karadzic, supreme  commander of the republic of Srpska army and president of the  republic of Srpska, Colonel-General Ratko Mladic, chief of  general staff of the republic of Srpska army, Major General  Milan Celeketic, chief of general staff of the Serb army of  Krajina, many other guests, and thousands of Banja Luka  citizens, as well as the new officers' families and friends.    Addressing the newly promoted officers, Radovan Karadzic  said  that the humiliation of allowing the international community to  draw its maps and offer them under the "take it or leave it"  principle was unacceptable. "We want to end this war. Our aim  so far has been to defend our own territory, but if our enemies  and the international community are forcing us into a  counteroffensive, we will not stop," Karadzic stressed.    Colonel General Ratko Mladic, Major General Milan Celeketic,  and Major General Slavko Lisica, head of the center of military  academies in Banja Luka, also spoke at the ceremony. The Center  of Military Academies in Banja Luka was opened last year in the  premises of the former Petar Drapsin Training Center for  Armored-Motorized Units. Personnel from the republic of Srpska  and the republic of Serb Krajina are trained there to become  officers and noncommissioned officers.</p>

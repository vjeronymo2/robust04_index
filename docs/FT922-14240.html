			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Christian revival perturbs Singapore: Religious morals may conflict with political requirements THE LAST thing one expects to see in the sober, disciplined city of Singapore is a respectable middle-aged Chinese woman lying on her back in a public place, moaning and twitching and saying: 'It was wonderful. I saw many bright lights.' In a country where even chewing-gum is forbidden, the only context in which you are likely to witness such an event is a charismatic Christian church service. The lady in question, a living testament to the rise of fundamentalist Christianity in Singapore over the last decade, was attending an Anglican service of hymns and healing, with electric guitar, in the Victoria Concert Hall on a recent Sunday. Leading the congregation was Bishop Chiu Ban-It, the former Bishop of Singapore, taking a break from his retirement in the English county of Dorset to cure the sick and see for himself the spread of Christianity since the first stirrings of the 'renewal' in 1973. He recalled the days when St Andrew's Cathedral had only three Sunday services. 'I was bishop and we were pretty desperate,' he said. Now there are nine services. 'It's just marvellous for me to come and see. The thing which thrills me is the number of lay people and young people who are taking responsibility.' Bishop Chiu gave the same sermon on Christian values this year in Singapore as he did when he preached to Queen Elizabeth at Windsor parish church in 1968. But this time he went on to offer the prospect of a cure for back problems, especially those caused by one leg being shorter than the other, and urged sufferers to come on stage to be healed. 'If we pray and ask the Lord, He levels their legs up. In many cases it's permanent,' he told the worshippers, who queued to be cured and as often as not keeled over while the bishop prayed and held their hands. The Singapore government, which regards the obedience of citizens to the secular state as all-important, is considerably less thrilled than the bishop by Christianity's progress. Only five years ago the authorities arrested more than 20 people over a supposed Catholic-Communist conspiracy. A fifth of the island's population are already Christians - roughly double the number a decade ago - and anecdotal evidence suggests the religion continues to spread among the young. There are influential Christians in the bureaucracy, in politics and in business. Anglican charismatics are among the more moderate of the new wave of fundamentalists. Baptist and gospel fringe churches have taken over several old cinemas to accommodate their growing congregations, and the services of visiting foreign evangelists are packed night after night. Most Christians are from the Chinese community, apparently because the Chinese practice of ancestor-worship has a looser hold on its adherents than Islam has on Malays, or Hinduism on Indians. One Singaporean Chinese woman from a baptist church explained how she angered her parents by becoming a Christian at the age of 12, before converting her siblings and finally - last year - her ageing mother. The trend has left some Chinese elders confused, and fearful of not seeing their relatives in the afterlife, but others watch stoically as their children hold prayer meetings in the house. Like many newly-converted Chinese Christians, Mr Oscar Huang, a computer software engineer from mainland China working in Singapore, is somewhat iconoclastic, scorning his Buddhist parents' belief in idols. 'My parents and grandparents ask the idols, the gods to help us, even the rice god,' he said after a Mandarin-language Anglican hymn-singing session. 'I don't believe that stuff. They can't help us.' Ask a Christian why the faith is spreading, and he or she will probably answer as Mr Lee Da-Win did after Bishop Chiu's service. 'The spirit is moving mightily in Singapore,' he said. 'Many people in Singapore are very open to the Lord.' The bishop himself says the success of Christianity is partly a reaction to widespread materialism in modern Singapore. Non-believers have another explanation; they link the rise of charismatic Christianity to the soullessness of life in a country where overt individualism and freedom of expression are often frowned upon as disruptive by a government dedicated to 'consensus'. At first glance, the stern moral outlook and the emphasis on family life of the Christians appear to coincide with the views of the government (some pastors like to fulminate against homosexuality, for example), but the authorities remain fearful of any Christian moral imperative which might conflict with their own view of the country's greater good. They are suspected by some Christians of trying to curb the charismatic movement with a long-drawn-out attempt to convict Mr Frederick Seaward of the Calvary Charismatic Centre on fraud charges. Singaporean officials are particularly wary of evangelism, whether by word of mouth or by more modern methods such as the country's radio-paging networks, because they do not want to upset Singaporean fundamentalist Moslems or provoke an outcry from their predominantly Moslem and much larger neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia. 'No-one goes after the Moslems because they can't, what with the Indonesians the the south and the Malays to the north,' says one believer. 'It always ends up difficult for the Christians.' Illust. Police handcuff a Christian demonstrator in Singapore in 1987. Authorities have since taken a less active line against religious revivals, but remain worried by it</p>

			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN GRANTED LAST WISH FOR SON'S VISA DIES  </P> <P> Sonia Siguenza, the terminally ill woman whose final wish was granted when the  Immigration and Naturalization Service issued an emergency visa to allow her  son to visit her from El Salvador, died Monday at Western Medical Center here.  </P> <P> Siguenza's husband, Israel Siguenza, was with his wife Sunday night, as he has  been almost every night in the 2 1/2 months she has been in the intensive care  unit.  </P> <P> "I told her she had beautiful eyes, and she opened her eyes for me, and I  kissed her and said goodby," he said. "It was time. She was already tired."  </P> <P> Sonia Siguenza, 25, a native of El Salvador, contracted an infectious blood  disease almost two years ago. When she learned she would probably not get  better, she asked for a final visit with her 9-year-old son, Walter, whom the  couple had sent back to El Salvador to live with grandparents when she grew too  weak to care for him.  </P> <P> Fulfilling the wish proved difficult for Israel Siguenza, as he was turned down  by one official after another. Although Siguenza, a car salesman in Costa Mesa,  is a legal resident, his son is not because he had lived in the United States  only a short time.  </P> <P> Sonia Siguenza's physician, Dr. Michael Fitzgibbons, wrote U.S. Sen. Pete  Wilson (R-Calif.), who personally appealed to INS Commissioner Gene McNary in  Washington. McNary arranged a "humanitarian visa" in June, allowing the boy to  stay for three years.  </P> <P> "He cries sometimes, and he is very sad that she has died," Siguenza said of  his son. "I wish I could have done more for her, but I did what I could," he  added, his voice breaking. "We got her son here. I think she passed away  happy."  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Pavlov: "Government Knockout: Beginning 4 May </F> a Kilowatt of Electricity for the Population Will Cost 63.6  Rubles"]    [Text] This piece of news was delivered the day before  yesterday at a scheduled meeting of the kray council of heads of  administration by Dalenergo representative Yu. Ivanov. It left  those present feeling shell-shocked. As it turned out,  Government Decree No. 352, signed on 22 April, had not been  coordinated with the regions, including Maritime Kray. So far,  preferential rates, wrangled out by the kray administration with  incredible difficulty, remain in effect. It was only thanks to  this that the kray was able to survive a harsh winter without  extraordinary losses.    The government's new knockout, which repeals all preferences  for Maritime Kray, may be a mortal blow for us. Enterprises and  organizations already owe 178 billion rubles [R] in unpaid  electric power bills. Of this, R98 billion is to be reimbursed  from the federal budget. Now it is frankly giving the kray the  finger.    The chronic lack of money stemming from nonpayments and the  massive decline in production is resulting in a considerable  drop in budget revenue. At the same time, expenditures are  growing, especially in the social sphere. S. Tereshkov, chief of  the kray administration's financial department, emphasized at  the council that budget revenue from kray sources is less than  half as large as the expense part. Therefore it is quite  realistic that the central government once again will freeze  wages in budget-financed spheres.    In short, the situation is more than alarming. As to our  fuel  and energy sector, it is, without exaggeration, catastrophic.  Repairs of equipment at central heat delivery systems alone  require R403 billion. Practically none of this money is  available. Despite the fact that with the advent of warm weather  electricity use has dropped by 40 percent, no accumulation of  fuel is taking place. Moreover, reserves are dropping.    Beginning 22 April suppliers stopped shipping coal to the  kray. It is quite possible that as early as May restrictions on  consumers will be introduced. The kray commission on emergency  situations will have to search in the nearest future for  cardinal ways out of the critical situation.    "If the government sets a price of R120 per kw for  electricity delivered to enterprises, this will mean death to  the Khrustalninsk mining and enrichment combine, as well as  other industrial collectives," A. Akifyev, deputy head of  Kavalerovskiy Rayon administration, said without hesitation.  "They will never recover."    Is there a way out of the lethal situation into which our  "dear" central government has pushed Maritime Kray and the rest  of the country? Replying to this question, I. Lebedinets,  chairman of the kray emergency commission, said that there is  only one solution: mobilize all production and human resources  in Maritime Kray into an all-people's construction project,  which has never let us down in the past, and increase production  of our own coal. Nobody will save us except ourselves.    No one would object to this idea, but there is  catastrophically little time left for its implementation. If we  are late... It is frightening to think of the consequences.</p>

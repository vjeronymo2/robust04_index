			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Vienna, May 28 (AFP) -- The International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] admitted failure Saturday [28 May] in its  attempts to monitor the refuelling of a nuclear reactor in North  Korea as Pyongyang defended the operation.    In Seoul the South Korean Government called on the North to  stop the controversial refuelling at the five-megawatt Yongbyon  reactor, warning that the situation could degenerate into a  crisis.    The IAEA issued a statement confirming that North Korea had  refused to allow its inspectors to check that no fuel was being  diverted to make nuclear weapons.    "The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) rejected  all IAEA proposals put forward with the aim of maintaining the  IAEA's ability to select, segregate and secure fuel rods for  later measurements so as to be able to verify the history of the  reactor core, specifically to verify whether this is the first  core," the statement said.    "The DPRK continued to maintain that it could not accept the  IAEA verification measures proposed."    It said two senior Agency members who had travelled to North  Korea would return to Vienna Saturday, but that two other  inspectors would remain behind to further developments.    IAEA Director General Hans Blix said earlier in a letter to  UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali that North Korea had  resumed refuelling at the Yongbyon reactor, defying the  international inspectors and making it impossible to make a full  accounting of weapons-grade fuel.

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / India resists IMF pressure over currency The Indian government is resisting advice from the International Monetary Fund to let the rupee float upwards in response to record private capital inflows into India. Though not committed to an exchange rate target, the government is determined to resist any substantial appreciation from the rate of close to 31 to the US dollar, at which it has stayed since March 1993. According to senior Indian officials, such an appreciation would risk inflicting the 'Dutch disease' on the economy - a reference to the way discoveries of natural gas reduced the competitiveness of exports from the Netherlands in the 1970s. An appreciation could, it is feared, inflict comparable damage on India's still fragile export success. In the financial year ending March 1994, according to the ministry of finance, India received foreign direct investment of about Dollars 600m (Pounds 398m) and a portfolio flow of Dollars 4bn, Dollars 1.5bn of which was from foreign institutional investors, while Dollars 2.5bn arrived in response to foreign issues of equity and convertible bonds by Indian firms. This capital inflow, in addition to what the finance ministry believes will turn out to be a small (and unexpected) current account surplus, helped produce an increase of Dollars 8.7bn in India's foreign exchange reserves during the financial year. Even without holdings of gold, reserves stood at Dollars 15.5bn at the end of March, equivalent to some seven months of imports. Along with a fiscal deficit of 7.3 per cent of gross domestic product, the rise in reserves has considerably augmented domestic liquidity. Monetary growth has jumped from 5 per cent in the year to May 1993, to 18 per cent in the year to January 1994. Annual inflation is also running at 11 per cent - disturbing by Indian standards. During its annual 'Article IV' consultations, the IMF advised India to let the rupee appreciate, if it could not implement a much sharper than planned cut in the fiscal deficit. But the government, supported by the World Bank, is concerned about the adverse effect a big appreciation might have on exports, which grew at the encouraging rate of 21 per cent, in US dollars, in the last financial year. The Indian government believes the reserve accumulation is likely to prove temporary. A rise in relatively import-intensive fixed investment  - the likelihood of which is indicated by an increase of 8.1 per cent in manufactured output between January 1993 and January 1994 - should, it believes, expand imports substantially. In consequence, the finance ministry expects a current account deficit of Dollars 1bn-Dollars 2bn in 1994-95. The capital inflow may also dwindle, albeit temporarily, during the current financial year. In the short run, the government is prepared to accept the reserve accumulation, rather than risk seeing the export drive come to an end. But it has decided to curb the monetary effects through the imposition of higher cash reserve requirements on the banking system. It has the additional option of trying to sterilise the inflow, via open market operations of the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank. Should the build-up of foreign exchange reserves continue, the government might consider making terms of non-resident banking deposits less attractive. It might also try to restrict the access of Indian business to foreign capital. In addition, a modest start to liberalisation of consumer goods was made in the government's import policy for this year. The current build-up of reserves will make it politically easier to accelerate liberalisation in future, which the IMF and World Bank both strongly recommend.</p>

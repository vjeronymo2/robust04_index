			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / UK Company News: FNFC may have to roll over some bank debt FIRST National Finance Corporation, the consumer credit group, said yesterday it might have to roll over some of its bank debt if it could not get 'technical' breaches of loan agreements waived within the next few weeks. In First National Bank, its main subsidiary, between Pounds 200m and Pounds 250m of debt is repayable by the end of April. As part of the refinancing, First National was close to raising Pounds 150m through the securitisation of unsecured home improvement loans, organised by Baring Brothers. But news of the breaches has put this on hold. Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, said yesterday it would not assign any rating to the proposed securitisation until First National Bank had obtained written waivers from all relevant institutions of all the outstanding breaches. Mr Martin Mays-Smith, FNFC's chairman, yesterday described the breaches as 'misdemeanors that are old, insubstantial and technical'. They were to do with infringing bans on guarantees between First National Bank and its subsidiaries. He said this might lead to a situation where there was a loan in default. 'But it is not absolutely certain.' He thought it would take about a month to get the waivers. 'If the process of getting the waivers drags on, it will be a problem of time not substance.' If there had to be some short-term roll-over of debt, he pointed to 'substantial undrawn facilities' and the proceeds of the recently announced Pounds 45.8m rights issue. Of the discussions that would have to take place with various banks to obtain the waivers, he said: 'Given the viability of the business, we hope they will be sympathetic.' S&amp;P yesterday confirmed the triple A rating of First National Bank's Pounds 170m securitisation of second mortgages carried out last October.</p>

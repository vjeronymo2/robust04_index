			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Letter: Global security now inseparable from economic issues Sir, Edward Mortimer's open letter to the president-elect of the US ('Dear Mr President', November 4) well describes some familiar and not so familiar challenges which will be faced by a new administration in Washington. Of particular interest, given the lack of any detailed discussion of foreign policy issues during the election campaign, are his recommendations to bolster the role of multilateral institutions and particularly the United Nations. However, Mr Mortimer's emphasis on multilateral policing operations is unduly one-sided. In this respect, Governor Clinton's stated recognition that, in an increasingly interdependent world, foreign policy concerns and domestic economic strength are inseparable, offers a far more hopeful message than Mr Mortimer's exclusive concern simply to double the number of bobbies on the (global) beat by enhancing the UN's military role. Indeed, Governor Clinton's message echoes a long-standing recognition in large parts of the international community, including agencies, that global security is inseparable from economic and social development. The urgency of forging an international economic perspective to match that likely to emerge from Washington in the coming months cannot be understated at a time of continued economic uncertainty in the world economy. What better way of matching the renewed activism in Washington than enhancing the multilateral economic structures already in place with a long-standing commitment to international co-operation, political pluralism and global economic development. Moreover, it is precisely through support to such institutions that Mr Mortimer's laudable ideal of a world citizen is most likely to be achieved.

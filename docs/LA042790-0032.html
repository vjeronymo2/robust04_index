			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS;  </P> <P> JAKE'S SOUTH BAY DOES THE BEACH TRADITION PROUD, THE RICE PILAF POORLY  </P> <P> Someday, some scholar of immense erudition and rare insight is going to write a  study of the California beach restaurant, and, when that happens, the new  Jake's South Bay on the Chula Vista waterfront will very possibly be included  as a highly refined, late-20th-Century example of this unique style of eatery.  </P> <P> The last California beach restaurant, whenever and wherever it may be built,  will not only offer the unique rice preparation that these places, and these  alone, are pleased to call "rice pilaf," but also the beloved filet  mignon/frozen lobster tail combination that is usually garnished with it.  Jake's offers these requisite specialties, along with a primarily seafood menu  that does include a few meat offerings.  </P> <P> There is also a unique style of service specific to the California beach  restaurant, and, if the busboys at Jake's aren't quite the surfer dudes of  yesteryear, they at least give a fair imitation. Their service is at times a  fascinating combination of cheerful good intentions absolutely unguided by any  sense of how to bus a table.  </P> <P> The waitresses do somewhat better, but also seem quite at sea at certain  crucial moments. Even so, there is nonetheless a charm to the service that  could never be duplicated by haughty, French-trained, professional waiters.  </P> <P> Jake's opened in late December and is owned by TS Restaurants, which also owns  Jake's Del Mar and Charlie's in Cardiff. There is a good, solid beach  restaurant tradition here, since TS co-founder Sandy Saxten started his career  in 1966 as a waiter at Chuck's Steak House in Hawaii and now presides over a  sizable chain of places in Southern California, Hawaii and Lake Tahoe. All are  within a stone's throw of the water.  </P> <P> Some recipes repeat from place to place, and guests at Jake's South Bay  generally enjoy a good price break; for example, the dish of scallops with  macadamias that costs $9.95 in Chula Vista runs $14.95 at the chain's Kapalua  Bar &amp; Grill on Maui.  </P> <P> Appetizers are few and in the beach mode, and include such things as a steamed  artichoke, ceviche, shrimp cocktail, raw oysters and a less-typical batch of  grilled oysters, which take on a distinct and rather pleasant flavor from the  charcoal grill. They arrive doused with some sort of inept butter sauce that  seems, at heart, to want to be a French beurre blanc, but, because the sauce  slips right off the bivalves, no harm is done.  </P> <P> The menu also includes a brief, inexpensive "cafe" section that is rare for  this sort of place but quite welcome. The offerings here run to a steak  sandwich; a chicken sandwich that, for better or worse, is seasoned with Cajun  spices; a fairly dressy cheeseburger; a seafood salad, and what the menu calls  a "gourmet" pizza, which is decorated with chorizo, onions, olives, mushrooms  and cheese.  </P> <P> Meals also include the choice of clam chowder or what is described as "house"  Caesar salad, which means a fairly good if rather dry imitation of the real  thing. It is pleasant and generously served, as is the chowder, a creamed soup  thick with potatoes, bacon, celery and clams that tilts a touch to the peppery  side and is finished with a little thyme, which only lately has become  traditional in chowder but certainly heightens the flavor.  </P> <P> The entree list opens with a few daily seafood specials -- the more extravagant  offerings, such as salmon and Maine lobster, appear here -- and proceeds  directly to the "fresh fish Cajun style," a dish that certainly would have been  a California beach restaurant classic if ersatz Cajun cooking had not been  invented so long after the advent of beach restaurants. A second offering that  also utilizes whatever fresh fish the kitchen has in plenitude on any given day  is the "fresh fish Veracruz," which finishes the chosen poisson with tomato  sauce spiked with garlic, jalapeno peppers and green olives.  </P> <P> The dinner list continues with scampi, one of the three true icons of beach  cooking and a dish that, like rice pilaf and steak and lobster, certainly has a  devoted and almost devout following. Scampi is one of the few dishes that seems  to taste exactly the same everywhere (the white wine, butter and garlic that  flavor the dish are not subject to the slightest modification), and anyone who  has enjoyed this dish elsewhere will like it at Jake's. The portion, however,  consists of just five medium-size shrimp, which makes this a rather skimpy  scampi.  </P> <P> It is de rigueur to have rice pilaf with this (although the steak fries are a  great deal more satisfactory), and the rice is every bit as gooey and  indifferently flavored as the Beach Restaurant Master Recipe dictates. There  must be a school somewhere that teaches beginning beach cooks how to prepare  this unique, stewed rice.  </P> <P> The scallops macadamia actually are breaded and browned, and the nut flavor  seems mostly in the breading, which is a good place for it. This is a good dish  and a tasty one, even if it is swimming in the same indeterminate butter sauce  that dressed the grilled oysters. Because this sauce has virtually no flavor or  body, it has little effect on the dish.  </P> <P> The menu takes a slightly Italian note with such dishes as the shrimp and  chicken piccata (the sauce includes capers and white wine); the seafood  pescatore, or fettuccine topped with fish and shellfish in a cheese-enriched  white sauce, and cioppino, a typical offering of seafood cooked in broth-based  tomato sauce.  </P> <P> Among meat offerings, there is a New York sirloin in a choice of green  peppercorn or blue cheese sauces (both something of a departure from the menu's  general tone); chicken breast marinated in gingered soy sauce, and a platter of  marinated, grilled New Zealand chops. At $17.95, the lamb is one of the most  extravagant offerings, but the order sampled was extravagantly portioned,  well-cooked and of good quality.  </P> <P> Desserts are of the simplest sort imaginable. The choice includes creme caramel  and chocolate mousse and, at its most imaginative, a TS Restaurants chainwide  special called Kimo's Hula Pie that consists of high-rising ice cream layered  in a cookie crust. Jake's serves a lot of it.  </P> <P> The restaurant takes full advantage of its handsome waterfront setting and of  the sweeping views across the bay to the Silver Strand and Point Loma. The  place is built in the style of a turn-of-the-century boathouse, with a  multitude of historic waterfront photos on the walls and peaked ceilings of  rough-sawn wood whose loft spaces accommodate hanging skiffs and dories.  </P> <P> JAKE'S SOUTH BAY  </P> <P> 570 Marina Parkway, Chula Vista  </P> <P> 476-0400  </P> <P> Lunch and dinner daily.  </P> <P> Dinner for two, including a glass of wine each, tax and tip, $30 to $60.  </P></p>

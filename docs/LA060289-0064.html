			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: HOLLYWOOD  </P> <P> Like all artists Tom Stanton mines his past when he paints. But with Stanton  his past is not simply an allusion but the actual surface of the work itself.  Old paintings cut up, overpainted and integrated become the connective tissue  and skin for his new imagery. It's a little like watching an actor rehearse an  old play; each time through giving the lines another, more amplified meaning.  </P> <P> This time around the paintings bury earlier foreboding images beneath a curling  web of thick white lines. It's like watching Mark Tobey white out an El Greco.  Results are uneven but have a strongly ritualistic, tribal flavor. Most  impressive are pieces like "Dragon" where the white rococo lines suggest  grotesque, Oriental demon masks and give the obsessive doodling a fierce  energy.  </P> <P> Stanton's sculpture is more playful and more consistent. Obviously pulled  together from whatever was around, "Senufu" in particular recalls both roots  and the white-clay-decorated body of an African dancer. After the visual clamor  of the paintings their elegant, linear simplicity is a welcome relief.  </P> <P> In the adjoining gallery Maureen O'Hara Ure shows small tableaux inspired by  folk art. A confusing mix of items -- part toy box, part furniture, part  traditional painting -- it is unclear whether these canny pieces are  autobiographical fragments or a collection of embellished household furnishings  made for fun. Some, like "Your House is on Fire; Your Children Alone" seem to  carry messages about history and racism, but others are just empty stages where  the painted backdrop is too generalized to have any meaning.

			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KOREAN MEMORIAL DESIGN APPROVED  </P> <P> A federal commission has approved a revised design for the Korean War veterans'  memorial, and ground breaking is scheduled for Veterans Day, 1991, a veterans'  panel said Friday.  </P> <P> Bill Russell, spokesman for the Korean War Veterans Memorial Advisory Board,  said organizers hoped that construction could begin next year despite  complaints by the original architects that their design has been altered.  </P> <P> He said the National Capital Memorial Commission approved the design, including  the revisions, during a hearing Thursday.  </P> <P> Four Pennsylvania State University architects won a contest to design the  memorial across the Reflecting Pool from the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. It  called for "a dreamlike" collection of 38 soldiers moving across a remote  landscape toward an American flag.  </P></p>

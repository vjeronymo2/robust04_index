			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Jiri Weigl, head of Prime Minister Vaclav </F> Klaus's team of advisers: "Havel Versus Klaus, or Mixing Up  Concepts"]    [Text] On 18 January, MLADA FRONTA DNES published an  article by Tomas Vencalek entitled "Havel Versus Klaus, or a  Dispute About the Meaning of the State." In it, the author  engaged in a remarkable discourse on the fundamental differences  of opinion between our most senior representatives on the  relationship between the citizen and the state.    This article maintains that the president, as an advocate of  a "consistent civic society," is calling for the establishment  of higher territorial units and non-profit-making organizations,  while Vaclav Klaus is an unequivocal advocate of a strong state  or strong-arm government and manifests his distaste for curbing  the power of this state in favor of the aforementioned  institutions.    Mr. Vencalek sees a disharmony here between the president's  "liberal view of the world" and the prime minister's  unidimensionally social democratic way of thinking, which is,  however, an apparently intrinsically neoconservative phenomenon  inasmuch as Reagan and Thatcher considered public-legal  institutions to be parasites on democracy and limited their  authority in favor of the state.    On the basis of these hypotheses, Mr. Vencalek "exposes"  neoconservatism as the ideological fellow-traveler of social  democracy (except for marginal differences in the taxation or  privatization spheres!!) and contrasts it with "liberalism,"  which does not trust the state.    The aforementioned views reflect the author's confusion  about  the fundamental ideological approaches to the arrangement of  society. Only in this way can he place conservative thinking  alongside social democracy. The essence of the conservative way  of thinking consists of its emphasis on a clear definition of  ownership rights with regard to property and on freedom of  choice for all social entities. In this context, the state is  also seen as the guarantor of stable and equal rules for  everyone. The role of the state as the "visible hand" of a  formless general rule should be minimal, but the role of the  state as the guarantor and maker of rules is crucial and, from  this point of view, the requirement for a strong state with  clearly defined authority, and jurisdiction for the individual  government levels is absolutely consistent with the requirement  for a minimal role for the state in the microeconomic sphere.  The social democratic view of the state runs counter to this.    The critical views that, in the discussion on the  establishment of higher territorial units, warn of the  consequences of ill-considered decisions in favor of the  government's ability to guarantee stability and uniformity of  conditions for implementing ownership rights and the freedom of  choice for all entities should also be understood in this  context.    It is essential to adopt a similar view of non-profit-making  organizations. To the conservative admirer of the clear and  natural order of things, a non-profit-making or public-legal  organization is an ambiguous entity that makes it difficult to  clearly divide property into private and public property--that  is, guaranteed by the generally recognized and supervisory  representative of the public, the state. If non-profit-making  organizations are perceived as private entities, which, however,  enjoy certain, mainly tax, advantages over other profit-making  private organizations, the only argument a critic can cite here  is the violation of the universal nature of the rules of  competition and the possibility that these advantages may be  abused.    It is worse if non-profit-making organizations are viewed as  a kind of third form of ownership, a form that contradicts both  private and state ownership. This aspect is gaining in  importance, first and foremost, in our situation, where  decisions are being made on the fate of the huge amount of  property amassed by the former regime. The illusion is being  fostered among the public that this is a more noble form of  ownership that does not pursue a profit motive and is not abused  a priori by a dubious state authority. The impression is being  created that the state property originally transferred into this  form will somehow serve "all of us" due to the noble intentions  of its "public-legal" administrators, that it will be given  preferential treatment against other entities, and that we,  citizens, will decide on its use by means of some unspecified  arrangement for self-organization. In practice, this means  abandoning the requirement for a clear definition of ownership  rights and of the responsibility of the owner associated with  them.    This approach to non-profit making organizations, which is  very vigorous in the ongoing debates on the appropriate  legislation, expresses a priori the mistrust of Mr. Vencalek's  "liberals" of private ownership and profit-making motives, which  is the driving force behind each market economy. It expresses  the attempt to establish, by a "public-legal" form, capitalism  with a human face, which preserves at least something of the  unfavorable aspects of the irresponsible past.    It is necessary to understand "liberalism" perceived like  this more in the U.S. sense, as an ideological trend very close  to European social democracy. They are both equally distant  from consistent and conservative thinking.    However, I must give Mr. Vencalek his due in one thing. The  issue discussed by him, albeit poorly interpreted, is a sign  that our conditions are obviously reaching maturity. It is  comforting that the differences between the conservative and  "liberal" or social democratic concepts of society are obvious  in our policy.</p>

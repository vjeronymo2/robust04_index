If the  plainness of the words were a yardstick for the cordiality of  relations, then there could be nothing better and more beautiful  in international trade than trade between the United Statesa and  Japan. Yet, the news and pictures of the weekend show the  contrary: U.S. President Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa were not trying to conceal that the Washington  trade talks remained absolutely without any result -- and, what  is worse, that the two sides even failed to show mutual  understanding for the positions in the negotiations.    If the Americans do not remain cool, the situation might  escalate into a trade war or at least into a worrying dispute.  The question as to who is to blame will hardly find a clear  answer. It may be difficult to provide evidence of flagrant  Japanese infringements of the free trade agreements that were  also signed by Japan. However, one cannot say either that the  only obstacle to the Japanese market are the letters that are so  unusual to Westerners. The difference between the theoretical  and practical openness of the Japanese market is striking, and  it has a lot to do with the close interrelations between the  economy and the administration in Japan.    However, those who complain about discrimination must also  ask themselves whether their product would really have such good  chances on a completely open Japanese market. It is not without  reason that the Japanese are so successful with their cars and  their electronic products, which taught fear to their  competitors in America and Europe. Thus, it is remarkable that  the U.S. President should complain about Japanese trade  restrictions without requesting their verifiable elimination,  but that he is trying to achieve import figures and quotas for  the U.S. economy. How should Hosokawa continue the difficult  course of deregulation in Japan while taking home new  regulations from trade talks? If he wants to retain credibility  in terms of domestic policy, then he must not even listen to  Clinton's proposal.    Diplomatic efforts in international economy must not  progress  to new agreements, but return to GATT rules. The more the world  is divided up into trade blocks, the more often bilateral  agreements will replace the most-favored nation status and  nondiscrimination. This does not serve peace. We are still far  away from the international society guided by universal values:  Based on the spirit of GATT, one step toward it could be taken  in world trade.</p>

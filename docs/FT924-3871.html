			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / International Company News: Proton tumbles 36% in year PROTON, the Malaysian car manufacturer, blamed a softening domestic car market for last year's 36 per cent decline in pre-tax profits, writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur. Proton has a 65 per cent share of car sales in the Malaysian market. It said there had been a 15 per cent drop in overall car sales in Malaysia in the past 12 months. Half-year, pre-tax profits were MDollars 130.46m (USDollars 52.1m), against MDollars 203.3m. Proton made a pre-tax profit of MDollars 408m on turnover of MDollars 2.2bn in 1991-1992. Proton is 50 per cent owned by Malaysian government interests. It was partially privatised earlier this year. The government haslifted restrictions on foreign share ownership of Proton, allowing foreign investors to hold more than 30 per cent of total equity.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Tanzanian chief of general staff, General Robert  Mboma, has warned Rwandan Government Forces and those from the  Rwandan Patriotic Front, RPF, that they should not try to cross  into Tanzania, particularly through the Rusumo Bridge in Ngara  District, Kagera region. His warning follows reports which say  that part of the bridge has been in the hands of RPF soldiers on  the Rwandan side of the border since the end of last month.    Speaking after issuing a statement on defense and security  in  Ngara District, and after touring the bridge at the border,  General Mboma said the Rusumo Bridge belonged to Tanzania. He  told a representative of the RPF chief of general staff, Colonel  William (Mbagile), that the Kagera River also belonged to  Tanzania. He warned that Tanzania would not tolerate seeing its  citizens, who use water from the Kagera River, continue to drink  water contaminated with corpses from Rwanda.    General Mboma also held talks with the Burundi chief of  general staff, Lieutenant Colonel Jean Bikomagu, who assured him  that the government and the Burundi Army are making efforts to  restore peace in their country.</p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Leading Article: The fight for EC finances WHEN MR Jacques Delors spelled out plans in February for a one-third increase in European Community revenues during the next five years, the EC Commission president knew that he was advancing into difficult terrain. The hostile response from the richer EC countries has shown that this campaign will be uphill all the way. Placing the EC's budget on to a new footing to meet the challenges of a Community which is becoming both wider and deeper is of crucial importance. The EC must, however, draw up a far more coherent list of spending priorities for coming years, ensuring that its ambitions for an enlarged union do not run beyond its capacity to finance those actions and responsibilities in a sound and sensible way. Half the extra money which Mr Delors wants to spend by 1997 is targeted on economic development in the poorer EC countries, Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland. Much smaller additions are earmarked for aid to the former Soviet Union, eastern Europe and North Africa, as well as for the EC's infrastructure and industry projects. The Ecu 21bn extra spending foreseen over five years in the Delors plan will not break any national budgets. The increase adds up to roughly 0.25 per cent of the Community's combined gross national product. Mr Delors' proposals are consistent with the principles underlying the Maastricht treaty on European union. The EC has, after all, set itself the goal of moving to a higher plane of integration, crucially through economic and monetary union. Most critical The countries which have most criticised Mr Delors' ideas are those which are either already - like Germany and Britain - net contributors to the EC budget, or those which fear, like Italy, that their benefits will be eroded. Yet if the Community wants to create the political conditions for irrevocably fixed exchange rates between all members, it will have to accept the need to pay for it. It is accepted that preparing for Emu requires convergence of EC economies, but this process should not be viewed in a rigid way. The EC cannot, for example, sensibly pursue full income convergence among all member states, not least because it would send the wrong signals to the former communist countries of central Europe now queueing up for EC membership in the next decade. Yet fiscal transfers from stronger to weaker countries will help to cushion the effect of economic restructuring in the poorer members. Such restructuring is taking place anyway, but the pressure will probably be greater under the Emu process. Spain, for instance, is understandably making support for the Maastricht treaty dependent on greater efforts to finance economic 'cohesion'. Greater equity Any future EC budget arrangements must aim for greater equity in the provision of resources. The Commission plans to shift the mechanism for allocating contributions away from the present reliance on value added tax receipts towards a measure based more on countries' GNP. That is an overdue move towards more fairness. Another guiding principle is the need to maintain maximum pressure for reform of the common agricultural policy. Farm spending was about three-quarters of the Community budget in 1984-85. It is due to fall next year to less than half the total. For Mr Delors' overall spending plans to be credible, these reforms must be intensified. There are consequences for Britain, too. If the new direction taken by the Community at Maastricht is to be sustained, Britain will have to help foot the bill. The UK's Pounds 2bn a year rebate on its Community payments was negotiated by Mrs Margaret Thatcher in 1984, when the EC's financing structure and its ambitions looked very different. The UK must accept that the rebate will probably have to be renegotiated. The German government again made this point in Brussels yesterday. Some of the Maastricht signatories may have been under illusions about the consequences of the commitment to which they agreed. If Mr Delors has provided the opportunity for a clearer and more rational debate about the EC's budget strategy, then - not for the first time - he will have set the Community on the right course.</p>

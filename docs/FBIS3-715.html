			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The French Government today expressed delight at the  resumption of dialogue between Cameroon and Nigeria over the  disputed Bakassi Peninsula. At a news conference in Lagos the  French ambassador to Nigeria, Pierre Garrigue-Guyonnaud, said  his country fully supports the diplomatic efforts employed and  would very much wish that the two countries resolve their  dispute peacefully. Foreign news correspondent, Godfrey Odu,  reports that the envoy denied allegations that France is  aggravating the Bakassi dispute:    [Begin recording] [Odu] [Words indistinct] since the  Nigeria-Cameroon dispute over Bakassi came to a head last month.  Ambassador Garrigue-Guyonnaud explained that the response by  France to Cameroon's request for assistance was part of the  normal respect of commitment entered into between the two  sovereign nations, and not intended prejudice to the spirit of  peaceful settlement. He said that France has taken some  diplomatic initiatives on its own but refused to specify.    [Garrigue-Guyonnaud] It is difficult to say I agree with  you,  but it is important and difficult to say because it should be  confidential. But the only thing I can tell you is that we  encourage [words indistinct], and we think that there is room  for negotiations.    [Odu] Ambassador Garrigue-Guyonnaud said that in response to  the Cameroonian request, France sent some military assistance,  but that none of these have been deployed to the disputed  Bakassi. [sentence as heard] The ambassador said that the level  of French military aid to Cameroon has not increased since the  Bakassi crisis, adding that Nigeria as well as Cameroon are both  friends of France. NTA news took the ambassador up on charges of  aiding and abetting the Cameroonian efforts to internationalize  the dispute.    [Odu] You have provided legal assistance (?to Cameroon)  [passage indistinct]. But defense information has it that a  sizable number of French troops have landed in the Cameroon  along with unspecified quantities of arms and ammunition. From  calculations, French interests in Nigeria alone are said to far  outstrip her business interests in all of her former African  colonies put together. French companies are doing lucrative  business in many spheres of the Nigerian economy. Some of the  largest include ELF Nigeria Limited and Total in the petroleum  sector; [name indistinct] and SCOA [West African Trading  Company] in freighting, haulage, and trading; CFAO [West African  French Company] in the industrial and general goods sector, as  well as Peugeot Automobile Nigeria Limited, a leading car  assembly plant. There are those in the construction industry  such Bouygue and (Schlumbeger) in oil field services. These  account for billions of dollars accruing annually [words  indistinct] in foreign exchange earnings. [end recording]</p>

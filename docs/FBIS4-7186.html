			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii with </F> unidentified correspondents at the prime minister's official  residence in Tokyo -- live]    [Text] [Fujii] I have just been appointed as finance  minister by Prime Minister Hata. Because I also served as  finance minister in the Hosokawa cabinet, this is my second  appointment to the post, and I am ready to assume this post  again.    I would like to briefly review urgent issues first. As a  result of the recent 15.25 trillion-yen economic package, bright  spots can now be observed in the economy, although it is still  in a very delicate stage. To achieve full economic recovery, it  is necessary for the government to steadily implement this  comprehensive economic package. The package includes a tax  reduction plan worth 6 trillion yen, including 5.5 trillion-yen  in income tax cuts. I am very grateful that Diet members have  shown their understanding about this tax reduction plan, and  have endorsed relevant bills. Now that the new government has  been inaugurated, I will ask Diet members to start deliberations  on the fiscal 1994 budget.    This economic package also has to deal with bad assets owned  by financial institutions because assets inflation is still  causing distortions in the economy. Although we do not have  figures for the period ending March, I think inflation has begun  to abate. We will make further efforts to bring inflation to a  halt.    Next, as the new prime minister has said, we will promote  economic reforms by inheriting reform measures from the former  government. I think economic reforms are very important for the  future society and economy. One of the important reforms is to  establish an economic structure in which Japan can cooperate  with other countries through promoting deregulation, market  liberalization, the review of industrial structure, and other  measures. As far as the Finance Ministry is concerned, we have  to actively promote deregulation in the insurance and monetary  markets.    It is also very important that we establish an economic  structure that helps smoothly integrate a society of longevity  into Japan's society and economy. Of course, this is related to  issues concerning employment, regional societies, lifetime  education, and others. The Finance Ministry will promote  welfare policies to cover medical care, pensions, and nursing.  I think it is very important for the government to work out  measures to put burdens equally on the people to promote the  policies. Because it is no longer allowed to put heavier  burdens on working people, the former government decided to cut  an income tax, and considered increasing a consumption tax. It  is important to establish a structure in which the nation can  easily deal with the aging society while imposing light burdens  on working people. Of course, in parallel with this issue, the  government has to tackle such issues as promoting administrative  reform, and revising inequalities in the tax system. That is all  I want to say.    [Reporter] Mr. Fujii, since you have been named the finance  minister again, you continue to be in charge of the budget.  Because the Hata cabinet is a minority ruling government, it  will have rough going. What do you think of the new cabinet,  which is said to be short-lived?    [Fujii] As you said, the new cabinet is a minority ruling  government. But because the 1994 budget was compiled by many  people, including cabinet ministers who are not joining the new  cabinet, I think the budget has many points the largest  opposition Liberal Democratic Party can agree on. We will exert  utmost efforts to have the 1994 budget passed by seeking the  cooperation of the opposition parties, including the Liberal  Democratic Party.    [Reporter] The office of former Prime Minister Hosokawa  recently announced that the former premier had failed to declare  3 million-yen income. What do you think of Hosokawa's sense of  obligation to pay taxes? Also, what do you think of the popular  opinion that taxation on politicians is not severe?    [Fujii] First, I would like to say that it is people's  obligation to pay taxes. In particular, those who are engaged  in politics have to strictly fulfill this obligation. Although  I am entrusting the National Tax Administration Agency with  taxation, I want to stress that we should never be lenient  toward politicians. The ultimate and only goal for the Tax  Administration Agency is to carry out taxation equally to  everyone in accordance with the law. I want to stress this goal  will not change in any instance.    [Reporter] I would like to ask about the current economic  situation. The yen surged to 102 today. You mentioned  international cooperation, but do you think Japan can deal with  this issue in cooperation with the United States?    [Fujii] As I have repeatedly said in the Diet, I would like  to refrain from mentioning a specific level of yen exchange  rate. But at G-7 meetings in Washington last September and in  Frankfurt in February this year, and at the recent meeting in  Washington, I asserted that overly rapid foreign exchange  movements in one country are not only undesirable for the  nation's economy but also have negative effects on the world  economy. I believe G-7 finance leaders have a common  understanding about this. Therefore, we must respond to overly  rapid foreign exchange movements. And the level of exchange  rates should reflect the fundamentals of a nation's economy. As  G-7 nations have repeatedly said, we must promote policy  coordination in various fields. I think this is a common  understanding. With this stand, I will deal with the issue you  have mentioned.    [Unidentified dean of press corps] Thank you very much.    [Fujii] Thank you.</p>

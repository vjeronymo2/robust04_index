			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Business and the Law: Stampede for India overdue - Global firms must now expand on to the subcontinent During the last two years, the emerging Indian market has played second fiddle to China in the strategic thinking of most international law firms. In spite of its size (a population of 900m), the three-year-old economic liberalisation programme instituted by Narashima Rao, the Indian prime minister, has yet to convince western investors of India's secure long-term potential. British law firms must now turn their attention to India's immediate future. Otherwise they will lose the advantage they enjoy over their American rivals through traditional Anglo-Indian cultural links. Only three western law firms, White &amp; Case, Chadbourne &amp; Parke, and the UK's Ashurst Morris Crisp, have opened offices in India - in contrast to the stampede to open offices in Hong Kong and China. Others are bound to follow, but it is not yet clear when. Much legal business in India just now is generated by energy projects and by the continuing popularity of global depository receipts (GDRs) among western investors. GDRs, issued by depository banks, are a convenient method of purchasing shares in Indian companies and now account for the majority of emerging market paper listed on the Luxembourg stock exchange. Investment funds have also proved popular with investors during the last year. About 22 have now been set up. While this work can easily be handled from London or Hong Kong, mounting foreign direct investment in India, accelerating capital markets activity and infrastructure projects are all forcing lawyers to spend longer periods in the country. Foreign direct investment is expected to rise to Dollars 2bn next year and portfolio investment has now reached Dollars 4.1bn. Although below Chinese levels, these figures indicate steady positive growth. If India follows the Asian pattern, US law firms will only start to arrive in force when their chief institutional clients do the same. Most British law firms, however, have no such tradition to follow. There is therefore time for them to take advantage of historical Anglo-Indian links and of the fact that India's legal system is modelled along English lines. Yet Ashurst Morris Crisp, in Delhi, is the only British firm with an Indian office. Mr Philip Hurst, an Ashurst partner, says the firm opened an office there because of demand from UK clients active in the infrastructure field. 'Although as a firm we don't have many foreign offices, client pressure last year brought us to the conclusion there were huge opportunities for us in India,' he said. New Delhi as the centre of government is the best place for those firms looking to specialise in infrastructure project work. Chadbourne &amp; Parke, a firm which specialises in project finance, was the first foreign firm into India. Mr Greg Ullman, a Chadbourne partner, confirms Ashurst's thinking. 'When we pitch for work on infrastructure projects it definitely helps us to have an office here. But you need a niche area of practice in India. There is no point opening an office just hoping to build up a practice,' he said. Capital markets lawyers are forced to consider India's financial centre, Bombay, where commercial property rates are almost as high as Hong Kong. The process of opening an office can also be daunting. Administrative decisions are often a long time coming in India. And there is vocal resentment from some quarters of the Indian legal profession, looking to protect itself from 'the foreign onslaught' as it was described recently in the Indian Financial Express. Ironically, practising Indian law is not on the agenda for most foreign law firms, which are much happier referring domestic work to local law firms (which with their lower fee rates are often the preferred advisers on many joint ventures). Ashurst is not the only British firm active in the Indian market, however. Freshfields and Linklaters &amp; Paines stand out as lead advisers on the Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) Dabhol Power project, advising respectively MSEB, the state electricity board, and Enron, the US project company. The US firm White &amp; Case acted as advisers to the lenders. Freshfields hopes in the future to capitalise on its projects experience elsewhere in Asia, especially when the transport development programme goes on stream. Freshfields advised on the Malaysian North-South Highway project. Linklaters is also prominent in Indian capital markets work. Mr Nikhil Mehta, head of Linklaters' India business group, says: 'India really took off for us in 1992 when we acted for Reliance Industries on its global depository receipts issue.' Since then the firm has advised on 31 public issues. But the real challenge for firms looking to move into the Indian legal services market will be to develop their practices beyond their initial area of specialisation, he says. Capital markets work can be managed from outside India. But it is also frequently the area where competition between US and UK firms is strongest and the Americans will not be slow to set up in the market once investment banks provide the impetus. To pre-empt this, many lawyers believe British firms need to open in India now and develop broad-based practices in the infrastructure, foreign direct investment and capital markets fields. British foreign direct investment in India has only recently begun to pick up speed, but the recent British trade delegation underlined future intentions, with a strong presence from UK road construction companies. The delegation also received assurances that efforts would be made under the Indo-British Partnership Initiative, to facilitate British lawyers setting up in Indian cities. Simmons &amp; Simmons, Denton Hall and Masons are three City solicitors firms with well-developed Indian practices all facing the dilemma of exactly when to make the commitment. Denton Hall is active in the power sector and as Mr Henry King, its chairman, admits: 'if we opened, we would be looking to make the leap from that sector to capital markets.' But, he acknowledges, it is all a matter of timing. 'Rather like driving in India, you need excellent judgment and plenty of luck.' There is no doubt US lawyers intend to play an active role in India's development and White &amp; Case's Bombay office is a good indication of what may follow. It handles foreign direct investment, capital markets work and project work and expects to see rapid growth in Indian companies looking to raise finance from US offerings as Indian business restructures. That optimism looks well-founded given Wall Street's continuing infatuation with India. US analysts are confident that the Indian economic liberalisation programme has sufficient momentum and 144A offerings (private placements in the US) of Indian deals will become prominent. It is no surprise that White &amp; Case should be among the first into India - the firm has a record of moving quickly into new markets - but others will follow soon enough. Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &amp; Flom is already active in Indian markets as is Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett, which acted for the India Fund Inc in February. Mr John Lobrano, a Simpson partner says: 'We have strong relationships with all the major US banks and if they opened out there it could possibly prompt us to reconsider.' British law firms which fail to exploit their current advantage over US competitors could be making a serious strategic error which they will live to regret.</p>

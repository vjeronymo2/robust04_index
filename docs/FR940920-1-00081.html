			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The above costs for the guidelines are overall national costs spread over the entire existing MWC population. However, about one half of the affected waste flow from existing MWC's larger than 225 Mg/day already is combusted in facilities equipped with spray dryer/electrostatic precipitator (SD/ESP) or spray dryer/fabric filter (SD/FF) systems, and these MWC's would incur only a minor compliance cost (about $3/Mg) as a result of the proposed guidelines. The average annual cost of acid gas, PM, and Hg control per unit of MSW combusted at large plants that do not already have SD/ESP or SD/FF systems would be about $20/Mg.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The average annual cost per unit of MSW combusted at small plants using dry sorbent injection/electrostatic precipitator (DSI/ESP) systems and Hg control would be about $36/Mg.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The guidelines will have a wide range of impacts on the price of combustion services. To study these potential impacts, the EPA first applied a cost accounting procedure that approximates the one that would be used by an individual publicly owned MWC. Then, using a 1993 average tipping fee of $57/Mg of MSW combusted (1990 dollars) of waste combusted and assuming the full cost of meeting acid gas, PM, Hg, and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  requirements is passed directly to MWC customers, the EPA found that the lowest and highest tipping fee increases for the model plants used in the EPA's economic analysis would be $9 and $56, respectively, per megagram of MSW combusted. The majority of tipping fee increases would be in the $17 to $28/Mg range. (These estimates apply only to MWC's at small plants that do not already have DSI/ESP, SD/ESP, or SD/FF systems or large plants that do not currently have SD/ESP or SD/FF systems.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA projects that, regardless of how the regulatory costs are financed, most of the burden will find its way directly or indirectly to households served by MWC's. Costs that are directly assessed to households are likely to be in the form of increased collection fees and/or increased taxes. Indirect household costs are price increases charged by businesses that similarly are faced with increases in collection fees and/or taxes. For the guidelines being proposed today, the EPA projects an increase in the average annual household cost of waste disposal of about $25 for communities that have MWC's. The actual cost per household will depend on local conditions, including the extent to which recycling and landfilling are also used within the affected community. Approximately 62 percent of the total average household cost is a direct cost, thus the annual direct household cost would be approximately $15. The EPA estimates that the average annual household cost breaks down to $26 per year for communities over 250,000 in population; $24 for communities with populations between 100,000 and 250,000; $24 for communities with populations between 50,000 and 100,000; and $22 for communities with populations under 50,000. This range represents less than 1 percent of household income. The actual cost per household will depend on local conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA identified 39 private firms each of which owns one or more MWC's. Detailed financial data are published for only 17 of the firms projected to incur costs, none of which is small (under $6 million in annual sales). (Firms for which annual sales data are not available are assumed to be small.) The total annual cost of the guidelines as a percentage of sales averages less than 1 percent and ranges from less than 1 percent to about 80 percent for these 17 firms. Potential tipping fee increases, based on an assumed full cost pass-through (i.e., passing all control costs to consumers via the tipping fee) and an average tipping fee of $57/Mg, are about 18 percent for MWC's owned by small firms and about 14 percent for MWC's owned by large firms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some of the benefits of the emission guidelines have been quantified. The absence of sufficient exposure-response and valuation information precludes a comprehensive benefits analysis for many of the MWC pollutants. The EPA expects partial benefits for reduction of PM and SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , including benefits from reductions in morbidity and mortality, to total about $106 million annually. The total benefits would be higher if benefits from reductions of other pollutants were valuated. In addition, recent evidence suggests the mortality reduction benefits of particulate mater controls may be higher than is assumed in this analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Control Costs for Typical MWC Plants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The previous section presented costs of the proposal on a national basis. This section presents examples of typical retrofit costs that would be experienced at both a large MWC plant and a small MWC plant. These are typical costs. Lower costs will be experienced at MWC plants that have already installed the air pollution control components required by the proposal. Higher costs will be experienced for MWC plants with more difficult retrofit applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The costing data presented in this section are provided in the following formats: capital cost, annualized cost, and cost per Mg of municipal waste combusted. The costing information is subcategorized by air pollution control components (i.e., GCP upgrade, acid gas scrubber, activated carbon injection application, and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  control). For perspective, the estimated cost of combustion units is also displayed. Since the actual MWC unit cost for an existing combustion unit is sensitive to past funding practices, the EPA could not provide this cost. Instead, the EPA has provided the cost of combustion units for a new MWC plant for reference. This costing information has been derived from 1989 background information documents that were used in developing the 1991 NSPS and emission guidelines (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for more information about these documents), and is presented in 1987 dollars (the escalation factor for converting to mid-1990 dollars is 1.111).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> From table 3A, it can be noted that the capital cost for retrofit at a large existing MWC plant (980 Mg/day capacity) would be about $16.8 million of which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $13.6 million would be for the acid gas control, 2.9 million for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  control, and less than one million for activated carbon injection and GCP. On an annualized basis, the cost would be about $5.1 million/yr or about $16/Mg of waste combusted. This would increase baseline combustor cost from about $60/Mg combusted (based on the baseline combustor cost for a new large MWC plant presented in table 3B) to about $76/Mg combusted. Large MWC plants represent about 94 percent of the existing MWC combustion capacity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / International Company News: Ameritech and GE unite to develop data service group Ameritech, the Chicago-based telecommunications company, and General Electric, the US conglomerate, are joining forces in a information services business which will develop electronic commerce and inter-company communications. They announced yesterday that Ameritech would invest Dollars 472m in the newly formed company, while GE would contribute the assets of its General Electric Information Services division, which specialises in electronic data exchange and electronic commerce. The move came just 24 hours after Ameritech, in conjunction with its German partner Deutsche Telekom, was selected to take a stake in Matav, the Hungarian state telecoms concern, as part of eastern Europe's largest single privatisation deal. Ameritech's stake will cost it Dollars 437.5m. GE's information services division, which has revenues of Dollars 600m and is based in Rockville, Maryland, was founded in the 1960s as a computer time-sharing business and evolved into an electric commerce company in the 1980s when the personal computer revolution reduced demand for time-sharing. The business helps companies exchange documents electronically with suppliers and customers, increasing efficiency and eliminating paperwork. It advises on internal company communications. The new company initially will be wholly owned and operated by GE. Ameritech's investment will be a four-year convertible note which will convert into a 30 per cent equity stake when certain legal restrictions are removed.</p>

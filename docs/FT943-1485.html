			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: CP Rail offers CDollars 1.4bn for rival network CP Rail System, the railway subsidiary of Montreal-based conglomerate Canadian Pacific, has offered to pay CDollars 1.4bn (USDollars 1.04bn) for the eastern Canadian operations of government-owned Canadian National, Canada's other main railway. The bid follows a recent pattern of mergers and acquisitions throughout the North American rail industry as operators seek to expand their networks and improve competitiveness by combining resources. CP Rail and CN earlier this year discussed merging their eastern Canadian operations, which cover their entire network east of Chicago and Winnipeg. However, the two sides failed to agree on the value of their respective assets. Mr Barry Scott, CP Rail's chief executive, yesterday described the bid as 'a singular opportunity for both the Canadian government and Canadian taxpayers'. He noted that CP's offer would enable the government to privatise half of Canada's biggest public corporation and would substantially lower CN's debt. Canadian Pacific said that the purchase would be financ-ed from existing resources. CP's offer will be an important test of the economic policies of the Liberal government, which took office last October and has so far been lukewarm towards privatisations following a wave of disposals by the former Progressive Conservative government. While business interests favour privatisation, the CP bid is likely to be opposed by many other groups, ranging from trade unions to communities which may be in danger of losing their rail service. CP said yesterday that it would shut one of two lines serving the east coast port of Halifax, Nova Scotia. CP Rail said its offer would be open for 90 days. It urged the government to speed up the process of obtaining the required regulatory approvals for constructing rail connections and the eventual abandonment of surplus assets, as well as determining appropriate bargaining units for labour agreements. The takeover would come into effect on January 1 1996. CP said it would aim to cut the combined workforce of 16,500 people by about 2,500 over the first four years.</p>

			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Arts: Clinging to the wreckage - Bernard Kops is a survivor  -and a busy one The East End in the 1930s may have been poor in most respects, but it was rich in incipient playwrights. The young Harold Pinter, Arnold Wesker and Bernard Kops were all growing up in neighbouring streets. Today Pinter has retreated into near silence and Wesker is disgracefully neglected, but Kops is busier than ever, with a radio serial, Soho Nights, in pre-production and two new plays recently opened on the London stage. Kops is very much the junior member of the triumvirate: the Spender to Pinter's Auden and Wesker's Isherwood. His experiments in various media  - since 1955 he has published nine novels, six books of poetry and an autobiography as well as having 32 plays produced on radio and television and 15 on the stage - have left him undervalued by a critical establishment that regards versatility as the province of the Jack of all trades. He is now, however, reaping the benefit. 'Early on, I suffered because I didn't join a group; I was never an 'ism' or an 'ist'. But if you come in on a bandwagon, you go out on one; people who surround you and kiss your toes go away and find other toes to kiss. I had a letter from Wesker only this morning. He wrote that: 'it's great you're doing so well; I sadly am not. And the reason for that is there's no one to foreclose on me.' ' He offers an explanation for their conjunction of talents: 'Jewish families all had the gift of the gab. Look at market stalls and the way they use language, with everyone talking the whole time. We were a bit like the brat pack of Jewish painters: Domberg, Rosenberg and Certler, who sat in the Cafe Royal full of chutzpah, refusing to accept their position in life. There was an anarchistic element in our background and a tremendous desire to escape from desperate circumstances.' There was also a teacher in the background, the legendary Marianne Watson, who ran evening classes at Toynbee Hall - 'I think Harold and Arnold also went' - and introduced him to a dramatic tradition quite unknown in his impoverished immigrant home. 'The only cultural connection was a Dutch band, Joe Kops and the Hot Shots.' As soon as he could, he escaped his family 'to find my identity', but he has since returned to it constantly in his novels and plays. His escape route was the streets of Soho: 'a world of immorality, prostitution, mad, passionate love and everything that was opposed to family life'. But the release proved too radical: 'I had an incredible breakdown and spent a year in hospital.' Soon afterwards he married and fathered four children. It's tempting to see his subsequent development as an attempt to marry the two extremes of his nature: the rootless, Bohemian, Soho side and the family man. In conversation, he constantly acknowledges his debt to Erica, who gave up her medical studies to marry him. She even inspired his first play. 'When my wife was having a baby, I was very jealous; I felt excluded from some mystery. Then one evening, in our flat in Camberwell, she was sitting in bed knitting and I was struck by the sense that I had done nothing with my life. It was that that set me to work.' The result was The Hamlet of Stepney Green, an international success and the archetypal Kops play, with its ghosts and songs and folk-lore; for, like Chagall, he 'paints his dreams'. But the innovative stagecraft was no academic experiment: 'It was all around me. My mother was a woman who, if she couldn't express herself in language, would burst into song . . . Joan Littlewood, who was supposed to direct the premiere, told me 'You may not be aware but you've recreated traditional Yiddish theatre in this play.' I replied: 'It didn't come from eastern Europe; eastern Europe comes from me.' ' But success reawakened his demons. 'There's a problem. You're inspired by the background you spring from and then you're cut off; so where do you draw your sustenance? Until you stabilise yourself, you're left floating in a miasma. Creativity leads you up some dark paths; you have to come to terms with aggressive instincts and fears. The theatre is very dangerous when you're vulnerable.' After a second breakdown, it became too dangerous. He turned from plays to novels. 'It's essential if you have a lot of creativity and energy to continue working or else you get tied up inside and no new energy can find you.' But, while he was protected from the theatre's public exposure, he found the lack of feedback frustrating: 'There's never a sense of occasion, a time when you think 'let's open the Australian champagne'.' Over all the years and across the various media, his basic preoccupations have remained constant. 'The underlying theme I think I've got is clinging to the wreckage: how to survive the journey between life and death and not to be mugged on the way - by yourself. Most people have similar desires and fears. I'm interested in universalities and how to cope with it all.' For a Jew of his generation, the overwhelming fear has been that of the Holocaust. Even now his eyes fill with tears as he recalls the murder of most of his Dutch family by the Nazis and the post-war compensation of Pounds 5 from the German government. 'Pounds 5 for your entire family] I knew a poet in Soho, who was on his uppers; so I gave it to him.' He is currently confronting the evils of fascism in Dreams of Anne Frank, at the Polka Young People's Theatre, Wimbledon. The play is suitable for anyone over the age of 10, but he believes it essential to target a younger audience. 'We underestimate the ability of children to take in such things.' He feels a personal link with Anne in that his German translator, Rosey Pool, had been her tutor before the war, and 'she often spoke to me of her.' Meanwhile at Greenwich, Harry Landis and Joanna Lumley are appearing in the two-hander, Who shall I Be Tomorrow?, about neighbours who enjoy an intense relationship in Belsize Park. He heaps praise on the actors: 'Joanna Lumley's so clever. The part is very threatening to her; she has great courage in taking it on . . . and Harry Landis never resorts to that cliched Jewish performance, which Solomon describes as 'the little Jewish tailor with his glasses on, and the little Jewish tailor with his glasses off.' Nor does Bernard Kops; one senses that all his performances are unique, even though he inquires plaintively why so many Jewish writers of his age look the same, describing himself as 'like Ben Gurion, but less wild'. He continues to write obsessively. 'What drives me now is fear of the scrapheap. I've always been very motivated. It goes back to the East End where you had to be up and running. Even as a kid I had to cross the road before everyone else.' He has no plans to stop working. 'To me writing is like breathing; I hope they both snuff out at the same time. I always have to have a project ahead with a title; it's almost as if it's the only thing that proves a future.' And he remains terrified of death. 'I'm not a religious man, not really; I wish I could say not at all. I'm not afraid of the past and confronting my ghosts, just of extinction. The idea of not being here to see my grandchildren grow up seems an impertinence.' Finally, conveying a strange blend of serenity and nervous energy, he confesses: 'I'm not ambitious. I've lived the life that I want to live; all I want is a continuation of the same. If you're enjoying a beautiful day with people you love, you don't ever want it to end.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Strasbourg, April 13 (AFP) -- PLO Chairman Yasir  'Arafat Wednesday [13 April] condemned attacks against "innocent  Israelis" in a speech to the European Parliament here, after six  people were killed in a bomb attack.    He was talking after learning that a bomb had exploded on a  bus at station north of Tel Aviv, killing six Israelis and  injuring 21 others.    Arafat said: "These attacks are just targeting innocent  people on both sides, Israelis and Palestinians, and do nothing  but strike at the heart of the peace process."    "All extremist forces on both sides, Israeli and  Palestinian,  have thrown themselves into a kind of escalation which cannot be  halted."    The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas claimed responsibility  for the attack saying it was the second of five planned to  avenge February's mosque massacre in Hebron.    Police spokesman Arik Ben Chen told AFP the bomb exploded  near the back door of the Afula to Tel Aviv bus at Hadera, 45  kilometres (27 miles) north of Tel Aviv. The attack happened on  Israel's memorial day for its fallen soldiers.</p>

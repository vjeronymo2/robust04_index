			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee and cocoa futures prices slide to fresh lows LONDON ROBUSTA coffee and cocoa prices continued their declines to new lows yesterday, while in New York the July arabica coffee contract had fallen below 60 cents a lb by midday. London's July robusta contract plunged nearly Dollars 40 a tonne to a 22-year low of Dollars 678 a tonne before recovering to Dollars 690, down Dollars 26 on the day. July cocoa closed only Pounds 1 above a new 16 1/2  year low of Pounds 574 a tonne. Producers with abundant supplies of both coffee and cocoa have this year been faced with the stark fact that consumers have high stocks, and see no need to buy. 'Producers have to sell for what they can get,' said Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with London futures broker GNI. Stocks of coffee held in importing countries have now reached 90m bags (60 kg each) - probably twice the required level, according to Mr Peter Kettle, analyst with ED &amp; F. Man, the London trade house. Mr Eagles also pointed out that the markets had become increasingly oligopolistic, with few trade houses and few consumers. He cited a recent Unctad report pointing to 'a shrinking number of participants in many commodity markets' with increasing power to influence prices through actions such as holding stocks.</p>

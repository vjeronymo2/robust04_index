			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / US marines prepare first deep land penetration in Somalia US Marines and army troops were preparing last night to make their first deep land penetration of the starvation-ridden interior of Somalia, writes Julian Ozanne in Mogadishu. According to US military officials, marines will start a 24-hour operation this morning to take control of Baidoa, the 'City of Death' at the centre of Somalia's hunger zone where up to 100 people are dying each day in that town alone. US officials said troops would today begin moving out of Mogadishu in a 70-vehicle armoured convoy and a score of helicopters along the bandit-plagued dirt road to Baidoa, roughly 150 miles north-west of the capital. By evening the road should be secured by 'Humvee' armoured cars and Cobra-helicopter flying patrols. Special forces commandos would move into positions around Baidoa by nightfall to prepare for an advance on the town at dawn tomorrow. In total 600 to 700 troops, including a small contingent of French soldiers, would be used. In Mogadishu confusion was still apparent among US forces about their exact role in disarming bandits, freelance gunmen and rival clan-militias. Col Fred Peck, the marines' spokesman, said he had received no orders to disarm Somalis and described the policy on disarmament as a 'very ambiguous situation'. He was speaking after Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, said at the weekend President George Bush had discreetly promised to disarm the warring factions. Michael Littlejohns adds from New York: Mr Boutros Ghali played down any policy difference with the Americans at a news conference in New York. Given that the UN must also be consulted before coalition troops could withdraw, he would try to ensure there was adequate security in Somalia to enable the world body then to begin a new peacekeeping operation and efforts at national reconciliation.</p>

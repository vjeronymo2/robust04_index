			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yuriy Nikolayev report: "AL-QUDS Receives Guests"] </F>   [Text] The start of the Palestine Days in Moscow and the  festival of the AL-QUDS newspaper was marred by another  provocation against this publication. On Friday night  Muscovites and visitors to the capital who were heading for the  Central Tourist Office in Leninskiy Prospekt were stopped by  militia cordons and volunteer forces. The bewildered  participants in the planned ceremonies were told: We have found  out that an explosive device has been planted in the concert  hall of the Tourist Office, and you are not allowed to go in  there.... The plan was simple: Of course people would not go  in if there was a bomb there, they would stand about at the  entrance for a while, and then go away. However, the organizers  of the provocation miscalculated.    Later, when it was established that there were no explosive  devices there, the assembled company filled the capacious hall  to overflowing....    The festival went on for three days, and each of these days  ended with soirees at the Central Tourist Office. And I can say  with certainty that these soirees left the guests and the hosts  with nothing but good impressions. From talking to the  initiator of the festival, the publisher of the AL-QUDS (Holy  City) newspaper, Doctor Shaaban Khafiz Shaaban. From the  conversations and speeches of famous Russian politicians and  public figures. Ruslan Khasbulatov, Ilya Konstantinov, Stanislav  Terekhov, Yegor Ligachev, Sazhi Umalatova, Vladislav Achalov,  and Valentin Chikin...were greeted warmly and sincerely by the  meeting participants. Maybe Aleksandr Nevzorov got more  applause than the others, but there is an explanation for this.  First, the participants in the festivities greeted him as a  State Duma deputy and then as a famous television journalist,  and then they greeted his first movie, "Miracle-working," on the  bloody events of October 1993....    Artistes Aleksandr Vedernikov, Ivan Yakushin, Valentin  Tsvetkov, Tamara Kartintseva, and Tatyana Filimonova, and  amateur Palestinian and Russian ensembles certainly enhanced  these soirees and gave people a lot of pleasure.</p>

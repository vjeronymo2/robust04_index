			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / International Company News: GDA set to join European white goods partnership GENERAL Domestic Appli-ances (GDA), the Anglo-American maker of white goods, is about to join a European partnership with the leading French and Spanish suppliers of household appliances. GDA, which is owned jointly by GEC of the UK and General Electric of the US, said it would shortly join Temfa, an 18-month-old partnership of Thomson Electromenager (TEM) of France and Fagor, the leading Spanish white goods group. The partnership aims to pool purchasing of jointly-used components, to share research ideas and technology, and to give its members the opportunity to sell each others' products under their own individual brand names. While this is only a limited alliance, it unites the third-largest domestic appliance group in Europe after Electrolux of Sweden and Bosch-Siemens of Germany. GDA's main brands are Hotpoint, Creda, Jackons and Cannon. TEM, a subsidiary of the state-owned Thomson electronics group, sells as Brandt, Thermor, Thomson and Vedette among others. Fagor sells under its own name, as well as White Westinghouse, Edesa and Aspes. All three companies are leaders in their countries and have teamed up to achieve the greatest economies of scale which are possible within the continued fragmentation of regional tastes in the European white goods market. This is 'a response to the growing segmentation of the white goods market, which in contrast to brown goods (audio-visual equipment) differs sharply from one continent to another, even from one region to another,' said Mr Henri Lagarde, the chairman of TEM. The partnership is set up under European Community law as a European economic interest grouping, a simple structure designed to encourage cross-border alliances, but which does not include industrial joint ventures. Mr Bruce Enders, GDA's managing director, hoped the deal would allow his group to enlarge its product range by sourcing from its partners, as well as to sell some of its own products to the continental European partners for sale under their brand names. This is the latest stage in TEM's campaign to strengthen its product range, following a joint venture to make microwave ovens with Toshiba, the Japanese electronics group in 1989; the formation of Temfa in 1990; and a joint venture last year to make electric ovens and hobs with De Dietrich, one of France's last independent producers of home appliances.</p>

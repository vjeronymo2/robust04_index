			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Markets: Fixed rates: hurry while stocks last - Serious Money Short-termism is one of the curses of the investing classes. So, it is doubly satisfactory to find a financial decision which makes sense on both a short and a longer term argument - and trebly satisfactory when it is one open to millions of ordinary people. For all we are talking about is an ordinary fixed-rate mortgage. Let us start with the short-term arguments. Fixed-rate mortgages became popular more than a year ago as home-owners came up for air after several years of sky-high loan rates. Estimates are that half to three-quarters of all new mortgage business is at fixed rates. And while interest rates hit the floor at the beginning of February, even after their recent rise you can still get a mortgage fixed for five years at around 7.5 to 8 per cent. But hurry while stocks last. Prices of gilt-edged securities have been tumbling rapidly in the past few days. Fixed-interest mortgage rates are linked to gilt yields. Thus, some of the present mortgage offers could be withdrawn soon. Indeed, it is happening already. The Woolwich has altered its rates for five-year fixed-rate mortgages twice in the past 10 days: from 6.95 to 7.45 per cent, and on up to 7.99 yesterday. (See page IV for more details of existing offers). While rates remain as low as 8 per cent, you have the pleasant anomaly that you are paying much the same as you would for a variable-rate mortgage. Fixed money normally costs more. That is an argument that will appeal even to the deeply myopic. Far more important is the outlook for interest rates over the next few years. UBS Phillips and Drew, for instance, is expecting base rates virtually to double to 10 per cent by the end of next year, which suggests that even variable-rate mortgages could be back over the 11 per cent mark. So much for the brave new non-inflationary world of the 1990s. Of course, not everybody agrees with that estimate. But it is hard to find anyone who thinks that interest rates can go significantly lower even this year, and most agree that any further dip will be very short-lived. So, that leaves very little to go for on the downside and lots of risk on the upside. For new borrowers, the arguments in favour of a fixed rate are pretty conclusive. They appear to be balanced more finely when it comes to trading in your existing mortgage for one with a fixed rate. Re-financing normally costs around Pounds 1,000 by the time you have paid the clutch of different charges that keep the financial services salesmen so sleek. Thus, rates need to rise to make the switch worthwhile. The higher they rise, the sooner you will cover the switching costs. But there is another deterrent to consider. Most fixed-rate mortgage lenders have substantial penalties for borrowers who want to pay off their loans early. So, fixing your mortgage too far ahead could prove almost as expensive as failing to fix it at all. The long-term arguments are more debatable and will not appeal to those who enjoy the thrill of outwitting the markets. They come down to the old truism that to finance a long-term asset with variable-rate money leaves you vulnerable to the whims of the market. Assuming your income is relatively stable, why not fix this main chunk of your outgoings too? After all, around 250,000 people whose homes have been repossessed can testify that the whims of the market can prove extremely painful. At this time of the year, the most unlikely people start asking for financial advice. Even journalists. FT readers, being less feckless, undoubtedly have done all their year-end tax planning already. Our detailed advice was published on March 12. But for those of you who have spent the past few weeks on Mars, here is a brief recap of some of the main points to check before April 5. Pre-paying fuel bills before VAT comes in on April 1. This is levied at 8 per cent initially, rising to 17.5 per cent in a year's time. If you can afford the outlay, it makes sense to pay now for some of the fuel you expect to use. Electricity, gas and oil companies all have arrangements helping you to do so. (See Briefcase on Page X and Weekend FT, March 19). Capital gains tax planning. This is going to be relevant to an unusually large number of people this year, thanks to the strong rise in stock markets over the past 12 months. The basic aim is to ensure you make full use of your Pounds 5,800 tax-free allowance, since it cannot be carried forward. (See CGT, Page VIII). Personal equity plans (Peps). You can shield up to Pounds 9,000 of investments from both income and gains tax each tax year. Administration costs sometimes cancel out the income tax savings in the early years of a Pep, and they are less use to people paying only the basic rate of tax. But, longer term, the protection from CGT is well worth having. And if you have investments already, a Pep is well worth considering. (Our survey was published on February 26). Making additional voluntary contributions to pension schemes. You need to get your contributions in by April 5 if you want tax relief against your income for 1993-94. If, however, you expect a pay rise which would take you into a higher tax bracket next year, it could make sense to hold fire.</p>

			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VOTERS OK BUSINESS PARK NEAR RACE TRACK  </P> <P> City voters Tuesday overwhelmingly approved plans to develop a 75-acre business  park next to the Los Alamitos Race Track, ending more than four years of  disputes and lawsuits.  </P> <P> "This election finally puts to rest a great controversy in our community," said  Mayor Pro Tem John Kanel. "The new owners (of the race track) are to be highly  commended."  </P> <P> Approval of Tuesday's ballot measure allows the rezoning of 75 acres next to  the track for the development of the Cypress Business and Professional Center,  which will include office buildings and a motel.  </P> <P> Last September, a group of Sacramento businessmen led by Lloyd Arnold bought  the 298-acre property for $71 million from Hollywood Park Realty Enterprises.  They have gained the support of a citizens group and local officials during  months of talks.  </P> <P> Tuesday's election put to rest more than four years of disputes involving the  race course.  </P> <P> In 1986, Hollywood Park Realty asked the City Council to rezone the land for  another business development, Cypress Plaza. The council approved the zone  change. However, facing mounting citizen opposition, the council reversed the  decision.  </P> <P> In 1987, a coalition of Cypress residents won voter approval of Measure D,  which returned the race track parcel to semipublic use. Measure D also mandated  voter approval of further zoning changes.  </P> <P> Hollywood Park sued the city over Measure D. Later, an Orange County Superior  Court judge invalidated the measure. The city appealed.  </P> <P> The owners were thwarted once again in their effort to develop the property in  1989 when residents overwhelmingly rejected Cypress Downs, a 167-acre  development proposal. Hollywood Park then proceeded with its $125-million  lawsuit against the city.  </P> <P> With the approval of the rezoning, Arnold plans to put the 75 acres up for  sale. He has already spent more than $3 million refurbishing the race track and  an adjacent golf course.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Election Returns  </P> <P> Cypress Business and Professional Center Initiative  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.76IN:1.67IN:1.67IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 100% Precincts Reporting  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Votes  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> %  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Yes  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3,284  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 86.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> No  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 520  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 13.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Turnout  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 17.6%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Lech Walesa today signed the law on the  1994 budget. This information was passed on to us by the  president's Press Office staff. The president previously  criticized the budget, which had been passed by the Sejm, for  not taking into account social expectations and particularly for  failing to keep the promises given by the government parties  during the course of last year's election campaign.    Today's decision was preceded by consultations the president  conducted among various circles. Andrzej Drzycimski, press  spokesman for the Belweder, recently explained that Walesa had  asked the question whether to sign or not to sign many times and  had received various answers.    The government coalition argued that the president could not  refuse to sign the budget, which had been adopted by the  government and passed by parliament, because this would be  against state interests.    At a meeting of the Council for Local Government Affairs at  the Belweder, the president announced that he intends to veto  the electoral law for parish councils. He said he will be  prepared to accept the law, provided the local government  elections are postponed until next year.    [begin Walesa recording] My assessment of local government  is  quite good or even very good. For this reason, in this  complicated situation, I wanted to postpone the election for a  year, but it has not worked. The coalition wants to have its  own people. This is normal. That is why, no matter what I do,  I will not have time to make another move. If I had another two  months, I could do it. There was social pressure. They are not  strong enough not to change their minds. But I do not have  enough time. My only possibility is the electoral law, whether  it should be the old one or the new one. I am convinced that the  new one should not be introduced.    Now, either changes are introduced, or I will insist on my  veto of the new law. They will not have time to introduce  changes. The choice will be either to change the law and  postpone it for a year, or retain the old electoral law. [end  recording]    [Announcer] The council supported the president's position.  Let me remind you that the council's members are representatives  of local government assemblies and the Union of Polish Cities,  as well as academics and parliament members responsible for  local government affairs.</p>

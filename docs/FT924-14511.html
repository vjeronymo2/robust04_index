			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Opt-out school funds squeezed THE government's campaign to persuade schools in England and Wales to opt out of local-authority control ran into further trouble yesterday with the release of an Education Department letter warning of a squeeze in capital funding for opted-out schools. Mrs Ann Taylor, the shadow education secretary, who published the letter, said: 'This shows that the long-term future of grant-maintained status will involve underfunding.' The letter instructs opted-out (grant-maintained) schools not to submit bids for capital spending on libraries, sixth-form blocks, sports halls or performing-arts facilities. 'In the climate of limited funds there are greater demands to be met,' it says. It will cause considerable disappointment to grant-maintained schools, many of which opted out in the expectation that funding for such projects would be more readily available from the government than from local authorities. The letter goes on to tell grant-maintained schools, whose capital funding comes directly from the government, that because of the tight public-spending round and the growth of the opted-out sector 'the government is unable to offer schools the guarantee that the (existing funding) formula will continue or that funds can be rolled over to the next financial year.' Head teachers told their pay review body yesterday that the introduction of performance-related pay for teachers would be a 'recipe for discontent' unless an extra 5 per cent was given to each successful school. The National Association of Head Teachers said it had 'substantial reservations' about merit pay, but would defer judgment until it had studied any scheme piloted in schools. The teachers' pay review body will outline proposals in January for extending performance pay. In an initial paper, it favoured a scheme rewarding academically successful schools with a cash bonus. However, Mr John Patten, education secretary, has criticised the idea, calling instead for individual payments for successful teachers so all have an incentive to improve their performance. Mr David Hart, NAHT general secretary, said ministers and the review body should agree to abandon performance pay it if became 'evident that it will not work'.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department received two comments on this provision. One commenter noted that while the preamble to the NPRM contained a provision requiring that the requested documents be relevant to the issues under appeal, the regulatory language did not contain that requirement. The commenter suggested that the Department adopt the standard set forth in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The second commenter opposed the assessment of fees for the production of documents. The commenter noted that since only governmental agencies are participating in the review of the QC claim, the Department ought to forgo the assessment of fees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department has considered the comment concerning the issue of the relevancy of the documents and has decided to revise &sect;283.12(b)(3) to be consistent with Rule 26(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has considered the comment concerning the assessment of fees for the production of documents and has decided not to adopt it. The Department believes that it is consistent and equitable that the costs of the search and duplication of documents under a request for production be borne by the party making the request. State agencies may submit such costs for reimbursement under 7 CFR part 277. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Postponements or delays: In &sect;283.12(b)(4) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that the hearing or other proceedings of the appeal process would not be postponed or delayed pending a response to or resolution of issues pertaining to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter strongly disagreed with the proposal that no delays or postponements of the QC appeal occur pending receipt of documents requested under FOIA. The commenter argued that documents requested under FOIA may be crucial to the resolution of the appeal and suggested that either a timeline should be imposed for furnishing documents requested under the FOIA or delays/postponements should be accepted as part of the process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department has considered this comment but has decided not to adopt it. The Department has established procedures for the production of documents which would negate the need for a party to the appeal to pursue document production under the provisions of FOIA. As provided for in &sect;283.12(b)(3) of the NPRM, the parties to the appeal are afforded the opportunity under the discovery process to request all documents relevant to the issues under appeal or which would reasonably lead to the discovery of such documents. In addition, the ALJ will establish the deadline by which all discovery activities must be completed. While the Department must process the FOIA and provide all responsive nonprivileged documents, it is inappropriate to delay or postpone the QC appeal pending action on the FOIA request. This also furthers congressional intent to streamline the appeals process. This section has been renumbered in the final rulemaking as &sect;283.12(i). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Witnesses and Exhibits: In &sect;283.12(b)(9)(ii) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that a witness whose name did not appear on the list of witnesses would not be permitted to testify at the hearing. In addition, exhibits which were not provided to the opposing party 15 days prior to the hearing would not be admitted into evidence at the hearing absent a showing of cause. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department received two comments on this provision. The commenters argued that there may be situations where a witness identified on an exchanged list is unavailable to testify at the hearing. However, the party may have a substitute witness not identified on the exchanged list who is available to testify. The party should be permitted to amend the list upon a showing of cause. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter noted that there are circumstances where it is unnecessary to exchange documents during the prehearing process because those documents are already in the possession of each party through their normal course of business. The commenter argued that under this circumstance the regulation should require that the parties need only identify documents in the possession of the opposing party and notice an intention to introduce them at the hearing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department has considered the comment concerning witnesses and has revised the regulations to clarify that it is the intent of the Department that in those situations where a party shows cause as to the reason a witness's name did not appear on the witness list, upon motion and approval by the ALJ, that witness will be permitted to testify at the hearing. The Department also wishes to clarify that if this situation arises, the other parties to the appeal may request a delay in the hearing to allow for an opportunity to prepare for this previously unidentified witness. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has considered the comment concerning the exchange of documents and has determined that adoption of this suggestion is unnecessary since &sect;283.11(a)(3) of the NPRM provides the parties with the option of either furnishing copies or a list of documents that the party anticipates relying upon at the hearing. Since exhibits are not necessarily previously existing documents which are in the possession of the other party, the Department is retaining the provision concerning the exchange of exhibits. This section of the NPRM has been moved in the final rulemaking to &sect;283.15(d). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

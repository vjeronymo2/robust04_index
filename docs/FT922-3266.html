			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Letter: Cadbury: divisions over ownership and accountability (4) Sir, Surely an attempt to repair the fractured interface between owners and managers of businesses by interposing an additional layer (of non-executive directors) must fail. Two additions to company law may bridge the gap: The remuneration of each executive director must be approved each year at the annual general meeting; Dividends may only be paid out of current cash earnings. These would certainly ensure good attendance at AGMs and create awareness as a first step to governance. Walter Grant Scott, Walter Scott &amp; Partners, Millburn Tower, Gogar, Edinburgh EH12 9BS</p>

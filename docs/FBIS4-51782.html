			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 27 (YONHAP) -- South Korean and  Japanese military aircraft will not have to be scrambled so  often after the two nations' defense ministers agreed to provide  prior notification of their flight schedules, officials at the  Defense Ministry here said Wednesday.    South Korean Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae and his Japanese  counterpart Kazuo Aichi agreed Tuesday to prevent confusion in  identifying planes flying over the open sea by providing advance  notice of their flight schedules near the zone.    They also decided not to scramble their military aircraft in  principle if the other country's flight schedule for the "air  defense identification zone" had been reported previously,  according to the officials. In the past, the two nations' Air  Forces had to scramble their planes in a bid to prevent foreign  aircraft from violating their territorial airspace when South  Korean or Japanese planes flew over the open sea where both have  air defense "pickets."    Frequent scrambling of military aircraft, however, has  increased the danger of Japan's and Korea's planes clashing or  firing on each other and become an urgent bilateral issue.  South Korea first raised the issue when former Japanese Defense  Minister Yozo Ishikawa visited Seoul in 1990, and since then  working-level officials from the two nations have held several  meetings in Seoul and Tokyo.    The airspace where both countries have air defense pickets  is  below 37 degrees east longitude near the Japanese islands of  Kyushu and Tsushima, defense officials said. The two nations  are soon expected to discuss prevention of accidents on the  basis of the ministers' agreement.</p>

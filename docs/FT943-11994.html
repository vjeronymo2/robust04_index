			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Regulators given guidance on risk The Basle committee guidelines on managing risk in derivatives - issued yesterday to banking supervisors - emphasise that dealers should be guided by written policy documents laying out how much risk banks' directors will tolerate. They say that bank boards should be informed regularly of the risk exposure of their institution, and re-evaluate their risk management policies consistently. They say boards must also ensure clear lines of management responsibility. Those dealing foreign exchange, derivatives and other traded instruments should be able to mark their positions to market prices at least daily, while some bigger institutions should be able to do so in real-time. The Basle guidelines say banks should emphasise strongly assessments of credit risk to companies to which they are selling complex and over-the-counter derivative products such as swaps, which may carry exposures for several years. They say the heavy use of computerised systems in the trading of derivatives means banks must make contingency plans for interruptions to normal processing. Regular reviews of technical equipment may help reduce risks. The Basle guidelines say that banks should review the legal structure of the countries in which they are operating before entering derivatives transactions, to make sure their customers' obligations can be legally enforced. Guidelines issued simultaneously by the technical committee of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions say evolving technology permits 'the engineering of increasingly complex financial instruments'. Iosco says this also allows market participants to unbundle different forms of risk. The products 'have risk profiles that are more difficult to analyse than simpler, one-dimensional financial products'. Iosco's guidelines say there are some differences in perspective with the Basle guidelines because of traditional differences of supervisory style, but both banks and securities regulators believe in strong management controls. The Iosco guidelines say: The framework of risk management policies overseen by boards of directors should specifically cover derivatives activity, establish responsibility for its implementation and provide for accurate and timely management reporting. The speed of evolution and complexity of derivatives products means firms should devote 'adequate resources' to all aspects of risk management controls, including back office systems, accounting and supervision. Firms should use risk reduction techniques, such as master agreements, netting exposures, collateralising transactions and third party credit enhancement, including letters of credit and guarantees. Firms should - both on an entity and group basis - be able to make accurate risk valuations daily and to identify concentrations of risks. Exposures may be netted providing netting arrangements are enforceable. Management controls should provide for independent credit risk management at the firm. This would set measurement standards and credit limits, and review leverage, concentration and risk reduction measures.</p>

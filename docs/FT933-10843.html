			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Management: A cross-cultural minefield - The surprises that ensued when British managers set out to teach the Russians western skills At 9am nearly half the training course had retired with a hangover. Two more had vanished, apparently conducting a romance. And though the rest seemed eager to learn about management skills, several more were stuck in Moscow, awaiting their correct papers. By the traditions of Russian industry, this may have been nothing new. But for the British organisers of the seminar it was a vivid reminder that teaching western management skills to a Russian audience is, at best, an unpredictable task. Few doubt that the Russians will need a heavy investment in training to help their economy undergo transformation. But the type of business training that is appropriate - and how it can be imparted in an effective manner - is an issue that remains a potential cross-cultural minefield. This particular exchange, arranged between Moscow Business School and Henley Management College, and sponsored by Digital, set out to address a key question: in a culture which has had no experience of western-style management or personnel skills, how do you create responsible and decisive managers? Or, to use the management training terms, how do you set about 'empowering' ex-bureaucrats? To tackle the theme, the 10 Russians, some from business, others from the Moscow Business School, were allowed to window-shop on a range of western management theories - British Petroleum told them about personnel strategy, Dun and Bradstreet spoke about human resource management, while Digital representatives lectured on issues ranging from the EC to employee empowerment. In an atmosphere of polite bemusement, the Russians were handed a series of 'machine sense tools' - not unlike multi-coloured designer toys - and told to analyse them in a session on confidence building and decision making. 'It has long been argued that if you give people the freedom and tell them they have it, they will be empowered,' said Helen Kelly, an American psychologist, who devised the exercise as a means of teaching employees and troubled teenagers self confidence and innovation. 'It's very exciting to see what can happen with this,' echoed Derek Thomson, a management consultant with Kodak, who explained that his company had already used the exercise on the factory floor in the US, with some 'very encouraging' results. 'The best thing is that it can be used in any language.' The Russians, who seemed as intrigued by the glue sticks and complimentary Kodak cameras as the toys themselves, obediently set to work. By the end of the morning, they had produced a range of paper machines, on which some chose to express their creativity by doodling designs. 'The thing about this is that you can learn to do things you thought you couldn't,' explained Kelly, through an interpreter, who had gainfully succeeded in translating 'empowerment' but had rather more problems translating the word 'fun'. And what did the Russians think they had learnt? 'It's all been very unusual, but I am not sure that I can use it in my work with customs regulations,' admited Natalia Koulikova, who worked in international trade at the Moscow Business School. Marina Mdivani, a professor in human resource management, was rather more hopeful. Russian managers desperately need, she said, to learn the principles of conflict, control and personnel management. And, indeed, she found the 'empowerment' message both fascinating and apt. 'But the problem is that we don't have very much money for all these exercises now,' she said. 'Most managers are more concerned with profits than playing with paper games.'</p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Labour councillors attack Brent over housing policy Labour yesterday sought to intensify pressure on the Conservatives by alleging that the London borough of Brent, Conservative-controlled since 1991, had used similar housing policies to neighbouring Westminster city council. The charges were denied by Mr Irwin Van Colle, chairman of Brent's housing committee. He said: 'The amount of gerrymandering the Labour authorities have done is quite staggering, but they can always turn around and say they have a duty to house the homeless.' Brent has introduced a 'portable right to buy' scheme in which tenants who do not want to buy in their own area are allowed to buy in an area which is 'more desirable'. Flats are kept empty while buyers are sought. Mr Cyril Shaw, Labour's housing spokesman on the council, said that about 200 properties were left empty at any one time. Housing associations, whose tenants are thought likely to vote Labour, are not being given permission to build in the more affluent north of the borough, which has a Tory MP, Sir Rhodes Boyson. The bulk of the most attractive sites for new housing association homes are in the north, say housing experts. Yet investment is being concentrated in the south of the borough, which is Labour-dominated and represented in parliament by the Labour MPs Mr Ken Livingstone and Mr Paul Boateng. Conservatives refused planning permission for a scheme by Paddington Churches Housing Association to build 10 new flats in Sudbury, which is in Gladstone, the most marginal ward in the borough. Mr Van Colle said: 'We have been deluged as an administration with complaints from owner-occupiers who've suddenly found that the new development that was supposedly going to be private-sector homes suddenly becomes social housing with homeless families in the midst of their area. 'We perceive it as a perfectly reasonable thing to represent the views of owner-occupiers who have just as many rights as homeless families.' He said the council's policy was to return housing associations to their 'original purpose' of rehabilitating houses. A motion by Labour councillors for the next council meeting says: 'In the light of the revelations of gerrymandering by Westminster, we censure this administration for following precisely the same type of immoral policies, which have resulted in houses staying empty for over a year, and properties required by the community being sold.'</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Hurd says nation state in good shape THE powers of the nation state in 'hugely important areas of policy' had not been significantly affected by last December's Maastricht treaty, Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, said in London yesterday. Mr Hurd told British MPs the separate 'pillar' system of the European Union, as proposed by the UK, had been fully respected by the treaty. The treaty was a compromise, but it had safeguarded British interests. Both the new common foreign and security policy and most of justice and home affairs remained essentially outside the European Community's competence and were designated as matters for inter-governmental co-operation, he said . That did not mean the UK, which takes over the EC presidency in July, was not interested in making progress in these areas. Within the inter-governmental context, it would ensure matters were taken forward promptly and effectively. Mr Hurd rejected suggestions that the European Monetary Union provisions of the treaty represented 'the most enormous transfer of power from this (the British) parliament to alien institutions.' That could happen, Mr Hurd conceded, if all member countries moved on to stage three of EMU, when a single currency and independent European central bank would be created. But this UKwould be subject to the British parliament. Referring to German demands it was not realistic to create an EC central bank without central political institutions to control it, Mr Hurd said he did not believe it would be 'sensible' to centralise EC political institutions. He found it difficult to imagine an enlarged Community of some 18 members with a centralised structure.</p>

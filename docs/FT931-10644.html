			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Leaden results in a golden age: American Express is at a loss to explain the red ink at its Shearson Lehman brokerage Among the challenges facing the new leadership of American Express, the troubled travel and financial services group, few are as serious as the red ink at Shearson Lehman Brothers, the group's brokerage and investment banking subsidiary. Last month Shearson, the second biggest stockbroker in the US, disclosed a loss of Dollars 116m (Pounds 77m) for 1992 and said its brokerage commission income rose by a paltry 1.8 per cent during the whole year. By contrast, Merrill Lynch, the market leader, last year enjoyed net profits that were 37 per cent higher at Dollars 952.4m and brokerage commission income that rose by 12.3 per cent. PaineWebber, ranked third, reported 41 per cent better net earnings of Dollars 213.2m and brokerage commission income that improved by 14 per cent. Last week, as the dust began to settle on the boardroom battle at American Express which led to the resignation of Mr James Robinson as chairman, analysts were still puzzling over the reasons behind Shearson's losses in 1992, a year that saw some of the fattest earnings in securities industry history. There was also confusion about the leadership of Shearson. The question arose because Mr Robinson had been named chairman and chief executive of Shearson just four days before he severed all ties to the American Express group. In winning those positions Mr Robinson had elbowed aside Mr Howard Clark as Shearson chief, relegating him to vice-chairman. The firm is now being run on an interim basis by Mr Richard Fuld and Mr Tom Hill, the Lehman-side executives who were recently named co-presidents. On Wall Street a surprising number of analysts who follow American Express and Shearson said they did not have enough information to understand the underlying reasons for Shearson's malaise. Shearson has put up the barricades. Journalists and analysts are being given few details. Mr Michael Egizio, a financial services analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps, the credit rating agency, said that because he had been denied access, he could not really know what was wrong with the firm. 'The company doesn't seem to know either - that's what's so disturbing,' he said. At first glance Shearson's fourth quarter 1992 net loss of Dollars 166m and full-year deficit of Dollars 116m can be explained by a variety of special charges. These charges include a Dollars 150m after-tax write-off relating to loans and equity held by Shearson in Computervision, a company that has had trouble for the past two years in servicing a 1990 bridge loan that was to have been refinanced by junk bonds. Also included is a Dollars 107m write-down of property holdings and Dollars 59m in unspecified legal provisions. But in the fourth quarter of 1992 Shearson still only made Dollars 4m of operating income before special charges. Mr John Keefe, an independent financial service analyst at Keefe Worldwide Services, said it was odd that 'if you take away these unusual items it is still hard to find much operating income - and this is during a golden age for the securities industry.' One man who should be in a position to explain the performance is Mr Harvey Golub, who replaced Mr Robinson as American Express's chief executive and who is now working on plans to restaff Shearson and return it to profitability. But in his first press conference since Mr Robinson resigned, Mr Golub and Mr Richard Furlaud, the new non-executive chairman of American Express, spent more time defending their earlier support for Mr Robinson than discussing future strategy. When asked why Shearson made no money in 1992 Mr Golub spoke of the charges as 'structural and baggage issues' and admitted that the security firm's cost base remained too high. When asked specifically why the second biggest brokerage house in the US had essentially flat brokerage commissions in 1992, Mr Golub replied: 'The answer is that I don't know.' Mr Golub's aides eventually claimed the commissions had been flat because gains in retail and institutional sales had been offset by declining commodity commissions. They also blamed a shift in the reporting of individual managed investor accounts from the brokerage commission to the custodial and advisory income category. Shearson declined, however, to provide a financial breakdown. Mr Golub was equally reticent about the possibility of American Express deciding to sell Shearson, saying at first he didn't know and then correcting this to a 'no comment'. Mr Golub said only that Mr Clark would not be reinstated as chairman and that there was 'no timetable' for selecting a new chief executive. 'It certainly would be useful to have a CEO at Shearson,' Mr Golub said. In fairness, Mr Golub is neither an investment banker nor an expert in the brokerage industry. He is something of a technician whose main task in life has been to turn around the travel related services (TRS) division of American Express. Mr Furlaud said that TRS would remain a prime responsibility for Mr Golub. Mr Golub pledged also to spend time on Shearson, which until recently seemed to have recovered from its worst period two years ago when it suffered huge losses and saw Mr Peter Cohen, chairman, forced out by Mr Robinson. Some former Shearson executives blamed excessive compensation and overhead costs for the firm's problems. Over the past two years Mr Robinson took a personal hand in plotting Shearson strategy, apparently allowing costly and overlapping expenses to occur when he came up with the idea of dividing Shearson and Lehman into separate brokerage and investment banking arms of the group. The unhappy marriage between the blue-bloods of Lehman Brothers and the retail brokers of Shearson continues to create tension within the firm. The single biggest component of a brokerage firm's costs is employee compensation - salaries and bonuses. At Shearson, compensation expenses have grown faster than revenues. Last year, for example, the firm's compensation expenses grew 14 per cent, while net revenues rose only 11 per cent. These expenses, by some estimates up to Dollars 250m too high on an annual basis, may explain part of the reason why Shearson, which analysts say should have earned as much as Dollars 700m in full-year operating income last year, only made Dollars 204m before charges, less than half the 1991 level. Many on Wall Street are betting that American Express will move to cut costs, strengthen capital and ready Shearson for an eventual sale - as part of the group's gradual dismantling of Mr Robinson's 1980s strategy of trying to build American Express into a 'financial supermarket'. Whatever happens, it is clear that Shearson will remain an albatross for Messrs Furlaud and Golub for some time to come.</p>

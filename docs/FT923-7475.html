			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / UK Company News: No end in sight to the Pacific war - Philip Coggan gives the background to the long-running dispute over the future of PHIT TO THE outsider, it seems incredible that grown men can fight bitter battles over the future of something as staid as an investment trust. But tiny Pacific Horizon, with a market capitalisation of just over Pounds 8m, is only the latest trust to provoke a bad-tempered bout. In one corner is Jupiter Tyndall, which has been managing the trust; in the other is the Pacific Horizon board. The origins of the dispute date back to the merger between Jupiter Tarbutt Merlin and Tyndall Holdings in 1991. Tyndall was a banking and fund management group which had made a disastrous investment in Clayton Robard, an Australian fund manager, just before the crash. Pacific Horizon was an investment trust in the Tyndall stable, having been created by the revamp of an Australian investment trust in 1989. Some would suggest that the underlying cause of the battle is the unhappiness of those Pacific Horizon directors who were linked with the Tyndall regime and have now left the group. Indeed, another trust in the Tyndall stable, European Project, has sacked Jupiter in favour of Murray Johnstone. But Mr Garnet Harrison, Pacific's chairman, dismisses allegations of 'sour grapes', pointing out that he left Tyndall a year before the takeover by Jupiter. For the Jupiter side, the key questions relate to the role of the manager. Is it right that a trust's managers should be allowed to buy shares in the trust - and then use that stake to block a bid approved by the trust's board? And should the managers be negotiating with potential bidders, without the board's approval? Mr John Duffield, chairman of Jupiter Tyndall, rejects suggestions of a conflict of interest. He says that his group has simply been trying to get the best deal for shareholders - and importantly, warrantholders. In addition, he says that Jupiter's most recent proposals would have resulted in the loss of the group's management contract over the bulk of the trust's assets. That, he argues, does not indicate self-interest. But why is Jupiter Tyndall, with more than Pounds 1bn of funds under management and which recently recruited Mr Leonard Licht, a top Mercury fund manager, bothered about an Pounds 8m trust? At the heart of the dispute are the two key issues which tend to prompt bitter conflict in the sober world of investment trusts. The first is the discount. Shares in most trusts trade at a discount to their net asset value. That causes frustration for those shareholders who bought at launch - and makes them willing to welcome proposals which narrow the discount, or eliminate it altogether. It also provides an opening for predators, who see the chance to buy assets on the cheap. But this can be bad news for the managers of the trust, since a bid will mean the loss of their fee income. In theory, the board of a trust and the managers are completely separate - and the former should have the right to sack the latter at any time. In practice, many trust boards are closely linked to the management groups. Indeed, in recent years, some trusts have been branded with the fund manager's name, making the prospect of sacking highly unlikely. At Pacific Horizon, the first proposal to eliminate the discount was for the trust to merge with CST Emerging Asia, another trust in the Jupiter stable. But that deal was rejected by the board of CST, which was independently advised by Robert Fleming. CST's board said 'PHIT's portfolio and performance, in terms of the decline in net assets per share since launch, provided no grounds for selecting PHIT as a merger partner.' (Pacific's performance leaves it eighth out of 10 trusts in the sector over the year to August 1, turning Pounds 100 into Pounds 85, according to Micropal). The Pacific Horizon board then negotiated a takeover by Martin Currie Pacific. But Jupiter Tyndall said the deal disadvantaged warrantholders. It bought up a stake of 25.1 per cent in the warrants and 15.4 per cent of the ordinary shares, in the process blocking the deal and causing Martin Currie to withdraw in mid-June. The summer has seen further skirmishing. Pacific Horizon said it was dismissing Jupiter Tyndall as manager and replacing it with Baillie Gifford. Jupiter announced it had received a bid approach (to the indignation of the Pacific Horizon directors); but a week later said the approach had been withdrawn. Today seemed likely to see the showdown. Two extraordinary meetings are being held - the first to vote on the replacement of Jupiter Tyndall, the second on a Jupiter plan to restructure the trust and allow investors to sell their holdings at 90 per cent of net asset value. But Jupiter announced yesterday that 'following discussions with a number of significant shareholders', it was dropping its proposals. Since the Martin Currie bid won the support of more than 74 per cent of Pacific's shareholders, perhaps that is not surprising. Mr Duffield seems unlikely to give up, however. Other potential bidders have been reported to be in the wings and Mr Duffield maintains that the replacement of his group by Baillie Gifford will do nothing to eliminate the discount (currently about 14 per cent). The future of Pacific may still be warlike.</p>

Jordan, Oman, and Qatar have identical positions on Arab  solidarity, joint Arab action, and the need to begin a new Arab  stage that overcomes the negative elements of the past and takes  into consideration the Arab nation's interest and future.  However, some Arab positions are still hostage to these  negative elements and fail to overcome them. Furthermore, these  positions adhere to weak arguments and advance stands that are  based on deceptive imaginations and facts which aim to implement  the biggest conspiracy that targeted Iraq and the Arab nation as  a whole in what was called the Gulf crisis.    His majesty the king's statements to the Qatari media and  Jordanian journalists reflect Jordan's firm and principled  commitment to the higher pan-Arab interests and eagerness to  maintain the minimum joint Arab action. The statements also  demonstrate the efforts with sincere brothers to overcome the  disaster and to start laying down new bases for Arab solidarity,  based on mutual respect, eagerness to maintain the nation's  rights and interests, and coordination of positions on peace  negotiations, the status of Jerusalem, and support for the  steadfastness of the kinsfolk in the occupied territories in  face of occupation and in their just struggle to restore their  legitimate rights, led by restoration of occupied Palestinian  territories and the right to self-determination.    Undoubtedly, His Majesty King Husayn's emphasis on the  status  of Jerusalem as part of the occupied territories, as stipulated  in all international resolutions, and on linking the fate of the  holy city to the current Arab situation is a renewed call on  Arab leaders to meet, have frank discussion, evaluate what  happened so far in peace negotiations, and coordinate Arab  positions on Jerusalem in particular, and the Arab causes in  general.</p>

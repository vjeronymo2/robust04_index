			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ALASKAN CHILL CHASES AWAY HOT, HUMID DOG DAYS  </P> <P> This is not normal, this business of cool temperatures and low humidity in  August. Do not let your relatives visiting from Back East be fooled into  thinking this is San Diego's standard, mid-summer paradise.  </P> <P> Temperatures struggling to reach the upper 70s and 59% humidity will make for  an exceptionally nice August weekend, said National Weather Service forecaster  Wilbur Shigehara. Normally, the humidity for this time of year is 66% and  coastal and inland areas are sweltering under 90-degree weather.  </P> <P> "People can stop wondering if the weather is always this nice in San Diego in  the middle of August," Shigehara said. "It's not."  </P> <P> "This extremely dry and unusually cool weather is courtesy of a cold front from  the Gulf of Alaska stalled over the Southland," Shigehara said. "Associated  with it is an upper-level low-pressure system along the West Coast. All this  adds up to weather more like May and June than mid-August."  </P> <P> Shigehara said the weather will remain pleasant and sunny through the weekend.  Hurricane Henrietta, about 1,300 miles southwest of San Diego, will bring  occasional high clouds, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tides Are Rising  </P> <P> While the humidity and temperatures are down, the high tides are up. Tuesday  night, the high tide was 6.9 feet, and Wednesday it was 7.1 feet, Shigehara  said. No damage was reported at local beaches, and the tide will subside to  near 6 feet by tonight, he said.  </P> <P> The surf is at 3 feet, and the ocean water temperature is 70. The beaches will  be a little breezy, with winds blowing 10 to 17 m.p.h., Shigehara said.  </P> <P> "With the winds and the low humidity, there will be a lot of ventilation that  cleans out the air pretty good," Shigehara said. "This is a wonderful thing for  the middle of summer."  </P> <P> Daytime highs at the beaches are expected to be from 68 to 73 degrees.  </P> <P> After the mid-morning clouds burn off, it will be sunny and pleasant along the  coast, Shigehara said. Highs will range from 73 to 78 degrees, and lows will be  between 63 and 68.  </P> <P> Inland highs of 78 to 87 degrees are forecast through Sunday, with overnight  lows a chilly 56 to 65.  </P> <P> In the mountains, high temperatures will struggle to reach the low-80s, and the  nights will dip into the mid-40s, Shigehara said.  </P> <P> The desert will have partly cloudy skies today, and highs will range from 102  to 108 through Sunday. Overnight lows will be in the mid-70s.  </P> <P> The more typical, humid, dog-day weather of August is not expected to return to  San Diego until the middle of next week, Shigehara said.  </P></p>

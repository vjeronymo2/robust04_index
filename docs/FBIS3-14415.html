			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by political </F> correspondent Gadi Sukenik "this evening"; place not given --  recorded]    [Text] [Sukenik] Mr. Peres, are you convinced that  deliberations with the PLO will resume, and intensively so, on  Tuesday [29 March], in preparation for the beginning of the  withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho?    [Peres] Barring unexpected developments, the answer is yes.    [Sukenik] What will take place then? Roughly speaking, when  can the withdrawal start and when can it end?    [Peres] If the negotiations start tomorrow [as heard]  indeed, we may be very near the first objective, namely, the  first half of April. Still, if there are further  delays....[pauses] Look there is a certain paradox here: On  the one hand, the PLO tells us to keep the timetable, but on the  other hand, it does not begin on time. We cannot finish on time  if we do not start on schedule.    [Sukenik] You know that the PLO points to security problems  in Hebron and to the Jewish core in the heart of Hebron in  explaining the various delays. You and Mr. Rabin repeatedly  declare that a decision on their evacuation is ours only,  regardless of the negotiations. Were you in a position to do  so, would you now decide on the evacuation of some of these Jews  at least?    [Peres] Look, I would take care of security in the largest  sense of the word. This is not a personal matter. What  happened in Hebron following the Cave of the Patriarchs incident  is that the chance for peaceful coexistence between the settlers  and the Arab residents was severely wounded if not killed  completely. It will take a very long time for the wounds to  heal. The settlers said they can have peaceful coexistence, but  this is not the case today. We cannot reach unreasonable  absurdities: place 120,000 Arab residents under curfew in order  to defend 400 Jews who live there.    [Sukenik] What is the conclusion then?    [Peres] We need to reach appropriate conclusions about  deployment in Hebron, from the civilian as well as the military  viewpoint.    [Sukenik] Can we assume that Tall al-Rumaythah and Netzarim  are the first settlements whose moment of truth is drawing  nearer?    [Peres] I will not say a word on this. I would only say  that there are large military shoulders carrying a very heavy  burden. Still, civilian shoulders must share the burden. It is  impossible to defend everything with pistols or guns or an army.  We must radically change the situation and cannot avoid this.  Today I heard of the slogan "All Israel Is Hebron." Let me  react to this in simple terms: The fate of Israel will not be  determined by the Hebron residents only. In contrast, the fate  of Hebron will be decided by the majority in Israel. We may  have different views among us, but the fashion in which a  decision is made must be acceptable to all, without exception.  In arguments there is no trigger, gun, or knife; there are only  arguments in favor or against, and the majority can decide. We  have reached a very sensitive situation on this matter. You saw  a Jew getting up during the holiday and shooting an Arab driver  in revenge. People use their arms as they please, and this is  unacceptable to us.    [Sukenik] Coexistence in Hebron is impossible then, in your  opinion?    [Peres] It is impossible at this stage. I believe the day  may come when coexistence will be possible, but tension has  reached its highest point today, and military measures are  necessary. In general, we will not abandon anybody, neither a  settler, nor any Arab resident of Hebron. Still, searching must  be an overall thing, not just military.    [Sukenik] It is impossible not to ask a short question on  the Syrian issue. In your opinion, does the nation support the  Golan cause indeed?    [Peres] Many people who say we must not get off the Golan  also say we must not give peace up, and everybody understands  that the two are closely interrelated. The Syrians have now  taken a step which the Americans greatly appreciate; it is quite  a wise step on their part. It is they who accepted President  Clinton's invitation to return to the negotiations in  Washington. This move binds the PLO too, naturally; the PLO  cannot stay out of the picture. I think that in contrast with a  certain hesitancy in Jordan, in contrast with the difficulties  we are facing with the Palestinians....[pauses] I believe,  incidentally, that we are getting back on track, that within  several weeks we will have a new situation in the Middle East:  For the first time, there will be a piece of Palestinian  reality which will be seen and felt, and, thank God, we will be  able to say goodbye to Gaza. Goodbye to Gaza means peace for  Israel without Gaza. I think it is possible to get on this  track and that we should get on a track of very serious  negotiations with the Syrians.</p>

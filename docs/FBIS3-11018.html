Moreover, the communique  states that although a democratic process has started, the  government has still not managed to set up a socioeconomic  structure that will benefit the weakest.    During the CEP-Conferpar meeting held in Ypacarai yesterday,  the bishops, priests, and nuns issued a communique voicing the  need for effective commitment to national unity through a  moralization campaign, so to be able to face the socioeconomic  crisis the country is suffering through.    The communique issued by the religious group maintains that  they welcome "with happiness" a democratic regime that, among  other things, made it possible to win public liberties. It  notes, however, that this is not the case in the socioeconomic  field, which is "marked by a series of factors and by an  economic policy in which the social aspect has not been taken  into account, and which encourages the defense of individual  interests to the detriment of the common well-being."    It then adds that, "sadly," one can witness every day the  growing deterioration in the country's socioeconomic situation,  and especially the situation of peasants, workers, and the poor,  "who are the most affected, and continue to be denied the  benefits to which they are entitled by law. This situation is  even worse in the case of the indigenous communities."    The clergy maintain that the solution to social problems  cannot be found through violence and government repression  against these sectors of society. In this regard they explain  that the solutions will be found within a framework of dialogue  and freedom, where none of the sectors resort to the use of  force.    The communique goes on to state "that we have also seen that  privileged people and groups have distorted the moral values by  means of a way of life based on moral, psychological,  administrative, political, and juridical corruption, which is  reflected among other ways in the deficient administration of  justice, and in the lack of essential health, education, and  housing services."    In view of this panorama of progressive impoverishment of  the  people the clergy reasserted their "preferential treatment of  the poor," expressing solidarity and support for the initiatives  taken for the sake of the common well-being, seeking "a fair  distribution of assets, a broad land reform policy, aid and  organization for peasant settlements, fair prices for  agricultural products, the recovery of ill-begotten property,  salaries commensurate with the cost of living, and the fair  demands of workers and peasants, who have a right to use  nonviolent means in their search for a more dignified life."    The communique also states that, taking into account the  social situation prevailing in the country, the national  citizenry must assume the commitment through a moralization  campaign to face the socioeconomic crisis we are enduring.</p>

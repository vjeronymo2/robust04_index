			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EMPLOYEES PAYING MORE OF MEDICAL BILLS, STUDY FINDS  </P> <P> Salaried employees of large U.S. companies are paying a bigger share of their  medical expenses than they did five years ago, according to a  soon-to-be-released study of employee benefits.  </P> <P> Hewitt Associates, a suburban Chicago consulting firm, conducted the survey of  227 major employers.  </P> <P> Medical plans are paying more catastrophic-illness costs but employees are  paying a larger share of other medical expenses, researchers discovered.  </P> <P> Hewitt found that just 29% of the survey respondents' medical plans covered  100% of hospital room and board charges, compared with 53% in 1984.  </P> <P> The more typical practice is for the plan to cover 80% of hospital charges and  require employees to pay 20% up to a specified maximum, usually $2,000 or less.  The plan then kicks in and pays 100%.  </P> <P> Employers also are trying to better manage medical costs by encouraging  employees to seek second surgical opinions and have medical tests done on an  outpatient basis.  </P> <P> Workers also face a wider array of employer-sponsored savings plans, and are  increasingly being asked to take a more active role in designing their own  benefits packages.  </P> <P> "There is a desire among employers to involve employees more in all aspects of  benefits," said Howard Levin, a partner in Hewitt.  </P> <P> "There's a sense that when employees participate, they get involved more and  have a greater appreciation" of their benefits, Levin said in a telephone  interview from his Lincolnshire office.  </P> <P> In 1984, Hewitt found that 62% of companies surveyed offered the same medical  coverage for surgery whether or not the employee got a second opinion. In 1988,  only 29% of the respondents offered the same coverage regardless of whether a  second opinion was obtained.  </P> <P> "Cost-sharing causes people to be more careful consumers of health-care  services," Levin said. "The employee who has to pay for part of any service  (used) is going to use more discretion."  </P></p>

			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Fire threat to N-arms doubted FEARS that forest fires in Latvia might threaten Russian nuclear bases were being played down yesterday by Swedish experts who have been assessing the situation. The fires, following two months of hot, dry weather, affect three main areas, one of them Garkaune, where ammunition dumps of the former Soviet army lie. Latvia's defence minister, Mr Talav Junzis, had said it was conceivable that nuclear warheads could be under threat from the blazes. But the Swedish experts questioned whether there were any nuclear weapons in the former Soviet republic. Mr Tor Larsson, an expert on nuclear weapons, said that even if some nuclear weapons were stockpiled there he doubted whether the fires would threaten them. He pointed out that nuclear weapons are stored under the ground and would never become hot enough through the concrete and earth to explode. 'It would need a temperature of over 1,000 degrees", he said. The Russian government's official position is that all tactical nuclear weapons have been withdrawn from the Baltics and other outlying republics, leaving only Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan in possession of strategic nuclear weapons. In Latvia, the prime minister's secretary said the country expected imminent help from Finland and Sweden to help put out the fires.</p>

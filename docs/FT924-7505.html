			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Survey of Australia (1): Opening the door to Asia - Enterprising Australians have been trading with Asia since the 1950s. More than 60 per cent of Australian exports go to the Asia-Pacific region and integration with Asia is regarded as desirable as well as inevitable IN a Sydney conference hall, Hsieh Fu Hua, the Singaporean managing director of Morgan Grenfell Asia, is telling a group of Australian businessmen how Australia is perceived in the economically dynamic Asian countries to its north. The news is not good. 'You should be aware of the loss of respect that Australia has suffered in the region,' he tells them. 'You have lost respect because of (insensitive reporting of Asia by) your bad press, your infamous businessmen in the 1980s, and the performance of your economy.' Hsieh has much more to say, none of it pleasant. But at the end of his speech he is applauded enthusiastically. Businessmen question him on how Australians can improve their sometimes touchy links with Asia. Radio and television networks queue to interview him for news bulletins. 'I was not surprised by the reaction,' Hsieh says later. 'One of the most attractive things about Australians is that you can tell them the truth and they listen to you. I could never have said things like that to an Asian audience. They would have walked out.' A few years ago, Hsieh's Sydney audience might have walked out, too. They stayed to listen because most share the view that opening the door to Asia is one of the changes which is essential if Australians are to avoid becoming the 'white trash of Asia,' as Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the former prime minister of Singapore, once forecast. Mr John Fahey, the conservative premier of New South Wales, summed up the emerging consensus concisely at the same conference: 'For decades, Australia scarcely noticed the changes taking place in its own backyard,' he said. 'We can no longer afford to do that.' This view is not new. Enterprising Australians have been trading with Asia since the mid-1950s when a forward-looking conservative government signed a trade pact with Japan. Now more than 60 per cent of Australian exports go to the Asia-Pacific region. But, increasingly, integration with Asia is regarded as desirable as well as inevitable. In 1992, it is almost impossible to imagine a serious political commentator suggesting that Australia should apply for membership of the European Community, as Mr John Elliott, then president of the federal Liberal party, did only two years ago. Part of the reason for the change in attitudes is the growing acceptance that the nature of Australia has been irredeemably altered by mass Asian immigration since the repeal of the discredited White Australia policy in the mid-1970s. For nearly two decades, up to 50 per cent of Australia's annual immigration intake has come from Asia, transforming the country from an almost exclusively European enclave to a vibrant and increasingly sophisticated multi-cultural melting pot. The non-racial immigration programme has done much to counter Australia's historical reputation among Asians for arrogant racism. However, the key factor in speeding up the change in attitude which is taking place has been Australia's relatively poor economic performance. Sporting successes aside, Australians have not had much to celebrate since the country slipped into recession in 1990. While the national rugby union and rugby league teams were in Europe winning world cup competitions, the rest of Australia has been struggling with slow growth and high unemployment. The economic problems have fostered a growing sense of gloom about the future, combined with a loss of national self-confidence which contrasts sharply with the euphoria of the late 1980s, when the economy was growing strongly and Australian entrepreneurs were still roaming the world looking for takeover targets. The short-term result is likely to be a sweeping reversal of fortune for the Labor Party, which has dominated government at both state and federal levels since the early 1980s. All the signs are that the Labor decade is almost over; Labor has already been swept out of office in Tasmania and Victoria and appears likely to lose the federal election due by mid-1993, although Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, will fight hard all the way to election day. With about six months to go before the last possible election date, the atmosphere is becoming increasingly clouded by the smoke of battle. But the short-term political confrontation disguises a remarkable degree of consensus about future policy. As Mr Paul Kelly, editor in chief of The Australian newspaper, argues in his recent book The End of Certainty, the 1980s marked a radical move away from the principles which had guided Australian governments since federation in 1901 - white-only immigration, trade protectionism, judicial regulation of industrial relations, paternalism, and loyalty to Britain. Both the main political groups are committed to continuing the process of developing Australian political and cultural independence, and opening up the formerly protected and regulated economy to international economic forces. Hence there is a large measure of agreement on key issues - tariff reductions; integration with Asia; and raising business competitiveness through labour market changes and other structural economic reforms. There is even some meeting of minds on touchy symbolic issues: Mr Keating may have tried to present republicanism as a Labor icon but Mr John Hewson, the federal Liberal leader, is only one of many conservatives who think abolition of the monarchy is probably inevitable in the long term. Of course, the new consensus is not complete. State politicians have local industries to protect, business leaders and media commentators fear the effect of competition on uncompetitive businesses, academics complain that Australia's traditional egalitarianism is in danger. But the critics' impact is limited by the absence of a rational alternative policy. A recent book by Mr Michael Pusey, an academic sociologist, tapped a deep vein of nostalgia for government regulation, but even Mr Pusey did not suggest that Australia could return to protectionism. As a result, the debate revolves around the pace of change. The conservatives want rapid progress towards unencumbered free markets; the government contends that Australians have already undergone all the reform they can digest. Nevertheless, it is clear that Australia's course towards an independent, open and pluralistic society has been firmly set. The argument now is not about what charts the ship of state should be using, but how much sail it should carry.</p>

Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board believes that the proposed rule change would increase the efficiency of both the implementation and operation of Board rules involving the submission of information to the Board. The ``procedures'' contemplated by the proposed rule change would concern only matters of a technical nature. The proposed rule change further provides that any procedures, or amendment thereto, may be approved by the Board without the necessity of a formal Board meeting, pursuant to existing rule A&hyph;4(d). Rule A&hyph;4(d) provides a mechanism by which action, ``other than action on proposed rules or proposed amendment to rules of the Board,'' may be taken by written consent of the Board or by telephone poll of all Board members. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  Of course, the Board will continue to file any matters with the Commission, as required, pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Act, and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Rule A&hyph;4(d) provides that: Action by the Board, other than action on proposed rules or proposed amendments to rules of the Board, may be taken without a meeting by written consent of the Board setting forth the action so taken or by telephone poll of all members of the Board, provided that, in the case of action taken by telephone, the Board, at a meeting, or the Chairman of the Board authorizes the action to be taken by such means. The Executive Director shall transmit to each Board member, as soon as practicable after a telephone poll is taken, a written statement setting forth the questions or questions with respect to which the telephone poll was taken and the results of the telephone poll. Such statements shall also be entered in the minutes of the next Board meeting. In the case of action taken without a meeting by written consent or telephone poll, an affirmative vote of a majority of the whole Board is required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission notes that the present proposal is intended to expedite Board consideration of matters that are technical in nature, and is not intended to affect the types of proposals that the Board files with the Commission pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Act and Rule 19(b)(4) thereunder. Telephone conversation,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On April 7, 1994, the Commission approved Board rule G&hyph;37, concerning political contributions and prohibitions on municipal securities business. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  This rule, among other things, requires dealers to submit certain information ``to the Board on Form G&hyph;37, in accordance with Board rule G&hyph;37 filing procedures, quarterly with due dates determined by the Board. *&blank;*&blank;*'' <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  In its filing with the Commission, the Board noted that it ``is in the process of developing appropriate rule G&hyph;37 filing procedures to allow for public access to the information to be submitted on Form G&hyph;37, as well as indexing, record storage, etc. *&blank;*&blank;*'' <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  In the present filing, the Board discussed these rule G&hyph;37 filing procedures as an example of the types of procedures to which the instant proposed rule change would apply. The Board will submit to the Commission another proposed rule change relating to rule G&hyph;37 filing procedures. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33868 (April 7, 1994), 59 FR 17621 (April 13, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Rule G&hyph;37(e)(ii). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> File No. SR&hyph;MSRB&hyph;94&hyph;2, at page 16. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34027 (May 9, 1994), 59 FR 25136 (notice of filing and order granting accelerated approval of File No. SR&hyph;MSRB&hyph;94&hyph;04). In addition, in order to assist dealer compliance with the filing requirements of rule G&hyph;37, the Board intends to develop an informal ``Procedures Manual'' for the relevant forms and procedures, and periodically to update or to amend the manual. The manual also would include forms and other filing information regarding rule G&hyph;36 on delivery of official statements and advance refunding documents to the Board. In the future, the Board also may adopt procedures regarding technical matters relating to the Board's Continuing Disclosure Information system, as well as any transaction reporting system the Board may develop. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

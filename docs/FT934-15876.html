			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / US peace initiative bypasses the UN THE US, bypassing the United Nations, has written to the president of Ethiopia, proposing an international inquiry into violence in Mogadishu blamed on warlord Mohammed Farah Aideed, Reuter reports. The initiative appears similar to a proposal from Gen Aideed to former US president Jimmy Carter last month when Gen Aideed offered to submit to the judgment of a special commission. At the time the proposals got short shrift from UN secretary-general Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali and the US. US ambassador Madeleine Albright announced the news to a Security Council meeting at which members supported President Bill Clinton's decision to send more troops into Mogadishu but also concentrate on political moves to reconstruct the country. Several diplomats questioned the parallel political moves by Washington as Mr Boutros Ghali was heading to Ethiopia to bring African leaders into the peace process. The bodies of two US soldiers have been recovered from Sunday's fierce street battle in Mogadishu, raising the death toll to 15. Another three are still missing.</p>

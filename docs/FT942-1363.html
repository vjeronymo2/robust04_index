			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Observer: Final puff Talk about public relations coups. David Wynne-Morgan, 63, first got into PR by writing a flattering piece about the late J Paul Getty. The oil tycoon was so impressed that he underwrote Wynne-Morgan's move into the game, becoming his first client at 5 guineas an hour. Claus von Bulow later inherited the Getty account. Now Morgan has handed in his notice as boss of Hill &amp; Knowlton in Europe. He plans ending his career by polishing the image of his favourite client, Peter Munk, the Canadian entrepreneur whose interests include North America's biggest gold mine, Clark Oil, and Berlin property. All a bit of a come-down for one of London's veteran flacks? Not likely. Morgan gets a seat on the board of Horsham - Munk's master company - a handsome wage and Dollars 1.3m in share options. All for working 12 days a month for Munk; no doubt a well-earned rest.</p>

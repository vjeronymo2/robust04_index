			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / German call for wholesale change on pay Employers and trade unions in Germany are facing a 'crisis of consensus' and must now overhaul their entire system of over-regulated wage-bargaining, the country's leading employers' spokesman said yesterday. Mr Klaus Murmann, president of the federation of German employers (BDA), called for a prolonged onslaught on the high costs of industry, including not simply wages, but the whole array of fringe benefits, holiday entitlement, and social security payments. He warned that more than 6m people would be either officially unemployed, or working in 'disguised unemployment' on job creation schemes or retraining programmes by the end of 1994. For employers to create more jobs, and revive the level of investment, they needed more flexibility from the unions, the public sector, and in their own thinking. Mr Murmann, who was re-elected with a large majority to the post he has held since 1986, also called for a switch in the whole system of financing job creation and training in eastern Germany. He backed the opposition Social Democratic party, and the union movement, in proposing that such schemes should be financed by direct taxation, and not by increased unemployment benefits as at present. He was speaking as latest figures published for insolvencies in German industry showed a new record level in the past year, with the numbers still rising. In the first nine months west German company insolvencies rose by 29.5 per cent compared with the same period of 1992, to a total of 9,284. In September, the monthly figure was 1,101, an increase of 38.3 per cent on September, 1992, reflecting the effects of the sharpest recession in the German economy since the second world war. Mr Murmann warned that the country was showing excessive pessimism about the state of the economy. At the same time, the willingness of the private sector to invest was undermined by the soaring public sector debt: he predicted that even today the federal government's revenue expectations would prove excessively optimistic, given the economic recession and the sharp rise in unemployment. Mr Murmann's comments, coming just as the wage round is getting under way, seem likely to anger the leading trade unions, who fear employer pressure to break the long-standing social consensus.</p>

More specifically, the YKT  leadership came into being thanks to the tacit support of KTC  who had just retired from first-line politics. And even today it  is difficult to explain its existence minus that factor.    Needless to say, KTC is a retiree from politics. He himself  reaffirmed it publicly on many occasions. But the fact is that  even though he retired from active politics, it does not mean  that his influence has also been "retired." This fact was  verified more than once. KTC remains a member of the DP and,  more importantly, all his men are in good shape in the DP.  [passage omitted]    According to the party Constitution, the next DP national  convention is to be held in May 1995; however, in the event of a  national election, it can be moved up by a maximum of 6 months  or delayed by up to 3 months. Therefore, the next DP convention  is, basically, far more than a year away, but Chairman Yi  recently referred to the possibility of moving it up within the  range indicated in the party Constitution. He thus hinted at his  so-called intent for en early convention, creating a subtle stir  in the party; until then, he had been negative about moving up  the convention date. Now, since he himself raised the issue,  there must have been a reason for it. Conversely, his action  proves that an anti-Yi offensive within the party is approaching  to a critical level. In fact, the nonmainstreamers have been  demanding, intermittently though, the holding of an  extraordinary party convention sometime in the first half of  1994.    Chairman Yi seems to be feeling the same pressure in the  course of his management of the DP's National Assembly policy  during the regular Assembly session, too. While the "nine man,  nine different minds" criticism against the party leadership  continues unabated, he could so far lead the party rather  smoothly by effectively managing the balance of power among the  members of the party Supreme Committee. However, as soon as he  moved to show his own color in his National Assembly speech and  in his parliamentary strategy as the opposition leader, the  nonmainstreamers strongly reacted against it. Even among the  Supreme Committee members, fewer came forward backing him up. No  Mu-hyon and Yi Pu-yong of the Democratic faction [from the  former DP before its merger with the UPP] turned their backs on  him. No Mu-hyon, while holding on to his basic line since the  last party convention in March, is nevertheless intensifying his  criticism of Chairman continuously. What makes the chairman  worry even more is that Yi Pu-yong, who had been relatively  cooperative, reversed his attitude, turning critical of the  chairman. Since No and Yi Pu-yong are also members of the Reform  group, these things have spawned speculations that Chairman Yi  has not only lost his grip of the Democratic faction but is  perhaps shunned by the Reform group, too. Only two Supreme  Committee members, Kwon No-kap and Han Kwang-ok, remain loyal to  the chairman, while the Tonggyodong faction reportedly sees  something missing in Chairman Yi, at times feeling dissatisfied.    Meanwhile, the Tonggyodong faction has been constantly on  the  move since it unified its genealogy in the name of [KTC's] Naeoe  Munje Yonguso [Institute of Internal and External Affairs].  Recently, it reorganized Yonchong, a private organization of  KTC. Chairman Yi also has launched a membership drive for his  private organization, T'ongil Sanha Hoe [Society for Reunited  Mountains and Rivers]. But he finds himself under mounting  intraparty pressure. In short, the Reform group does not approve  of "dual citizenship" of members, putting pressure on the  chairman and his force.    Chairman Yi's camp is aware of all this subtle shifting. So  much so that some insiders say that they might be oversensitive.  At any rate, YKT and his force are known to be working on  strategies to ensure that their leadership continues after the  National Assembly regular session and further to defend its  power base at the next party convention while keeping a close  eye on its own faction that is turning rebellious, on the  increasingly visible resistance of the progressive forces within  the party, and on the growing signs of disharmony with the  Tonggyodong faction, the main force in the DP.    In this atmosphere, Chairman Yi is said to have tried to  contact KTC recently. In fact, this does not pay for either  side. For KTC, it could harm the image of his retirement from  politics. Chairman Yi could also be hurt because it would  further enhance his image as a weak leader unable to run the  party independently. But the immediate reality is that something  has to be done to change the flow of things in the combined  forces of a DP apparently plagued by internal disharmony.  Chairman Yi's side in particular seems to be feeling the need  more keenly. Therefore, reports say, he tried to contact the  Tonggyodong camp while discreetly keeping a distance.    Acting as mediators between the two camps are Kwon No-kap  and  Han Kwang-ok, both members of the Supreme Committee, plus Rep.  Mun Hui-sang, Chairman Yi's chief secretary, and Pak Chi-won, DP  spokesman. Mun was the first chairman of Yonchong. He also had  served as its sixth chairman until Kim Ok-tu took over recently.  He is one of the key figures among KTC's direct disciples and he  is always present at their gatherings. Despite his position as  Yi's chief secretary, he would say unhesitatingly that "my `home  base' is Tonggyodong." Pak also has his roots in Tonggyodong and  was part of the KTC campaign in the last presidential election.  The two are the key workers playing the role of a bridge between  the YKT and KTC forces to prevent a split and ensure cooperation.    They are said to be playing the part of letting Chairman  Yi's  side know --through a variety of routes--what KTC thinks about  Yi's National Assembly strategy and political course in general,  or vice versa. They contend that there is no gap between  Chairman Yi and KTC. They explain that there has been no change  in their basic relationship--even amid the subtle undercurrent  of a power game within the party. They assert that KTC has had  no objections to Chairman Yi's political line, to the substance  of his National Assembly speech delivered in October as a  product of that new line, and to his press conference in late  September in which Yi stated that he would give the economy  priority over the issue of liquidating the past--namely, to all  those things that fed the feud within the party. Needless to  say, it was Mun Hui-sang himself who led the writing of that  speech. Moreover, Pae Ki-son, former assistant chief secretary  for KTC, also took an active part. Pae has also been working as  an aide for Chairman Yi for some time. Another source familiar  with developments on both sides asserts that "there is nothing  going on that could fundamentally reverse the internal balance  of power within the mainstream." He insists that the only  problem is the dissatisfaction among mainstreamers with the  performance of Chairman Yi, who they think lacks in leadership  for an effective struggle against the ruling camp. And it is a  problem that can be resolved, he adds.    The nonmainstreamers have a different view. While agreeing  that the KTC-YKT alliance will not be easily shaken, they do not  think that YKT will remain the alternative for the mainstreamers  for too long. At the same time, the mainstreamers themselves  have the realistic need to try and shake the mainstreamers from  inside to make sure that he will not. Their concerns are, in  fact, no longer over the KTC-YKT alliance but are focused on the  moves of the Tonggyodong faction.</p>

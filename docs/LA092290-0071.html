			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AKRON OFFERS CLUE TO FULLERTON FUTURE  </P> <P> With its Big West opener at Fresno State only a week away, Cal State Fullerton  expects to find out today how it will stack up in conference play when it takes  on Akron.  </P> <P> Titan Coach Gene Murphy considers Akron, a Division I-A independent, on a par  with the top Big West teams.  </P> <P> Akron is 2-0-1, but Coach Gerry Faust is quick to point out that victories over  Illinois State, 17-7, and Kent, 38-10, and a 14-14 tie with Central Michigan  are not especially remarkable.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement of the All-National Committee for the Defense of </F> National Interests, on its fourth anniversary, read by  unidentified speaker -- live]    [Text] Dear compatriots, in these dramatic days of global  social changes, when the erosion of the Bulgarian spirit is part  of our difficult everyday life, a symbol of patriotism and  national pride is more than ever necessary. The anniversary of  our existence marked by indefatigable efforts for the homeland's  sake is both an opportunity and an obligation to assess our work.    The All-National Committee for the Defense of National  Interests is celebrating its fourth anniversary. This is a very  young age for the dimensions of history, but it is sufficient to  give evidence of political wisdom, of a new self-confidence, and  of meaningful efforts.    Founded at a grandiose mass rally on 7 January 1990, which  took place in front of the St. Aleksandur Nevski Cathedral [in  the Sofia center], a rally which was prompted by the spontaneous  wave of people's discontent in facing the emerging Turkish  danger, the All-National Committee for the Defense of National  Interests is the most extensive public organization in our  country today.    The committee, precisely, is the reliable and unshakable  guard watching over our national sovereignty, confronted with  the dark shadow of the Pan-Islamic doctrine, which permitted the  emergence of ethnic unrest and provocations. The committee has  become a shield protecting the revival of the Bulgarian spirit.    We are now addressing you, our compatriots. We appeal to  your faith and patriotism, in the hope that, all together, we  shall jointly revive Bulgaria as a strong, prospering, and  democratic country.    The All-National Committee for the Defense of National  Interests guarantees that not even an inch of the Bulgarian soil  shall be taken away, that no Bulgarian shall be Turkicized or  turned into a Macedonian [makedoniziran]. In professing the  truth that every citizen is equal before the law, we are  following the postulates of our apostle of freedom, Vasil  Levski, in repeating his everlasting principle: Life in our  Bulgarian homeland should not be similar to life in a Turkish  village.    We are convinced that all our compatriots, wherever they are  throughout the world, are equal citizens of our homeland and  children of mother Bulgaria. We shall always defend the rights  of Bulgarians in Macedonia, Ukraine, Moldova, Yugoslavia,  Romania, Albania, Turkey, Greece, the Commonwealth of  Independent States, in Europe, and all over the world.    We resolutely condemn national nihilism and we shall  severely  hold responsible all traitors. We categorically declare that  there is no place for the Rights and Freedoms Movement [DPS] in  a future parliament, nor is there place for any party whatsoever  based on ethnic or religious principles.    We are against the genocide through which some kind of  religious pseudo-movement and single-racial formations are  dividing the Bulgarian nation and are creating contemporary  ghettos for their supporters.    We declare ourselves in support of the civil disobedience  and  intellectual rebellion of the materially destitute and  humiliated Bulgarian scientists, teachers, educators,  physicians, engineers, economists, workers, peasants, and  pensioners. We are in favor of a priority statute for our  national capital.    We are siding with the Bulgarian youths who are the victims  of irresponsible experiments, dooming them to unemployment and  hopelessness. We are rejecting the anti-Bulgarian approach to  the young generation. Bulgaria belongs to you, young friends,  do not leave it to others. It shall be the country which we all  are going to create.    We are also addressing our Bulgarian women with hopeful  confidence. Mothers of the homeland, let us protect together  the national ideals and interests, the lives, efforts, and  future prosperity of your children. We are in favor of social  protection and support the nation's biological survival. We are  against the slandering and disgracing of those who created  Bulgaria in ancient times and in our contemporary history.    We are watching the developments in the Rhodope area with  concern. Let us raise our voice of warning against all  unpatriotic elements. Bulgarian Muslims are Bulgarians just  like all of us, like all Eastern Orthodox, Catholics,  Protestants, and atheists in Bulgaria.    We shall never permit the poison of Macedonianism to corrupt  the souls of Bulgarians in the Pirin area and in Vardar  Macedonia. It is justified to fight the relapses into  Macedonianism with fire and sword.    No Macedonian nation or language whatsoever exist. Our  brothers in the Vardar area must be granted the right of free,  ethnic, self-identification.    We appeal for the integration with the peoples belonging to  Christian civilization, for integration with the ancient values  of Europe, an insuperable part of which we have always been.    Once more we would like to recall our feelings of sympathy  and friendship with Russia. This glorious Slavonic country was  a great positive factor for the birth of the Third Bulgarian  State. Today, when Russia is going through difficulties and  privations, despite all things, we are convinced that its  historical existence shall always be a factor of peace and  stability in the world, in Europe, and the Balkans.    We respect and appreciate the remarkable democratic values  created by the brilliant minds of numerous U.S. citizens. We  shall always remember the words of Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin  Franklin, the great founders of the United States, that freedom  is the greatest benefit of mankind. We are proud that hundreds  of thousands of Bulgarians have participated in the building of  the economically most powerful state in the world, as its equal  citizens, and that one of them even invented the computer.    We would like to strengthen the traditional cooperation and  the spirit of understanding with Germany. Our joint victories  and defeats have taught us that nothing is more valuable than a  hand of assistance offered in hard times.    Dear compatriots, four years ago, the All-National Committee  lit the spark of Bulgarian patriotism and nationalism. Today  the spark is growing into a flame. Tomorrow it shall light the  fire of purification and rebirth. The only principle worth  announcing shall be: Bulgaria above everything.</p>

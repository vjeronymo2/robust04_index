			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Al-Asad-Clinton Geneva Summit"] </F>   [Text] All eyes are nowadays focused on Geneva, where  Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton will meet in a summit  the day after tomorrow, Sunday [16 January]. Observers pin  great hopes on this meeting, which they expect will produce  positive results that would push forward the peace process.  Such a meeting should be held and the United States should  throw its full weight behind continuation of the peace process,  especially after the Israeli rulers have displayed intentions  which show they are not interested in a genuine peace, but in  wasting time, avoiding the resolutions of international  legitimacy, and avoiding compliance with the letters on the  basis of which the Madrid conference was launched.    Given this situation, Syria has understood the facts and  knows for certain that Israel is maneuvering and seeking  separate deals with this or that Arab party. Israel has also  continued to exercise the ugliest forms of suppression,  terrorism, and murder. Israel has continued to confiscate Arab  lands and build new settlements without any regard for the peace  process or the talks that are being held in more than one  capital and with total disregard for the resolutions of  international legitimacy and human rights charters.    Thus, the Syrian position came clear and firm. In a  nutshell, it is that there can be no peace without an Israeli  withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories; that there can be  no peace but the just comprehensive peace that would restore the  Palestinian Arab people's national legitimate rights; that there  can be no peace without regaining the Arab lands in Syria,  Lebanon, Jordan, and Palestine; and that any attempt by the  Israeli rulers to avoid these principles and facts will be  rejected.    Therefore, the peoples of the region who yearn for the just  and comprehensive peace are pinning hopes on the Presidents  al-Asad-Clinton meeting. This is because peace cannot be  achieved without Syria and the region will not see peace or  stability unless all the Arab parties are involved in the  current peace process and on the basis of UN Security Council  Resolutions 242, 338, and 425 and the land-for-peace formula.    Finally, the Presidents al-Asad-Clinton meeting confirms the  important position of Damascus in the region and its principal  role, which cannot be ignored or avoided, neither in peace nor  in war.</p>

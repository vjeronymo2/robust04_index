			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: UK markets It was perhaps too much to hope that the chancellor could resist the temptation to say 'I told you so'. Still, at least Mr Clarke managed to bite his tongue until Sunday morning, which showed some restraint. The glee in Whitehall seems justified, and not just because it covers the UK's embarrassment over last September's undignified exit from the ERM. Once the shock of the last few days' events has passed, continental interest rates outside Germany should start to fall. That would land the UK in the happy position of having to decide between an appreciation of sterling or falling interest rates. Given that events are already flowing the chancellor's way, he may be tempted to hold back on interest rates until the autumn. There are other benefits for the UK too. With sterling firm, and a further eventual cut in base rates probable rather than possible, gilt yields may well fall too. A revival in continental markets will improve export prospects for British companies, albeit at a somewhat higher exchange rate. UK growth is thus likely to be stronger next year than previously estimated  -with domestic consumption taking a larger slice of the total. As there is little sign of inflationary pressures, all that augurs well for equities. The market has been nervous with equity yields below 4 per cent, but with bond yields and interest rates around their lowest levels for a generation, such fears may ease. That said, investors still have to get through the company reporting season in September, which may show little sign of the much-trumpeted recovery. And however unlikely it may seem now, any spark of renewed inflation would have the markets running for cover.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter requests that paragraph (a) of the proposed rule be revised to clarify that each individual panel may be reworked in accordance with Option I of McDonnell Douglas MD&hyph;11 Service Bulletin 53&hyph;31, or replaced in accordance with Option II of that service bulletin, rather than implying that all panels must be either reworked or replaced. The commenter also requests that the proposal be revised to indicate that installation of operator-manufactured panels with properly installed inserts are acceptable in lieu of production panels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA concurs. Paragraph (a) of this AD has been revised to indicate that the requirements of that paragraph may be accomplished by either reworking an individual panel in accordance with Option I of the service bulletin, or replacing an individual panel in accordance with Option II of the service bulletin. Paragraph (a) of the final rule also has been revised to specify that new panels that meet the original type design or FAA-approved equivalent panels are considered acceptable replacement panels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 32 Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 20 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD. The FAA has been advised that the requirements of this AD have been accomplished on all 20 airplanes of U.S. registry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, should an affected airplane be imported and placed on the U.S. Register in the future, the FAA has been advised that the manufacturer plans to provide required parts and to accomplish the required modification at no expense to operators. Therefore, there is no future economic cost impact of this rule on U.S. operators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Adoption of the Amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

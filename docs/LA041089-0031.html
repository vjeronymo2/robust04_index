			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> NEUTRONS AID CANCER FIGHT  </P> <P> Bombarding tumors with high-energy neutrons instead of X-rays doubles the  percentage of men who survive certain inoperable prostate cancers and could  save the lives of one-fourth of those now killed by the disease, scientists  said last week.  </P> <P> Prostate cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in U.S. men after  lung and colorectal cancer. About 103,000 U.S. men will develop the disease  this year, and 28,500 who have it will die, according to the American Cancer  Society.  </P> <P> Dr. George Laramore of the University of Washington School of Medicine in  Seattle said the study he led indicates that one-quarter of those who die each  year could be saved by nationwide adoption of neutron radiation as the  treatment for such men.  </P> <P> Neutrons are electrically neutral particles in the nucleus, or center, of an  atom. They are massive particles, while X-rays are a form of electromagnetic  radiation, as is light. Beams of neutrons attack cancer cells with about 100  times the energy of X-rays, Laramore said.  </P> <P> The study was conducted at the university and other institutions. It involved  91 men whose cancer spread beyond the prostate. Five years after treatment, 70%  of those who received neutron radiation remain alive, twice the 35% survival  rate among those treated with X-rays.  </P></p>

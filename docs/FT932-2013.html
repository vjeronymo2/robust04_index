			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Freedom of information Hoare Govett's ideas on how companies should manage the flow of information will be useful to a market still coming to terms with the Thorold Mackie insider trading case and the stock exchange censure of London International. All the more so since the basic message is that companies should not use the new, stricter climate on insider trading as an excuse to clam up. While there is no justification for the selective dissemination of market-moving information, Hoare Govett is right to say that the market's collective judgment is improved if analysts can deepen their understanding through regular contacts with companies. Such contacts will be more comfortable if any price sensitive information has previously been put into the public domain. Where one can quibble is over quite how much more information compan-ies should give. Hoare Govett would like to see more detail about strategy at annual meetings as well as cash-flow figures and balance sheets at the interim stage. If companies inform the market through a formal statement when they feel investor expectations are out of line with reality, there should be little likelihood of anything untoward slipping out in private meetings with analysts. Hoare is less anxious to see regular trading statements ahead of a company's closed season even though this leaves a long gap between the interims and final results. But if the market wants a less discriminatory flow of information, it cannot also worry about getting too much. It is difficult to tell whether a given development will move a share price by more than 5 per cent, the trigger suggested by Hoare. Standard Chartered and Lucas must have assumed when briefing analysts last week that their stories were not worth that much. That this assumption turned out to be wrong reinforces the view that it is better to give too much information than too little. Analysts could be just as usefully employed picking through the detail as plucking a few ripe strawberries out of the chairman's bowl at Wimbledon.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian </F> delegation to the Taba talks, by Hasan Abu-Zayid in Taba on 20  January, from the "With the Midday Events" program--recorded]    [Text] [Abu-Zayid] How do you evaluate today's round of  talks?    [Sha'th] I think that progress was made today and yesterday.  I cannot say it is progress in substance, but in method.  Progress in method sometimes opens the door for progress in  substance. We always began from the starting point. When we  resume talks, we also begin from the starting point. Therefore,  the talks were haunted by a ghost called the crossings problem.  Today, I think we agreed on the exact points of agreement and  disagreement in the problem of the crossings so that we will not  again start from zero when talks begin, whether in Taba or on a  higher level when the leaders or foreign ministers meet. This,  in my opinion, is the basic progress made. This progress is  represented in the two sides' readiness to agree to the points  of agreement and disagreement so that we will not start afresh  when we discuss the issue of the crossings once again. We might  later say the problem is not one of crossings, but of the points  that are still controversial. Progress also continued vis-a-vis  the issue of civil administration. I think that except for the  Paris negotiations, which will determine the method of  transferring power in economic issues, only the water problem  remains. I do not want to downplay the importance of the water  problem; it is a difficult problem in the Arab-Israeli conflict.  It is difficult for the Palestinians, especially in Gaza. It  is the only remaining problem and needs to be solved. All the  rest deals with the method. Hence, we can really say that by  the end of tomorrow nothing will practically remain except the  issue of water.    [Abu-Zayid] If no agreement is reached in Taba, will the  issue of border crossings be discussed in Oslo or elsewhere?    [Sha'th] I do not know what will exactly be discussed in  Oslo. What is certain is that these negotiations are continuing.  If Oslo presents an opportunity to solve some problems, we will  naturally seize that opportunity. Nevertheless, these  negotiations are continuing. Next Monday, delegations of the  Security and Civilian Affairs Committees will meet as usual.    [Abu-Zayid] What do you expect from the Peres-'Arafat Oslo  meeting this week?    [Sha'th] The meeting is basically Arab, that is, the aim of  going to Oslo is to pay tribute to late Norwegian Minister  Holst. We--President 'Arafat and I--are going there to take part  in his funeral. Minister Peres is also going there to offer his  condolences. But there will be an opportunity to meet.    [Abu-Zayid] Will that opportunity be enough to benefit from  this meeting and reach an agreement?    [Sha'th] That might be possible. If this happens, I will  undoubtedly be happy. The Norwegian ambassador here told me:  Holst's soul will rejoice if you reach a peace agreement even  during his funeral because he lived and died for peace.  Consequently, Holst's soul will not be distressed if you seize  the opportunity of his funeral to get closer to peace.    [Abu-Zayid] Will 'Arafat today ask for an Egyptian  intervention to bring the Israeli-Palestinian views closer?    [Sha'th] The Egyptian intervention in the negotiations is  always desirable by us and apparently by the Israeli side.  There has been no objection to this constructive role by Egypt.  Therefore, President 'Arafat's meeting with President Husni  Mubarak will certainly be an important meeting during which  President 'Arafat will fully brief President Mubarak on  developments and ask for an Egyptian backing of the peace  process.    [Abu-Zayid] Will the Palestinian side take part in the  Washington talks and who will lead the Palestinian delegation?    [Sha'th] I do not know if anyone has been selected to lead  the Palestinian delegation to Washington or at least to attend  the meeting the heads of delegations will hold in Washington  shortly. However, I think it might be Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat because  he was deputy chairman of the previous delegation led by Dr.  Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi. Consequently, it is logical to have him  there, but this depends on President 'Arafat's decision.</p>

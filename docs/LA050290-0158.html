			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> SANTA ANA YOUTH'S CONDITION CRITICAL AFTER 12,000-VOLT SHOCK  </P> <P> A 16-year-old Santa Ana youth was in critical condition this morning after  12,000 volts of electricity blasted through his body when a metal radio tower  he was trying to install came in contact with a high-voltage power line,  authorities said.  </P> <P> Two others who were involved in the incident are hospitalized in serious  condition at UCI Medical Center in Orange.  </P> <P> Santa Ana Battalion Chief John Chambers said the bolt of electricity that raced  through Sergio Olguin briefly stopped his heartbeat. The current burst holes in  Olguin's hands and feet before exiting his body.  </P> <P> Paramedics revived him before rushing him to Fountain Valley Regional Hospital  and Medical Center.  </P> <P> Olguin, his 17-year-old brother, Caesar, and a friend, Carlos Mangana, 24, were  installing a makeshift 48-foot tower at their home in the 2000 block of Elder  Street when the metal structure tipped and touched the power lines.  </P> <P> The Olguins' sister, Ana, 21, said the bolt of electricity threw Caesar and  Mangana into some nearby bushes. The tower crashed to the ground pinning  Sergio's leg, she said.  </P> <P> "They tried giving him (Sergio) mouth-to-mouth (resuscitation) but he wouldn't  come back," she said. "Caesar came crawling in the house . . . and we called  911."  </P> <P> Chambers said Sergio suffered serious exit wounds. Hospital authorities were  attempting to determine the extent of injuries to his vital organs.  </P> <P> At UCI, doctors were conducting similar tests on Caesar and Mangana, who both  suffered second- and third-degree burns.  </P></p>

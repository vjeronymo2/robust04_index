The government intends to include this plan  in the action program which will be worked out, it is hoped by  early February, to improve the government procurement system.  The government plans to issue this report also in English. In  this way, the government hopes to meet the demand for market  opening by making it easier for foreign companies to participate  in government procurement bidding.    In this action program aimed at improving the government  procurement system, the government, first of all, intends to  thoroughly carry out the open competitive bidding system as  stipulated in the Public Accounts Act. However, it is expected  that because the amount of information to be made public before  the bidding will probably increase drastically, it will be  impossible for the existing official gazettes to handle such a  huge amount of information.    Therefore, the GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT GAZETTE will carry  only  the information on government procurement for those who want to  participate in the bidding. It is planned that the gazette will  carry not only public announcements on the bidding but also  other information, such as plans to introduce the open  competitive bidding system by concerned organs, and lists of  liaison offices. In addition to the official gazettes, a  gazette known as the COMMERCIAL BUSINESS DAILY (CBD), which  deals only with information on government procurement, has been  widely circulated in the United States.</p>

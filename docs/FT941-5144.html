			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / USAir warns of deepening losses in low-cost battle: The biggest test of British Airways' international strategy USAir, the beleaguered US carrier in which British Airways holds a 24.6 per cent stake, yesterday shocked the airline industry by announcing that competition from low-cost carriers would drive it even more heavily into losses this year. Analysts had been looking for a recovery after five years of losses. But USAir said pre-tax losses in the first quarter alone were likely to rise from Dollars 61m to Dollars 200m (Pounds 137m), while for the year as a whole the deficit was expected to be even worse than last year's Dollars 349m. USAir confirmed that BA would not invest any more money in the airline until it was clear that an effective cost-reduction programme was in place and the company's financial performance improved. Late last night the company said it had asked its four labour unions to begin 'substantive talks' on cost cutting and productivity improvements as part of a plan to return USAir to profit. The plan is expected to involve drastic cuts in jobs, wages and conditions of employment. USAir shares tumbled Dollars 1 1/8 to close at Dollars 9. Mr Seth Schofield, the airline's chairman, president and chief executive, said one reason for the first-quarter loss was that unusually severe winter weather in the north-east - USAir's main market - had forced it to cancel about 8 per cent of its flights in January and February. But the main reason for the company's grim financial outlook, Mr Schofield said, was USAir's need to cut fares in response to the steady expansion of low-cost carriers in many of its east coast markets. Last month USAir said it was cutting business fares indefinitely by up to 50 per cent on routes between 96 cities in the eastern US. The move was in response to competition from Southwest Airlines and Continental Airlines, two low-cost carriers which have begun to make significant inroads into its markets. Other large US carriers have responded to low-cost competition by cutting jobs and increasing productivity, so enabling them to match competitors' fares without worsening their financial performance. But USAir has so far made little progress in reducing costs, so lower fares will translate into bigger losses. BA has invested nearly Dollars 400m in USAir and was due to invest another Dollars 450m between now and 1998. But yesterday it said it would not commit any more funds 'until the outcome of the restructuring is known.' Lex, Page 22</p>

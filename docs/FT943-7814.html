			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Let the children decide - Diary of a Private Investor / Kevin Goldstein-Jackson explains why his daughters have a summer task Summer holiday time and the children are getting restless. My eldest daughter, aged 12, has suddenly become very fashion-conscious and is urging yet another visit to the local Etam shop where she and her friends love the Tammy Girl clothes. No wonder Etam's 1994 annual report says the company 'has one of the faster stock turns in the retail trade' and listed pre-tax profit up 28 per cent on the previous year. I wish I had bought shares for my daughter in 1985: she would have more than doubled her money. Instead, in 1985, I used money provided by a relative to buy each of my two daughters a baby bond. These were offered by the Tunbridge Wells Equitable friendly society and were promoted as a 'tax-free investment for children aged 0-18'. Basically, it was a 10-year, unit-linked endowment policy which could be funded by monthly instalments totalling Pounds 100 a year, or with a lump sump of Pounds 800. I chose the lump sum method. The promotional literature claimed the bonds would achieve a minimum 'estimated value' after 10 years of Pounds 2,004 but added that, under certain circumstances, this could reach Pounds 2,767. I think it is unlikely that either figure will be achieved. In April this year, just 18 months before their maturity date, a statement showed the bonds were worth just Pounds 1,420.59 each. A society official explained: 'In a contract of this nature, where growth in unit prices is dependent on investment expertise and the underlying economic climate, it is impossible to predict the eventual policy value at a particular time in the future.' My daughters are now old enough to understand fully the value of money and the importance of sound investment. They are not very impressed by the baby bonds. When these mature, they intend to find a good home for the proceeds. Indeed, they believe they can do better by choosing their own direct investments. They prefer to buy shares in individual companies rather than investing via a unit trust. This is, partly, because they remember the pleasure (and profit) they gained a few years ago when they owned shares in the Walt Disney company of the US. They appreciate visiting and using the products and services of the companies in which they have invested. Since they have travelled widely, they also understand the vagaries of fluctuating currencies. That is why the profits from their investment in Disney were put into a bank account - in Swiss francs. It is no longer sufficient for banks to offer money boxes, comics and other freebies. What concerns my children most is how much interest they will get. My youngest daughter has an account with the National Westminster bank but only a small amount remains on deposit there. Most of the rest has been transferred to a Young Sovereign account with the Skipton building society. This earns 6.5 per cent gross a year and, if she does not withdraw anything until December 1, she will get an additional 2 per cent gross. A Young Sovereign account can be opened with a minimum initial deposit of Pounds 25. Since many banks and societies pay interest of only 1 or 2 per cent to many of their young savers, Young Sovereign has big attractions to children who are serious about investment. As my daughters do not pay tax, they have registered with the Inland Revenue (on Form R85) provided by the building society to receive their interest without having any tax deducted. It is important also to remember that, subject to certain conditions, children have the same income and capital gains tax allowances as adults. The Inland Revenue leaflet IR110, A Guide for People with Savings, is available from tax offices and includes a section that covers children's accounts. Young people are naturally inquisitive. I have, therefore, set my daughters the holiday task of asking their young friends to name their favourite products and predict the next trend or craze. Perhaps the results will lead to a company in which my daughters can make a profitable investment. It might even be Etam.</p>

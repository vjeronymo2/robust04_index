			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Complete guide to identity Sir, Robert Scallon is not alone. Surely an ID card, preferably incorporating a photograph, far from being a restriction of civil liberties as has been suggested, would, being a guarantee of identity, ensure holders of all rights and privileges to which they are entitled. But how do we persuade the government that they are essential? Martin Gordon, 36 College Avenue, Maidenhead, Berks SL6 6AX</p>

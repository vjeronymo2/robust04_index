			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Observer: Just in case The Bingham report into the collapse of BCCI, the corrupt international bank, could have landed its author, Lord Bingham, in very hot water. The report - commissioned by the government - was at one stage scheduled to be published today. However, the inquiry has few precedents and so it was only late in the day that the Treasury's solicitors discovered that very little privilege attached to it. In other words, Lord Bingham, the new Master of the Rolls, could have been sued for libel. Rather than risk a lorryload of writs landing on the desk of the most senior civil court judge, the Treasury has decided to postpone publication till the report can be released under parliamentary privilege when the Commons resumes.</p>

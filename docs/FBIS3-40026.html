			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League Secretary Umberto </F> Bossi by Daniele Vimercati in Rome; date not given: "Bossi:  `Beware the Wrath of the North'"--first paragraph is IL GIORNALE  introduction]    [Text] "Italy faces a clear-cut alternative: the League in  government or secession." Between one election rally and  another -- this evening he will be in Brescia -- Umberto Bossi  vents the bad temper caused by the troubled events leading up to  the election and sets out his anxieties regarding the next  parliamentary term. The deep north resounds with the cry of  pain raised by the League's hard-liners, who will not swallow  the alliance with Berlusconi and "contamination" by the MSI  [Italian Social Movement]. Opinion polls cast doubt on the  League leadership in the north, where it is prey to Forza  Italia. But what Bossi fears more than the forecasts is a  "restoration by stealth," which would give rise to "a grave  danger, the break-up of the state."    [Vimercati] Bossi, what are you up to? Changing the stakes?  They said it was the League that was pursuing the break up of  the state.    [Bossi] I am getting tired of repeating this: Federalism is  the opposite of secession, it is an institutional buffer that  prevents a divorce between areas in the country that differ too  widely.    [Vimercati] Okay, but what do you mean by "either in  government or secession?"    [Bossi] I live among the people, I listen to them. And I  notice that there is a widespread desire to go it alone in the  north. The people will not agree to turn back, to watch while  the centralist state is restored. And if victory were to escape  the League, or if it were to remain outside government, a  centralist comeback would be inevitable. The north would have  no part in it, and the result would be a break up.    [Vimercati] What could happen, in concrete terms?    [Bossi] It is not for me to say, but there are a lot of  people in the north who will not agree to go back to the old  system, to pay new taxes to cover the cost of an unacceptable  political system based on bribes. The north cannot waste this  opportunity, it is ready to go to any lengths. And the south,  too, in my opinion, will go back to its old godfathers or will  try to break its links with the state unless it obtains  development and employment.    [Vimercati] So you maintain that a vote for the  liberal-democratic alignment is a vote for a united Italy?    [Bossi] For a united, federalist Italy. But a win for the  freedom alignment is not enough. Within the alignment, it is  the League that must win, otherwise, if the recycled politicians  in Forza Italia and the CCD [Christian Democratic Center] were  to gain the upper hand, the mechanism of change could be brought  to a standstill.    [Vimercati] You have a single symbol and a joint manifesto,  and yet you refer to the Berlusconians as "recycled." Do you  think that is polite?    [Bossi] I call things as I see them. I will not renege on  the alliance with Forza Italia, even though I understand the  distress that this inflicts on the League members, the people  who have sacrificed themselves for the revolution. But I  cannot, and will not, hide the fact that the League is one thing  and Forza Italia is another. The League was the force behind  the revolution, the locomotive for change. The others have  jumped onto a moving train. If the League wins and goes into  government, it will be another, perhaps decisive, step forward  for us. If Forza Italia wins, or the CCD, or the Right, there  is a danger that the train will stop, or even derail.    [Vimercati] Be honest, now: Is there a leadership problem in  the liberal-democratic alignment?    [Bossi] After the election, what will count will be numbers  in parliament. I am certain that the League will have the  strongest and most united parliamentary party. We shall be a  force to be reckoned with in government, and I have some  surprises up my sleeve, a secret weapon.    [Vimercati] Perhaps you want to emulate the socialists?    [Bossi] This is no laughing matter; the league has been the  socialists' grave. We shall govern with Forza Italia and anyone  else who accepts our manifesto. Of course, I should have  preferred the League to stand alone against the rest, but that  way we would have left Berlusconi in the hands of his inventors,  in other words the Christian democrats.    [Vimercati] Are you sure the DC [Christian Democratic Party]  welcomed Forza Italia's intervention?    [Bossi] Let us say that the Christian democrats intended  Berlusconi to represent the good League member who would eat up  the evil League: the great recycler who, together with Segni,  would put a nice bag of votes into the DC's basket. But we  repulsed poor Segni with losses and broke up the  Segni-Martinazzoli-Berlusconi axis, bringing the latter over to  the freedom alignment.    [Vimercati] So why are you distancing yourselves from him?    [Bossi] Because the misinformation put about by the regime  is  confusing the voters and trying to make them forget which is the  true motive force for change. There is an attempt to bring  political debate back into the confines of a false right-left  confrontation, when the real choice is between statism and the  free market, federalism and centralism. The more the League  wins, the greater will be the triumph of freedom: political,  economic, and institutional freedom.    [Vimercati] Do you not think that Berlusconi shares these  slogans?    [Bossi] We shall see when he is put to the test, when, for  instance, we call for the antitrust rules to be applied to  television.    [Vimercati] Do you intend to join forces with the PDS  [Democratic Party of the Left] in the attack on Fininvest?    [Bossi] The very idea! The private television companies have  been the saving of pluralism in television, but we are against  monopolies, and even duopolies.    [Vimercati] You have recently gone back to attacking the  public prosecutors. Why?    [Bossi] I am afraid they might sway the election campaign,  that they might try to prevent the emergence of a strong  political power capable of extending the arm of the law to the  caste of the examining magistrates as well. Even those who don  gowns must go to jail when they commit mistakes. Diego Curto is  the only one to suffer this fate so far. A single arrest is not  much in a category that has always lived in the shadow of the  parties.    [Vimercati] Do you not fear that calling for a turn of the  screw on the examining magistrates will make you unpopular?    [Bossi] Turning of the screw? No, it is only a matter of  balance. And I guarantee that there will be no more contact  between the judiciary and the parties in federal Italy. That is  why not even one of our candidates is gowned.</p>

			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> STILL DRY: As most of the nation shivers (A35), the problem here is rain -- or  the lack of same. . . . WeatherData, a private weather service, says no  immediate end is in sight for Southern California's prolonged drought. "Right  now, we're starting to get nervous," says meteorologist Rick Dittmann. "This  high pressure has been here, it's been persistent for two months now, and  although we have some of the rainier months ahead, we do need to start getting  some precipitation.". . . The Santa Ana reporting station (B9) shows 1.04  inches of precipitation for the season; normal for this date is 3.01 inches.  Dana Parsons and Mark I. Pinsky  </P></p>

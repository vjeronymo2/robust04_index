			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Poll setback for Romania rulers Romania's opposition has emerged from elections as a force to challenge the ruling National Salvation Front (NSF) for the first time since the removal of Nicolae Ceausescu, Reuter reports from Bucharest. Sunday's polls to elect mayors and councillors passed with minor upsets but without the heavy bloodshed that followed the December 1989 revolution. An exit poll conducted by the BBC in Bucharest suggested the 14-party Democratic Convention opposition bloc would get up to 40 per cent of the vote, the NSF 30 per cent and the ultra-right nationalist RMP 10 per cent.</p>

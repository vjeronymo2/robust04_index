If in the first round of elections more than  half the number of eligible voters cast votes, but no candidate  receives more than half the number of valid votes cast  (hereinafter: unsuccessful round of elections),    7.3.a. candidates running and having received no  less than 15 percent of the valid votes cast in the first round  of elections may run in the second round of elections; if fewer  than three candidates received at least 15 percent of the valid  votes cast, the three candidates receiving the largest number of  votes in the first round of elections may run in the second  round of elections;    7.3.b. and the candidate receiving the largest  number of valid votes shall become a National Assembly  representative, provided that more than one-fourth the number of  all eligible voters in the district voted.    7.4.

Special elections shall be held if no first  or second rounds of election were held in an individual voting  district due to the lack of a candidate. (Paragraph 46.)    8.1. Candidates whose names appear on the various  party slates in regional voting districts shall receive their  mandates in the order they are listed on the various party  slates and in proportion to the number of votes cast for each  party slate, provided that more than half the number of eligible  voters cast votes. The proportionate allocation of votes cast to  the various party slates shall be made pursuant to the formula  specified in the Appendix to this Law.    8.2. If the first round of elections in a regional  voting district is invalid because fewer than half the number of  eligible voters voted, all party slates competing in the first  round of elections may compete in the second round of elections.  Candidates whose names appear on the various party slates shall  receive their mandates in proportion to the number of votes cast  for each party slate, provided that more than one-fourth the  number of eligible voters have voted. The proportionate  allocation of votes cast to the various party slates shall be  made pursuant to the formula specified in the Appendix to this  Law.    8.3. If after the proportionate allocation of  votes cast for the various party slates pursuant to Paragraphs  8.1. and 8.2. a mandate remains unallocated, the candidate  receiving more than two-thirds the number of votes required to  receive a mandate--although fewer votes than otherwise required  for the allocation of a mandate--shall also receive a mandate.  From among several candidates receiving more than two-thirds the  number of votes, but fewer than the number of votes otherwise  required for a mandate, the candidate receiving the highest  number of votes shall receive the mandate. Upon completion of  the above process, unallocated mandates shall be added to the  number of mandates available from the national slate.    8.4. If a mandate is acquired pursuant to  Paragraph 8.3., the difference between the number of votes  required to acquire a mandate, and the number of votes actually  cast for the candidate shall be deducted from the national  aggregate number of fractional votes allocated to the party that  nominated the candidate.    8.5. A candidate running on a regional slate shall  be deemed to have failed to acquire a mandate pursuant to  Paragraphs 8.1.-8.3., unless he received more than two-thirds  the number of votes cast needed to acquire a mandate in the  given voting district, and more than four percent of the  national aggregate number of votes cast for the various regional  party slates.    8.6. Parties announcing combined slates at least  eight days prior to the elections shall receive mandates in  proportion to the aggregate number of votes cast for their  slates of candidates. When announcing combined slates of  candidates, the sequence in which individual candidates are  slated to receive mandates shall also be announced. Such  announcement shall be made public by the election board.    8.7. Parties fielding joint or combined slates in  regional voting districts shall inform the election board no  less than eight days prior to the elections of the proportion in  which their remaining fractional votes are to be allocated to  the national aggregate number of fractional votes.    8.8. In the event that two or more parties receive  identical numbers of votes entitling each to receive mandates,  and if fewer mandates are available in the regional voting  district than the number of parties receiving identical numbers  of votes, the mandates shall be allocated in the sequence the  various parties appear on the ballot form.    8.9. Special elections shall be held if, due to  the lack of party slates, no first or second rounds of election  were held in a regional voting district. (Paragraph 46.)    9.1. Candidates fielded on the national slates  shall receive their mandates in proportion to the national  aggregate number of fractional votes, and in the order of the  announcement of such fractional votes. The following shall be  regarded as fractional votes:    9.1.a. votes cast for candidates fielded by  parties in individual voting districts in the first valid round  of elections, which resulted in no mandate in either round of  elections; and    9.1.b. votes cast for slates in a regional voting  district in a valid round of elections, which were insufficient  for a mandate, or were in excess of the number of votes required  for a mandate.    9.2. Votes cast in an invalid round of elections  shall not be regarded as fractional votes and therefore shall be  disregarded from the standpoint of mandates to be acquired from  national slates. Similarly, the number of votes cast for a  party's regional slate, whose national aggregate number of votes  does not exceed four percent of the national aggregate number of  votes cast for the regional slates of all parties, shall not be  regarded as fractional votes.    9.3. Parties having filed notice no later than  eight days prior to the elections of their intent to combine  their national slates shall receive mandates in proportion to  the combined total number of fractional votes allocated to their  slates. When providing such notice to the National Election  Board, the parties shall also state the sequence in which the  candidates receive their mandates. Such notice shall be made  public by the National Election Board.  <H6>  PART III </H6>   THE ELECTORAL PROCESS    Chapter IV    The Election Campaign    10.1.

elections    I. Individual voting district    1. Valid and invalid round of election:    (a) Valid first round of election    A first round of election is valid if more than half the  number of eligible voters cast votes    (b) Invalid first round of election    A first round of election is invalid if half the number, or  fewer eligible voters cast votes.    (c) Valid second round of election    A second round of election after an invalid or unsuccessful  first round of election (Points 1/b and 2/b) is valid if more  than one-fourth the number of eligible voters cast votes.    (d) Invalid second round of election    A second round of election after an invalid or unsuccessful  first round of election (Points 1/b and 2/b) is invalid if fewer  than one-fourth the number of eligible voters cast votes.    2. Successful or unsuccessful round of election:    (a) Successful first round of election    A valid first round of election is successful (Point 1/a) if  a candidate receives more than half the number of votes cast.    (b) Unsuccessful first round of election    A valid first round of election is unsuccessful (Point 1/a)  if no candidate receives more than half the number of votes cast.    (c) Successful second round of election    A valid second round of election after a valid (Point 1/a)  or  invalid (Point 1/b) first round of election is successful if the  votes cast for the various candidates differ.    (d) Unsuccessful second round of election    A valid second round of election (Point 1/c) is unsuccessful  if the candidates received equal numbers of votes.    In individual voting districts the candidate receiving in  the  valid round of election the number of votes specified in Points  2/a or 2/c shall become the National Assembly representative.    II. Regional voting district    1. Valid and invalid round of election:    (a) Valid first round of election    A first round of election is valid if more than half the  number of eligible voters cast votes.    (b) Invalid first round of election    A first round of election is invalid if half the number, or  fewer eligible voters cast votes.    (c) Valid second round of election    A second round of election after an invalid first round of  election (Point 1/b) is valid if more than one-fourth the number  of eligible voters cast votes.    (d) Invalid second round of election    A second round of election after an invalid first round of  election (Point 1/b) is invalid if one-fourth the number of  eligible voters or fewer eligible voters cast votes.    2. Preconditions for calculating the outcome of regional  slate election results:    (a) national tally of votes cast for regional slates,  separately per party;    (b) identification of parties whose national vote total does  not exceed the four percent margin established in Paragraph 8.5.  of the Law.    3. Calculating results in a valid round of elections held in  a regional voting district:    (a) The number of votes cast for the various parties'  electoral slates shall be added up (hereinafter: the total  number of valid votes).    (b) One additional mandate shall be added to the number of  mandates that can be obtained in a voting district (hereinafter:  divider).    (c) The total number of valid votes shall be divided by the  divider. The quotient thus derived represents the number of  votes needed to acquire a mandate.    (d) The number representing two-thirds of the number of  votes  needed to acquire a mandate shall be calculated (hereinafter:  two-thirds limit).    (e) The number of votes cast for a given party slate shall  be  divided by the number of votes required to acquire a mandate.  The whole number derived as a result of the division equals the  number of mandates acquired by the party, in due regard to the  provisions of Paragraph 8.8. of the Law. The remainder after the  division, as well as votes not resulting in mandates constitute  fractional votes.    (f) If, after the division pursuant to Point (e) there  remains an unallocated mandate, parties receive mandates in the  declining order of fractional votes cast for parties, up to the  two-thirds limit. If all mandates are distributed in a given  voting district, no additional mandates shall be distributed,  irrespective of the two-thirds limit. Except for fractional  votes defined in Paragraph 8.4. of the Law, fractional votes not  resulting in mandates shall be added to the national slate.    (g) After completing the calculation specified in Point (f),  above, in a regional voting district, the still unallocated  mandates shall be added to the national slate.    III. Distribution of mandates that can be  acquiredfrom national slates based on fractional votes    1. Fractional votes resulting in individual and regional  voting districts (Paragraphs 9.1.a. and 9.1.b.) shall be added  up on a nationwide basis separately for each party, in due  regard to the provisions of Paragraph 8.4 of the Law  (hereinafter: total number of fractional votes cast for a party).    2. The number of fractional votes cast for all the parties  throughout the country shall be a added up (hereinafter:  national fractional vote).    3. The number of mandates not allocated from regional slates  (Point II/3/g) shall be added to the maximum number of mandates  that can be acquired from the national slate (58).    4. The national aggregate number of fractional votes shall  be  divided by the number of unallocated mandates per Point 3 above.  The resultant quotient shall represent the number of votes  required to allocate a mandate.    5. The number of fractional votes cast for any given party  shall be divided by the number of votes required for the  allocation of a mandate. The whole number quotient derived as a  result of the division shall represent the number of mandates to  be allocated to any given party. Fractions and fractional votes  not resulting in mandates shall be the repeat fractional votes  (hereinafter: repeat fractional votes).    6. If after the division specified in Point 5 above there  remains an unallocated mandate, the number of repeat fractional  votes shall be divided by the number of unallocated mandates.  This calculation produces the number of votes required for  allocating one mandate. The allocation of mandates shall be  continued based on the new quotient and on repeat fractional  votes in a declining order, until the number of mandates shown  in Point 3 above are allocated.    7. If, after completing the calculation pursuant to Point 6  above, there remain unallocated mandates, the calculation shall  be repeated after deducting the already allocated mandates and  the number of votes already taken into consideration.    IV. Relationship between the 4-percent limitand the  mandates that can be acquiredthrough regional slates    1. The number of votes cast for regional slates nationwide  shall be added up separately for each party (hereinafter: number  of slate votes cast for a party).    2. Slate votes cast for all parties shall be added up  (hereinafter: number of slate votes cast).    3. Four percent of the number of slate votes cast shall be  calculated.    4. Any party receiving more slate votes than the four  percent  margin, shall receive the mandates acquired in the regional  voting district, as well as mandates from the national slate,  based on fractional votes.    5. Any party receiving fewer slate votes than the four  percent margin shall    (a) lose the fractional votes acquired in the individual  voting district,    (b) not acquire mandates from the regional voting district,  and shall    (c) not acquire mandates from the national slate.  <H6>  Appendix 5(Paragraph 52.e.) </H6>   Sample ballot form -- individual voting district    [Form omitted]  <H6>  Appendix 6(Paragraph 52.e.) </H6>   Sample ballot form -- regional voting district    [Form omitted]  <H6>  Appendix 7(Paragraph 52.f.) </H6>   Information on nominating candidates    A candidate may be nominated by completing and submitting  the  "Nominating slip."

[Signed] Dr. Matyas Szuros, provisional president  of the Republic;Dr. Istvan Fodor, acting president  of the National Assembly   <H6>    LEGISLATIVE INTENT </H6>   to the legislative proposal on theElection of  National Assembly Representatives  <H6>  GENERAL INTENT </H6>   Our history, and close to 1,000 years of statehood have  taught us that the Hungarian people always had a sincere desire  to enforce their right and to perform their responsibility to  direct and shape their own fortunes. After aspiring for freedom  and independence for centuries, at the end of the 20th Century  we once again have an opportunity to establish a constitutional  state consistent with European concepts of freedom--a century  that put to test individuals as well as nations.    The substance of suffrage and representation is the most  sensitive issue from the standpoint of public law. Exercising  the right to vote--a political right to which every citizen is  entitled--is also the means for establishing a representative  body. The provisions of an electoral law by which a  representative body is created must not be based on arbitrary  criteria. The standards contained in such law must be  organically related to existing social conditions, and a true  reflection of the relative strength of various political forces  must be guaranteed. In addition to introducing the fundamental  institutions of direct, democratic representation (popular  referendums, popular initiatives, and so forth)--the subjects of  unfair neglect in the past, to be used in a reasonable manner  and with moderation under law in the future--secure foundations  for governance will, undoubtedly, be established by the periodic  renewal of representative bodies based on the people's will.  This is a common characteristic of every modern, democratic,  constitutional state.    At the present stage of our social development we must  establish a system of political representation in which the  policy-formulating influence and strength of political parties  increases, in addition to having reliable and credible people,  fit to perform the tasks.    The new electoral law is not simple, because it is adapted  to  the existing transitional and evolving social and political  conditions. The Proposal provides for a mixed electoral system  that aims for proportional representation, as a result of which  176 representatives will be elected from individual voting  districts, and 152 representative mandates will be acquired by  parties based on votes cast for regional (county) slates of  candidates. An additional 58 candidates will be chosen from  national slates of candidates to compensate for disproportions  resulting from votes cast for candidates running in individual  voting districts or fielded on regional slates. The proposed law  represents a departure from the mechanisms and institutions for  nominating candidates used so far. It eliminates previous  restrictions and establishes new legal criteria for nominating  candidates.    Procedural rules guarantee the freedom and fairness of  elections. From the standpoint of openness, the freedom to  conduct election campaigns, and the availability of judicial  recourse, the Proposal withstands any comparison. The Proposal  guarantees rights to citizens, while it primarily prescribes  duties for state agencies, organizations involved in the  administration of the elections, and for the mass media: it  assigns tasks to be performed by them to help citizens enforce  their rights.    SECTION BY SECTION ANALYSIS    1. The Proposal preserves the traditional and  democratic basic principles of elections: Suffrage is general  and equal, and secret ballots are cast directly for candidates.    2. The Proposal provides a narrower definition of  disenfranchised persons than before. The fact that  disenfranchisement can only occur pursuant to law, based on the  judgment of a court serves as a guarantee.    In a departure from legal provisions presently in force, the  Proposal also provides a right to be elected: Any person with a  permanent residence in Hungary and entitled to vote can also be  elected.    The fact that Hungarian citizens staying abroad on election  day, or whose permanent or temporary residence is not in  Hungary, are regarded as impeded from the standpoint of casting  votes, is a new element in the Proposal. This new provision is  based on the fact that the Proposal views suffrage as a basic  political right to which every Hungarian citizen is entitled,  and regards persons staying abroad for long or short periods of  time as impeded only insofar as the exercise of that right is  concerned.    3. The eligible voters' free choice between  exercising or not exercising the right to vote, as provided for  by the Proposal, is significant as a matter of principle. This  provision establishes an absolute opportunity for the exercise  of the right to vote, but not a legal obligation to vote.    4. An extremely large variety of electoral  procedures are used by various countries having multi-party  systems. One finds examples for systems based purely on voting  for slates of candidates, and others based exclusively on  systems of individual voting districts, and yet others, in which  the two systems are combined. At present, the appropriate system  to be adopted in Hungary is one that combines slate voting  linked to the various parties, and voting for candidates running  in individual voting districts--a system in which every vote  counts.    Consistent with the above, the Proposal provides for an  electoral system that combines slate voting and voting for  individual candidates, and different rules to be observed in  electing representatives running or fielded in individual voting  districts and in regional (county, Budapest) voting districts.  About 60,000 residents elect a representative from each  individual voting district. Voters may cast two votes, and  receive two ballot forms to do so. One is used to cast a vote  for a candidate running in the individual voting district, the  other for casting a vote for one of the county (Budapest) slates  of candidates fielded by the various parties. The winning  candidate in an individual voting district receives a mandate.  Votes cast in individual and regional voting districts  nationwide, not materializing in individual or slate mandates,  are added up, and 58 mandates are allocated to the national  slates of parties in proportion to the aggregate number of  "fractional votes" cast for each party.    As a result of this combined electoral system, 176  representatives will be elected to serve in the National  Assembly from individual voting districts, 152 representatives  from regional voting districts, and 58 representatives from  national slates of candidates. There will be a total of 386  National Assembly representatives.    The legal status of each representative is equal; the way  they acquire their mandates--from individual or regional voting  districts, or from national slates--has no bearing on their  status.    5. The method of nominating candidates for  National Assembly representative varies according to the  differences specified in Paragraph 4. Persons eligible to vote,  and their social organizations qualifying under the law on the  functioning and management of parties may, in their own right,  nominate candidates to run in individual voting districts. Only  persons eligible to vote may be nominated, and an additional  condition requires that 750 nominating slips be collected from  persons residing in the voting district and eligible to vote.  Candidates nominated by eligible voters, or by social  organizations which do not organize themselves as parties are  called "independent candidates."    Parties may field candidates in regional voting districts  only if they also field candidates in at least one-fourth the  number of voting districts within the regional voting district,  but in no event fewer than two voting districts. The intent of  this provision is to prevent weightless, ad hoc groupings  without grass roots support to play a role in Budapest or county  public life.    Parties fielding at least seven regional slates may field  candidates on national slates.    The Proposal enables parties to nominate the same person as  a  candidate in an individual voting district and a regional voting  district, and, in addition, to list that person's name on the  party's national slate. This enables parties to provide a  greater chance to persons they regard as particularly important  from their own standpoints.    6. Consistent with the new order of nomination,  the Proposal conditions candidacy by a statement to be issued by  the candidate, in addition to requirements established earlier  in the Proposal (signatures of support, and the established  ratio of candidates fielded). Candidates must issue statements  attesting to the fact that they are eligible voters and that  they accept the nomination, and must also state that they hold  no office inconsistent with the representative mandate, and that  they would resign such office, if elected. The Constitution  specifies these conflict of interest rules.    Candidates conforming with these conditions are registered  by  election boards without further evaluation. The sole reason for  which election boards can reject candidates is noncompliance  with established legal criteria.    7.-9. Consistent with the logic applied to  nominations, election results are also determined on the basis  of different sets of rules. The fact that a certain proportion  of eligible voters must cast votes for a representative to be  elected is a common rule. In the first round of elections the  criterion of validity is that more than half the number of  eligible voters cast votes. Since greater public interest is  attached to the allocation of a representative mandate than to  holding a third or fourth round of elections, an auxiliary rule  recognizes the votes of one-fourth the number of eligible voters  as the validity criterion for a second round of elections. Two  rounds of elections may be held in individual voting districts.  A candidate running in an individual voting district acquires  his mandate in the first round of elections, if he receives more  than half the number of valid votes cast. The first round of  elections is invalid if no candidate receives more than half the  number of valid votes cast. Candidates receiving more than 15  percent of the valid votes cast in the first round of elections  may run in the second round of elections. Unless at least three  persons receive 15 percent of the valid votes cast, the three  candidates receiving the highest number of votes in the first  round of elections may run in the second round of elections. The  mandate is awarded in the second round of elections to the  candidate receiving the highest number of votes.    Parties fielding regional slates of candidates receive  mandates in proportion to the number of votes cast for their  respective slates. Party candidates receive mandates in the  sequence in which candidates have been announced by their  respective parties, the exact number of such candidates  depending on the proportion of votes cast for each party. The  Appendix to this Law describes the exact method by which these  proportions and the award of mandates are to be calculated; the  method was specified in due regard to international experience  and traditions followed in Hungary. In order to enforce the  principle of majority rule, the Proposal establishes two  barriers in the path of mandates to be acquired from slates. One  is that mandates cannot be acquired with fewer votes than  two-thirds the number of votes calculated and required for the  acquisition of a mandate in any given regional voting district.  [The other barrier:] Parties acquiring fewer than four percent  of the votes cast for all the parties in a regional voting  district cannot receive mandates either from their regional, or  from their national slates of candidates. This solution ensures  that National Assembly decisions are made solely by political  forces that enjoy actual societal support.    Voters do not cast votes for the national slates of  candidates; instead, parties receive mandates after the national  aggregate number of fractional votes is known, pursuant to the  method of calculation specified in the Appendix to this law.    10. The proposal provides great latitude in the  election campaign for both voters and parties. It only prohibits  the solicitation of nominating slips in places where such  activity is regarded as unacceptable annoyance (in the patient  care sections of health care institutions, on mass  transportation vehicles), and where the influencing of voters is  not desirable due to relationships of dependence, and therefore  must be prohibited by law (workplaces, armed forces).    Signatures for nominating candidates must be provided on  slips received by every registered voter, as part of a notice  advising the voter that he is registered. If in doubt, the  election board verifies the authenticity of signatures.    Eligible voters are free to organize election rallies, and  such rallies are open to the public. The organizer of a rally is  responsible for maintaining order.    11.-12. To ensure equal chances for every party,  the Proposal provides for the mass media (Hungarian Radio,  Hungarian Press, Hungarian Telegraphic Office [MTI] to  participate in the election campaign.    To ensure an atmosphere in which the free expression of the  voters' will is not influenced during the period immediately  preceding election day, and on election day, the Proposal  restricts the publication of public opinion poll results, and  prohibits campaigning beginning at 0000 hours the day before the  elections.    13. As part of the rules governing the election  campaign, the Proposal provides for the preparation of wall  posters, advertisements, signs and pamphlets. Such campaign  material may be prepared without special permit. The Proposal  restricts the placement and posting of posters only to protect  public and private interests. These include: the placement of  posters on building walls and fences only with the building  owner's or manager's permission.    Local councils may define by ordinance public buildings and  parts of public areas where the placement of election  advertisements and wall posters is prohibited in order to  protect the appearance of a city, historical places, the  environment, or interests related to foreign tourism.    14.-18. Detailed rules concerning the method of  voting have not undergone fundamental changes, but are  supplemented by stronger guarantees to ensure the fairness of  elections. A new provision includes the requirement that polling  places cannot be established in buildings exclusively used by  one or another political party; that pens, rather than pencils  be used to mark ballot forms; and that the first person casting  a vote at a polling place must also check the ballot boxes.    Consistent with rules now in force, the chairman of the  returning board is responsible for maintaining order at the  polling place and its vicinity, and the policeman on duty at the  polling place may enter the polling place only with the  permission of the chairman of the returning board.    19. Consistent with the electoral system  characterized by two votes to be cast, separate ballot forms are  provided for voting for individual district candidates, and for  regional slates, respectively.    20. The method of voting differs from the practice  followed thus far. The earlier negative voting (crossing out the  name of a candidate not desired) is replaced by positive voting:  A "+" mark must be placed in the box on the ballot form next to  the candidate's and the party's name. Votes can only be cast for  candidates and parties appearing on the ballot form, by  designating the candidate and the party slate for whom the voter  casts his vote. Parties establish fixed slates, i.e., voters can  cast their votes only for the slate as a whole. Therefore, with  respect to an otherwise valid vote (in which the official ballot  form is used and it is clear for which party slate the vote is  cast), changes made in the sequence of the candidates within a  slate, deletions from, or additions to the slate must be  disregarded. Such votes must be regarded as valid votes cast for  a given party slate.    21.-25. The Proposal does not change the rules  for, and the traditional order of the voting process, with which  people are familiar. The proposal introduces only a few  supplemental rules that strengthen the societal openness of the  elections. These include a requirement that a copy of the  minutes containing the election results be deposited to the  archives in the area of jurisdiction, and that ballots cast be  preserved until the final settlement of possible pending  judicial proceedings challenging the election results.    26.-34. The establishment and composition of  administrative boards involved in the elections are consistent  with practices based on the principle of having [several]  parties. Notably: every party that fields a candidate and the  representative of every independent candidate is, by law, a  member of the relevant administrative board.    The chairmen and secretaries of administrative boards are  impartial; neither of these officials can be members of a party  fielding candidates, nor can they be representatives of an  independent candidate. A fixed number of members in each  administrative body is chosen either by the National Assembly,  or by councils. Elective and delegated members of administrative  bodies have equal rights and duties.    35. Working groups without any decision-making  authority assist in the functioning of the administrative  bodies. These groups perform administrative, technical, and  organizing functions. Members of the working group take an oath  to unconditionally uphold legality.    36.-39. The method of forming precincts remains  unchanged as compared to rules presently in force.    The State Census Bureau continues to prepare the register of  voters.    The manner in which the register is compiled, the display of  the register for public inspection, and rules for legal recourse  against the illegal exclusion or inclusion of a voter have not  changed.    40. The proposal retains previous provisions  permitting people to vote with certificates, but includes  additional safeguards to prevent possible abuse of this  opportunity. Certificates must be preserved as part of the  election documents, so that in case of doubt--e.g. in court  proceedings--the validity of votes cast based on certificates  may be proven in a credible manner.    41. Openness plays a definitive role in ensuring  the fairness of elections. Accordingly, provisions to the effect  that actions and operations of administrative boards are matters  of public record, and that data and facts available to  administrative boards cannot be classified as secrets, reflect  adherence to significant principles.    The populace must be informed of every fact, deadline, or  information related to the elections and of interest to the  public.    Members of the press need no separate permit to observe the  workings of the administrative boards, and therefore the  Proposal lifts constraints that existed earlier.    Only one restriction exists, notably: on election day, in  order to safeguard the fairness of the elections: partial  election results must not be made public prior to 2000 hours,  i.e., the final hour when polls close according to the law.    The amount of funds available to candidates and to parties  for the campaign, and the kinds of funds they use for various  purposes is of public concern, and therefore is also part of  openness. For this reason, these data must be publicized by the  press.    42.-45. From the standpoint of ensuring the  legality of elections and of protecting the exercise of  fundamental political rights, provisions pertaining to judicial  recourse, as contained in the Proposal, are of outstanding  importance.    The basic feature of the system of legal recourse is that  the  administrative boards provide first instance remedies to actions  objected to. The aggrieved party may turn to the courts, if an  administrative board rejects an objection. A one-step court  proceeding not subject to appeal is provided for.    46. Special elections must be held in both  individual and regional voting districts, if the second round of  an election is also invalid because fewer than one-quarter the  number of eligible voters participated, or because the election  could not be held in lack of a candidate or a slate.    Special elections must be held in individual voting  districts  only when the mandate of a representative expires. (Criteria for  such expiration are detailed in the Constitution.) Mandates  vacated by representatives elected from regional or national  slates may be disposed of by the party that established the  slate. The party that established the slate may designate any  representative from the slate to fill the vacated mandate. The  sole condition established in this regard is that the party  select a person announced by the party to be included in the  slate at the time of the general elections; the sequence of the  candidates on the slate may be disregarded.    Even though special elections could also produce fractional  votes, special election results have no effect on mandates  allocated from the national slate.    47. The temporary exemption from under regular or  reserve military duty, and the free of charge access to public  transportation enjoyed by candidates are intended to provide  opportunities for the candidates' real participation in the  election campaign.    48. Based on a new feature in the elections--the  use of computer technology--which increases openness and permits  faster communications to the public, the Proposal distinguishes  between preliminary and final election results. Preliminary  results are published in daily newspaper, while final results  appear in MAGYAR KOZLONY.    49. Rules pertaining to the calling of elections  are contained in the Constitution; the electoral law has to  settle only the duration of the election proceedings. This  remains unchanged: the duration is 90 days.    50.-51. The National Assembly appropriates funds  to cover the cost of state functions related to the elections.    Budgeted funds must be used to finance the expenditures of  the state on the one hand, and the costs incurred by the various  parties participating in the elections, on the other. The latter  must be financed in order to ensure equal opportunity for all  parties to win. The Proposal establishes standard amounts of  support for the various parties: they receive state  contributions in proportion to the candidates fielded.  Independent candidates are entitled to the same amount of  support as candidates nominated by parties.    53. Consistent with his changed role, the minister  of the interior directs the state functions related to the  preparation and implementation of elections.    54. The proposal continues to exempt proceedings  related to the elections and to the entitlement to vote from  under payment of official dues.    55. The Legislative Law requires that all laws be  in mutual harmony from the standpoint of both content and form.  It would be appropriate to place provisions of this law  referring to election rallies under the authority of the Law on  the Right to Assemble, and the text of the law must be changed  accordingly.    56. The Proposal provides that the Law take effect  on the day of its proclamation. Following the effective date,  provisions of Law No. 3 of 1983 must still be applied insofar as  the election of council members is concerned.</p>

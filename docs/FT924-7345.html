			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitions provide lift at Jarvis Porter A JUMP in interim profits at Jarvis Porter, which prints labels for the spirits, toiletries and pharmaceutical industries, from Pounds 1.01m to Pounds 1.85m pre-tax, pushed the shares 15p higher to 175p. Profits in the six months to August 31 benefited from acquisitions, improved margins and a swing from interest payable to receivable. Mr Paul Jarvis, chairman, said he was pleased with the results. He said Mr Richard Brewster, the chief executive who joined the group from David S Smith, the paper and packaging group, in May last year, had brought Jarvis Porter greater opportunities to expand by acquisition. The shares are well above the 138p price at which the group placed shares in July to finance a Pounds 11.4m acquisition of businesses from James Wilkes. That deal went through in August, and the businesses were owned for three weeks of the period. The results also included a full contribution from Holmes McDougall, bought in June last year for Pounds 7m. Sales rose 23 per cent to Pounds 16.4m and operating profits 60 per cent to Pounds 1.84m. Operating margins were 11.3 per cent, compared to 8.6 per cent, and 10.2 per cent for the 1991-92 year. Net interest receivable was Pounds 12,000 compared to Pounds 142,000 payable. Earnings per share rose 65 per cent to 5.1p and the interim dividend is increased from 1.4p to 1.5p. COMMENT Fans of Mr Brewster who bought shares in Jarvis Porter after his move there last year will feel justified by these results. Already his first acquisition is contributing well and the second appears promising too. More are to be expected, although Mr Brewster is in no great rush and may be less ambitious in the size of deal than he was at David S Smith. Specialisation and solid finances are still to be the key words at Jarvis Porter. Current year forecasts of about Pounds 4.5m pre-tax (up from Pounds 2.19m) suggest a p/e of 16.4. This might look a bit steep but will still attract dedicated followers.</p>

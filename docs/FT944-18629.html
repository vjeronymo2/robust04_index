			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / People (News in the names): Maverick hunter of Swiss banking Martin Ebner, the maverick Swiss stockbroker who is trying to take control of Union Bank of Switzerland, the country's largest bank, was recently referred to as the 'George Soros of Switzerland'. It is a fairly apt comparison. Such is the 49-year-old Ebner's reputation for making big money for his clients that when he launched a new investment fund last April - even in the midst of a Swiss stock market slump - he pulled in SFr3bn within a couple of weeks. Like Soros, he can also lose big sums. That fund launched in April, called Stillhalter Vision, has just reported SFr240m in unrealised paper losses in its first five months of activity. But over the nine years since he left staid Bank J. Vontobel in Zurich, to prove that the Zurich market was ready for a professional block trader, Ebner has been phenomenally successful, both for himself and the dozen or so institutions and wealthy individual clients he serves. His broker-dealer BZ Bank, now one of the biggest players in the Swiss market, achieved a profit of SFr161m last year, with a staff of only 19. BZ Trust, his asset management arm, has some SFr10bn under management. Ebner personally may now figure in lists of Switzerland's richest people, but he remains an outsider by choice, refusing to join the Swiss Bankers Association or to hobnob with Zurich's financial establishment. Friends and foes alike concur that Ebner has an extraordinary nose for market trends. 'A genius,' his former boss Hans-Dieter Vontobel says. And he is widely respected for his willingness to take big risks - which he does every day as a block trader in Switzerland's relatively illiquid equity market. But his advance on UBS has startled many. It is the first time he has shown a taste for political, as well as financial, risks.</p>

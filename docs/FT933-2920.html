			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Factories' unit labour costs head for historic yearly fall THE PAY bill in manufacturing industry has not grown at all this year and British manufacturing is heading for a reduction in unit labour costs in 1993 for the first time since 1960, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday. Providing timely backing for the government's freeze on public sector pay bills next year, announced on Tuesday, the CBI also said that recovery was not bringing a bounce-back in manufacturing pay settlements and that pay freezes remained common. Settlements averaged 2.3 per cent in the second quarter of the year compared with 4 per cent one year earlier. The CBI said prices and employment prospects were now a downward pressure on pay. Its latest survey shows that 60 per cent of employees do not expect a higher pay rise next year. Mr Howard Davies, CBI director general, said the public sector squeeze for 1994-95 would help reduce private sector expectations. The current year's 1.5 per cent public sector limit had helped take one percentage point off private sector settlements. An average reduction of 3 per cent in the first half of this year, combined with the continuing low level of pay rises, virtually ensures the first negative figure for the whole year for more than 30 years. The current position is superior to that in Germany, France, Japan and the US. Sir Michael Angus, CBI president, said: 'Experience in the US has shown that it is possible to keep unit labour costs falling even in a recovery phase.' Economists say it is normal to achieve productivity gains in the first phase of an upturn as output picks up while the workforce remains static. But the CBI said that this upturn was not being accompanied by a sharp rise in hourly labour costs. There is, however, some evidence that the reduction in pay settlements is bottoming out. The latest survey to show a slight increase in the last quarter - from an average increase of 2.09 per cent to 2.49 per cent - comes from the Engineering Employers Federation. Employment in manufacturing has been static since December 1992 at 4.2m. Companies were using more overtime and more part-timers, while the use of performance-related pay had spread, the CBI said.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: View from the pit The government seems to have dug itself into a hole which is getting deeper by the day. That yesterday's unemployment figures were slightly better than the market expected while average earnings are growing at less than 6 per cent is of trifling importance. What matters more is that a headline unemployment rate of more than 10 per cent has been announced in a week in which the government has taken an axe to the coal industry and spurned a market opportunity to cut interest rates. It almost begins to look as if it does not care about recovery at all. After the humiliating exit from the ERM, such behaviour is asking for political trouble. So it is not surprising that sterling should be weak. Exchange markets do not look kindly on countries with economic growth problems whether they are in or outside the ERM. When there is no growth, anti-inflation defences, whether they be high interest rates or tight fiscal policy, lose their power to frighten. It would be difficult for the authorities to undercut German rates by far and for long. Had they had the confidence to cut rates at the start of the week, though, sterling might have held up better. Instead the UK could find itself in a trap where lack of growth makes sterling weak, so interest rates cannot be cut and the lack of growth is compounded. Eventually, of course, credibility would be stretched too far and rates would have to be cut. That might be an occasion for equities to rebound, as they did after Black Wednesday. Until then the market is bedevilled by sheer uncertainty as well as by its anxiety at the determination of the government to cut spending when output is falling. There must be a more coherent policy. The question is: can the government deliver it?</p>

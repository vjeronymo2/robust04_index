Shepilko; UDC 537.877.01] </F>   [Abstract] The numerous inhomogeneities which characterize  real complex obstacles and distinguish them from circular  cylinders and make it difficult to simulate them by a circular  cylinder irradiated with an electromagnetic wave, i.e., a  longitudinal recess or a sectorial cut, necessitated an analysis  of the backscattering cross section on the basis of a strict  solution of the problem of electromagnetic wave field scattering  by a circular infinitely long cylinder with a sectorial cut and  by a sectorial cylinder which may be used for simulating a  bilocal polygon; it is assumed that the cylinder is a perfect  conductor with an exp(-i_o_t) behavior. The problem  is solved in a _r_, , z cylindrical system of  coordinates; the dependence of the sectorial cylinder's  backscattering coefficient on the relative diameter and angular  cut dimension for E and H-polarization is  plotted. The findings are compared to a plane tape and circular  cylinder, and it is shown that the effect of the cut depends on  the wave polarization; this is manifested by the oscillating  behavior of backscattering. The author is grateful to V.P.  Shestopalov and B.Z. Katsenelenbaum for constructive remarks and  discussions. Figures 2; references 7.</p>

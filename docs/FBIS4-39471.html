			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia must have only one president, said Yuriy  Spiridonov, the recently elected head of the Komi Republic. He  told Interfax in an exclusive interview on the eve of the  inauguration ceremony that the Komi leaders had turned down the  idea of instituting the post of president in their republic.  "We are an inalienable part of the Russian Federation," he  said. "Even if the leaders of the republics and regions are  elected by the people, they must not be called presidents, he  added.    To quote Spiridonov, the Constitution of the Komi Republic  provides the local parliament with sufficient rights to control  the head of the government. "A president does not head either  the legislative or the executive bodies. He is above both, so  it is not the president that we are electing. The head of the  Komi Republic directly runs the government, the responsibility  he bears is much greater than that of the president of any  republic," he said.    He expressed regret that the new Russian Constitution does  not contain the Federation Treaty. This makes the Center and  the constituent entities conclude a bilateral agreement in each  particular instance, said Spiridonov.</p>

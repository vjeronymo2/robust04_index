			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The man behind the strikes which paralyzed the  Cameroonian public sector last year has fallen victim to an  internal coup in the country's main trade unions federation.  (Louis Sombe) has been picked up by the security forces, and  the man suspected of being behind his fall is a supporter of  Cameroon's ruling party, the CPDM [Cameroon People's Democratic  Movement], as Victor Apie Ngome reports in this telex from  Yaounde:    (Louis Sombe), the controversial secretary general of  Cameroon's Confederation of Trade Unions, was arrested in his  office this morning together with his son and four other people.  Mr. (Sombe) was having an early briefing session with some of  his staff, when, after a manner that has become customary in  Cameroon, policemen armed with tear gas canisters, truncheons,  and submachine guns stormed the premises and whisked him away in  a white Peugeot car toward unknown destination. His son and the  other four people were driven off in a different direction. It  appears that the union's president, Etame Ndedi, recently  ordered (Sombe)'s dismissal, saying that the union had found him  guilty of indiscipline, but Mr. (Sombe) ignored the order,  saying that Mr. Etame Ndedi's so-called disciplinary committee  had no power to sack him. Mr. Ntame Ndedi also hinted that Mr.  (Sombe)'s financial records were not straight. Union sources say  Mr. Ntame Ndedi had always complained that Mr. (Sombe)'s salary  was too high and that he was living in luxury. Most union staff  boycotted this morning's swearing in of the union's new  secretary general, in solidarity with Mr. (Sombe), who is still  widely respected as the workers' real representative. Many  people have been expecting this arrest to happen and they  believe that Mr. (Sombe)'s sacking has been masterminded by the  government, in order to stop him leading a general strike in  June. Mr. (Sombe) joined the massive strikes that paralyzed the  civil service last December, thereby falling out with Mr. Ntame  Ndedi, who is a member of the central committee of the ruling  CPDM party, and who was against December's strike.</p>

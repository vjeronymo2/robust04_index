These categories of entities listed in the applicable statutes are collectively identified as ``designated entities.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> dates: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments are due no later than December 6, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> addresses: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments to Ms. Deborah O'Neill, Contract Management Division (Code HK), Office of Procurement, NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC 20546. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> for further information contact: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Ms. Deborah O'Neill, (202) 358&hyph;0440. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This rule establishes major policies with respect to contracting and subcontracting with designated entities. With respect to prime contracting, it ensures that designated entities are fully considered for awards. Also, the consolidation or bundling of contract requirements is controlled. With respect to subcontracting, it requires specifying mandatory goals in solicitations for subcontracting with designated entities, evaluating designated entity subcontracting goals proposed by offerors, and including in contracts the designated entity subcontracting goals in addition to the goals included in the subcontracting plan required by 15 U.S.C. 637(d) as implemented in FAR Subpart 19.7. NFS Subpart 1819.70 and the clause at 1852.219&hyph;76 are substantially revised. A new subsection is added to NFS 1815.608. NFS 1870.303, Appendix I, Chapter 301, is amended to cover proposal evaluation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Availability of NASA FAR Supplement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The NASA FAR Supplement, of which this proposed coverage will become a part, is codified in 48 CFR chapter 18, and is available in its entirety on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.

This regulation is needed, because it provides the NASA policy regarding contracting and subcontracting with designated entities. Regarding prime contract awards, the policy ensures that designated entities are fully considered for awards. Regarding subcontracting issues, the policy requires specifying mandatory goals in solicitations for subcontracting with designated entities, evaluating designated entity subcontracting goals proposed by offerors, and including in contracts the designated entity subcontracting goals in addition to the goals included in the subcontracting plan required by 15 U.S.C. 637(d) as implemented in FAR Subpart 19.7. Current regulations do not address these prime contracting and subcontracting policies. The potential costs for this regulatory action are nominal and are not quantifiable. Because the subcontracting goals are included in the contract, costs for contracting with or subcontracting to designated entities would normally be charged to the Government. The potential benefits are the increased direct awards or subcontracting awards to designated entities which will broaden the base of NASA contractors. The value of increasing the contract and subcontract opportunities to designated entities cannot be measured, because it involves not only increases to NASA's business base of qualified and eligible contractors but also additional opportunities for designated entities to receive a fair proportion of NASA awards to the maximum extent practicable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> NASA certifies that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule does not impose any information collection subject to 44 U.S.C. chapter 35. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 1815, 1819, 1852, and 1870 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

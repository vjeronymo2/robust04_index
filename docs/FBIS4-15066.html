			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 5 TASS -- The Federation Council voted  down today the federal law "on procedure to publish and  introduce federal constitutional laws, federal laws and bills of  the Russian Federal Assembly's chambers" adopted by the State  Duma due to the "inadmissibility of its certain articles and  items".    This is the second law submitted by the parliament's lower  chamber to the upper one in accordance with the Constitution.  The first law, on budget financing of spending in the second  quarter of 1994, was approved today in repeated voting.    "There is nothing dramatic about this," believes Federation  Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko. In his opinion, "this  proves that the Federation Council takes its work seriously".    In accordance with the Constitution, a conciliatory  commission to include members of both parliament chambers will  be set up to settle the differences.</p>

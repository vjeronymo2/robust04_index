			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Observer: PIA pressure When will the Prudential, Britain's biggest life insurer, end its splendid isolation and apply to join the Personal Investment Authority along with the rest of the UK life insurance industry? The question is prompted by the news that Sir Martin Jacomb, a member of the City's great and good, is expected to take over as chairman of the Pru next year. Sir Martin is a director of the Bank of England and a former deputy chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, and can generally be relied upon to toe the establishment line. Sir Martin was a member of the board when the Pru insisted on exercising its right to be directly regulated by the Securities and Investments Board and the Pru does not sound as though it is bracing itself for a shift. Even so if the Pru is a member of the PIA a year from now it will be a sure sign that its robust chief executive Mick Newmarch is no longer being allowed to have it all his own way.</p>

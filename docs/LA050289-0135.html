			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> COUNCILMAN FERRARO'S SON ARRESTED IN FALSE EMERGENCY 911 PHONE CALLS  </P> <P> Gianni Lucke Ferraro, the 33-year-old son of Los Angeles City Council President  John Ferraro, was arrested at his Studio City home after police said he had  falsely reported emergencies on the 911 line, authorities said today.  </P> <P> The younger Ferraro was released on his own recognizance this morning after  being arrested on the misdemeanor count at about 11 p.m. Monday, Officer Bill  Frio said. Police declined to specifically say what the calls were about or how  many were placed.  </P> <P> "Officers had been sent to investigate some emergency calls that Mr. Ferraro  made regarding the conditions at his residence," Frio said. "They were personal  matters. They were not emergencies. They believed that if he was left  unattended that the emergency calls would continue so he was arrested for . . .  false reporting of an emergency."  </P> <P> Last year, Ferraro was sentenced to one year in County Jail and five years'  probation in the April, 1987, vehicular manslaughter death of a pedestrian in  Hollywood. Police said Ferraro struck a 69-year-old man while driving drunk.  </P> <P> Ferraro, a one-time radio reporter and producer, was also ordered to enroll in  an alcohol rehabilitation program. According to court records, Ferraro had two  previous drunk driving convictions, both in 1976.  </P></p>

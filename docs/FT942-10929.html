			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Motoring: The latest Range Rover Vogue Off-roading is the last thing typical buyers of the latest Range Rover Vogue (pictured left) with a 2.5-litre, direct injection diesel engine and automatic transmission (from Pounds 29,995) will have in mind, even though it is perfectly at home in thick mud. The lofty driving position, ease of control, tons of headroom, airbags and impression of strength are appealing. Acceleration is leisurely and the engine sounds growly while speed is picking up. Noise vanishes in fourth gear. The diesel moderates the Range Rover's traditional thirst so well that over 30mpg (9.4 l/100km) is achievable compared with the equivalent 4.2-litre petrol V8's under 20mpg (14 l/100km).</p>

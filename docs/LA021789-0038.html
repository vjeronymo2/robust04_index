			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Surgeons removed tissue from a kidney of deposed Philippine President Ferdinand  E. Marcos and found that it was benign, sources close to the former president  said. Marcos, 71, who is recovering from pneumonia and bronchial asthma at St.  Francis Medical Center in Honolulu, underwent the operation Tuesday after a  scan of his kidney indicated he might have a tumor, the sources said. U.S.  intelligence reports released in Washington in 1986 said Marcos had undergone a  number of kidney transplants but that his body had rejected the organs.  </P></p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / International Company News: Bank sale favours retail investors THE AUSTRALIAN federal government is to favour small investors when it sells off a further 19.9 per cent stake in Commonwealth Bank of Australia next month, writes Nikki Tait from Sydney. Mr Ralph Willis, minister for finance, said the government plans to sell about 178m shares to investors, reducing the authorities' holding in the bank from 70 per cent to a minimum of 50.1 per cent. The sale is expected in October, soon after the bank's annual report is published. Up to 65 per cent of the issue will be available to retail investors. The price will be determined by a tender or 'book-building' process. The issue is widely expected to raise upwards of ADollars 1.5bn (USDollars 982m).</p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Sketchley ends year Pounds 6m in the black SKETCHLEY, the dry cleaning and textile services company which came close to collapse in 1990 before new management moved in, yesterday announced a return to profits and resumed dividend payments. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 6.02m in the year to March 27 compared with a Pounds 5.26m loss. This was mainly due to benefits from cost cutting and a reduced interest charge. Mr Tony Bloom, deputy chairman, said Sketchley, which at one stage was losing Pounds 800,000 a month, was out of trouble. 'We've made the base secure. It's now time to develop via acquisitions,' he said. These could be add-ons to existing businesses or new ventures, he added. Sketchley's recovery had been highlighted at the interim stage when profits of Pounds 3.19m compared to losses of Pounds 5.54m. Turnover for the full year fell to Pounds 107.1m (Pounds 157.9m) although the prior year figure included the vending machine division, since sold. Continuing businesses were affected by recession. The textiles division's operating profits fell to Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 6.3m) while dry cleaning fell to Pounds 2.18m (Pounds 2.38m). Positive cash flow reduced net borrowings from Pounds 31.6m to Pounds 11.9m, or 31.3 per cent of shareholders' funds (89.3 per cent). The interest charge fell to Pounds 2.62m (Pounds 6.15m). Earnings were 7.8p against losses of 6.9p last time. The company is recommending a final dividend of 3p, which is 2.6 times covered. The group reported little progress on various outstanding legal disputes, which include an expected writ from Eurocopy over its 1989 purchase from Sketchley of Equipu. Sketchley said any proceedings would be 'vigorously contested'. COMMENT Sketchley's new management has done everything right so far by concentrating on its two core divisions, stripping out costs and reducing borrowings. The next task will be to improve the remaining businesses. These figures provide mixed portents. Operating profits are up but margins for dry cleaning and textile services both fell, from 4.5 to 4.2 per cent and from 12.1 to 11.3 per cent respectively. This may just be a reflection of the severity of the recession, but it is slightly disappointing since staff numbers have fallen from 5,000 to 4,650 and Sketchley outlets from 500 to 470 in the past two years, thereby reducing overheads. Forecast profits of Pounds 8m put the shares, which closed down 1p at 154p, on 14 times. Given the 41 per cent rise in the share price since May 9, investors may prefer to wait for a little consolidation, especially if a hot summer prompts people to bring out their cottons, which rely on the washing machine rather than the dry cleaner.</p>

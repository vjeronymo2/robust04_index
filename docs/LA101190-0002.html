			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> QUE PASA?;  </P> <P> PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> "I come from the barrio. I know what it's like," said Sister Guadalupe Zozaya  of the more than 600 people who line up once a week for free fruit and  vegetables at Mother of Sorrows Convent on West 87th Place in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "We ask them no questions, make them fill out no forms," she said. "We treat  them with respect." She has been distributing the food for two years "on  Thursdays, my day off, with my brother Arthur, my right-hand man." Sister  Guadalupe, who grew up in Boyle Heights, said the food program carries out the  mission statement of the School Sisters of Notre Dame, her order: "Make the  concerns of the poor your own."  </P></p>

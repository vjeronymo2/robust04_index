			<p>BFN     [Text] Josip Manolic, president of the Croatian Assembly's  Chamber of Counties, has refused to convene a session of the  Chamber in eight days' time, Chamber of Counties Secretary Anton  Rajcevac told journalists today.    At the proposal of some Croatian Democratic Union deputies  to  convene a session, Manolic, referring to the standing orders,  said he did not consider that the reasons to convene a session  of the Chamber of Counties in eight days' time were justified  and that he would convene it when he found it necessary for this  assembly chamber to perform its constitutional obligations.</p>

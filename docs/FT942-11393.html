			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (29): Iranian arrears a worry for banks Payments arrears on Iranian l/cs remain one of the most pressing issues facing exporters and their banks. Arrears are conservatively estimated at Dollars 7bn. It is now accepted that these problems require a structured debt deal, but Teheran rejects Paris Club rescheduling. Export credit agencies (ECAs) and creditor banks in four countries have recently recognised this by agreeing debt relief worth an estimated Dollars 5.6bn on a bilateral basis. Arrears on l/cs of up to 14 months are reported by European banks, although collection experience is mixed. Long-established suppliers with priority state clients, for example, still tend to be paid on time. Germany has led the way with a ground-breaking debt agreement on debts covered by official export credit insurer Hermes worth Dollars 2.3bn. This contradicted US opposition to trading partners providing additional support for Teheran. The deal gives two years' grace, with repayments over 48 months for completion on 31 December 1999. Three agreements, announced in March with Japan, Austria and Switzerland, follow a similar pattern.</p>

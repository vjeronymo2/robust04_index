			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Pakistan refuses to stop nuclear programme Pakistan said yesterday it would never give up its controversial nuclear programme until there was an agreement to make the entire region a nuclear weapons-free zone. Mr Sardar Assef Ahmed Ali, the country's foreign minister, made the statement during an abortive debate in parliament which ended in disarray when opposition MPs led by former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, stormed out of parliament in protest at a government attempt to obstruct open discussion on the nuclear issue. The government cited security reasons. Pakistan has admitted its ability to build a bomb, but claims its programme is strictly peaceful. 'The present peaceful programme will continue,' the foreign minister said to an almost empty house after the opposition had left. The government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has come under fierce attack from opposition critics in the PML (Pakistan Muslim League) who are demanding a full explanation of the country's nuclear policy. Their demands have gathered pace since last week's reports that the Clinton administration wants to introduce new legislation which would end the military and economic aid cut-off against Pakistan. That cut-off was introduced three years ago following allegations that Islamabad had acquired the capability to produce nuclear weapons. Pakistan denies the charge. But last week's reports from Washington have raised fresh concerns among Pakistani nationalists, who fear that the nuclear programme which has already been 'capped' or put at a standstill may be 'rolled back' or cut down in size, as part of a deal. Last week's move in Washington is the most significant step to resolve the dispute since the aid cut-off. However, it is not clear if a bill to lift the embargo against Pakistan would be passed in the US congress.</p>

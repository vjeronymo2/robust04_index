			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / US shifts focus of drugs crusade MR Lee Brown, director of the White House drug control policy office, will today outline a shift in US anti-narcotics strategy which envisages a reduction of operations to intercept drugs transported through Central America and the Caribbean. Mr Brown's testimony before the Senate judiciary committee follows a review by government agencies of US drugs strategy. One of the conclusions of the review is that interdiction operations in Central American and Caribbean - including deployment of AWACs and CP3 surveillance aircraft and naval patrol craft - have not been cost-effective. Interdiction will remain an important part of the strategy but its focus will shift towards source countries, where the emphasis will be on developing local capabilities in intercepting drugs flights and halting operations of cocaine laboratories. 'What we are trying to do as part of the new strategy is to place more emphasis on institution building and more emphasis on support for source countries in terms of economic growth and development,' said a senior State Department official. The strategy will propose increased help for cocaine-producing countries - chiefly Bolivia, Peru and Colombia - in their domestic anti-drug programmes, aid with the administration of justice, which is also seen as cementing democracy, and greater emphasis on alternative development in the countries' coca-growing regions. The US is expected to seek support from the Washington-based international financial institutions in developing the strategy. Mr Brown's testimony will, however, emphasise developments in drug policy on the domestic front. As well as outlining the strategy - whose full detail will not be known until the budget is presented to Congress next February - Mr Brown is attempting to extend his office's current five-year authorisation, which expires this year.</p>

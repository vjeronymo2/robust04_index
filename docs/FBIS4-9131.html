			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Katerina Perknerova: "Baudys's Palm Reading"] </F>   [Text] In mid-February, Defense Minister Antonin Baudys  (Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party) refused  to share a discussion table with former Minister Vacek in the  television studio. He justified this fact by saying that, when  Vacek was minister, only the Army's symbols were being  repainted, but the Army had not been transformed. According to  Baudys, only under his leadership has the transformation of the  Army begun. The key question is what our idea about  transformation is. It is certain, however, that the defense  minister intends to present a long-term transformation project  in the summer--one and a half years after his assuming office.  From this viewpoint, the thing is clear. We should present  some figures, however: The Czech Republic Army had 92,599 job  positions on 1 January. According to experts, the optimum  number should be 65,000 soldiers. Since 1990, 777 units have  been abolished; of these, 132 were abolished last year. A total  of 187 units have been newly established. The Air Force  discontinued its operations at seven airports. A total of 6,594  people left the Army in 1993; of these, 4,303 were officers and  20 generals. According to Baudys, this not the right time for  personnel changes....    Mr. Fejfar (Civic Democratic Party), a member of the Defense  and Security Committee, said in an interview for RUDE PRAVO in  February that, "in the three most recent years, almost nothing  has changed in the Army." At the recent meeting in Harrachov,  he even stressed that, if the positions of platoon, unit, and  troop commanders are not filled (only 35 to 40 percent of these  positions are filled), "the Army may face collapse." J.  Pospisil, Baudys's deputy and Fejfar's party colleague, is  rejecting this catastrophic vision, but he, too, believes that  the Army is losing between 150 and 200 competent officers, who  do not believe in the prospects of the military profession. The  Czech Republic Army has reached the figures planned for 1996.  We are not going to comment on Baudys's idea that colonels and  lieutenant-colonels should take over the positions of warrant  officers.    I see today's situation in the following way: Fearing more  screenings, personnel purges, and similar Baudys's actions,  professional soldiers who have been in service for a long time  are taking the first opportunity to leave the Army for civilian  life. Fejfar is convinced that this applies not solely to former  political instructors and military counterintelligence but also  to expert professionals--for instance, elite pilots. Young  people are not eager to join the Army because no one can tell  them in which direction the Army will develop.    Baudys's being in darkness as a minister has its effect on  the Army, too. Having no concept for transformation, he cannot  tell the Czech factories what orders the Army will place. It is  quite possible that he does not realize that the development of  a new tank takes not several months but years. He believes that  the purely professional Rapid Deployment Brigade is an important  transformation step. This brigade should be established on 1  July. Foreign military experts believe that such a short time is  unrealistic for training the brigade.    Baudys believes that it is alarming that cases of wounding  soldiers, of even death cases, are on the rise. He assured us,  however, that he gave the task to General Staff Commander  Nekvasil to adopt efficient measures.    The problem is that no simple order can solve the problem of  the decomposition of our Army. If the training is at minimum,  pilots do not fly the necessary number of hours, there is  disorder in Army units, and military material is being stolen  (the Defense Ministry registered 3,500 cases of illegal activity  by soldiers). Then no wonder accidents resulting in death are on  the rise, too.    If Baudys says, in view of this bad situation, that the  basic  transformation of the Army will be completed in 1995 and the  Czech Republic Army will be prepared to join NATO, this seems  like palm reading to me, which the minister demonstrated in a  television show directed by Simek, rather than a realistic  evaluation of the prospects of the Czech Republic Army.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Mexico City, 29 Mar (EFE) -- Today the Attorney  General's Office (PRG) accused former policeman Tranquilino  Sanchez Venegas of complicity in the murder of Luis Donaldo  Colosio. [passage omitted]    The suspicion that he participated is based on an analysis  of  the videotape broadcast on television and on graphic material in  the Police's possession, where it appears that Sanchez Venegas  opens a path for the murderer through the crowd while watching  -- without acting to prevent -- as confessed murderer Mario  Aburto Martinez shoots Colosio in the right temple.    Various PRG officials, who asked to remain anonymous,  indicated that the arrest of the former policeman was made after  a lady friend of Aburto Martinez declared that on 11 March the  two individuals met in a Tijuana park.    According to official reports, the former policeman was  employed by the Tijuana PRI for ``crowd control'' at the event  were Colosio was murdered. [passage omitted]    The PRG has indicated that for now no one else has been  arrested as an accomplice in the murder, although several  individuals are being investigated.</p>

			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: A German strategy for Britain 'THE more that he talked of his honour, the faster we counted the spoons.' Which applies, rather obviously, to a British chancellor who talks of rigour the day after he cuts interest rates. This could only too obviously be where Mr Edward Heath came in. That is the future the markets are beginning to discount, and no reader needs advice on how to hedge. Stay short of sterling. But suppose that it is different this time. Suppose that Mr Major, awakening from his fantasy of European leadership, and Mr Lamont, free from playing follow-my-leader, have learned from their experience. What reflections would guide a rational man after such a shock? 'We're on our own,' might sum it up; but not in the smug John Bull sense Mr Lamont so successfully employed to rally his back-benchers. On our own in the sense that Britain has to establish its street credibility before it can join the fast-track group in Europe; not as a result of joining before we are ready. And on their own in the sense that they cannot lean on the advisers who got them into this mess. They must make their own policy from the ground up. This is very difficult for men so comparatively young. They did not experience the significant past; they must read about it in books, and they do not have the time. (So if you find the potted version which follows convincing, clip it out and send it to them.) The strategic aim need not be changed: Mr Major wants to out-German the Germans. He must hold on, though, to the new understanding of cause and effect which emerged in the economic debate. You do not get strength by suppressing inflation; you get a strong currency from having a strong economy, and low inflation follows. The re-emergence of this truth could be worth all the turmoil and humiliation, if we can hold on to it. The two leaders of fast-track Europe ended the war devastated; both now have quite impressive economies (though the German record has been gravely blotted since re-unification), but they chose opposite routes to get there. The French approach lay through a strong industrial policy - rather the Labour line. This produced much technological excitement, but a long string of disappointments and devaluations. In 1983, they moved over to the German track, and have been painfully converging ever since. The German approach, as much forced on them by isolation as thought through, relied on the market. Inflation had left their currency as devastated as their cities, and much undervalued overseas after it was reformed. The only way to get rich was to earn foreign currency, legitimately or otherwise; and so began more than three decades of export-led growth. The mark rose with the trade surplus. This is also the strategy followed, sometimes accidentally, by Japan, Korea, and currently by China and most recently by Poland (with dawning success), and possibly Russia. Britain now has an opportunity to follow these examples. The physical economy is not devastated, simply under-sized; the country still needs a structural transformation. The psychic economy happily has been laid flat: union militancy and resistance to change went some years ago, and now we are drying out from our long addiction to borrowing. For Britain, as for the US, net exports are the only likely source of long-term dynamism. The task is to revive the economy without reviving bad habits; in other words, to keep a highly competitive exchange rate while containing inflation, especially credit-led inflation. This approach might well appeal to the schoolmaster in Mr John Major - 'if it isn't hurting, it isn't working'. His anti-inflationary convictions are real; even, according to his officials, obsessive. Given time, the market could do the rest; and Mr Major has time. There are two problems. Mr Major is, for the time being, politically too weak; and sterling is still probably too strong to motivate a solid manufacturing revival. So even if you believe that we may have stumbled into the best-proved strategy for growth, the financial posture is the same: stay short of sterling. Not for ever, though.</p>

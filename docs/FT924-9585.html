			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: Buoyant Woolworth rises sharply on strong sales WOOLWORTH Corporation, the US retailer which operates both general merchandise outlets and specialty stores, yesterday reported sharply improved third-quarter results. The group hoisted after-tax profits from Dollars 41m a year ago to Dollars 65m. The profits increase came on sales up by 3.2 per cent, at Dollars 2.5bn overall. Within this advance, Woolworth saw faster progress on the specialty store side - sales rising by 4.4 per cent - while the general merchandise revenues only increased by 2.2 per cent. However, Mr Harold Sells, chairman, said the group was 'encouraged that the rate of increase in sales and profits in the third quarter was greater than that of the first half'. He added that the progress being made with Woolworth's store redeployment programme should mean 'further improvements in sales and profits throughout the all-important fourth quarter'. The third-quarter results mean the stores group has now reported after-tax profits of Dollars 115m for the first nine months of the year, on sales of Dollars 6.83bn. This compares with a net loss of Dollars 38m in the same period of 1991, but the 1991 came after a one-off, non-cash charge of Dollars 113m related to a change in accounting standards. Yesterday, Woolworth shares responsed with a Dollars  3/8 rise to Dollars 33 3/8 at close of trading. Woolworth said its revenues in the US were 'essentially flat'. However, there was a reduction of approximately 8 per cent, year-on-year, in the number of stores operated, and on a comparable-store basis, sales rose by 2.4 per cent. Overseas revenues rose by 7.5 per cent in US dollar terms, although if the currency translation was made at year-earlier foreign exchange rates, the rise would have been 4.6 per cent. FW Woolworth, a unit of Woolworth , said up to 40 locations would be added to its new The Bargain] chain. The company said the locations to be acquired were mainly in Ontario and eastern Canada and were occupied by the Bargain Harold's chain. It said some 20 The Bargain] locations would be opened by the end of the month, and the balance early in the new year.</p>

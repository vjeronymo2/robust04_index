			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Manila starts talks on growth plan with IMF THE PHILIPPINES starts negotiations with the International Monetary Fund tomorrow on a new programme aimed at pushing the economy towards a high-growth plane. Philippine negotiators, led by Mr Ramon del Rosario, finance secretary, and Mr Jose Cuisia, governor of the Central Bank of the Philippines, will be seeking credits of more than Dollars 800m (Pounds 526.3m) under the IMF's extended fund facility to support the country's 'growth-oriented' economic programme designed to cover the next three years. The programme is part of the government's plan for a growth of 4.5 per cent in the economy this year, rising to double digits by 1998. Because of a debilitating electric-power shortage, the economy grew by just 1.5 per cent in 1991 despite heightened optimism brought about by the improved political environment. The current economic stabilisation programme supported by the IMF involves stringent ceilings on fiscal and monetary expansion. It is due to end in March. The negotiations are expected to be difficult. Early assessments of the Manila programme indicate strong pressure from the IMF to scale down the growth targets. IMF analysts had noted that previous high-growth periods in the Philippines were followed by balance-of-payments crises. Owing to the heavy spendings on infrastructure allocated during the early part of the growth programme, the strategy could fuel inflation later and derail the ambitious scheme, according to some analysts. However, the Philippine negotiators are expected to press for the programme, because of the need for 'a more dynamic investment and overall output performance'. The officials feel that after meeting the strict criteria attached to the current programme, the Philippines should be 'in a stronger bargaining position' for the week-long negotiations.</p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / International Company News: Japan workers co-operative collapses with Y101bn debts A financial institution owned by employees of Japan's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications filed for liquidation yesterday with debts of Y101bn (Dollars 988m). It is Japan's third-largest bankruptcy this year. Koshin Shoji, a wholly-owned subsidiary of a Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications' workers' co-operative based in Tokyo, filed for liquidation with the Tokyo district court after a share-holders' meeting found the company had no choice but to fold. The failure is the largest among non-bank financial institutions since the collapse of Osaka-based E. G. Capital and Consultants last year with debts of Y230bn, according to Tokyo Shoko Research, a private research company. It is also the third-largest bankruptcy this year after Sanwa Tatemono, with debts of Y124.3bn, and Adoc with debts of Y110bn. The collapse of Koshin is likely to raise criticism of the ministry's relatively relaxed stance regarding the company's lending practices. Koshin Shoji is a non-bank financial institution established by an MPT employees' co-operative to invest the monthly contributions - 3 per cent of salaries - made by its 250,000 members. Members receive a lump sum plus investment returns upon retirement. The company has lent to discount note brokers, which in turn on-lent funds to consumer finance companies, according to Tokyo Shoko Research. With tighter regulations on consumer finance companies and the collapse of Japan's asset inflation bubble, a growing number of loans made by Koshin went bad, the research company said. The collapse of Koshin follows several years of financial difficulty, beginning with a Y30.8bn write-off of loans made to five consumer finance companies in 1986. Last year, Koshin made a loss of Y5.5bn on revenues of Y8.3bn. The posts and telecommunications ministry said the loss would be covered by selling some of the co-operative's assets, which amounted to Y457.6bn at the end of March last year. This would happen over a period of about 10 years, so as not to affect payments to co-operative members. The MPT employees' co-operative also owns other businesses, such as a hotel, a construction subcontracting company and a golf course. All of those businesses were sound, the ministry said.</p>

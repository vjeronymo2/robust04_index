			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Upward trend of sales in north is reversed A SHARP downturn in sales and confidence in northern England was reported yesterday. Liverpool chamber of commerce, covering Merseyside, west Cheshire and north Wales, reported a reversal between July and September of all upward trends in home and export deliveries and orders. Steep job losses are forecast for this quarter, with 29 per cent planning to shed labour. That follows four successive quarters in which the trend of job losses had stabilised. This quarter's plunge is forecast at a similar scale to two years ago, when 35 per cent of companies in the Liverpool survey cut jobs in the fourth quarter. The pattern is similar to larger surveys by the Manchester-centred north-west chambers and the Leeds-collated chambers for Yorkshire and Humberside. The only indicator not in negative balance - more companies reporting a decrease than an increase - is for export orders, but even here the figure is zero after being positive last year. The Hotpoint washing machine factory at Llandudno Junction, north Wales, is to close with the loss of 100 jobs.</p>

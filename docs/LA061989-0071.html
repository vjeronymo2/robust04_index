			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINA PROTEST MARCH DRAWS 1,500 IN L.A.  </P> <P> In one of the largest demonstrations of its kind in Los Angeles, more than a  thousand people marched in summer-like heat to the Chinese Consulate on Sunday  to protest the continuing suppression of pro-democracy students in China.  </P> <P> Besides its size, what made this march different from past demonstrations was  evidence that the protest is becoming a broad-based community movement, leaders  said.  </P> <P> The pre-march rally at MacArthur Park resembled a political convention, with  brightly colored signs announcing the presence of such diverse groups as the  San Fernando Valley Chinese Cultural Assn., the Thousand Oaks Council of the  Chinese Cultural Assn. and the Libertarian Party. Altogether, there were more  than 150 organizations represented.  </P> <P> "This is the largest gathering so far in Southern California," said Changqing  Cao, a Chinese journalist studying in the United States. "We should set aside  June 18 as a special day."  </P> <P> Los Angeles police estimated the size of the crowd at 1,500, although Chinese  community leaders released estimates more than twice as large.  </P> <P> The featured speaker was Tong Boning, a student who returned to China when the  pro-democracy demonstrations began, then was detained briefly by the government  when he tried to leave after the June 3-4 massacre in Tian An Men Square.  </P> <P> To those who wondered why the government had released him, he explained that  "they wanted me to send a strong message to the people in the United States."  That message, he said, is that Chinese students here should be careful; anyone  who believes "just because you are in the U.S. that you are safe (should know  that) we are watching you."  </P> <P> To a cacophony of honking horns on Wilshire Boulevard, the crowd marched to the  consulate to deliver a protest letter.  </P> <P> "As overseas Chinese and citizens of the world, we strongly denounce such  uncivilized actions by your government," it read.  </P></p>

			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Hope for a gaming industry down on its luck: Liberalised rules will help to offset the effects of the Budget and the National Lottery Yesterday's government move to liberalise gaming machine regulations was welcomed by an industry still reeling from the Budget proposals to tax video and quiz machines and increase duty on fruit machines by 19 per cent. The industry, which is also facing new competition from the National Lottery, had been lobbying in particular for an end to the payment of prizes in tokens, which it says are unpopular with customers and involve high administration costs. The past few years have been tough for the industry. The number of gaming machines in use has fallen from 60,000 four years ago to about 40,000, according to the British Amusement Catering Trades Association (Bacta). Mr Kenneth Clarke's Budget measures have been criticised as potentially counterproductive. Mr Russell Smith, chief executive of Kunick, one of the UK's three biggest operators of amusement and gaming machines, said: 'There will inevitably be some shrinkage of the market. The chancellor will not raise as much money as he thinks.' Mr Tim Moon, whose Arrow Leisure runs two arcades in Croydon, south of London, said the Budget had angered operators. 'Things are very tight at the moment as it is, without having this as well.' As a result of the Budget, the duty on small-prize gaming machines has gone up from Pounds 450 a year to Pounds 535. Jackpot machines, which have a money prize of up to Pounds 200, had their licence fee increased to Pounds 1,375 a year. A monthly instalment payment scheme was also introduced. Video and quiz amusement machines face an annual duty of Pounds 250 from next November. Customs and Excise estimates that 65,000 premises will be covered by the new tax. Mr Clarke hopes these measures will raise an extra Pounds 55m a year - Pounds 30m from the new tax. He argues that the increase brings the duty back into line with its 1987 level. Mr Roger Withers, president of Bacta, describes the new tax as 'ill thought-out and ill-conceived' and argues that it could lead to the loss of up to 15,000 jobs. Mr Withers is managing director of BLMS, the Bass subsidiary which supplies amusement machines. Bass has estimated that the Budget proposals will cut its profits by Pounds 500,000 this year. The biggest impact will be at the bottom end of the market. Many cafes, fish and chip shops and country pubs may decide to hand back their machines, according to Mr Smith. Others say some small seaside arcades, which have maybe 50 video machines, could face closure if they are hit by a tax bill running into thousands of pounds. Mr Moon's two arcades have about 40 gaming machines and 10 video machines. 'We already pay VAT,' he said. 'New taxes hit the coin-slot industry particularly hard because they come straight out of revenue. Unlike Sainsbury, say, we cannot pass on the cost straight to customers because the prices are fixed.' Mr Moon estimated that he would have to reduce the number of machines he operated by between 30 per cent and 40 per cent as a result of the tax increase. His maintenance department would also have to be scaled down. Many operators claim to be confused by the rule changes. Customs and Excise says the new tax exempts juke boxes, snooker and pool tables, bar billiards, football games and rides for children. But video games, pinball machines and 'skills-with-prizes' machines, such as trivia games, will be included.</p>

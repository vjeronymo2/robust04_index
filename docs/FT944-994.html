			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / International Company News: Czech media group raises Kcs280m Bonton, an acquisitive Czech media and entertainment group, has raised Kcs280m (Dollars 9.5m) in the first large private equity placing by a Czech company with foreign institutional investors The transaction is seen as a pacesetter for other Czech companies seeking to expand in the fast-growing but undercapitalised sectors of post-communist central Europe's most stable economy. CS First Boston's Central European Growth Fund and funds managed by, among others, Baring Investment Management and the US-based Emerging Markets Corporation, took stakes in Bonton in the placing, which represented just under 30 per cent of the company's share capital. Bonton plans to use the proceeds from the placing, arranged by CS First Boston, to make new acquisitions, develop its retail network, and reduce debt. It said it would seek a public listing for its shares within two years. The investors acquired mainly new shares in Bonton, which has interests from music and film production to commercial radio stations and record stores. Bonton was founded in 1990 by Mr Martin Kratochvil, a high-profile Czech businessman and jazz musician who is the group's chairman. The company expects 1994 revenues of more than Kcs700m and profits of Kcs7m, and says it aims to increase profits 10-fold by 1996. Mr Kratochvil and Mr Michael Kocab, co-founder, are Bonton's biggest shareholders, each with a 17 per cent stake.</p>

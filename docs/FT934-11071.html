			<p>931102 FT  02 NOV 93 / Survey of Corporate Treasury Management (6): In pursuit of yield as recession ends - Simon London explains how liquidity is monitored to ensure cash flow is in good health IT IS not only pensioners that suffer a drop in income when interest rates are low. Companies with large cash balances are finding interest income squeezed, and face pressure to either make cash work harder or return the surplus to shareholders. Organisation of cash management within a company can help to increase returns without any change of investment strategy. Squeezing the most out by reducing working capital, cutting debtor days and stocks is an obvious place to start. As the economy pulls out of recession, though, the pressure will be in the opposite direction. Bringing the surplus cash resources of a group together in one centrally-managed fund is a self-help strategy favoured by many companies. 'Centralised cash management produces the best returns by concentrating expertise, increasing the size in which we can deal and avoiding the position where idle cash balances are spread around the group,' said Philip Wood, director of treasury at Reuters, which had Pounds 700m cash at its last financial year end, although it has since spent Pounds 350m buying-back its own shares. Reuters' approach also demands close involvement of tax planning in investment decisions. 'We are always trying to maximise the after-tax returns to shareholders. Investors measure us in terms of earnings per share, and that is how we judge ourselves,' commented Mr Wood. But good housekeeping and careful planning can only work so far. The search for higher yield almost inevitably involves a greater degree of risk. As many local authorities found out to their cost, deposits placed with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International offered higher returns than those placed with clearing banks for a reason. In the light of the BCCI collapse, many companies have tightened controls and do not place deposits with banks below a certain credit quality. For Reuters, the threshold is normally set at a credit rating of single-A from one of the big rating agencies. This applies to swaps contracts and exposures other than deposits. Different types of exposure to each institution are added to give an aggregate exposure. But credit ratings are not the only guide. Many company treasurers have been wary of buying mortgage-backed securities following the financial problems faced by National Home Loans, a prominent issuer. In fact, the credit quality of asset-backed bonds originated by NHL and others remained reassuringly stable through such problems. But prices fell as investors edged away from the market. 'It is partly a question of self-protection. It is easier to go to the main board to justify buying plain-vanilla government bonds. None of them are likely to understand mortgage-backed bonds, and most will react with suspicion,' commented the treasurer of one large company. Another way of chasing additional yield when short-term interest rates are low is to move into longer-maturity instruments. The 100-year bonds issued in the US by companies such as Coca-Cola are the most extreme examples, offering a yield comfortably above the benchmark 30-year US treasury bond. The danger is that very long-dated instruments tend to be more sensitive to changes in interest rates and expectations of inflation than shorter maturity stocks. Credit risks may be no greater than short-dated paper, but the market risks can be difficult to manage. The same might be said of investment in foreign currency instruments. Some UK companies prefer to keep cash in sterling - the currency in which shareholders funds are denominated and earnings per share is measured. Others invest in currencies which are a broad match for their spread of underlying business, or which help off-set exposures to help smooth earnings per share. Derivative financial instruments are used to help offset interest-rate or foreign-currency risks. The philosophical view of companies which prefer sterling-only investment, though, is that the cost of hedging eats into additional yield gained from the underlying investment. Reuters invests mainly in sterling instruments. It aims for a compromise on interest-rate exposures by identifying a core cash position which is likely to be maintained for at least three years and locking into interest rates of around this maturity. Not all of this core cash position is held in instruments of three years maturity, but interest-rate swaps are used to lock into rates of around three years. Cash outside the core is likely to fluctuate - with acquisitions, or other corporate needs - and is treated separately. Companies point out that neither short-term nor long-term interest rates are especially low in real terms, when measured against inflation. A real return on bank deposits of around 4 per cent represents a reasonable real yield by historic standards. Even so, low nominal interest rates make it difficult for companies to justify holding cash which is unlikely to be channelled into productive investment. Most industrial companies demand a nominal return of at least 15 per cent from investment in new plant and machinery. Ronnie Hampel, ICI's chief executive, has said that an average return of 20 per cent through the economic cycle will be demanded of new investment in the chemicals business. Set against such stiff targets, holding excess cash can act as a drag on a company's rate of return on capital. Reuters' decision to implement a share buy-back programme is a symptom of such pressure. Glaxo's decision to pay a higher than expected dividend this year also reflected the growth of its cash pile - from Pounds 1.3bn to Pounds 1.8bn, despite spending Pounds 850m on research and development - and pressure from investment institutions to stem the rising tide. But Glaxo has no immediate plans to return the bulk of its cash to shareholders. Cash-rich companies, such as GEC, equally show little enthusiasm for making a one-off payment. Like other companies which face an uncertain trading environment, Glaxo argues that cash gives it the flexibility to react to a changing market. On that view, cash always has value above and beyond the yield it is currently earning.</p>

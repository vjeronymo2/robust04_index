			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PANEL REBUKES NEWPORT JUDGE FOR FAVORITISM  </P> <P> Calvin P. Schmidt, Orange County's longest-sitting judge, was publicly scolded  by state judicial authorities Thursday for giving preferential treatment to a  wealthy friend's stepdaughter and making improper campaign contributions. But  he was cleared of doing legal favors for a prostitute.  </P> <P> The action by the Commission on Judicial Performance appeared to mark the close  of the sex and influence scandal that has embroiled several judges for more  than two years at Harbor Municipal Court in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> In sharply worded criticism, the San Francisco-based judicial watchdog agency  announced that Municipal Judge Schmidt, 59, had "undermined public  </P> <P> confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary."  </P> <P> Only two of the judges -- Schmidt and Municipal Court Judge Brian R. Carter --  were targeted in formal disciplinary proceedings. Similar allegations against  Carter, 63, were dropped by the commission after he retired from the bench in  February.  </P> <P> Schmidt hailed his vindication on some of the allegations and said that  contrary to a news report, he has no plans to retire. His current six-year term  ends in 1992.  </P> <P> "This exoneration by my judicial peers ends what has been for me the most  painful time both professionally and personally in my 23-year career as a judge  and community servant," he said in a prepared statement.  </P> <P> Schmidt's lawyer, H. Warren Siegel, said the scandal was "a real trauma" for  Schmidt because he is "a man dedicated to his community." He is active in the  charitable organizations of Hoag Hospital and the Newport Beach Chamber of  Commerce. He is also national director of the Girl Scouts of America.  </P> <P> In its action against Schmidt, the commission chose what is considered to be  one of the mildest forms of discipline it has available. It declined several  tougher punishments, including recommendations that the state Supreme Court  censure the judge, remove him from office or disbar him.  </P> <P> But Deputy Atty. Gen. Roy Hewitt, who presented the case to the commission,  said the action still carries a strong message.  </P> <P> "The message is clear that some of his conduct is not to be condoned or  practiced by other judges," Hewitt said.  </P> <P> When asked if the public can be assured it may trust Schmidt's integrity, Peter  Gubbins, the commission's investigating attorney on the case, would only say,  "I think the public can have confidence that the system as a whole works  properly."  </P> <P> Glenn A. Mahler, presiding judge of Harbor Municipal Court, praised Schmidt.  </P> <P> During his years of judicial service at the Harbor Municipal Court, Schmidt has  gained "an outstanding reputation with the legal community as a fair and honest  jurist," Mahler said. "We are pleased that Judge Schmidt will continue as a  judge of the Harbor Municipal Court and as the senior judge in Orange County."  </P> <P> Most of the commission's two-page ruling dealt with the way Schmidt handled the  1988 case of Terri Ann McMullen, stepdaughter of longtime friend Robert  Guggenheim of Newport Beach.  </P> <P> McMullen, 28, was arrested twice on cocaine charges. Twice Schmidt called  detention officials and ordered her freed on her own recognizance, despite  another judge's order that she be held on bond and despite her failure to  appear in court between her first and second arrests.  </P> <P> "The obvious and sole reason for Judge Schmidt's actions was his friendship  with McMullen's stepfather," the commission wrote. "Judge Schmidt's  (recognizance) releases of McMullen were arbitrary and capricious exercises of  (his) judicial discretion and undermined public confidence in the integrity and  impartiality of the judiciary."  </P> <P> The commission found that Schmidt acted "in patent violation" of the judicial  canon of ethics when he contributed money from his own campaign to candidates  for political office, including former Democratic state Sen. Paul Carpenter of  Cypress. The judicial canon of ethics limits the amount a judge may contribute  to political candidates.  </P> <P> The panel, however, found no evidence to support the allegation that Schmidt  offered to reinstate the driver's license of convicted prostitute Della  Christine Johnson in 1984 in exchange for a promise of sex. She told police  that Carter called her later and collected on that promise by having sex with  her, an allegation Carter denies. But the commission said it heard no evidence  on the alleged exchange of sexual favors and determined that the "case  disposition was not unusual."  </P> <P> The commission also rejected an accusation that Schmidt intervened on behalf of  a friend whose marriage ceremony he had performed, using his influence to help  the friend obtain a plea bargain in a criminal case.  </P> <P> Public criticism was added to the commission's array of disciplinary  possibilities this year under a constitutional amendment. Reprovals, which rank  in severity between private admonishments and public censures, have been given  to two judges so far, including Schmidt.  </P> <P> The judge said he still believes that based on the information he had on  McMullen, he acted in good faith when he released her. But he added that he  "accepts the commission's finding that my decision might have given the public  the impression of a lack of impartiality on my part."  </P> <P> The judge he said accepts the commission's findings on his political  contributors but said he still believes he acted legally and "did not knowingly  violate" judicial ethics.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Dan Weikel contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / US Mid-Term Elections - November 8: California split over anti-immigrant plan Opposition to California's Proposition 187, denying social services to illegal immigrants, appears to be gathering momentum. Two new television polls in the past 24 hours still left the initiative ahead, by 49-42 and 48-38 per cent respectively, but for the first time, it commanded less than majority support and its edge was a far cry from the two-to-one margin recorded a month ago. Hispanic-American voters, in particular, have swung heavily against. A survey released this week by the Southwest Voter Research Institute found 57 per cent opposed to the proposition, which is on the state ballot in next Tuesday's mid-term poll, and only 15 per cent in favour, with the balance undecided. In mid-October, polls showed nearly half the legal Hispanic residents in support. Opposition has also been fanned by the Mexican government. The foreign ministry in September complained of the 'xenophobia and racism' implicit in the proposal. Now Mexico is offering assistance and advice on fighting it to Hispanic groups in California, a break with its practice of not interfering in US politics. Three Sundays ago, about 70,000 paraded in Los Angeles in protest, many waving the Mexican flag - to the fury of the initiative's supporters. On Wednesday about 10,000 schoolchildren, the majority Hispanic, walked out of city classrooms to demonstrate. Their teachers have also become vocal, with 1,000 signing a pledge to ignore the provision in the proposition obliging them to report to the federal government any case in which the parents of schoolchildren were suspected of being illegal immigrants. Several hospitals and medical associations have also threatened to refuse to comply with the reporting provision, and have warned of the broader public health consequences of denying care to illegal immigrants. Local chambers of commerce, representing businesses with long histories of employing illegal immigrants, remain generally opposed. Mr Pete Wilson and Congressman Michael Huffington, Republican candidates for governor and senator respectively, have remained steadfast in support of Proposition 187, while their Democrat opponents, Ms Kathleen Brown and Senator Dianne Feinstein, have campaigned against. Mr Wilson's stand helped him move ahead of Ms Brown while the initiative appeared to command broad support and has not hurt him since opposition to it has grown. Mr Huffington, however, has been greatly embarrassed by the disclosure that he had employed a British nanny without proper papers. One poll out yesterday had Ms Feinstein 10 points to the good, but another had Mr Huffington two points up. Many other prominent state politicians have refused to take a position either way. They include Mr Richard Riordan and Ms Susan Golding - very much in the front line on immigration as mayors of Los Angeles and San Diego - on the grounds that they do not want to encourage divisiveness in their cities. Mr Dan Lungren, the state attorney-general locked in a tough re-election battle, has also remained on the fence. On Monday he said he was 'legally obliged' to defend Proposition 187 in the courts - lawsuits are inevitable if it passes - but said he lacked the authority to prosecute teachers and doctors for not reporting suspected illegal immigrants. The movement against Proposition 187 may yet prompt a white suburban backlash in its favour. As of now, it would probably pass, but Tuesday is a long way off.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: Swedish forestry groups plan to merge ASSI and Doman, two state-owned Swedish forestry groups, yesterday announced plans to form Sweden's fourth largest pulp and paper company through a merger. The government said it favoured the move in principle, noting that the combined group would be stronger and easier to privatise, but has taken no final decision. It would be one of three state-owned groups, alongside the power group Vattenfall and the pharmaceutical company Procordia, which could be sold off next year. Assi and Doman have combined sales of nearly SKr13bn (Dollars 1.6bn) and employ 11,000 staff, 4,000 of them outside Sweden. The aim is to effect a fusion from the start of next year, 52 years after the companies were split apart and after 30 years of on-off merger talks. The two companies have no overlapping activities, and together would form a financially strong group with an equity-assets ratio of some 80 per cent. Doman is Sweden's biggest forestry owner, with 3.4m hectares of land, and its biggest sawmill owner, with a capacity of 800,000 cu metres a year. Assi, which acquires 35 per cent of its wood from Doman, is predominantly a packaging group, producing 1m tons of packaging paper and board a year, and 640,000 tons of corrugated board and boxes. It has operations in eight European countries, excluding Sweden. Assi and Doman said they might eventually be interested in bidding for NCB, another forestry group which is majority-owned by the state, but they stressed there were no ongoing talks. Forvaltnings AB Ratos, the investment group, has sold its shareholding in AB Industrivarden for a total of SKr840m. The stake, about 10 per cent of Industrivarden's capital, was bought by a number of Swedish and foreign investors.</p>

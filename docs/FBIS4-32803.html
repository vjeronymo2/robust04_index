			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on 30 May Communique issued by the Zapatist National </F> Liberation Army General Command on the end of consultations to  discuss the proposal to reach a peace agreement in Chiapas, by  reporter Juan Carlos Santoyo and unidentified announcer; from  the "ACIR Radio News" Newscast -- recorded]    [Text] [Santoyo] Pepe, good afternoon to you and the  audience. I have the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army]  communique in my hands. I will read its six basic points:    Brothers of the EZLN's Clandestine Indian Revolutionary  Committee-General Command, we are contacting you to state the  following:    1. The EZLN has already ended the consultations in all the  towns that supported it by holding assemblies in the many towns,  ejidos, rural slums, and hamlets that support and sympathize  with the EZLN's just cause. Zapatist men, women, children, and  elders analyzed and discussed the 32 proposals made by the  federal government and the 34 demands made by the San Cristobal  Zapatist group.    2. The men, women, children, and elders who, in 1993, voted  to start the war and all those who have joined the EZLN taught  the country a lesson in liberty and freedom by exercising their  right to freely choose the EZLN.    3. The EZLN also received opinions and comments by all other  Mexican social sectors. We will take into account the wisdom  expressed by the suggestions made by our brothers, Indians,  peasants, workers, students, teachers, housewives,  nongovernmental organizations, Mexicans living abroad,  intellectuals, and honest artists.    4. As of 31 May 1994, the EZLN is in a state of permanent  assembly to start counting votes, to analyze the opinions  received, and to give a reply as the supreme leadership of the  EZLN's military and civilian forces.    5. All access to territories under EZLN control will be  closed to the national and international media while the  counting and analyses is in process. The results will be  released through a communique issued by the supreme leadership.    6. The date and place to hold a news conference to inform  Mexico and the world of EZLN decisions will be given in due time.    As usual, Subcommander Marcos signed this communique from  somewhere in the mountains of the Mexican southeastern region.    Thus, the EZLN takes a major step regarding a consultation  that was expected to reach a prompt conclusion. We have also  received reports indicating that Manuel Camacho Solis,  commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, might be  arriving in San Cristobal de las Casas in the coming hours.  Camacho Solis is expected to issue a communique on the Chiapas  situation, and especially, to give details of a program he  discussed with legislators two weeks ago during a meeting. This  program, which was called aggressive, seeks to provide answers  to all doubts and demands expressed by the EZLN in regard to the  San Cristobal agreements. Thus far, this is the situation here  in San Cristobal de las Casas and gradually, a second dialogue  seems to be closer to becoming a reality. Many, however, are  convinced that a second dialogue could not take place very soon,  but the two conflicting parties are expected to give a concrete  answer on the steps to follow regarding this peace and  reconciliation talk.    [Announcer] Is this EZLN communique addressed to a specific  person?    [Santoyo] No. It is addressed to the Mexican people, peoples  and governments worldwide, and the national and the  international media. It is not addressed to anyone in  particular.    [Announcer] Reports from San Cristobal de las Casas indicate  that complaints have been made that, precisely, the EZLN has  been telling the international media that, there are planes and  helicopters flying over EZLN-controlled territory, just 136 days  away from the date when this activity will be banned.    [Santoyo] That is true. There is a second communique in this  regard that has been addressed to SEMANARIO NACIONAL, PROCESO,  LA JORNADA, EL FINANCIERO, and EL TIEMPO. In this communique,  Subcommander Marcos, the signer, makes a traditional report of  their current situation in the jungle. Marcos does indicate  that following the 15 May event, helicopters have been spotted  in addition to planes. Cooks complain that there will not be  enough pots if they decide to land at the same time. Marcos  includes in this communique -- a very long one, some seven pages  -- a sort of poetic report of everything they are currently  experiencing in the Lacandon jungle. He basically says that the  consultations are over. The communique also includes a part  addressed directly to the Party of the Democratic Revolution  [PRD]. This part constitutes a long point and refers to the PRD  saying a few days ago that more people have died within the PRD  because of political strife than within the EZLN. Marcos notes  in this communique that, even if they are right on the fact that  more people could have died, what is truly significant is that  currently in this Chiapas location, efforts are being  implemented to make these peace and reconciliation negotiations  benefit all Indian and peasant peoples nationwide.    Marcos adds that as it is true that people have died, so it  is that there is sacrifice and bloodshed involved in every  struggle. They do not say, however, that currently, it is hard  for the country to assume this sacrifice. There is also another  section of the communique that says criticism is always welcome  from pontiff to pontificate. Finally, they will be able to  accuse us of being untimely; ignoring the correlation between  forces; practicing political miscalculation; lacking [word  indistinct] to watch the debate live; lacking subscriptions to  major newspapers and magazines to learn about post-debate  evaluations; being unkind and rude; suffering from mountain  sickness; not recognizing possible allies; being sectarian,  intransigent, and ill-tempered. We can be accused of  everything, but not of being consistent. All we have done is  place a trigger [gatillo] on hope, this communique concludes.  This communique answers all the criticisms raised within the PRD  regarding the famous visit made by PRD presidential candidate  Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano. On this occasion, he received  very blunt criticism from the EZLN, and specifically, from  Subcommander Marcos. [end recording]</p>

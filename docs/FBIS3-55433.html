			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mircea Dascaliuc from Chisinau] </F>   [Text] Moldovan Parliament Speaker Petru Lucinschi today  received Petre Roman and Eugen Dijmarescu [leaders of the  Democratic Party-National Salvation Front -- PD-FSN, of  Romania], who are in Chisinau after having accompanied a  humanitarian convoy that conveyed gifts to the children of  Moldova.    During the talks, the officials briefed one another on the  current situation in the two countries, laying special emphasis  on finding ways for achieving real cooperation in the future  between the two countries. They also tackled financial,  economic, law-making, social, and political issues.    Lucinschi presented the situation in the eastern and  southern  rayons of Moldova, detailing the difficulties facing the  leadership of Moldova in ensuring legality in those areas. In  that context, Lucinschi made some remarks referring to the  situation of the Ilie Ilascu group [imprisoned and sentenced to  death by the authorities of the self-proclaimed Dniester  Republic], assessing that within a short time, the entire group  will be transferred to Chisinau and handed over to the  authorities of Moldova.    Assessing Romanian-Moldova relations, the speaker of the  Moldovan Parliament asserted that, unfortunately, the results  obtained so far in the furthering of those ties do not  correspond to what was originally intended and expressed his  hope that in the future the cooperation between the two states  will develop from mere declarations to concrete actions,  including in the law-making field.    The meeting was also attended by Marian Enache, Romania's  ambassador to Chisinau.</p>

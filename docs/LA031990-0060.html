			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT HAPPENS NOW  </P> <P> With the major league owners and players having come to an agreement in New  York Sunday, ending the 32-day spring training camp lockout, here are some  questions and answers concerning the situation:  </P> <P> Question. When will the regular season start?  </P> <P> Answer. April 9, one week after it had been scheduled to open.  </P> <P> Q. How many games will be played?  </P> <P> A. At least 158, with an effort being made to complete the entire 162-game  schedule.  </P> <P> Q. When will training camps open?  </P> <P> A. Immediately, with players expected to report by Tuesday.  </P> <P> Q. What will be the effect on exhibition games?  </P> <P> A. Of 410 exhibition games, 362 have been canceled. Teams will be allowed to  begin exhibition play March 26.  </P> <P> Q. I have tickets to opening day, April 2 in Dodger Stadium. What happens to  them?  </P> <P> A. The Dodgers said Sunday night that they will talk with the Padres today to  try to get them to come to Los Angeles for an April 9 opener and a one-game  series. Both clubs were scheduled to be off on that day.  </P> <P> Q. What will the effect of a shortened spring training be on the Dodgers?  </P> <P> A. Perhaps a greater effect than that felt by most clubs because key players  Kirk Gibson and Kal Daniels are returning from off-season surgery and Juan  Samuel and Hubie Brooks are new to the club after off-season transactions.  </P> <P> Q. And the Angels?  </P> <P> A. It may have less effect on them than on many clubs because of the club's  veteran pitching staff. It is generally considered that pitchers take longer to  prepare for a season than position players.  </P> <P> Q. How many negotiating sessions were involved in hammering out the agreement?  </P> <P> A. 34.  </P> <P> Q. Why so many? Why did it take so long?  </P> <P> A. Several issues were agreed to in principle early, but throughout the  negotiations it was apparent that the salary arbitration option for players  with more than two years and less than three would be a sticking point. It was,  until the very end.  </P> <P> Q. How was it resolved?  </P> <P> A. The owners agreed to allow 17% of those players to apply for arbitration.  </P> <P> Q. How many is that?  </P> <P> A. Of the 83 in this year's class, 14 would have been allowed to submit for  arbitration. Next year's class has 91 at this time.  </P> <P> Q. Will the Freeway Series between the Dodgers and Angels be played?  </P> <P> A. The Dodgers said Sunday night that it would be played, probably a week late.  That would put games on April 6, 7 and 8.  </P></p>

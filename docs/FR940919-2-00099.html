			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Any child who is engaging in substantial gainful activity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not be found disabled regardless of the severity of his or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> her physical or mental impairments. The guidelines for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining whether a child is engaging in substantial gainful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity will be identical to the guidelines for adults. Although  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the issue of work activity will arise infrequently in childhood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claims, the step is warranted for two reasons: 1) the approach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for adults and children should be as similar as possible; and 2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a child approaches age 18, it is increasingly likely that work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity may be an issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Step 2_Medically Determinable Impairment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Because the statute requires that disability be the result  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combination of impairments, the absence of a medically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determinable impairment will justify a finding that a child is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not disabled. To establish the presence of a medically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determinable impairment or combination of impairments, evidence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must show an impairment that results from anatomical,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physiological, or psychological abnormalities which are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrable by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diagnostic techniques.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The same guidelines and rules that apply for adults will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply equally for children. SSA will continue to evaluate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existence of a medically determinable impairment based on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weighing of all evidence that is collected, recognizing that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neither symptoms nor opinions of treating physicians alone will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support a finding of disability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SSA will use the same exception for evidence collection in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> childhood claims that will be applied in adult claims. If a child  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not an exception to further development, SSA will then  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluate whether the impairment(s) is included in the index of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disabling impairments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Step 3_Index of Disabling Impairments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> If a child has a medically determinable physical or mental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impairment or combination of impairments documented by medically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable clinical and laboratory techniques and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impairment(s) will meet the duration requirement, SSA will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compare the child's impairment(s) against an index of disabling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impairments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As with adults, the index for childhood claims will function  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to quickly identify severely disabling impairments. The index  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will describe impairments so severely debilitating that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impairment is of comparable severity to an impairment that would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevent an adult from engaging in substantial gainful activity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without assessing the child's functional ability. As with adults,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual functional ability in childhood claims will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessed in a consistent manner at Step 4 in the process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The index for childhood claims will consist of descriptions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of specific impairments and the medical findings that are used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantiate the existence and severity of the particular disease  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entity. The medical findings in the index will be as nontechnical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as possible and will be simple enough so that laypersons will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> able to understand what is required to substantiate a disabling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impairment in the index. As with adults, SSA will draw no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conclusions about the effect of a child's impairments on his or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> her ability to function merely because a child's impairment(s) is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not included in the index. Additionally, SSA will no longer use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the concept of ``medical equivalence'' or functional equivalence in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relation to the childhood index.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Step 4_Comparable Severity to an Impairment(s) That Would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prevent an Adult From Engaging in Substantial Gainful Activity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Consistent with the approach for adult claims, SSA will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> develop, with the assistance of the medical community and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> educational experts, standardized instruments which can be used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to measure a child's functional ability. These standardized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures of functional ability will be linked to clinical and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratory findings to the extent that SSA needs to document the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existence of a medically determinable impairment or combination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of impairments. The functional assessment instruments will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed to measure, as objectively as possible, a child's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in an age-appropriate manner. Ultimately, the course of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documenting and developing for functional abilities in childhood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claims will, to the extent possible, mirror the adult approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, SSA will consider whether it is appropriate to defer the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of standardized functional assessment instruments for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use in childhood claims until it gains experience in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development, refinement and use of such instruments for adults.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SSA will use the results of the standardized functional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessments to determine whether a child has impairment(s) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparable severity to an impairment(s) that would prevent an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adult from engaging in substantial gainful activity, as in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Medical Evidence Development  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Timely and Accurate Decisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> SSA's ability to provide timely and accurate disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decisions depends to a significant degree on the quality of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medical evidence it can obtain and the speed with which it can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtain it. The medical evidence collection process accounts for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considerable portion of the total time involved in processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability claims.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The new process will eliminate multiple, repetitive requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for information from health care providers. Health care providers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be relieved of requests for information that burden them  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with far too much paperwork and will be compensated for the time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> invested in providing information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Core Diagnostic and Functional Information Focus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The goals of the evidence collection process will be to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> focus requests for evidence on the critical diagnostic and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functional assessment information necessary for a disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision and to form a new partnership with the sources of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information so that it can be obtained in the most efficient,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost-effective manner. Medical evidence development will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> driven by the four-step approach used to decide disability. Two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the core elements of that approach are: (1) identifying an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual's medically determinable impairments (including those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that meet the Index of Disabling Impairments criteria); and (2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessing the functional consequences of those impairments. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decisionmaker will develop medical evidence that is sufficient to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfy the core elements but target evidentiary development to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtain only the evidence necessary to reach an accurate decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the ultimate question of disability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Except for the right to receive income, G retains no right or power which would cause him to be treated as an owner under sections 671 through 677. Under the applicable local law, capital gains must be added to corpus. Since G has a right to receive income, he is treated as an owner of a portion of the trust under section 677. The tax consequences of any items of capital gain of the trust are governed by the provisions of subparts A, B, C, and D (section 641 and following), part I, subchapter J, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code. Because not all of the trust is treated as owned by the grantor, the trustee may not report by the methods described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (i)(A) On January 1, 1995, G, a United States citizen, creates a revocable trust all of which is treated as owned by G. The trustee of the trust is T. During the 1995 taxable year the trust has the following items of income and gross proceeds: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=38 g=1 f=1 --> Interest  <!-- PJG 0114 ellipses --> $2,500  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dividends  <!-- PJG 0114 ellipses --> 3,205  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proceeds from sale of B stock  <!-- PJG 0114 ellipses --> 2,000 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (B) The trust has no items of deduction or credit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)(A)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ) The payors of the interest paid to the trust are X ($2,000), Y ($300), and Z ($200). The payors of the dividends paid to the trust are A ($3,200) and B ($5). The payor of the gross proceeds from the sale of B stock is S ($2,000). The B stock was purchased by T for $1,500 on January 2, 1995, and sold by T on November 30, 1995. T furnishes the name, TIN, and address of the trust to X, Y, Z, A, B, and S. T timely files a Form 1099&hyph;INT with the Internal Revenue Service on which T reports interest attributable to G, as the owner of the trust, of $2,500; a Form 1099&hyph;DIV on which T reports dividends attributable to G, as the owner of the trust, of $3,205; and a Form 1099&hyph;B on which T reports proceeds from the sale of B stock attributable to G, as the owner of the trust, of $2,000. On or before the date specified in section 6034A(a), T furnishes a statement to G which lists the following items of income and information necessary for G to take the items into account in computing G's taxable income: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=38 g=1 f=1 --> Interest.  <!-- PJG 0114 ellipses --> $2,500  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dividends.  <!-- PJG 0114 ellipses --> 3,205  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gain from sale of B stock <!-- PJG 0114 ellipses --> 500 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> Information regarding sale of B stock: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=38 g=1 f=1 --> Proceeds <!-- PJG 0114 ellipses --> $2,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Basis <!-- PJG 0114 ellipses --> 1,500  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Date acquired  <!-- PJG 0114 ellipses --> 1/02/95  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Date sold <!-- PJG 0114 ellipses --> 11/30/95 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ) In addition, the statement furnished to G states that all items of income or gross proceeds that T is required to report to the Internal Revenue Service are included on the statement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

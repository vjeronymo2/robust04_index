			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Leaders to meet in peace talks AMID fears of a new Serb-Croat war in Croatia, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic is due to meet in Geneva today Mr Franjo Tudjman, his Croatian counterpart, and Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic for talks on ending the 16-month war in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Peace talks have so far failed to stem violence in the republic. Croatian radio said yesterday that parts of south-western Mostar were aflame, including the town's industrial district. The Croatian Defence Council (HVO) had seized key positions and pushed back the mostly Moslem Bosnian army, the radio said. The Serbian and Croatian presidents are set to discuss the ethnic division of Bosnia on a 'confederal basis', Tanjug, the Serbian news agency, reported. It did not mention whether Mr Milosevic would hold face-to-face talks with Mr Izetbegovic, who has rejected the ethnic partition of Bosnia in favour of a federal state. Meanwhile, the Croatian president, in a statement yesterday, said the re-opening of the strategic Maslenica bridge was a 'civil' matter which should not lead to 'military conflict'. Croatian and Serbian radio reported scattered artillery duels in Croatia as tensions escalated over the planned re-building of the bridge, which joins mainland Croatia to its southern Dalmatian coast. Serb leaders from the self-styled state of Serbian Krajina, which has cut Croatia in half, on Thursday signed an agreement, brokered by international mediators, which reaffirmed calls for the withdrawal of Croatian army and police from Maslenica bridge and the nearby Zemunik airport and for the deployment of UN troops in the region. Krajina leaders have vowed to stop the pontoon bridge from being put into operation tomorrow. Serb artillery is within easy reach of the bridge. The UN has appealed to Croatia to postpone plans.</p>

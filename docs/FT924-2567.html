			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London robusta COFFEE prices lost impetus towards the close, easing back to the day's lows, while COCOA prices fell from their highs to end mixed. Coffee showed little inclination to move up again after Wednesday's sharp rally, despite widespread conviction that there was still considerable potential on the upside. 'The market has had a couple of days over Dollars 1,000 and doesn't know what to do next. It's almost like a touch of vertigo,' one trader said. On the LME NICKEL prices continued to attract buying interest on downside dips during another volatile session, and the market ended higher. Dealers said nickel again traded within a wide range, with little sign that the current choppy phase was drawing to an end. Uncertainty over the worsening political atmosphere in Russia induced short covering on dips. Nymex PALLADIUM was firmer at midday, with analysts expecting further rises because many players are convinced Russian output will drop dramatically. Compiled from Reuters</p>

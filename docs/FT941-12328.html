			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Memory is not very good Sir, With reference to your excellent review of Portable Computing (January 26), PCMCIA meant Personal Computer Memory Card Manufacturers International Association on page 1; Personal Computer Memory Card International Association by page 2; Personal Computer Memory Card Industry Association on page 5; and by page 6 you had shortened it to PCMIA. PCMCIA does, of course, mean 'People Can't Memorise Computer Industry Abbreviations'] In fact the meaning of PCMCIA is Personal Computer Memory Card International Association and it has largely replaced the old JEIDA standard. JEIDA? . . . Don't ask] R S Rollings, 1 Caedmon Close, York YO3 0HS</p>

			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> CANYON CLEANERS;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: TWO CARS, ABOUT 1,200 TIRES, 3,500 POUNDS OF SCRAP METAL, CHAIRS,  WASHERS AND DRYERS ARE AMONG THE ITEMS REMOVED IN TUJUNGA.  </P> <P> Tires -- hundreds of tires -- appliances by the dozen and a new car with only  its stereo missing were among a "shocking" collection of illegally dumped items  pulled this week from two steep ravines in La Tuna Canyon in Tujunga.  </P> <P> By Thursday afternoon, sweating, dirty volunteer workers and minimum-wage Los  Angeles Conservation Corps employees had dredged out what cleanup organizers  said was one of the worst collections of dumped debris they have ever seen in a  San Fernando Valley canyon.  </P> <P> "This has been really shocking to us all," said Scott Mathes, director of the  California Environmental Project, the nonprofit group that organized the  cleanup with other agencies. "From the amount of debris, we think this is the  first time this part of the canyon has been cleaned."  </P> <P> Although illegal dumping has long plagued scenic and remote canyons throughout  the Valley, park rangers and others suspect that skyrocketing prices at  space-crunched landfills in the region have led to an increase in clandestine  dumping.  </P> <P> Northern La Tuna Canyon, the site of the four-day cleanup, is especially  vulnerable to dumping because of its proximity to the freeway and its desolate  location far from the vigilant eyes of rangers and homeowners, said Gary Moser,  chief park ranger for the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, a state agency  that buys and maintains parkland.  </P> <P> "It's really sickening to see what has been dumped in that area," Moser said.  "There are truckloads of entire house renovations -- the kitchen sink, the  tiles, the ceiling."  </P> <P> Most jolting to the cleanup crews working in a human chain was that they pulled  out about 1,200 tires, stacking the putrid-smelling rubber by the roadside in a  four-foot-high pile for 20 yards.  </P> <P> "It really gets me mad to see this," said Gustavo Guzman, 19, one of the paid  workers. "Before, I never even cared about the environment. But when I'm down  there with all those sharp metals, heavy tires, car parts, I wonder how people  can do this. They don't realize the damage."  </P> <P> The crews hauled away several large, wooden stereo consoles, couches, chairs,  washers and dryers. They collected 1,100 pounds of glass, 3,500 pounds of scrap  metal and two trailers full of wood and concrete, all of it hauled to recycling  centers. About 30 gallons of oil in tin cans and glass bottles were carefully  removed. Workers called police to haul off two cars, including a new 1989 black  Mazda with only the stereo missing. Both vehicles had been reported stolen.  </P> <P> "It's pretty scary down there," said worker Lorena Chavez, 22.  </P> <P> Mathes' volunteer group and the Conservation Corps crews, which are funded by  state and local government grants to clean up public lands, targeted a stretch  of conservancy-owned parkland in the canyon where about four feet of debris had  choked chaparral and scraped away tree bark.  </P> <P> In their zeal to remove trash, they inadvertently cleaned an adjacent parcel of  privately owned property. Mathes said they will attempt to contact the owner to  ask for contributions to the cleanup effort.  </P> <P> Rangers and environmentalists said the debris buildup in La Tuna Canyon was  especially troublesome because water from nearby creek beds eventually drains  into the Los Angeles River, carrying with it residue from hazardous materials  such as oil and paint. The polluted water ultimately flows into the Santa  Monica Bay.  </P> <P> Also, wildlife food chains are poisoned when materials seep into the ground and  splash on shrubbery. Animals are commonly cut or injured in the trash. Plant  life is smothered by the trash. In rainy seasons, flooding is common in La Tuna  Canyon because culverts are clogged, Moser said.  </P> <P> Environmental groups said they are bolstering their efforts to track down  illegal dumpers by sifting through garbage in search of mail or other  identification papers. Moser said he often tracks down dumpers and can usually  persuade them to donate funds to future cleanups.  </P> <P> Punishment for dumping can range from a $100 citation to a $100,000 fine and  prison time if hazardous materials are involved. But catching offenders is  difficult because police or rangers must actually see the dumping take place.  </P> <P> Mathes and rangers said they will petition the city of Los Angeles to install  higher road barriers to make it more difficult to unload a truck of garbage.  </P></p>

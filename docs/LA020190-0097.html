			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'HEROES' GETS A MEDAL AS RECRUITMENT TOOL  </P> <P> "Heroes," airing tonight at 5 and 9 on the Arts &amp; Entertainment cable  channel, promises viewers that it will capture "the incredible life stories of  some of the world's most courageous individuals." Only Western countries need  apply -- the men and one woman profiled were awarded either the U.S. Medal of  Honor, Great Britain's Victoria Cross or France's Legion of Honor.  </P> <P> Produced by former ABC news executive Av Westin ("20/20"), the 26-part series  kicks off with an overview episode, setting the stage for the profiles to come.  </P> <P> Judging from the show's second episode -- and first profile -- on Brig. Gen.  Patrick Brady, "Heroes" comes across as a skillful recruiting tool for the  armed forces.  </P> <P> This can be expected from Brady, who was honored for action in Vietnam in 1968  and who is now the head of public affairs at the Pentagon, but Westin has to  take the major part of the blame.  </P> <P> There's no doubt about Brady's courage. A helicopter pilot who specialized in  flying in thick fog, he won his Medal of Honor for one horrendous day in  Vietnam when he rescued 51 wounded soldiers in heavy combat zones. "Just a man  doing his job," he says, "in the right place at the right time."  </P> <P> But Westin's choices of footage -- even the ones with bloody casualties -- and  the interviews and narration subtly glamorize the war. And Brady's "right  place" was a battlefield where thousands died over the years -- a battlefield  that still adversely affects the lives of hundreds of thousands of veterans and  refugees today.  </P> <P> Other episodes will include veterans from World War II, the Korean War, and one  Frenchman honored for his deeds during action in Algeria in the '60s.

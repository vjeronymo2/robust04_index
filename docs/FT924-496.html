			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / International Company News: DAF shares soar as minister hints at state support SHARES in DAF, the lossmaking Dutch commercial vehicles maker in which British Aerospace owns a 16 per cent stake, surged yesterday after a government minister indicated the company could count on state support if it needed extra financing, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam. 'DAF may soon need perhaps several hundred millions of guilders, which I will seek to arrange, together with the banks and the Belgian government,' Mr Koos Andriessen, the Dutch minister of economic affairs, said in an interview. DAF's shares rose 10.6 per cent to Fl 8.30 from Tuesday's close of Fl 7.50 before dropping back to finish at Fl 8.10, a rise of 8 per cent on the day.</p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Leukaemia victim awarded Pounds 167,154 A former dockyard fitter who contracted leukaemia through working on nuclear submarines was yesterday awarded Pounds 167,154 damages against the Ministry of Defence. Mr Rudy Molinari, 39, a father of two who worked at the Royal Naval Dockyards, Chatham, Kent, between 1970 and 1983, was told by the judge that if his period of remission ended and the disease reappeared within five years he or his family could return to court for further damages. It was the first time that damages have been assessed for leukaemia, and the judgment could have implications for about 120 other workers who are considering claims for radiation exposure against the ministry. The ministry denied negligence but admitted liability in that it 'failed to do all that was reasonably practicable to restrict the extent to which Mr Molinari was exposed to ionising radiations'. The award includes Pounds 40,000 for pain and suffering. The majority of the balance was for loss of earnings. The MoD, which had paid Pounds 160,000 into court, was ordered to pay the costs. Mr Martyn Day, solicitor for Mr Molinari, said after the hearing he was delighted with the judgment. There were 'hundreds, if not thousands, of radiation victims throughout industry awaiting the outcome of the case,' he said. Mr Molinari said he hoped that a proposed 'no-fault' compensation scheme, which involved no legal accusations, would soon be in place.</p>

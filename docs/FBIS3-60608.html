It is part of a 10 kilogram batch of the radioactive  material, the remainder of which was recovered Thursday in  Bursa, western Turkey, in an undercover operation.    Three Georgians were slightly wounded when they were  arrested  after trying to sell the uranium to disguised police officers.  Their identities were still not revealed Monday by police.    The seized material has been sent to a nuclear research  centre in Istanbul for tests, as police look for links with a  smaller haul of uranium in October in Istanbul.    In the earlier incident police arrested five Turks and three  Iranians allegedly attempting to sell 2.5 kilos of uranium,  which the Istanbul research centre said was of insufficient  quality for the manufacture of a nuclear bomb.    Five of the group, including one Iranian, were jailed for  the  "illegal trafficking of nuclear material" by a court in Istanbul.    Parts of the Chernobyl nuclear power station in Ukraine are  still in operation despite a massive explosion in one of its  reactors in April 1986 which caused the world's worst peace-time  nuclear disaster, releasing a cloud of radioactive dust across  Europe.</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / BT will press for faster increases in rental charges BT WILL press for faster increases in line rental charges and a slower rate of cuts to average charges during the review of prices due to begin at the end of this month. Executives of the telecommunications group argued yesterday that the review by Oftel, the industry regulator, should not demand an immediate one-off cut in prices. They rejected suggestions that BT's level of profitability was excessive. The two executives - Mr Andy Green, director of public communications products, and Mr John Basgallop, head of UK regulation - also disclosed plans to introduce a series of optional pricing packages that would appeal to different types of residential customer. The scheme would allow users to pay lower call charges in exchange for higher rental charges. The executives said the review was taking place at a time of 'tremendous uncertainty', particularly because new competitors were emerging, after a change in government policy last year. They said the forthcoming general election and the fact that the term of office of Sir Bryan Carsberg, Oftel's director-general, comes to an end in June, added to the uncertainty. Even so, they argued that Labour and Conservative approaches to telecommunications were unlikely to be 'miles apart'. BT would like the restriction on rises in residential line rental charges to be relaxed. At present it is not allowed to increase them by more than 2 per cent a year above inflation. Mr Green described an alternative proposal, floated by Oftel, that the average residential bill should not increase by more than the rate of inflation, as a 'perfectly acceptable way ahead'. Mr Green also argued that its main price control formula - which requires that a basket of prices be cut by an annual 6.25 per cent, after allowing for inflation - should be relaxed. That was because the formula included a one-off element to bring international prices down, he said. The executives argued that a price formula should be set that would lead to BT earning reasonable profits, if it made reasonable progress to improve efficiency, so giving it an incentive to 'over-achieve'. The sale of part of the government's residual shareholding in British Telecom will raise Pounds 5.43bn, including Pounds 1.84bn in this financial year, the Treasury said yesterday. A total of 1.6bn shares have been sold, including the international tender offer.</p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: WILD AT HEART BY BARRY GIFFORD (VINTAGE: $8.95)  </P> <P> Barry Gifford's slim novel follows the improbable odyssey of two misfits:  Sailor Ripley, a dim ne'er-do-well, and Lula Pace Fortune, a small-town  Southern girl who's brighter than Sailor but not by much. Together they head  west in Lula's Bonneville, seeking "room to move," even though it means Sailor  must break parole and Lula must abandon her domineering mother. Not much  happens to the pair, but Gifford's exceptional ear for dialogue captures not  only regional idioms but also inflections, including the flirtatious Southern  mannerism of turning statements into questions.  </P></p>

			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Rewarding Enterprise Enterprise Oil has worked hard for more than five years to bring its Nelson field on stream. Given that, it must be galling that the oil started to flow this weekend with crude prices around their lowest for eight years, and at their lowest in real terms for 20. The rate of output from the company's Scott and Nelson fields means that by 1995-96, Enterprise's oil output will be almost double that in 1990-91. That success has won the company a share price which stands at a premium to net assets. Measured after tax payments but before dividends, cash will flood into the company at around Pounds 400m a year. Yet low oil prices cut into potential profits, and earnings will not look anything like as rosy as cash flow. The company's dividend payment may remain barely covered. On top of that, Enterprise must find or buy oil on the same scale as its newly-expanded production capacity if it is not to mine into its asset base and reduce its longer-term value. Finding reserves at the rate they are being used will soak up almost all of that Pounds 400m a year of free cash flow about to be produced. There is thus an argument that the dividend should be cut, because it is sucking too much cash out of the business. That would be a poor reward for Enterprise's loyal shareholders. But if oil prices remain low, and exploration remains fundamentally unprofitable, much of that money may not be worth spending. It might then be returned to shareholders or invested outside the upstream oil business. Weighing that decision will be the acid test of Mr Graham Hearne's chairmanship.</p>

			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: IT'S BACK TO OLD DRAWING BOARD  </P> <P> Old cartoon strips don't die, they just get sketchier, or so it must seem to a  legion of fans who will get a new Sunday-only cartoon strip from Pulitzer  Prize-winning cartoonist Berke Breathed in place of his wildly popular "Bloom  County." Ever since Breathed announced he would be ending the strip and  replacing it with the weekly feature, letters have been pouring in from unhappy  readers, including a suicide threat (which turned out to be fake) and the  announcement by a Massachusetts teen-ager of a grass-roots campaign to keep the  cartoon characters alive. "The warmth of those characters was really something,  and it's been an exceptional show of regret that Berke's ending it," said Al  Leeds, who edits the cartoon strip for the Washington Post Writer's Group. It  was Leeds who signed Breathed to a contract in 1980 and watched the strip,  featuring Opus the penguin and the other peculiar residents of a fictional  locale, spread to about 800 daily and college newspapers nationwide. The  cartoonist's mail has more than doubled lately, to as many as 250 letters a  week, full of pleas from fans such as 13-year-old Eric Gustafson, who has  collected about 100 signatures in his campaign to save the strip, ending Aug.  6. "I'm sure 'Bloom County' has a lot of fans nationally who are upset, so  we're trying to get something started locally and hope it will spread," said  Eric.  </P> <P>  -- Czechoslovakian playwright Vaclav Havel, whose jailing this year for human  rights activism raised a global outcry, will be awarded the West German Book  Trade Assn.'s 1989 peace prize. The prize, worth $12,700, will be awarded at  the annual Frankfurt Book Fair on Oct. 15, but Havel likely won't be there to  receive it. "He has no passport, and even if he were given one he would be  afraid to go unless he had assurances that he would be allowed back," said the  playwright's brother, Ivan Havel. Havel, 52, served half of an eight-month  prison term on charges arising from demonstrations against Czechoslovakia's  Communist government. He was released May 17 after protests over his sentence.  </P> <P>  -- First Lady Barbara Bush quietly celebrated her 64th birthday Thursday,  saying she "would just as soon not focus" on the event. Nothing special is  planned for Monday either, when President Bush turns 65. None of the couple's  children were on hand for Mrs. Bush's special day, which the First Lady was to  spend in part speaking at the commencement for 110 graduates from the General  Education Development program at Woodson High School in Washington, where high  school dropouts return to receive their degrees.

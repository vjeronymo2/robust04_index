			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARIZONA SURPRISED IN TEXAS  </P> <P> James Gray of Texas Tech did not have much problem with Arizona's imposing  defensive line Saturday night.  </P> <P> Gray, a senior, scored two touchdowns and rushed for 224 yards as Texas Tech  upset 20th-ranked Arizona, 24-14, at Lubbock, Tex.  </P> <P> Backup tailback Anthony Lynn provided the game-clinching touchdown from three  yards out with 8:11 left as the Red Raiders overcame a 7-0 deficit to win.  </P> <P> Arizona (1-1) opened its season last week with a 19-3 victory over Stanford in  a Pacific 10 Conference game.  </P> <P> Gray turned in the second-best rushing performance in Texas Tech history.  </P> <P> Texas Tech (1-0) gained 367 yards rushing, its best total since 1986.  </P> <P> "I think Arizona went into this game not worried about our offensive line and  me," Gray said. "And I think we changed their minds."  </P> <P> Said Coach Spike Dykes: "We just gave James the ball over and over and he  responded."  </P> <P> The Red Raiders scored twice in a 51-second span in the second quarter to take  a 14-7 halftime lead.  </P> <P> Arizona scored first on quarterback Ron Veal's one-yard run early in the second  quarter. Veal set up the score with passes of 21 and 19 yards.  </P> <P> But Gray led Texas Tech with a 26-yard scoring run to cap an 80-yard drive with  3:06 to play in the half.  </P> <P> Texas Tech defensive end Marcus Washington recovered David Eldridge's fumble at  the Wildcat 23, and Gray scored two plays later on a 14-yard run, bringing his  school-record career touchdown total to 34.  </P> <P> Gray gained 163 yards in 21 carries during the first half.  </P> <P> Arizona Coach Dick Tomey said the Wildcats knew what was coming, but couldn't  stop Gray.  </P> <P> "Gray was good but so was their entire team," Tomey said. "We were simply  outplayed."  </P> <P> Arizona linebacker Chris Singleton said: "Gray is a great running back. One  tackler can't stop him. And their offensive line really did a good job."  </P> <P> Texas Tech offensive coordinator Dick Winder said it didn't take a genius to  figure out Tech's game plan.  </P> <P> "James is a big horse and we're going to ride him," Winder said. In the first  half, Texas Tech drives that stalled at the Arizona 29-, 17-, 26- and 10-yard  lines failed to produce points.  </P> <P> Arizona's Mario Hampton tied the game, 14-14, with a two-yard scoring run in  the third period but Elliott's 29-yard field goal, set up by Gray's 20-yard  run, gave Tech the lead in the fourth quarter.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Juan Carlos Santoyo from the "ACIR Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Text] After several weeks of silence, the Zapatist  National Liberation Army [EZLN] issued another communique on 7  April. The Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee-General  Command [CCRI-CG] of the EZLN issued a communique dated 7 April,  which includes five basic points.    The first point states that in recent days EZLN members have  learned that 21 civilians are being held at Cerro Hueco  Penitentiary and are wrongfully accused of being EZLN members.    The second point states that following the release of the  EZLN fighters, who are under arrest in Chihuahua, the EZLN has  no other guerrillas in government prisons.    The third point states that the EZLN General Command has  carefully reviewed its lists of combatants and that the names of  those who are being wrongfully detained at Cerro Hueco  Penitentiary are not on those lists.    In the fourth point, the EZLN denounces government plans to  arbitrarily cover up the indiscriminate arrest of civilians  during the conflict by accusing them without proof of belonging  to to the EZLN.    In the fifth point, which is a warning to the authorities,  the EZLN warns that if these 21 prisoners continue to be held,  the detentions will be an obstacle to continuing the dialogue  process, because the EZLN cannot speak of peace if the  government speaks of war with its actions.    It also notes that the CCRI-CG communique is signed by  Subcommander Marcos.</p>

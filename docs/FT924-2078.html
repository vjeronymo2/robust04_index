			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Untying the tangle of red tape - Excessive bureaucracy is an unnecessarily costly burden on companies and, say critics, it stifles enterprise It is seven years since the government set up a special deregulation unit to fight red tape. Yet an official review of the bureaucracy with which businesses have to deal has unearthed more than 6,000 pieces of legislation and 2,500 forms still in existence. However assiduous government is in attempting to reduce bureaucracy, all its efforts are undone by the weight of new legislation. The 1980 edition of Butterworth's Company Law, a basic reference work for the legal profession, was just 486 pages thick. By 1991 it ran to 3,544 pages, Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said last week at the launch of a new government campaign to reduce the burdens on business. The cost to business of complying with regulations is similar to the defence budgets of many developed countries, Graham Bannock, a small firms consultant, calculates. Nor is the burden equally spread. Small businesses employing fewer than 15 people spend the equivalent of 2.5 per cent of their turnover dealing with value added tax payments alone while companies employing up to 500 people devote just 0.07 per cent, Bannock says. The owner of a small electrical contracting business employing two people who set out to master government regulations relating to his operations would have to read 26 booklets running to nearly 270,000 words, the Forum of Private Business calculated in 1984. The forum has not repeated the exercise but believes that, if anything, the burden has grown heavier. Most time is taken up in dealing with Customs &amp; Excise, which administers VAT, and with the Inland Revenue which handles income tax. Business owners also have to deal with employment regulations, health and safety issues and local authority planning decisions. European Community directives also now play an important part in the lives of many businesses. The announcement last week of a renewed deregulation drive by government coincided with the launch by the Institute of Directors of its own campaign to reduce red tape. The IOD has been sniping at individual examples of excessive regulation over the past year but has decided to put its efforts on a more permanent basis. Peter Morgan, director general, urged the government to deregulate in areas which would have an immediate impact on the economy and job-creation. Action which could be taken without the need for legislation would be particularly useful, he said. But he warned against attempts to reduce costs to government by simply transferring the burden to business. The government, for its part, expects to complete its review of business legislation within the next few weeks. Departments will then draw up a list of priorities for action to reduce the burden. From next April they will carry out a rolling review of regulations to ensure that pressure is kept up to minimise their impact. Hamilton will make monthly reports to John Major, the prime minister, on the performance of different ministries. Officials will be expected to make use of risk assessment and management techniques and to carry out regular assessments of the compliance costs of new regulations. A guide for officials and businessmen will be published before Christmas. Government departments frequently underestimated the impact of regulations, Hamilton said. The Home Office had estimated the cost of new fire regulations at Pounds 1.7bn but the Association of District Surveyors had calculated the cost at Pounds 8bn.</p>

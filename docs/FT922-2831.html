			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Government Bonds: Switch into D-Mark safe haven continues SPANISH and Italian government bonds slid further last week as dealers and investors continued to switch out of high-yielding markets and into the relative safety of the D-Mark bloc in the aftermath of Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht Treaty on June 2. The markets will be watching the outcome of the Irish referendum on June 18, where the result is expected to be a vote in favour of the treaty. However, the Danish vote against the treaty has forced investors to examine the merits of individual bond markets more carefully now that interest rate convergence has been placed - perhaps temporarily - on ice. In the case of Italy and Spain, dealers and investors are now far more concerned about the domestic economic problems. Italy is suffering from political uncertainty in addition to its economic woes - namely a large budget deficit and high level of public debt - and short-term interest rates have been forced up since the Danish referendum to support the currency. Market participants are still worried about the prospect of higher interest rates if the lira continues to come under pressure in the immediate future. The Spanish government bond market was dealt a severe blow after the Danish referendum, and fell back further on Friday following the release of worse-than-expected inflation figures. Inflation rose 0.3 per cent in May (leaving the year-on-year rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent), whereas economists had hoped to see an increase of only 0.1 per cent. The two markets which have gained the most from the Maastricht blues are Germany and the Netherlands, with the latter seen as having a more favourable inflation outlook as well as having nearly completed its funding programme for the year. The yield on the 8 per cent bund due 2002 fell to 7.91 per cent by the end of last week, from 7.95 per cent a week before. In the Dutch market, the yield on the 10 -year Dutch government bond has fallen from 8.32 per cent to 8.27 per cent in the same period, and dealers have noted strong buying interest in the 15-year issue - especially given that Germany lacks a similarly dated bond.</p>

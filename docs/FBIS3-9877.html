			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statements by Polish Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk </F> and General Tadeusz Wilecki, chief of the Polish Army's General  Staff, during a news conference with unidentified reporters;  place and date not given--live or recorded; from the "Caliber"  military program]    [Excerpts] [Kolodziejczyk] What happened to the Armed  Forces' budget this year smacks of a scandal. There occurred  far-reaching interference by the legislative branch with the  powers of the executive branch. That is unacceptable. If the  [defense] ministry's chief is supposed to bear constitutional  responsibility for the Armed Forces' readiness and the readiness  of the country's defense system, one must not tie his hands with  decisions on where and how money should be spent because this  way one will not succeed in creating anything that would make  sense or be a logical whole. Under the situation that has  emerged, I will submit a complaint before the Constitutional  Tribunal. [passage omitted]    We are not so conservative as to refuse to give up  anything--we can see the need ourselves. The Army is smaller;  personnel policies have changed; there is a different concept,  generally speaking; there are fewer officers who are better  educated; there are more ensigns and noncommissioned officers;  the size of forces on contract and over-the-time service has  increased, following the example of other armies; and there is  also an increased level of professionalism, but not necessarily  through increases in the size of the officer corps. As a result  of the last, we also have a process of integration with regard  to military education, but that is a process the rate of which,  unfortunately, is also dependent on the budget.    [Wilecki] I think that in 1995--and I am saying this  officially--we are making efforts to make it possible to  introduce a 12-month service term.    [Kolodziejczyk] If I may, I would like to elaborate on that  issue in a couple or more sentences. It used to be that one had  to serve three years in the Navy, and training of a naval expert  using equipment that was not that complicated lasted six months.  So that meant six months of training and two and a half years  of service itself. Right now, training a radio-telegraphic  operator to a decent level by using the equipment the regiment  has at its disposal, takes seven to eight months. Now, if  service takes 12 months, its real, actual length will be only  four months. So the question is: What kind of implementation  has to take place to secure the servicing of equipment at a  decent level? That is the main problem here. And there is no  other way to cut short the length of military service except to  professionalize the service, which means over-the-time and  contract service when, after a cycle of training, there follows  a four-year period of service--that is to say, four years at the  minimum. Except that, in order to introduce that kind of  service, just as General Wilecki said, there must be legislative  regulations that would eliminate all waivers of military service  due to cultivating a hectare of land, having this or that number  of children, and so forth. This is a citizen's duty, and we are  all equal in the eyes of the law and the Constitution. That is  the first thing. As a second issue, we come back to the issue  because one must invest resources in the establishment of a  corps of cadre of the over-the-time service and contract  service, as I mentioned. [passage omitted]    [Wilecki] Generally speaking, the Armed Forces are in bad  shape. It is my moral duty--and I have been fulfilling this for  two years now--to make the supreme authorities in the state  aware of things because it is those authorities who bear  responsibility for the country's security. As chief of the  Polish Army's General Staff, I am responsible for certain  things, I feel it is my duty to bring them to light, and I think  the country's supreme authorities are being made aware of these  issues. The fact that you [addressing the journalists] do not  know all of the details--forgive me, but the special services of  our various potential friends and enemies are working around the  clock and are following various events. So it would be hard to  expect the mass media to publish details on the Armed Forces'  protection systems and functioning. One must realize that some  things are discussed behind closed doors. I am hoping that the  parliamentary debate, which Sejm Speaker Oleksy announced during  his meeting with the General Staff's leadership a few weeks  back, will be a closed-door debate and that it will lead to some  details being cleared up. It is true that not all members of  parliament feel comfortable with defense matters.    [Kolodziejczyk] Sejm Speaker Mr. Jozef Oleksy has said  publicly that the debate will indeed take place in the month of  April. Practically speaking, the Army and the Defense Ministry  have been ready for it for a long time now. What do we expect  from the debate? We expect no miracles because tea does not get  sweet simply by stirring it. But there is a very significant  issue: putting in order the legal framework for the Defense  Ministry's functioning, and also of the General Staff and all  structures of the Army. This requires great effort and is a  very urgent issue. In fact, in the eyes of the West, we may  well be perceived as an Army that failed to accomplish anything  in terms of reform because it continues to be headed by a  minister with powers provided for by a 1967 law, so, despite the  fact that the minister wears civilian clothes, he has a right to  command the forces, in accordance with the law I mentioned and  that is in force.    Incidentally, I want to explain something with regard to the  West's perception of these issues. As far as I can figure out,  it is of no interest to them who is in charge of the ministry  and what kind of uniform he used to wear, be it a railway  uniform, a military one, or some other type. What is important  to them is precisely what we are talking about--that is to say,  power. So the minister can be a civilian if he has the power to  exert administrative and political supervision over the Army.  And there is the Armed Forces' commander, who, in our case, is  known as chief of the General Staff and who is charged with  statutory responsibility for the defense readiness of military  units--that is, of the Armed Forces. That is the first  necessary step and there are very many others to follow. That  is the first thing we expect from the Sejm debate. We expect it  will be a new incentive for putting these things in order,  including the Small Constitution, the powers of the Security  Council, SORM [expansion unknown], and so forth. Another thing  we expect is that the Sejm will make a decision on reaching a  certain fixed level of GDP within a set time limit, to be spent  on the defense budget, and that, thanks to that, we will be able  to arrange our implementation potential in a way that would make  sense, taking into account our financial capabilities. These  are the two issues that can bring a vast improvement to the  entire ministry, particularly the Armed Forces, without  additional resources. [passage omitted] The optimism I sense  is over the fact that West Europe's two largest countries--with  the greatest economic and military potential--made a decision to  recommend us for associate membership in the Western European  Union [WEU]. That means introductory integration into European  security structures. It also brings results in the form of a  promise of openness to technological and technical cooperation.  We have been fighting for that kind of openness for several  years now, with a complete lack of success, I might add. The  intention of implementing both the Partnership for Peace  initiative and the most recent initiative regarding cooperation  with the WEU countries is to collect experiences precisely at  the level of basic units, which means platoons and companies.  Then we will find out what is the relationship between our  communications and command systems, training techniques, signal  methods, and so forth, and then, on the basis of these  conclusions, we will have an opportunity to correct our own  programs and move to a higher level of cooperation or joint  exercises in the following year.    To have the best possible relations with our neighbors is  the  primary principle of our security policy. Second, it is  regional cooperation; third, European structures; and, finally,  arms reduction. So the first item requires two parties to  participate. My sense is that Western countries have matured  enough so as not to be alarmed by every move of President  Yeltsin's or Minister Kozyrev's eyelids, and to instead  implement what is rational at a given point. Integrating Poland  and other countries into European security structures, which  means eliminating the gray area--that is rational. Gray areas  always bring to mind potential possibilities of destabilization.  I think the trend should be spread over and cover the remaining  countries. It is a process, but, for the moment, let us focus on  what pertains to Poland. So there is a chance for Poland, and  we shall see what will happen in May. I am optimistic, and I  have faith that Poland will be an associate member of the WEU.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Valeriy Sevryukov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS -- Albania insists that a  solution of the Kosovo question should become a component part  of an all-round settlement of the Yugoslav crisis, Albanian  Ambassador to Russia Arben Cici said in an exclusive interview  with ITAR-TASS here on Wednesday.    "We believe that the most efficient means to achieve this  goal is to link up the lifting of sanctions against Serbia with  an understanding between Belgrade and the Kosovo legitimate  leaders on a status of that territory," he noted.    Kosovo, the diplomat stressed, is a component part of the  Yugoslav crisis, harbouring a real danger of a new eruption of  the conflict.    A solution of the problem of ethnic Albanians making up 90  per cent of that territory's population and experiencing  pressure from Serbs, is a must to achieve a lasting and final  peace on the Balkans.    Albania is situated next the the conflict zone, Cici  continued. Therefore, it is interested in establishing peace and  stability in the region as soon as possible. Efforts of  Albanian diplomacy are aimed at this goal. Mindful of this, we  welcome any initiative or action, no matter wherefrom it comes.    The only condition is that these actions should stop war,  establish a lasting and stable peace and lead to a just  political settlement of the crisis.    Albania has always offered assistance and sincere  cooperation  to international organisations and states who have friends,  influence and interests on the Balkans and who will assume an  unbiased obligation for a just settlement of the conflict and  prevention of its proliferation.    Their role and responsibility in this respect are  invaluable.  Russian diplomacy has peculiar features and advantages  permitting it to play an important role in the Balkan region,  the Albanian ambassador stressed.</p>

			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: EL MONTE;  </P> <P> DAIL-A-RIDE PACT AWARDED  </P> <P> The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to award a $309,734, 11-month  contract to ATE/RYDER to operate the city's Dial-A-Ride program for elderly and  disabled residents.  </P> <P> A three-month contract beginning July 1 was given to ATE/RYDER last month when  the city discovered that the previous contractor, Mid-Valley Transit Inc., was  not properly insured.  </P> <P> ATE/RYDER also operates the city's old-fashioned trolley system.  </P> <P> Rather than put the contract out to bid after three months, Parks and  Recreation Director Brian Ogden recommended that the city continue with the El  Monte-based ATE/RYDER, which he said is a proven provider. Mid-Valley Transit's  yearlong contract was for $205,000, but Ogden said start-up costs and two new  station wagons that ATE/RYDER plans to buy account for the higher price.  </P></p>

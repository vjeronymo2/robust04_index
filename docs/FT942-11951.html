			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo The outcome of the wrangling over Japan's new cabinet has had little affect on long-term interest rates, although investors in the short-term money markets were encouraged by the creation of Mr Tsutomu Hata's minority government. Traders believe Mr Hata is unlikely to deliver the tax reform package, including income tax cuts to be financed by a rise in consumption taxes, because of the departure of the socialist party from the coalition. He may, therefore, try to avert pressure from the US by cutting interest rates to stimulate the economy. If a general election is called following the passage of the budget bill, as many analysts are forecasting, the Bank of Japan may be tempted to ease its monetary policy to counter the rise in negative sentiment towards the economy, which has just started to stabilise. Bond market investors, however, had little incentive to commit funds ahead of the Golden Week holidays. Financial markets this week will be closed for three days starting today. Institutional investors, which have indicated they would put most of their new money into the bond market rather than stocks, are expected to start investing after the holidays but the upside of bond prices may be limited by the rise in bond issues by municipal governments.</p>

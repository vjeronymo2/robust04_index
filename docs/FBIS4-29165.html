			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "International Report" program] </F>   [Text] Papua New Guinea [PNG] has suddenly found it  difficult to borrow overseas to fund its increasing budget  deficit. To secure its latest loan, it had to sign over to a  syndicate of foreign banks led by the Union Bank of Switzerland  first rights to government revenue from major resource projects.  Here is Sean Dorney.    [Begin recording] [Dorney] PNG has received something of a  jolt from the international commercial banking community. In  its first attempt in a number of years to borrow from  non-concessional sources overseas, it has found the banks  reluctant and skeptical about its financial management. The PNG  Government was looking to borrow US$160 million that it wanted  to repay over five years. But, after 12 months of tough  negotiations, it could get only US$90 million to be paid back  over three years and it had to give the banking syndicate led by  the Union Bank of Switzerland rights to first call over its  revenues from its mining and oil projects. They'll be paid into  a bank account in London and if PNG defaults the banks take the  revenue. The resource revenues in taxes and dividends are paid  into what is called the mineral resources stabilization fund.  And the finance minister, Masket Iangalio, had to push an  amendment bill through the PNG parliament last week to allow  payment into the fund to go to London, not to the Bank of PNG.  The fund was set up in the 1970s to help PNG cope with wide  fluctuations in revenue resulting from sharp movements in the  world's prices of copper and gold. PNG's former prime minister,  Rabbie Namaliu, is aghast at the bank's demand.    [Namaliu] What concerns me and the opposition very much is  the fact that this is the first time ever in our history since  independence that we have been asked to mortgage national assets  to foreign banks in order for us to obtain commercial loan. And  that's really worrying because not even our grit [as heard] has  been accepted by commercial banks, and, in fact, before we could  go and borrow commercially without problems and risk because,  basically because, the international financial community still  had a great deal of confidence in this country.    [Dorney] Mr. Namaliu claims that confidence has been wrecked  by the Wingti government's policies of the past three years  including such moves as renegotiating the Pago gold mine  agreement. The finance minister, Mr. Iangalio, admits he is  disappointed by the terms demanded by the foreign banks. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / BJP leader calls for Indian election MR Lal Krishan Advani, the leader of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), yesterday demanded immediate elections in India, claiming that the government had lost the mandate of the people as violence in Bombay, the country's commercial capital, continued for the ninth day running. Fourteen more people were killed yesterday, raising the death toll in the latest round of violence in the city to 200. Life in Bombay continued to be paralysed, as troops marched through deserted suburban streets, unable to contain the looting and burning. Mr Sharad Pawar, the defence minister who has been directing the security clampdown, said he expected the city to return to normal by today. The radical BJP plans to intensify its campaign for early elections by despatching leaders throughout the country after announcing its programme on January 15. Mr Advani said he was 'not ashamed' of the demolition of the mosque in Ayodhya by Hindu fundamentalists - the incident that sparked the communal violence - saying it was a 'dilapidated and abandoned' structure and not a mosque at all. The Congress (I) yesterday ruled out the possibility of a change of leadership in Maharashtra and Gujarat, the states worst hit in the second phase of violence following the destruction of the mosque. Mr VN Gadgil, the party's spokesman, said there was no question of the government declaring a partial emergency.</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Folding of the brewing umbrella - Regionals lose the protection of Whitbread On Thursday of last week, with little fuss, one of British brewing's historic institutions was abolished when Whitbread, one of the giants of the industry, sold Pounds 225m-worth of shares in eight smaller brewers. Thus ended the so-called 'Whitbread umbrella', whereby for 40 years Whitbread had held strategic stakes in local brewers to protect them from takeover by their bigger rivals. The obvious question now arises: given that protection was necessary in the first place, are the regional brewers being thrown to the wolves? Not necessarily. In many industries, size means everything. In UK brewing, there is evidence that middle-sized companies these days can not only hold their own against the giants, but can actually gain ground. This can be simply illustrated by combining the results of a dozen regional brewers* and comparing them with Britain's biggest brewer and publican, Bass. Last year, the regional sample had combined sales of Pounds 1.8bn and operating profits of Pounds 255m, a margin of 14 per cent. Bass's brewing and pub divisions had combined sales of Pounds 2.3bn and profits of Pounds 361m, a margin of 16 per cent. Scale economies, it seems, are worth something in UK brewing: but not much. Look at the best performers in the regional group, and the balance tilts the other way. Morland, the Oxfordshire brewer, had a margin last year of 23 per cent. Over the past five years, its sales have grown by an average 19 per cent a year, while its earnings per share are up 11 per cent over the period. Greene King, based in East Anglia, has margins of 19 per cent and average sales growth of 7 per cent. Bass as a group raised its sales by 2.5 per cent a year over the period, while its earnings fell by nearly a third. In one sense, Bass could argue that its poor performance is the result of enemy action. Since 1989, when the government took steps against the industry on competition grounds, there has been a ceiling on the number of licensed premises the big brewers can own. Not only are groups like Bass and Whitbread barred from increasing their pub estates: in compliance with the Beer Orders (as the legislation is known) they had to get rid of pubs and take large restructuring charges against profits. In fact, the Beer Orders are less of a constraint than they appear. They limit only the number of pubs the big brewers can own. Bass, like many of its smaller competitors, has little desire to increase the number of its pubs. This is because the tied house system has left the brewers with a long tail of small, unprofitable tenanted pubs whose sole purpose is to mop up the last of the brewery's output. The big or middle-sized brewers want to get rid of those pubs and acquire bigger, more profitable managed pubs instead. More fundamentally, the big brewers face the problem that in some parts of their business, size can be a positive disadvantage. It is, of course, more economical to produce beer in huge, modern breweries, and to promote national brands through the national media. But distribution is another matter. Very often, the local brewer has all his pubs within a few miles of the brewery: and for a product consisting almost wholly of water, most of whose retail price goes to the government, this is an important advantage. As for the pubs themselves, a crucial drawback for the big brewers is that they have failed to introduce branding into their outlets. Retail chains like Boots or Marks and Spencer can use a standard national format to drive smaller rivals out of business. For the big brewers, the reverse can be the case. Watneys, for instance, now jointly owned by Grand Metropolitan and Fosters, has in recent years expunged its name from many of its pub frontages, preferring modest anonymity. The result of this can be a reverse economy of scale. Run one pub, and you make a given profit. Run fifty, and you have to hire an accountant, a buyer, a property expert and security staff. Quite possibly, none of those pubs will be more inherently profitable than the one you started with. If so, the extra overhead is a dead loss. So what shape will the industry take, now that Whitbread has taken its umbrella away? Brokers' analysts, who are perhaps interested parties, argue for a degree of concentration. But, they agree, it will take a limited form. Rather than the big brewers snapping up the smaller, the medium-sized brewers will snap up the smallest. This may take time, since many of the smallest are protected by family holdings or restricted voting structures. The point is, however, that the middle-sized brewers from which Whitbread withdrew its protection last week are mostly able to take care of themselves. Companies such as Morland, Greene King, Marston and Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley have developed varied and successful strategies to cope with the changing world of UK brewing. In stock market terms, all stand on higher multiples and lower yields than the industry leaders. For the big brewers, the Beer Orders are a handy excuse for not snapping up their smaller rivals. In truth, they might be pushed to afford them. *Boddington, Devenish, Eldridge Pope, Fullers, Greenall, Greene King, Mansfield, Marston, Morland, Vaux, Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley, Youngs.</p>

			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> BUCHANAN SUPPORTS SISTER, OPPOSES TAXES  </P> <P> President Bush is at risk of losing the conservative support that helped him  into the White House unless he holds the line on taxes and sends a stronger  message to the Soviet Union on the Baltic republics' independence, said  conservative Washington commentator and former Reagan Administration adviser  Patrick J. Buchanan on Tuesday.  </P> <P> "He's now coming to a fork in the road in his administration," Buchanan said at  a fund-raiser at the Santa Ana Country Club for his sister, state treasurer  candidate Angela (Bay) Buchanan.  </P> <P> "He's going to have to choose whether he stands with those of us who stood with  him in 1988 against Dukakis when . . . he said, 'No new taxes.' "  </P> <P> Buchanan said Bush's recent decision "to put everything on the table" in budget  discussions with Democrats -- including taxes -- was "a mistake."  </P> <P> "He has not explained the nature of the crisis being so severe that you should  immediately throw aside the most important pledge he made," Buchanan said.  </P> <P> Buchanan's appearance Tuesday evening was one of eight scheduled stops on a  three-day Southern California swing he is making on behalf of his sister, a  former U.S. treasurer who is now locked in a tough battle for the Republican  nomination for state treasurer with incumbent Thomas Hayes.  </P> <P> The Democrat who will face the winner of the Republican primary is another  woman with a famous brother -- Kathleen Brown, a member of the Los Angeles  Board of Public Works and the sister of former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr.  </P> <P> About 120 people attended the $200-per-person reception, and Ken Rietz, one of  Buchanan's consultants, said her brother's appearances should bring in about  $200,000 for the campaign.  </P> <P> "People like to talk to him," said Rietz. "They may not always agree with him,  but they like to hear him."  </P> <P> Said Bay Buchanan: "He brings some attention and some excitement to the  campaign."BOB SCHWARTZ  </P></p>

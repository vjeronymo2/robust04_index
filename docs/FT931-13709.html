			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: CBI report urges transport funding THE government should take advantage of current low contract prices to reduce the backlog of improvements to Britain's transport infrastructure, says a Confederation of British Industry report published yesterday. Investment in transport has been inadequate, says the report, even though good links are necessary for economic regeneration. The recession has created an opportunity for investment while contract prices are low, it says. The report says rapid development of effective communications in Britain is jeopardised by fragmentation in planning and implementation, due to transport investment being handled by at least five Whitehall departments.</p>

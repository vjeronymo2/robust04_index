			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Ukraine's shipping minister sacked THE Ukrainian government yesterday sacked Mr Viktor Pylypenko, the merchant marine minister, amid allegations of corruption. He is accused of involvement in corruption at the Black Sea Shipping Company, which a government commission alleges evaded up to Dollars 20m in taxes and sold more than 30 ships illegally. The decision to sack the minister - part of a wider anti-corruption drive launched by Mr Leonid Kushma, the prime minister - must be approved by the Ukrainian parliament, of which Mr Pylypenko is a member. A spokesman for the government accused him this week of having spent more than Dollars 100,000 to build a lavish bathroom in his office. The allegations yesterday are the most recent charges to be levelled against the company. With 206 vessels, it is Ukraine's largest shipping concern, and a potential magnet for foreign investors.</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Foreign minister ousted in Thailand Thailand's foreign minister, Mr Prasong Soonsiri, has been ousted after a party squabble and replaced by Mr Thaksin Shinawatra, a prominent entrepreneur. Mr Prasong, a tough former intelligence chief, was sometimes accused of handling delicate relations with neighbours in a devious manner, and failing to erase the notion that Thailand supported the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. His replacement, the founder of the Shinawatra Computer and Communications group, is an ambitious former policeman with no previous political experience. He started in business by selling computers to his own police department. The leader of the Palang Dharma (Buddhist way) party, Mr Chamlong Srimuang, has pushed Mr Thaksin forward as part of a reshuffle of all the party's 11 cabinet seats in the ruling five-party coalition's administration. The former president of the Bangkok Bank, Mr Vichit Surawongchai, replaces Mr Winai Sompong, as minister for transport and communications. Mr Chamlong fears his party has been overshadowed by the ruling Democrat party in the two years since the last election. Mr Chuan Leekpai, the prime minister and leader of the Democrat Party, has said he will not interfere with the PDP reshuffle list which was given to the Democrats yesterday. In September Mr Chamlong engineered his return as overt party leader for the first time since 1992. His religious faction which claims high moral principles also took control of the party executive. Mr Chamlong will enter the cabinet for the first time as a deputy prime minister, replacing former party leader Mr Boonchu Rojanastien. He is expected to strive hard to bolster the party's Bangkok power base particularly by trying to ease the capital's traffic jams. However Mr Chamlong's dictatorial management style could upset his coalition partners, especially since they will not want to see Palang Dharma be made the saviours of Bangkok by solving the transport crisis. The move may, however, improve the chances of the Tanayong group's elevated railway being completed.</p>

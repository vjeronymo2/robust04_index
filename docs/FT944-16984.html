			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Lottery tickets on sale next month Tickets for the National Lottery are to go on sale for the first time on November 14 - just six days before the first multimillion-pound weekly draw. The Pounds 1 tickets will be available initially at about 10,000 outlets all over the UK. As well as announcing the date for the launch of ticket sales, Camelot, the consortium operating the National Lottery, also announced the introduction of a new tier of weekly prizes of about Pounds 100,000. Until now there was a wide gap between the likely first prize of as much as Pounds 2m and smaller prizes ranging from Pounds 10 to about Pounds 1,500. The new prize, inserted to increase interest, will be awarded on the basis of drawing an additional numbered ball. To win the first prize a lottery player must correctly choose six numbers out of a total of 49 in any order. A player who has chosen five of the correct numbers will be able to win a Pounds 100,000 prize if the seventh produces the missing correct number. Mr David Rigg, a director of Camelot, said yesterday: 'The bonus number adds to the excitement and should increase the number of big winners on the National Lottery each week.' The consortium brings together the food and drinks group Cadbury Schweppes, computer company ICL, the security printer De La Rue, Racal Electronics and GTech, the US manufacturer of lottery equipment. The special computer terminals needed to play the Lottery will be located in high street stores which range from Tesco and J. Sainsbury to WH Smith and Woolworth and in petrol stations such as Esso and Shell. It is hoped the lottery will raise about Pounds 9bn by the year 2001 for five 'good causes' - the arts, charities, a millennium fund, national heritage and sport.</p>

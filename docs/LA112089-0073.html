			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> OILERS WIN IN OVERTIME IN A HURRY  </P> <P> Almost before most people knew the overtime was under way Sunday night at  Edmonton, Mark Messier scored to give the Oilers a 5-4 victory over the Chicago  Blackhawks.  </P> <P> Only eight seconds had elapsed when Messier took a breakaway pass from Kevin  Lowe and slid the puck underneath Chicago goalie Alain Chevrier.  </P> <P> It was the 13th goal for Messier, who earlier assisted on three goals to help  Edmonton build a 4-2 lead.  </P> <P> Chicago tied it with goals by Doug Wilson and Steve Larmer just 91 seconds  apart in the middle of the third period.  </P> <P> With their second win in a row, the Oilers jumped from last place in the Smythe  Division to a tie for second with the Kings and Vancouver.  </P> <P> Vancouver 2, Buffalo 2 -- Soviet player Igor Larionov scored on a power play  early in the third period at Vancouver to help give the Canucks a tie.  </P> <P> If they had won, the Canucks could have moved into second all by themselves in  the Smythe Division.

			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL AIR OFFICIALS APPEAL LIMITED ROLE IN EMISSION CONTROLS  </P> <P> In California's arduous struggle with air pollution, local authorities have  long played the primary role in regulating emissions from factories, refineries  and other stationary sources of contamination.  </P> <P> But now, these officials say, that power could be sharply curtailed and the  public health threatened by an appeals court ruling that has caused deep  concern among pollution regulators and their allies throughout the state.  </P> <P> Joined by environmental and health groups, the authorities have asked the  California Supreme Court to overturn the appellate decision, which they contend  could sound the death knell for local regulation of toxic air contaminants from  non-vehicular sources. A high court ruling is due by September.  </P> <P> </P> <P> State Law at Issue  </P> <P> At issue is whether a landmark 1983 state law, known as the Tanner Act, bars  California's 41 local air pollution control districts from regulating toxic  contaminants before the state Air Resources Board has analyzed and identified  them as dangerous.  </P> <P> Under the law, a toxic air contaminant is one that may cause an increase in  death or serious illness or pose "a present or potential hazard to human  health."  </P> <P> The aim of the legislation was to reduce the risk of cancer, birth defects and  genetic mutations from air-borne pollutants. Asbestos and benzene are examples  of substances that have been labeled as toxic by both state and federal  authorities. Smog -- a mixture of gases and particulates -- can impair health,  but has not been generally recognized as toxic.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Local Control Preempted  </P> <P> The ruling under attack was issued last summer by a state Court of Appeal in  San Jose in a lawsuit by petroleum producers and refiners against  precedent-setting local regulations adopted by the Monterey Bay Unified Air  Pollution Control District. In a 3-0 decision, the panel held that the Tanner  Act preempted the district's power to regulate toxic emissions until the Air  Resources Board had acted.  </P> <P> District officials, in appealing to the state high court, say the ruling will  create an enforcement gap in which toxic emissions could go unregulated for  long periods of time.  </P> <P> In five years, district officials note, the Air Resources Board has identified  only nine chemicals as toxic substances. Nobody in the dispute is accusing the  board of intentional delay. They say the process outlined for it to follow is  just too time-consuming. The district said it wants to be able to move quickly  on perhaps hundreds of substances that it believes could cause cancer, birth  defects and other injury.  </P> <P> "The state ARB has been incredibly slow," said Lawrence D. Odle, executive  director of the Monterey Bay district. "We'd be abdicating our responsibility  to the public if we didn't do something on our own."  </P> <P> Officials contend that the ruling overlooks the fact that local districts may  face threats from a substance that poses an unusual danger only to their own  community.  </P> <P> "A specific pollutant may not be a problem when viewed on a statewide basis and  it may be way down the list at the ARB," said Daniel P. Selmi of Loyola Law  School, an environmental law specialist representing the district in the case.  "But that pollutant may present a very big problem in a particular area of the  state."  </P> <P> On the other side, lawyers for the Western States Petroleum Assn., the group  that challenged the Monterey Bay plan, argue that only a painstaking scientific  review by the state can produce a reliable and consistent regulatory framework  for controlling toxic emissions.  </P> <P> Allowing each separate district to perform its own scientific analysis can only  lead to a patchwork of conflicting regulatory standards, the association's  attorneys say.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Complex Problems  </P> <P> The Air Resources Board was created to conduct research and provide guidance  for local districts, the association says. The Legislature, in adopting the  1983 act, meant to maintain a uniform, statewide approach to the complex  problems of air pollution control, it contends.  </P> <P> Michael A. Monahan, a Los Angeles attorney representing the petroleum  association, notes that the Monterey Bay district has labeled about 150  chemicals as toxic -- several of which the state already has concluded pose no  threat to health.  </P> <P> "Our concern is that there could be air districts all over the state  identifying hundreds of chemicals" as toxic, Monahan said. "It would create a  regulatory nightmare."  </P> <P> The Tanner Act, sponsored by Assemblywoman Sally Tanner of El Monte, was passed  in the wake of newly emerging concern over toxic emissions from stationary  sources.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Identify Pollutants  </P> <P> The act established complex procedures in which the Air Resources Board,  working with state health authorities, would identify toxic air pollutants and  then design measures to control them. Local districts then were to adopt  regulations at least as stringent as those adopted by the state board. The  regulation of pollution from vehicles remained the sole responsibility of the  state.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, at the federal level, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in  recent years has adopted national air quality standards that are to be attained  by states and local communities. To date, the EPA has identified eight  substances that are subject to controls as hazardous air pollutants.  </P> <P> Monterey Bay district authorities, unsatisfied with the pace of the Air  Resources Board, in 1986 adopted their own sweeping plan to control toxic air  contaminants from new or modified stationary sources. To obtain a permit to  operate, emission-producing facilities must install "reasonable" technology to  control toxic contaminants, and if those contaminants could cause cancer, the  facilities must employ the "best" technology to control them.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Decision Reversed  </P> <P> A Monterey Superior Court upheld the local plan but the state Court of Appeal  reversed that decision. The appellate court held that the district had no  authority to regulate toxic emissions until they had been identified by the Air  Resources Board. After such identification, the district could go ahead and  regulate toxics even before the state had adopted the model rules, the court  said.  </P> <P> The Court of Appeal found that the Legislature, in passing the act, "has not  expressly reserved" the toxic-identification process for the state. But in view  of the "extremely detailed and thorough procedure" for identification set forth  by the act, it was apparent the Legislature meant to leave that task  exclusively to the state, the court said.  </P> <P> In its appeal to the state Supreme Court, the district has gained support from  a broad coalition of environmental and health groups, including the Citizens  for a Better Environment, the American Lung Assn. of California and the Sierra  Club.  </P> <P> "We look at this case as deciding whether, in fact, we are really going to be  regulating air contamination in California," said Alan Ramo, the attorney  representing the coalition. "The state process is slow and cumbersome. At the  rate they're going, it could be a hundred years before we could regulate all  the contaminants that should be regulated."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Appeal Backed  </P> <P> Also backing the appeal are seven local air-pollution districts, including the  South Coast Air Quality Management District -- which encompasses Los Angeles,  Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties -- and Los Angeles Dist. Atty.  Ira Reiner, whose office prosecutes violators of pollution control laws.  </P> <P> The South Coast AQMD, like some other districts, is developing a plan to assess  the risks and then adopt controls for sources of toxic emissions. The specific  toxics that would be subject to regulation have not yet been determined, a  spokesman said.  </P> <P> The districts urged the justices to recognize the need for local authority in  controlling toxics, noting for example that the South Coast AQMD on its own has  adopted regulations to control styrene, a suspected carcinogen used in the  manufacturer of fiberglass.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Regulation Argued  </P> <P> Although the substance may not present a major problem in many locales, it does  in the South Coast region and should be regulated, the districts said.  </P> <P> (According to a spokesman for the South Coast AQMD, the case will not affect  the district's recently proposed clean-air plan, which is designed to bring the  region into compliance with federal emission standards.)  </P> <P> Another important ally for the district emerged in the Air Resources Board  itself, which contended that the act could never have been intended to alter  the long-recognized authority of local districts to impose more stringent  controls on non-vehicular emissions than those required by either the state or  federal government. The board conceded that its procedures are necessarily  time-consuming and said local districts should be free to act against toxics in  the interim.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Powerless to Regulate  </P> <P> In its presentation to the court, the Monterey Bay district warned the justices  that under the appeal panel's interpretation of the law, a new facility can  locate in the middle of a city and emit toxic pollutants that local authorities  would be powerless to regulate.  </P> <P> For example, the district cited a dilemma it now faces in weighing the risks of  a proposed energy-producing "biomass" facility in the region. Under the appeal  court ruling, the district could regulate six nontoxic pollutants the plant  will emit, but could not control the emission of arsenic and chloroform -- two  contaminants it believes are toxic but have not been identified as such by the  Air Resources Board.  </P> <P> Attorney Selmi, representing the district in oral argument before the court  last month, pointed out that under the appellate ruling, local districts  actually would have less power to regulate toxic emissions than they do to  control nontoxics. "The Legislature could not have intended that result," he  said.  </P></p>

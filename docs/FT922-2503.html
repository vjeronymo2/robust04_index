			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Russia and US have few hopes NEITHER the US nor Russia appears optimistic about an early resolution of the problems in the former republics of Yugoslavia. President Boris Yeltsin's spokesman said on Monday night before his summit with President Bush that 'If we see there is a broad international consensus to stop the conflict, we will go along with it.' Mr Bush emphasised US willingness 'to help in a humanitarian sense'. But he rejected comparisons with the Gulf War, in which, he said, only the US was in the position to take the international lead. 'Here the EC took the lead and I hope we'll stay shoulder-to-shoulder with them until this problem is solved.' However, Mr Ralph Johnson, the State Department undersecretary for European and Canadian affairs, said recently that he doubted that much of a European consensus existed beyond the short term. On Monday, Mr Bush himself was bluntly warned by President Sali Berisha of Albania of the threat to fragile regional stability posed by Serbian territorial ambitions.</p>

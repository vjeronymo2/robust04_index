			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Baldwin agrees bid for Simpsons BALDWIN, the holidays, printing and properties group, has agreed an all-paper bid for Simpsons of Cornhill, valuing the owners of the famous City chop house at Pounds 1.68m. But the offer was condemned by a group of dissident shareholders who tried to oust the Simpsons board at an extraordinary meeting in September. The offer - already accepted by the Simpsons board and stockbrokers Raphael Zorn Hemsley, which together represent more than 54 per cent of the capital  -will reunite two of Britain's leading restaurant executives: Mr Roy Ackerman, chairman of Simpsons, and Mr Sandy Singh, chief executive of Baldwin. During the 1980s the two worked together as joint chairmen of the Kennedy Brookes restaurant chain which was sold to Forte for Pounds 173m. 'It is our intention to create a major force in the restaurant, catering and leisure sector,' Mr Singh said yesterday. His view was echoed by Mr Ackerman who expects 'similar growth' once Simpsons becomes a Baldwin subsidiary. Details of the bid emerged two days after shares in USM-traded Simpsons were suspended following Baldwin's approach. It has offered one 10p Baldwin share for every two Simpsons, and full acceptance will mean the issue of 2.28m new shares, representing 12 per cent of the capital. A spokesman for the dissident group, led by Mr Robert Klapp, former chairman of Select Appointments, claimed the offer would represent a considerable loss for investors who paid 50p per share in Simpsons' Pounds 2m float last year. Simpson's shares closed at 33p. The board was wrong to accept when other bidders, including a leading brewery, were also interested in Simpsons, the spokesman added. Mr Ackerman dismissed the dissident claims and said they presented no threat to Baldwin's offer. In a separate development, Mr Singh confirmed Baldwin would also buy Leading Guides, the publishing company owned by Mr Ackerman. The company, which publishes Egon Ronay guides, was formed earlier this year after Alfresco Leisure publications, of which Mr Ackerman was also chairman, went into receivership. Mr Singh said Baldwin would be paying up to Pounds 1 a share for Leading Guides.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Lessons of the currency turmoil: What can be learned from Black Wednesday EUROPEAN government officials and central bankers have emerged wiser, and above all humbler, from a series of investigations into last autumn's European currency crises. Since September, sterling and the Italian lira have left the exchange rate mechanism, while the Spanish, Portuguese and Irish currencies have been devalued. 'We should have had the foresight to encapsulate all the five months of realignments into one weekend. 'We must never let this happen again,' says Mr Wim Duisenberg, president of the Netherlands central bank. Despite the pressures on the peseta before Spain's June 6 election, the ERM has now entered a calmer phase - thanks principally to France's success in maintaining the franc's D-Mark parity. Yet Europe is also now much more sober in assessing the chances of progress towards the Maastricht goal of economic and monetary union. 'The events of September 1992 brought the ERM on to a more realistic basis,' says a senior German central banker. And Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's directorate member responsible for economics, believes economic divergences within the EC have made it 'hardly conceivable' that Emu could take place by 1997, the earliest date laid down by the Maastricht treaty. A landmark in the post mortem comes today when monetary experts from the G10 largest industrial countries hand to finance ministers in Washington a report into the crisis. The study group comprises a team from the Group of 10 countries (the US, Japan, Canada and the larger EC members). The report concludes - as did two separate but related inquiries already mounted by the EC - that no significant ERM reforms are needed. Underlining the general mood, Mr Alfons Verplaetse, governor of the Belgian National Bank, says: 'We can stick with the existing rules.' The report shows why central banks last autumn were unable to withstand large currency shifts set off by investors' belief that ERM parities had become un - realistic. Huge amounts of worldwide savings are traded on the Dollars 880bn (Pounds 507bn) a day international foreign exchange market. One central banker says an estimated Dollars 200bn to Dollars 300bn in international investments last autumn were held in higher-yielding weaker currencies which came under attack. This led to 'gigantic shifts' as the likelihood of ERM devaluations grew, he says. The report's analysis of the volume of funds on the move provides one reason for Bundesbank calls for curbs on obligatory ERM intervention to support weak ERM currencies. The report does not, however, go into detail into a series of additional problems in running the ERM which contributed to last autumn's upsets. Among the factors behind the exchange rate upheavals, the Bundesbank's high interest rate policies have attracted a large portion of blame. One of the more outspoken critics is Mr Luis Angel Rojo, Bank of Spain governor. He says: 'What is unstable is not the system itself but the economic conditions surrounding the system, as shown by the conjunction of high German interest rates and recessionary conditions in much of Europe.' In a bid to deflect such charges, the Bundesbank has been pointing towards other ERM countries' failure to make timely ERM currency adjustments before last September. Lack of realignments after January 1987, it says, led to currency rates becoming out of line with realities - building up pressures which overwhelmed the system. The misunderstandings between ERM members in September 1992 have already been well documented. What has not, however, come to the surface is that the Bundesbank tried, in a series of confidential discussions in spring 1990, to launch a broad ERM realignment - but received a general rebuff. High level talks were held with the Bank of Italy as well as with the French and Netherlands authorities. The Bundesbank again made informal soundings about a realignment in 1991, although it never sought a formal application through the German government, to change parities. The Bundesbank's lack of persistence partly reflected the D-Mark's sporadic weakness in 1990 and 1991. But it also highlighted the German authorities' desire to avoid a confrontation with France, which opposed a franc devaluation. One Bank of Italy official comments that Germany acted as if it was still 'a political dwarf.' He adds: 'If France says 'No' (to a realignment), there is no way that the Germans are going to make their voice heard.' In exploring the lessons of last September's unrest, some officials' attention has turned to the abstruse subject of Article 109j in the Maastricht treaty. As a precondition for membership of Emu, this lays down that ERM members should keep their parities unchanged for two years before irrevocable fixing of exchange rates. The 'two-year rule' would not start to apply until 1995 - at the earliest two years ahead of the earliest date for Emu of January 1997. But Italy, in particular, blames the rule for creating an extra hurdle hindering countries from making timely adjust ments. Prof Luigi Spaventa, a former adviser to the Italian treasury, who was named on Wednesday as budget minister in the new interim Rome government, says the 'no-realignment' rule is 'dangerous.' Mr Cees Maas, former treasurer-general at the Netherlands finance ministry, who played an important role in the negotiation of the Maastricht treaty, says now that if he had to renegotiate the treaty, he would prefer not to have the non-realignment rule. Mr Maas, now a board member of the Dutch ING financial services group, says he did not realise that the clause would lead to undue 'politicisation' of the question of realignments. Mr Maas' views are not shared by present Dutch finance ministry officials in charge of international monetary affairs. But his point is nonetheless a telling one. Unless the 'no realignment' rule is changed, Mr Maas says, the ERM is again likely to enter a phase of excessive rigidity from 1995 onwards  -and the mistakes of the last few years could be repeated.                             *      *      * We can stick with the ERM rules - Belgian National Bank governor We should have put five months of realignments into one weekend.

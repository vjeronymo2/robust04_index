			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Observer: Tamed As if tiptoeing between a pair of hungry lions, most foreign dignitaries arriving in Jerusalem say nothing apt to provoke either Israelis or Palestinians. But Kyrgyzstan's president Askar Akayev is clearly no such pussyfooter. Warmly welcomed by Israel's president Chaim Herzog as the first visiting head of state from the former Soviet Union's mainly Moslem central Asian republics, he proclaimed: 'I pray to Almighty God for the long-awaited independence of the people of Palestine.' Whereupon foreign minister Shimon Peres observed tartly: 'We are going to hold a dialogue with our guest.' Peres clearly has powers of persuasion. Yesterday his ministry triumphantly announced that Kyrgyzstan has agreed to follow Costa Rica and El Salvador in housing its embassy in Jerusalem - hub of of the Arab-Israeli conflict, which few nations recognise as the Israeli capital. Even so, Akayev may well have left one lion purring in Israel at the price of finding the other roaring back home. His Moslem brethren in the Arab world and elsewhere will no doubt now want a dialogue with him in their turn.</p>

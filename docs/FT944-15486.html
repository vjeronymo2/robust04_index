			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Airtours stretches sea-legs in Pounds 35m buy The detour by Airtours into the cruise market, launched in April with the purchase of a Norwegian ship, has taken off faster than the group expected. Yesterday the UK's second biggest holiday company paid Pounds 35m cash for a second ship - almost six months before a single passenger embarks on an Airtours cruise. 'We were surprised by the demand in the market place,' said Mr Hugh Collinson, managing director, adding that potential customers had been disappointed that more than 90 per cent of the cruises on the first ship had already been sold. 'We were keen to get a second ship to take advantage of the pent up demand,' he said. The group's first boat, the Seawing, has room for 800 passengers, and sets sail under the Airtours banner on March 25. Its purchase for Pounds 16m was announced on April 28 at the same time as an Pounds 82m rights issue and the acquisition of SAS Leisure for Pounds 74m. The group said at the time that it had no immediate plans to invest in further cruise ships. The Nordic Prince, bought yesterday from Royal Caribbean Cruises, can take more than 1,200 passengers. Airtours takes delivery at the beginning of next year, but is leasing the ship back to Royal Caribbean until March 15. Mr Collinson said the ship would then undergo a minor refit - mainly of furnishings - and start operations for Airtours on May 6 from Palma in the Mediterranean. Airtours is using its existing marketing and reservation systems for its cruise holidays, which can be combined with stays ashore. Mr Collinson said summer prices for a flight and an inside cabin ranged from Pounds 399 to Pounds 549 per person a week, which he claimed was Pounds 300 below competitors' prices. April's rights issue price was 390p. Yesterday the shares edged ahead 3p to 455p.</p>

			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / 4-year high in core jobless THE number of long-term unemployed, those out of work for more than a year, rose 64,000 in the quarter to July to 905,000, the highest level since July 1988. The government, however, said it saw 'grounds for cautious optimism' because the rate of increase was slower than in the previous two quarters. It also pointed out that the total was 452,000 lower than the peak in April 1986. The long-term unemployed now form one third of the total unemployed, with the largest percentage increases in long-term unemployment in the south-east, south-west and East Anglia. In the south-east excluding London the figure has risen 276 per cent since July 1990, and in Greater London it has risen 139 per cent. The number of very long-term unemployed  - those without jobs for more than five years  - continues to fall and is at its lowest level since October 1984. Among those aged 18 to 24, long-term unemployment is up by 16,500 to 184,700  - the highest level since January 1988  - but it remains about half of what it was at its peak in January 1985. Ministers also say that the UK unemployment rate for under 25s, at 17 per cent, is below the EC average of 18.4 per cent. In the light of the figures the Labour party and unemployment pressure groups warned the government not to pursue the idea, rumoured to be under discussion in Whitehall, of cutting unemployment benefit from one year to six months. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, said that such a move would now hurt 586,000 people. He also urged Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, to resist cuts in training budgets. 'When she meets the Treasury, instead of offering them cuts in training she should remind them that every person unemployed for a year costs the taxpayer Pounds 9,000,' said Mr Dobson. 'She should remind them that if it wasn't for the Pounds 24bn price that the taxpayer is having to pay for unemployment they'd need no cuts at all this autumn.' The Unemployment Unit, the pressure group, said that the government was preparing to 'abandon' the long-term unemployed.</p>

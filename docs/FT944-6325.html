			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Challenge for German students Sir, Michael Lindemann's analysis of the German higher educational system presents perfectly the government's arguments for reform (Survey of Germany: 'Expensive learning curve', November 21). To complete the picture I would add a students' point of view. Many German students have to work to finance their studies (and most of the German students have to find accommodation in the private sector, which is much more expensive than a place in a hall of residence which is guaranteed the English students). They also have to study under conditions which are quite different from English universities - overcrowded lectures and tutorials, with an average number of 50 students per tutorial instead of six as is usual at English universities. As long as students have to cope with these conditions it is no wonder that it takes them an average of seven years to finish their degrees. Tests after two terms and fines would not change the situation. On the contrary, students would have to work more to pay the fines. That said, the quality of a German graduate is not comparable to the English graduate. If you have finished your studies in Germany you are in many cases on a level with a postgraduate English student.

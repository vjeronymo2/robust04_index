Their theme: the fourth General Program for Research and  Technology for the European Union. There are not only  difficulties in agreeing on content and financing. Now the  European Parliament is also headed on a confrontation course and  has called for an additional increase in money for research.    "We realize that we are on a confrontation course with our  demands," Rolf Linkohr, the European parliamentarian, conceded,  "but we cannot permit research in Europe to continue losing in  importance." At Linkohr's suggestion, on the 18th of November  the European Parliament called for 13.7 billion ECU (1 ECU =  1.92 German marks) for the fourth General Program for Research  and Technology starting in 1994, 600 million ECU more than  planned.    Next Monday in Brussels the European ministers of research  and technology will attempt to find an answer to this demand.  But they already failed at their last meeting in mid-October to  come to an agreement either on the content or the financing of  this fourth General Program for Research and Technology for the  European Union (EU). Nor is their success on Monday in any way a  sure thing. "The chances," according to a colleague of Federal  Minister for Research and Technology Paul Krueger, "are  fifty-fifty."    Three different ideas must be reconciled in the formulation  of the fourth General Program for Research and Technology:        -  The European Commission has requested 13.1 billion ECU  calculated for the research and technology program from 1994 to  1998. The largest blocks go to information and communications  technologies (I&amp;C - 3,900 million ECU), industrial  technologies  (1,800 million ECU), life sciences (1,325 million ECU), energy  technology (1,050 million ECU), fusion research (980 million  ECU), and environmental research (970 million ECU).    -  The European Parliament had originally agreed to this  proposal  but then on the 18th of November demanded another 600 million  ECU. Of this, 400 million ECU should be added to research on  non-nuclear energy carriers. In addition, the industrial  technologies were supposed to go up by 300 million ECU and  I&amp;C  technologies go down by 300 million ECU. Finally, the funds for  the "socially oriented research" recently included in the fourth  General Program for Research and Technology are also supposed to  be increased from the previous 125 million ECU to 225 million.    -  The European ministers for research and technology  responsible  for the financing of this general program have until now  approved neither of the Commission's or the Parliament's ideas  on content nor financing. Even among themselves they are still  far from agreeing on the content and financing (see VDI-N 22/93,  p. 3.).       That is why this coming Monday the ministers for research  and  technology will try above all to determine the amount of the  total budget. While the majority of the EU countries either  agree with the Commission's proposal of 13.1 billion ECU or even  call for more, Krueger considers this proposal overspending.  With his colleagues in the Cabinet and the Minister of Finance  Theo Waigel in tow, he will therefore try to keep the budget  down to under 13 billion ECU. He has the influence to do it.  After all, Bonn finances the Brussels budget and thus the fourth  General Program for Research and Technology as well to a good  30%.    However, Krueger can currently count only on the British for  support with his demands. They had already indicated in October  that they did not want to go over 11 billion ECU. Krueger and  his British colleagues cannot not be outvoted--unanimity is a  requirement for passing the program.    For tactical reasons, according to the Brussels research  manager, the Council of Ministers may remain with its budget  proposal well under the 13.1 billion ECU proposed by the  Commission. That gives the ministers the necessary playing room  in the poker game with the Parliament, since it has the final  say in approval of the program.    EU parliamentarians like Linkohr are, however, not counting  on the Parliament being able to push through its demands for  another 600 million ECU. "But," as Linkohr says, "we won't  consider anything less than 13.1 billion ECU."</p>

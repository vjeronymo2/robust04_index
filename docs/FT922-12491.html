			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Letter: In a changing world, the value of an MBA is rising not falling Sir, Your supplement on management education (April 10) continues to perpetuate some myths about the role of an MBA which are commonly expressed in media coverage of business education. MBAs, so the story goes, are past their sell-by date. There are too many of them and only a few of the existing programmes are likely to flourish. This error is partly based upon a perception of the MBA programme as a finishing school for the super-privileged; an initiation rite for the future captains of global industry - but only for the multilingual and rich elite. Fortunately, the truth is quite different. The MBA is essentially a 'career adjuster' for a wide range of those who want to diversify, up-grade or shift direction. As such, far from having peaked in importance, the MBA will become an increasingly essential part of a dynamic and flexible economy. Who is going to convert the forces officer into a personnel manager, the banker into a consultant, the engineer into a finance director, the equity trader into a fund manager? MBA courses have done, and continue to do this and more. The structure of MBA courses, accordingly, has to offer a range of basic skills which all modern business requires, plus the facility for advanced training in specialist areas which create immediate employability. The generalist may be admired, but is he really what the market needs? Which firm would invest in a machine that could do a little bit of everything? The fact that companies are increasingly buying in purpose-built training courses in no way diminishes the value of an MBA. On the contrary, in a rapidly changing world the value of training of all kinds is rising, not falling. Losers will be those unprepared for change. MBAs are the least likely to fall into this class. Management journalists might even benefit from an MBA] They would, at least, not write about them in such condescending tones.

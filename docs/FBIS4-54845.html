			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Croatian Defense Minister Gojko Susak by </F> Stipe Pudja; place and date not given: "I Was Prepared To Resign  Because of Duboki Jarak!"]    [Text] Gojko Susak, defense minister of the Republic of  Croatia, is the only Croatian minister who has been a member of  all five Croatian governments so far. Although he enjoys the  support and is respected by his ministry as well as by the  Croatian Army, Minister Susak, together with President Tudjman,  was one of the most criticized men of the Croatian state  leadership by the opposition. We talked to Minister Susak about  that as well as about the latest withdrawals from the HDZ  [Croatian Democratic Community] of the President of the Chamber  of Representatives Stipe Mesic and the President of the Chamber  of Counties Josip Manolic.    At the beginning of the interview, we asked him about the  latest events in the ruling party, and Minister Susak, who is  also the vice president of the HDZ, said:    [Susak] I personally think the present process in the party  is extremely positive. In the evolution of the Croatian state,  we entered the political scene as a movement which, in due  course, must grow into a party whose views and guidelines were  publicly and clearly set by President Tudjman at the Second  General Assembly of the HDZ. We voted and agreed to ratify the  party program and people who will implement it. Such phenomena  are normal in all parties in the world, not to mention our  process of transformation from a movement into a party. I do  not see it as a rift, nor as a cause for panic in the party. I  think, and so do most HDZ members, that, after they [Mesic and  Manolic] leave, the membership of the HDZ will be even stronger.  Therefore, I believe this will prompt a large number of people  of quality to join the HDZ.    [Pudja] Leaving the HDZ, Mr. Manolic and Mr. Mesic were very  critical of your work at the Ministry of Defense. What do you  think about that and is this constructive criticism?    [Susak] In the past year, and it will probably be so for a  while, the Defense Ministry has been one of the most important  departments, but also one of the most controversial ones, owing  to the global political and military situation of the Republic  of Croatia. And it is only natural that both the Defense  Ministry and myself are subject to criticism regardless of  whether it is well-founded or not. Criticism is always welcome.  The fact is that we are now in the position that every citizen,  regardless of his or her function, can voice his or her opinion.  We advocated that right and our army fought to preserve our  territory and such a system. However, criticism is also subject  to analysis. Those who criticize the Ministry of Defense and  especially myself as the key man of the Ministry, must  substantiate their accusations with some proof. I am willing to  face the Croatian public, let them analyze the situation if they  want, even with the help independent experts, from the moment I  took office at the Ministry to the present. That does not  justify my mistakes, if there were any, and I must have made  some, as I am only human. However, I am willing to face the  judgment of the public and of experts and let them evaluate my  work and results. Let me remind you that, recently, during a  session of the parliament, there was an attempt to call for a  vote of no confidence in me. I think that voting for a vote of  confidence or no confidence in me in the parliament in free and  independent Croatia would be the most exhilarating moment. That  would be the system I fought for and I would be honored,  regardless of the outcome of voting. I will use this  opportunity to ask my party to agree to that.  <H5>  Former Intelligence Services </H5>   [Pudja] You have not quite answered my question. Do you  know why Manolic, in addition to referring to President Tudjman,  most often refers to you personally? Is there, perhaps,  something we do not know?    [Susak] Yes, but in Mr. Manolic's frame of mind, which is  probably the result of his life-long orientation and experience,  which does not correspond to Croatian views and the road Croatia  was supposed to take. He chose his own path and the Croatian  public will have their say about that and decide whether his way  is better than what I advocate. After all, there will be more  elections and we will see the judgment of the Croatian nation.    [Pudja] Could you comment on the fact that some people  from the ruling party are founding a new party? As those men  are the presidents of the two chambers of the parliament, could  this result in a parliamentary crisis and malfunctioning of the  state?    [Susak] Our party itself could not have chosen a better  moment for such an event. The HDZ has not for a single moment,  in the past four years of its existence, been in a better  position to solve such problems. The international and domestic  situation in Croatia has never been safer or more stable. The  fact that their timing is bad points to their political naivete.  If their plan was to provoke and destabilize the system and  disrupt the functioning of the state, my opinion is that they  could not have chosen a worse moment. But that is their choice  and we will accept the challenge. We will not deal with them  the way they dealt with their enemies while they had power in  the former regime. From the beginning, we advocated a Croatia  whose every citizen will be able to air his or her views,  whatever they may be.    [Pudja] At the meeting in Dubrovnik, you also brought up  three of Manolic's followers -- Boljkovac, Karic, and Degoricija  -- as they were members of former intelligence services and you  said the HDZ would get stronger after they leave.    [Susak] Regarding the said gentlemen, we know they come from  similar structures and have similar views. At the beginning,  the HDZ was organized as a movement comprising all kinds of  views and structures. I think they were the only structure that  was connected by the fact that they all, at one point, worked  for former intelligence services, regardless of what they were  called, from 1945 to the free general elections. They all have  that in common, from those leaders who chose to leave to those  who will follow them. I do not want to speculate about that, but  there is a possibility that they will resort to some kind of  blackmail or something else. Regardless of what we may think,  Manolic was one of the most responsible officials in our time,  as well. If the system of a law-ordered state failed at the  Ministry of Defense or some other ministry, why did he not react  then? That is odd. He had the opportunity to call us to  account for what happened and he could even dismiss us. I find  it odd that he chose to do that now. That should tell us much  about his intentions. As for their holding us accountable, I  would like to see both Manolic and Mesic present concrete  examples and substantiate their accusations.    [Pudja] Manolic's group also blames the Croatian leadership  and you personally for the conflict between the Croats and the  Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Susak] I think that what Manolic reproaches us for is the  least important factor in the conflict between the Croats and  the Muslims. If he had cared about interests of the Croats in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, he would have taken concrete steps in the  past three to four years and done something himself, both  publicly and secretly. There had to be much secret work in order  to organize the local Croat population and defend the territory  where they live. I think the fact of the matter is something  completely different. They say we are to blame, that those  conflicts were caused by Croatian state politics, but my only  reply is that the Croatian state leadership and the leaders of  the HDZ -- and I am one of them -- have been consistent in  implementing our policies toward Bosnia-Herzegovina, from the  moment Bosnia-Herzegovina was recognized to the referendum and  acceptance of all proposals of the international community. The  Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats and their leadership were the only one  of the three nations to have accepted all proposals of the  international community in order to establish peace. We could  not have implemented that on our own, for it takes at least two  sides to reach an agreement. The conflict between the Croats  and the Muslims, which unfortunately broke out, was not in the  interest of Croatia, nor in the interest of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats. It was against our interests and  that is why Croatia cannot be blamed. That does not justify  mistakes that happened on lower levels among the Croats in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, our policies have been consistent  from day one and we are prepared to render an account of our  implementation of such policies.   <H5>    The Example of Konjic </H5>   [Pudja] You also said that the first shipment of weapons  from  Croatia went to Foca.    [Susak] Yes. The first shipment did go to Foca thanks to a  local Muslim representative. Unfortunately, they lost Foca, not  because they had no desire to defend it, but because they did  not receive support from where they were supposed to get it.  That does not mean that, given that support, they could have  defended it, but during the most critical moments, the Bosnian  leadership did not realize how serious the situation was. I do  not mean this as a criticism, we all made mistakes, but this is  a fragment that must also be considered in analyzing the events  of the past two and a half years. One cannot blame the policies  of one side or the other for the conflict between the Croats and  the Muslims. As a result of the Serb aggression, several  thousand refugees were forced into a small area where it was  impossible to live and that is why there were misunderstandings.  Very often the official Bosnia-Herzegovina leadership failed in  the most crucial moments. Afterwards, they tried, and are still  trying, to make up for that, but that is another matter. That  will not justify the first days when they were not up to the  moment and when we could not find partners in the  Bosnia-Herzegovina leadership to organize a more effective  defense together. Their dilemma was whether to ask the  "Yugoslav Army to defend them from the Chetniks." However, when  that army showed its true colors there as well, it was too late  to do anything efficiently. Unlike their leaders, some Muslim  individuals realized what was the essential problem and came  directly to Zagreb for help. That is why we sent those weapons  to Foca.    [Pudja] The Croats were accused of being responsible for  those conflicts at the Bosnia-Herzegovina assembly in Sarajevo  as well.    [Susak] Those were isolated examples. Prime Minister  Silajdzic said that himself. The Croats cannot be blamed for  that tragic conflict. The Muslims could not have gotten their  first weapons from anywhere else but from Croatia or from the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats against whom they used them. I  repeat, there were mistakes at lower levels and in some  Bosnia-Herzegovina Croat structures. We have documented the  case of Konjic, where the ratio of Croats and Muslims is less  favorable. The first shipment of weapons from Croatia that got  to Konjic was divided equally among the Croats and the Muslims.  The Muslims abused that and seized power in Konjic using  weapons they got from the Croats. The cases of Bugojno,  Travnik, and other towns are well-documented too. In a  nutshell, the enemy of the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina was far  too recognizable and powerful for the Croats to reach for  another enemy.  <H5>  Investigation Into Sesvete </H5>   [Pudja] Your political opponents also say you are  responsible for the explosion in Duboki Jarak [a suburb of  Zagreb]. They think you should be held accountable as the  defense minister.    [Susak] The defense minister would, in normal procedures and  conditions, have to be responsible for what happened in Duboki  Jarak. However, there has been much misinformation in the  public and two items are very important. Firstly, at the time  of the accident I was away on business in Mostar. I was  informed about the accident at about 1430 and I reported to the  supreme commander and the president of the Republic at about  1900. Newspapers say I came one day later, which is not true.  I will not reveal what the president and I talked about. I was  prepared to resign. In normal circumstances, I take the  political responsibility regardless of the facts. However,  President Tudjman, who appointed me defense minister, thought I  should not resign. It is common knowledge that a defense  minister does not hand in his resignation to the parliament, but  to President Tudjman, and it is up to the parliament to analyze  all the events and form their opinion about me in a regular  procedure.    [Pudja] With regard to what happened in Sesvete, you  personally suggested to bring in commissions from abroad.    [Susak] It would be irresponsible of me if I did not get  several opinions about the explosion. At the meeting with  President Tudjman, in addition to the commission of the Defense  Ministry which was appointed by the president personally, I  requested to send for another independent commission from  abroad. At the same time, we filed a request with NATO and  France. The French contacted us first and we accepted their  commission. NATO, which contacted us later, offered to send a  group that would help us destroy leftover bombs which did not  explode, and we accepted. Those commissions will soon submit  their reports to appropriate organs, which will then decide  about who is responsible for the explosion.    [Pudja] Can you, perhaps, tell us when will those reports be  made public?    [Susak] I think the commissions will finish their job within  the next two weeks. First results could be expected even  sooner. All things considered, the results will be presented to  the public and for discussion in the parliament in the next two  weeks. There is no way I can influence the work of those  commissions and their results. You know that the Ministry of  Justice appointed a judge who gives entrance and exit  permissions to all commissions.    [Pudja] Are there any indications as to the cause of the  explosion?    [Susak] I would not like to speculate about that at this  point. It would not be good for the work of the commissions.  Journalists and analysts can afford to speculate, but a defense  minister cannot.  <H5>  Spegelj's Slander </H5>   [Pudja] In spite of various expectations about the  respectability of the Croatian Army and about the situation  regarding the military industry of Croatia, you were the one who  spoke about that the least.    [Susak] You are here to ask questions, and I am here to  answer them. I would not like to discuss the respectability of  the Croatian Army at present. That is up to military experts to  say. In public, we hear both views. However, the most  surprising thing is that former defense minister and commander  of the Supreme Headquarters General Spegelj says that the  Defense Ministry and Supreme Headquarters are mostly composed of  people who are not trained for their jobs. I do not know to  whom he refers, perhaps General Bobetko or somebody else.  Professional skill is assessed by means of comparison. I, as  the defense minister, can be reproached for not being a soldier.  I think this ministry is just like any other ministry. My role  is to find the best possible personnel and means in order to  make the system work. I think it is in the interest of Croatia  that a civilian, regardless of who it may be, be at the head of  the Defense Ministry, for we do not want Croatia to be a  military state, but a democratic country. The Army is just one  of the factors which protects and establishes the system of the  state. Whether, in the past two and a half years, I justified  the confidence of the president of the Republic and of the prime  ministers, that is up to them and to the Croatian people to  deduce on the basis of unbiased analyses. They should look into  the state of the Croatian Army when I took office, into  circumstances regarding the acquisition of its equipment, into  the state of Croatian military industry, and compare the  responsibility of the Croatian Army then and at present. Let me  remind you, when I became defense minister, an arms embargo was  already imposed on Croatia.    [Pudja] People think that the Croatian Army can regain the  remaining part of the occupied territory of Croatia. So far, we  have been trying to regain that territory and include it in the  system of Croatia in a peaceful manner. Will that be the case  from now on as well?    [Susak] According to estimates and reports of not only those  who are in charge of that in our ministry, but also of other  reports, the Croatian Army can liberate the entire Croatian  territory, by force if necessary. But I would like to repeat  what our president said: The first task of our state politics  is to reach our goal with minimum casualties. However, if we  are forced to resort to force, if there is no way out, we are  prepared to do that and liberate our territory.   <H5>    [Box, p 6] </H5> <H5>  Accusation </H5>   [Susak] Manolic's statement that I stepped in and arranged  the release of a certain colonel of the Information and Security  Service, and that he was smuggling drugs, is an accusation that  deserves to go to court. Both the Justice Ministry and the  Ministry of Interior and their ministers have publicly denied  those accusations. If I were doing something else and if I had  the time, I would immediately begin legal action against Joza  Manolic.  <H5>  [Box, p 7] </H5> <H5>  Emigration and the Croatian Independent Democrats </H5>   [Susak] The Croatian Independent Democrats would like to  spread some information about emigration and the names of people  who allegedly want to join their party. I think the emigration  will commit themselves on that. Manolic and Mesic have only a  handful of emigrants' names -- I say names, for those are  obviously not people. As to the question why there are so many  emigrants, that should be answered by Mr. Manolic, who had a  very important function at the time when a large number of  Croats were forced to leave their homes.  <H5>  [Box, p 7] </H5> <H5>  Christian Morality </H5>   [Susak] We, members of the HDZ, do not advocate a  clericalist party, as Mr. Duka and Mr. Juric say; rather, we  advocate what every party of that orientation in Western  democracy wants -- to build the state on Christian morality. On  the basis of that and as a national party we want -- as long as  we enjoy the confidence of the Croatian nation -- to create the  Croatian state.  <H5>  [Box, p 7] </H5> <H5>  Care </H5>   [Susak] Caring for disabled veterans and families of  soldiers  who died defending our country is the duty of the entire  Croatian state. At the latest session of the government, I  proposed that a session be dedicated exclusively to problems of  wounded soldiers and families of dead soldiers, and the proposal  was unanimously accepted. Within our means, the Defense  Ministry will make a concrete step toward solving at least those  initial problems with accommodation. I will propose that housing  funds be established in every county and that loans be provided  for those who could solve their housing problems. I think that,  if we continue with our present budget policy and with this  government, we will be able to solve that part of the problem.</p>

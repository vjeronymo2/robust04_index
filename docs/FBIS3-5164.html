The Central Jakarta District Court found the  30-year-old Nuku guilty of producing and distributing stickers  insulting to President Suharto. The sentence was less than the  maximum allowed by law and sought by government prosecutors.  Nuku faced the sentencing alone since his lawyers have boycotted  the trial in protest over the court's refusal ta allow them to  call witnesses to testify on Nuku's behalf.    For his part, Nuku remained silent throughout as he  continued  his silent protest which began two sessions earlier, also over  the court's refusal to hear the testimony of his witnesses.    Nuku, who chairs the Pijar Foundation human rights group,  was  arrested during a demonstration at the House of Representatives  last November. Police claimed he was distributing stickers  offensive to the president.    "This court finds Nuku Soleiman guilty of all charges and  sentences him to four years in prison," said Presiding Judge  Nurhayati. The panel of judges said they could find only one  mitigating factor when passing the sentence, Nuku's relative  youth. They cited several factors that worked against him,  including the lack of respect he showed the court during the  trial, two previous convictions, and no evidence of remorse.  They also deplored the harsh language employed by Nuku during  the trial.    The judges later asked Nuku whether or not he would appeal  the sentence. The defendant, still maintaining his silence,  walked up to the judges and presented a written statement which  his close friends confirmed as a note claiming that he will  appeal.    The courtroom was packed with the defendant's supporters,  mostly clad in the green jacket of the National University,  Nuku's almamater. They yelled at the judges and challenged them  to pass a heavier sentence. Also present in the public gallery  were opposition figures, including Ali Sadikin and Chris Siner  Key Timu. Adnan Buyung Nasution, chairman of the Legal Aid  Foundation, which organized Nuku's defense, was also present.    As Nuku was being escorted out of the courtroom, his  supporters yelled encouragement and sang the patriotic song  Padamu Negeri (For You the Nation).    Buyung later termed the verdict a tragedy for the nation  because punishment was meted out to someone who merely acted out  his constitutional right. "This shows that free impartial  movement is no longer guaranteed, he said. He said that courts  of law in Indonesia are controlled by the government and that  judges could not be impartial when presiding over politically  sensitive cases such as Nuku's. "Under such a suppressive  atmosphere, it's difficult to find an idealistic judge. The  judges had taken their stand against the defendant from the very  beginning," he said. Buyung labeled this trial worse than the  mid-1980s political trial of dissident leader Lt. Gen. (retired)  H.R. Dharsono whom he helped defend.    Nuku's friends later distributed to reporters a five-page  typed statement he crafted while in detention, which said he had  made no attempt to defend himself because he did not believe in  the impartiality of the court. "A strong and powerful force from  outside the court has arranged the trial and the verdict has  been rendered long before the trial began," said Nuku in the  statement.</p>

			<p>Algiers   Port   <F P=102> 94AF0123A Algiers EL WATAN in French 23 Feb 94 p 4 </F> <F P=103> 94AF0123A </F> <F P=104>  Algiers EL WATAN </F> <F P=105>  French </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article signed K.D.: "Port of Algiers: Unbearably </F> Congested"--first paragraph is EL WATAN introduction]    [Text] The authorities heard the alarm signal set off some  time ago, concerning the congestion of the Algiers quays. The  prime minister, accompanied by the transport minister, made a  point of inspecting the port of Algiers in person, during a  surprise visit yesterday.    During his tour, Mr. Redha Malek was informed by EPAL  [Algiers port authority] officials of the degree of completion  of the container terminal construction project, of the port  development strategy and, of course, of the considerable delays  in unloading and delivering goods.    At present, 140,000 tons of goods are stored on the quays  and  in the hangars, waiting for their owners to come and get them.  This excessive use of storage areas, therefore, considerably  hampers the port traffic, even though all maritime activities  are directly affected by the recession.    For instance, 30,000 tons of lumber and iron, most of which  were imported by Metalsider, Cosider and Enab, are awaiting  delivery.    In addition, 3,800 containers containing household  appliances, agricultural, chemical, and food products, and  vehicles are awaiting an improbable delivery.    This situation is due to the dilapidated state of the  handling and processing facilities. The port of Algiers has  about 80 cranes, much more than half of which are broken down.    Forklifts are not doing any better; most of them do not  work.  The congestion at the port is also due to the small depth of  casting off stations.    Since the port has not been dredged for many years, the  average water depth has decreased from 11 to 6 meters.  High-draft ships must sometimes wait until a dock of suitable  size becomes free.    Actually, ship traffic decreased by 4.63 percent in 1993.  During that year, 473 ships docked at Algiers, compared with 496  the year before.    Paradoxically, the EPAL is doing better, financially, under  these crisis conditions.    Its net results showed a 19.1-percent increase.    But this performance is the result of increases in port  tariffs. In other words, the port authority still must solve a  major problem: that of congestion. The government is expected to  take measures to do just that.</p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL'S OUT, SNOWMEN IN;  </P> <P> WINTER WONDERLAND DAZZLES SANTA CLARITA  </P> <P> Santa Clarita turned a day of cold and snow into an impromptu winter festival  Wednesday, sending children to the slippery slopes and parents to snug  firesides.  </P> <P> As thick, wet snowflakes the size of nickels drifted out of the sky and freeway  ties with the outside world were cut, schools shut down and businesses, shops  and government offices closed.  </P> <P> About six inches of snow fell, the heaviest since a 12-inch storm in 1974,  Sheriff's Deputy Dick Verner said.  </P> <P> The many residents of the Santa Clarita Valley who commute over the Santa  Susana Mountains to jobs in the San Fernando Valley and Los Angeles took the  day off after police closed the snow-slick roads on mountain passes out of the  area. The California Highway Patrol blocked on-ramps and off-ramps to the  Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways Wednesday morning, creating  miles-long backups at major intersections.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Stay Home,' People Told  </P> <P> "We're telling people to stay home and get off the roads and just wait this  thing out," Officer Ralph Elvira said.  </P> <P> And so they did.  </P> <P> Customers with armloads of mittens, boots and winter hats lined up 15 deep at  the Sports Chalet in Newhall.  </P> <P> The store's 400 plastic, saucer-shaped snow-sliding toys were sold out by early  afternoon, store manager Whitney Wilkinson said.  </P> <P> That left only six old-fashioned sleds with runners. At $25, they cost more  than twice what a plastic disk did, but 7-year-old Johnny Schoonvel's father  sprang for one anyway.  </P> <P> "First me and my dad were building snow forts and now we get to go sledding,"  Johnny bubbled.  </P> <P> "Yeah, look at what this says on it," a smiling Barry Schoonvel, 40, said to  his son. "It says 'Speedy.' "  </P> <P> "It's an incredibly festive day," said the elder Schoonvel, who normally  commutes to Chatsworth. "Everyone in the neighborhood is outside, happy to be  off work. We booed the people who tried to go to work."  </P> <P> Los Angeles County pickup trucks fitted with plow blades kept main streets open  throughout the area, at a cost of $8,000 a day to the city, Santa Clarita  officials said.  </P> <P> But by noon traffic was light, except to supermarkets thronged with shoppers  stocking up on food to wait out the storm.  </P> <P> "It seems like everybody had the same idea," said Karen Hall of Newhall, coming  out of a Lucky market with enough food to last several days. "I've met most of  my neighbors here."  </P> <P> Joe Dunham, manager of the store, said there were heavy runs on cognac,  firewood and film, as adults prepared for a night by the fireplace and families  rushed out to photograph each other in the unusual snowfall.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Snowman Built  </P> <P> City workers built a snowman in front of the Santa Clarita City Hall and about  20 of them posed for pictures, women employees standing in slush in open-toed  pumps.  </P> <P> "This is an unusual day and we're doing unusual things," said City Manager  George Caravalho. "We might as well enjoy the snow while it's here."  </P> <P> In the civic center in Valencia, hand-drawn "closed" signs were posted on the  Los Angeles County office building, the library and the municipal courthouse.  </P> <P> That disappointed Bill Read, 41, of Newhall, who showed up with an unpaid  traffic ticket. As long as he couldn't get to work in Thousand Oaks, he said,  "I thought this would be my one opportunity to get this thing paid."  </P> <P> He read the notice on the courthouse door and trudged off, saying, "I guess  I'll just have to rent a video, go home, kick back and relax."  </P> <P> The five school districts in the valley canceled classes for the day, freeing  22,000 students who turned every available slope into a sledding ground and  covered the streets with snowmen and even snow women, built with triangular,  skirt-shaped blocks.  </P> <P> "Every kid is outside soaking wet and freezing but loving every minute of it,"  said Donna Grindey, 49, a Valencia mother.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'No School'  </P> <P> "This is great -- no school and snow fights," proclaimed Adam Wright, 10, of  Valencia as he skidded through the snow on his bicycle. "Look, it really  fishtails."  </P> <P> Officials of the school districts "are all going to wait until Thursday" to  decide whether to keep the schools closed for a second day, said Robert Nolet,  superintendent of the Sulphur Springs School District.  </P> <P> There was concern about the safety of children on school buses, Nolet said, but  the main problem was the large number of school employees cut off by freeway  closures because they live in the San Fernando and Antelope valleys.  </P> <P> The Golden State Freeway was closed Wednesday morning from Lyons Avenue, just  south of Magic Mountain, to Lake Hughes Road in Castaic. Some northbound  traffic later was allowed through under CHP escort. The Antelope Valley Freeway  was closed from Sierra Highway to Palmdale until the afternoon.  </P> <P> "Surprisingly, there have been no big problems yet," said Los Angeles County  Sheriff's Lt. Harvey Cantor. Deputies responded to 15 accidents in the Santa  Clarita Valley.  </P></p>

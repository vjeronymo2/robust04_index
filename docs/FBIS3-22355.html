			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Toxins Washed Into Baltic Sea"] </F>   [Text] Treaties and regulations decree how the wash waters  of ships carrying chemicals as cargo must be treated. Special  inspectors monitor compliance with the stipulations in Finnish  ports and violators can be prosecuted. In practice, ships that  have no concern in this regard, can dump the wash waters from  their cargo space straight into the sea almost without any peril  of being held accountable.    The inspectors do not always, not even nearly always, know  where to search for concealed wash water. In suspicious cases  expert advice is available only during office hours, and the  vessels cannot be detained in port merely on suspicion, as is  the case in Central Europe. If a violator is occassionally  brought to court, the possible fine is insignificant when  compared to the profit gained through the environmental crime.    By neglecting to comply with Baltic Sea protection measures,  violators take over the markets from law abiding suppliers. The  lack of concern by the responsible seafaring and environmental  authorities is incomprehensible, considering how an  exceptionally fragile marine ecosystem is being polluted.    Finland has obligated itself, together with the other Baltic  coastal countries, to prevent and decrease the environmental  pollutant burden on the Baltic Sea. Even the mere improvement in  conveying information between unloading port and loading port  would prevent vessels from matter-of-factly dumping the tank  wash waters on their voyage.</p>

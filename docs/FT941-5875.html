			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / English universities avoid admissions cuts Universities in England will admit more new students this year than they did in 1993 in spite of government plans announced in the Budget to cut the intake by 3.5 per cent. The Treasury and the education department had overestimated the number of students already in the system by 10,000 - equivalent to the student population of a large university, said the Higher Education Funding Council for England. But university vice-chancellors predicted the total number of disappointed place-seekers would increase, as early figures from the Universities and Colleges and Admissions Service suggested a rise of about 10,000 applicants. The funding council yesterday announced the grants it would pay to each university and higher education institution in England for the next academic year. For the first time it has set targets for the maximum number of students in each institution, to help the government's plan of halting university expansion. The council will apply a financial 'cap' so that universities will receive no extra funding for any students they admit above their target figure. This follows several years of expansion which last year saw 'old' universities - excluding former polytechnics - increase their intake by 7 per cent. The Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals described the government's policies as 'stop-go', and said quality was at risk. Among individual institutions, Oxford and Cambridge both fared well from the grant reallocation, with a rise in total grant of 5.8 per cent. Professor Graeme Davies, chief executive of the funding council, said Oxford and Cambridge had benefited from a reassessment of research funding. They also avoided being penalised for over-expansion last year. Less traditionally prestigious universities which also secured funding increases of more than 5 per cent included Coventry, Plymouth, and Portsmouth, all polytechnics until two years ago. The London School of Economics and Political Science was one of nine institutions limited to a below-inflation increase of only one 1 per cent. Last year the LSE announced a plan to charge students an extra fee for tuition, claiming this would be necessary to maintain academic standards. This was eventually voted down by lecturers, but the move indicated that the LSE was unhappy with its level of funding. Some specialist institutions that do not have university status enjoyed spectacular shifts in funding. Lackham College of Agriculture near Chippenham in Wiltshire secured the greatest rise in grant - 55.4 per cent. The University of East Anglia, despite an increase of 3.4 per cent in funding, predicted it would have to cut intake by about 8 per cent compared with last year because the funding council had not taken into account the number of four-year courses it offered. The university would be able to meet its cap on total admissions only by cutting first-year admissions. It said other universities could be affected by the same problem.

			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS LEARN LANGUAGE OF BASEBALL  </P> <P> Some men go to the Soviet Union to establish business relations, others to  enhance diplomatic understanding. But there was Lou Frank detailing the infield  fly rule and why it's illegal to tag up and leave a base before the ball is  caught. He was getting the message across with the help of an interpreter.  </P> <P> The book of baseball rules, especially the complex aspects, can be equated to a  foreign language. It was literally that for Frank when he went to the Soviet  Union to instruct classes in how to be an umpire. For 26 days, he talked,  demonstrated and critiqued the work of the officials.  </P> <P> Although he was there to do the teaching, it became a learning experience for  him, too. Surprisingly, he found the Soviets were acquainted with the  accomplishments of Babe Ruth, Ted Williams, Stan Musial and Lou Gehrig, plus  contemporary players.  </P> <P> "They even knew the major leagues had experienced a lockout because of labor  contract problems and wanted to learn more about it," he said. "There must have  been a million toasts between us. That's the Russian way. They were gracious,  and the hospitality was superb.  </P> <P> "As loyal Americans, we emphasized we loved our country dearly. Then we  mentioned if Russia ever defeated the United States in baseball that it would  have the same feeling we knew when our Olympic ice hockey team defeated theirs  in 1980. Another point we tried to make is that to understand the American mind  you have to understand baseball."  </P> <P> Frank, a retired vice president of the Hecht Co., has been an amateur umpire in  the Baltimore area for 15 years. A nephew, who is an exchange student in the  Soviet Union, is a friend of an American, one Richard Spooner, who is involved  in Soviet baseball. Spooner provided the contact that brought Frank to the  Soviet Union for the purpose of explaining umpiring techniques.  </P> <P> It wasn't necessary to send umpires from organized baseball. Frank's awareness  of the fine points of umpiring so exceeded the limited knowledge of the Soviets  that he was regarded as the second coming of Bill Klem and Jocko Conlan. They  use four umpires for all games, lacking uniforms and standard equipment but  officiating more by committee than individual decisions.  </P> <P> "We kept telling them how they had to be more assertive and to end those  committee meetings," explained Frank. "All the umpires had other jobs but most  of the players were doing it full-time as a profession. They made around 350 to  400 rubles, which translates to around $40 to $50 a month on the exchange rate.  The umpiring has a long way to go, but they are earnest and conscientious and I  believe are going to improve."  </P> <P> Phil Willen and Larry Silverman, two Baltimore businessmen, provided some of  the funds for Frank's trip. He took baseballs as gifts from the Orioles and  reports that the Toronto Blue Jays bought a set of uniforms for one of the  teams. "The players use gloves from Japan and Korea. Most of the balls came  from Cuba and they complained about them. There's only one true baseball field  in all of Russia. That's at Moscow State University and was built by a Japanese  ambassador who loved baseball. It's an artificial turf field, with a wire fence  around it, a press box and locker rooms."  </P> <P> Most of the games, however, are played on soccer fields, which means either  right or left field is abnormally short. They pitch without the benefit of a  mound and the throwing speed is remindful of American batting practice. Often  the balls they use are scuffed from wear and black as a lump of coal.  </P> <P> Games were played in Simferopol and Eypretoria. Frank would observe and make  suggestions as to the positioning of the umpires and how they went about making  the calls. All the players used aluminum bats, and Frank quickly recognized  Soviet baseball is a "hitter's game."  </P> <P> Disputes with umpires would last all of two seconds because it's not in the  Russian nature to argue and the players admitted they didn't know enough about  the rules to offer a challenge in the first place.  </P> <P> But one thing they did do when they were unhappy with a decision was to change  their facial expressions to mirror disgust. So if looks could kill, some  umpires would be stone-cold dead for calling a runner safe at the plate. But  there are no vocal insults exchanged because in the Soviet Union, an umpire is  afforded the same respect as a judge.  </P> <P> Leo Durocher and Earl Weaver would have had to change their ways.  </P></p>

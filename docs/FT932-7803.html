			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: France and nursing homes boost Kunick KUNICK, the leisure group, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.06m for the six months to March 31, a 29 per cent increase on the comparable pro forma profits of Pounds 1.6m. There was a significantly improved performance in France and a turnround in the UK nursing homes, writes Peggy Hollinger. Last year it sold 50 per cent of Goldsborough Holdings, its UK nursing home business to County NatWest Ventures. The results assume that the business had been a 50 per cent associate throughout both periods. Sales were 5 per cent ahead at Pounds 49.3m (Pounds 47m). After preference dividends losses per share were 0.26p (0.43p). Mr Christopher Burnett, chairman, said Goldsborough's performance had encouraged the joint owners to aim for a flotation within the next 12 months.</p>

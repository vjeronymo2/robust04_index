			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Aircraft staff start work-to-rule ABOUT 400 aircraft maintenance staff at Dan Air Engineering have started a work-to-rule and partial overtime ban to force FLS Aerospace, the Danish owner of the company, to improve a 6 per cent pay offer. They expect flights from Manchester, Stansted and Gatwick airports to be disrupted. Dan Air, which is not involved, sold its maintenance business to FLS last year. Employees say they have not had a pay rise for more than two years. Meanwhile, FLS has since acquired FFV, another maintenance company, staff of which are higher-paid. MSF, the management, science and finance union, says some FFV employees earn up to 20 per cent more than Dan Air Engineering counterparts. The union may recommend acceptance of 8 per cent this year if movement is promised towards parity between the two sets of workers.</p>

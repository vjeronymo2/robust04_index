			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Protest vigils are being held this evening at  dozens of junctions throughout the country under the slogan:  The people are united on the Golan. Our correspondent Nitzan  Hen reports that several dozen settlers demonstrated this  afternoon opposite the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, calling on the  U.S. Administration to stop pressuring Israel. The  demonstrators drove in a slow motorcade on Hayarqon Street, and  chanted slogans denouncing Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin's  remarks that the settlers may live under Syrian rule in the  framework of a peace agreement. We will never agree to live  under foreign sovereignty, the settlers said, calling on Rabin  to fire Beilin at once.    Another protest was held outside Rabin's residence in  Jerusalem. Students demonstrated against a withdrawal from the  Golan, demanding that the government call an election before  making any territorial concession on the Golan.    There is nothing new in al-Asad's remarks -- this was the  reaction of the Golan settlers to the announcements by Clinton  and al-Asad in Geneva. The settlers staged demonstrations today  and blocked the main road to the Golan Heights. [passage  omitted]    Dozens of kibbutz members in the Jordan Valley held a  demonstration at the Tzemah junction, one of 60 demonstrations  taking place tonight at junctions throughout the country in  support of the Golan settlers.

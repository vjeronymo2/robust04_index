			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Shia rebels halt attacks SYRIA and Iran yesterday appeared to have persuaded Shia Moslem Hizbollah guerrillas to stop firing Katyusha rockets from southern Lebanon, ending three days of bomb, artillery, sea and air attacks that killed 13 Lebanese and Israelis, writes Lara Marlowe in Beirut. After shifting a mechanised battalion to the Lebanese-Israeli border on Tuesday night, the Israelis said they would take no further action unless Hizbollah attacked them again. No Katyusha rockets have been fired since Tuesday, when Syria convoked the 'security committee' established under Syrian and Iranian patronage in 1990 to end the war between Hizbollah and Amal, the rival Shia Moslem militia.</p>

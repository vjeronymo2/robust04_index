			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Italians retain Brussels hopes Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, yesterday kept alive Italy's hopes of winning 'an important economic portfolio' in the next European Commission. After meeting Mr Jacques Santer, president-elect of the Commission, Mr Berlusconi said they had agreed to postpone a formal decision on Italy's two Commission nominations until it was clear which portfolios would be available. That means waiting until after the Danish election on September 21, which should decide whether Mr Henning Christophersen of Denmark is going to stay on as commissioner responsible for macro-economic policy. If not, Italy will lobby hard to replace him with Prof Mario Monti, an economist and head of Milan's Bocconi University. The second Italian candidate for the Commission is likely to be Mr Enrico Vinci, secretary-general of the European parliament although Mr Berlusconi refused to confirm the names under consideration. One potential Italian commissioner, Mr Renato Ruggiero, a former trade minister, now seems certain to become the EU's candidate for head of the World Trade Organisation, the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, following an informal meeting of EU foreign ministers at the weekend.</p>

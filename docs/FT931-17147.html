			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Major sees clear UK recovery this year MR JOHN MAJOR predicted yesterday that 1993 would bring clear economic recovery in the UK and could mark the start of a 'virtuous cycle' of sustainable growth and prosperity. The prime minister promised that the government would seek a closer relationship with industry and commerce, and raised the prospect of a revival in areas of the UK's manufacturing base. Interviewed on BBC radio's The World at One, Mr Major admitted that 1992 had been a miserable year for many people. Fear of unemployment was one of the brakes on restoring confidence - the task for 1993 was to bring hope to people who had lost their jobs. Comparing the current position with the beginning of the 1980s, Mr Major held out the prospect of a number of years with steady and sustainable growth. Progress had been made in laying the foundation for recovery, he said, putting particular stress on the low inflation level. He looked to the expansion of small and medium-sized businesses to create jobs, as they had done in the early 1980s. He said 400,000 businesses had been started even in the difficult circumstances of last year. Mr Major promised further promotion of vocational qualifications, and forecast a broadening of the UK's industrial base. 'There are areas of manufacturing where I think we can begin to re-enter manufacturing . . . and that is not just a question of investment, it is partly a question of attitude.' His positive tone is part of a continuing move by the government to re-emphasise the importance of manufacturing. Earlier this week, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said the UK's manufacturing performance should be 'a source of confidence and pride'. It follows a signal last month that the Budget would focus on measures to underpin industrial investment, and offer particular help to small businesses and exporters which have suffered in the recession. Downing Street said the European single market and the completion of the agreement on international trade meant that the coming months would be a time of great challenges for business, and that Mr Major wanted the government to try to ensure that British industry did not miss out on the opportunities. Mr Major spelt out his continued support for Mr Lamont as chancellor, despite sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism. That had resulted from events beyond the chancellor's control, Mr Major said - the Danish referendum, uncertainties surrounding the French referendum, and 'infelicitous' briefing by the Bundesbank which directed the markets towards sterling. The prime minister's determination to seize the initiative on the domestic agenda and put behind him the past few months in which the government was widely perceived as at the mercy of events, was also explicit. He underlined his commitment to further education and health reforms, but was more cautious in his language on privatising British Rail, while insisting that the legislation would be passed by parliament this year. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, rejected Mr Major's sighting of increased economic confidence, saying that the government still failed to appreciate that the fear of unemployment was the fundamental barrier to a restoration of confidence. He recalled previous ministerial forecasts: 'The Conservative party's promises about economic recovery are the biggest devalued currency of our time.' Smith urges return to 'active government', Page 4</p>

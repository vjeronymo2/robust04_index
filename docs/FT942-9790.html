			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: Hungarian bank plunges into deficit after charge Kereskedelmi Bank, Hungary's second largest commercial bank, plunged to a Ft46bn (Dollars 450m) loss in 1993 after taking a heavy charge for bad loans. The state-owned bank reported an operating profit of Ft9.3bn for the year to December but a Ft55.3bn provision for non-performing loans dragged the bank down to a record deficit, equivalent to 1.4 per cent of national gross domestic product. The loss left Kereskedelmi with a capital deficit that required a Ft33.4bn injection from the state last December just to bring the bank to a capital adequacy of 0.02 per cent of risk-weighted assets of about Ft125bn. Even a top-up of Ft5bn to be agreed at the annual meeting next Monday will lift the capital adequacy ratio to only 4 per cent, still well below the 8 per cent level recommended by the Basle-based Bank for International Settlements. The bail-out, part of a Dollars 3bn government programme to shore up 10 leading banks, came after the World Bank, in an internal memo, warned that Kereskedelmi Bank, Magyar Hitel Bank, the largest commercial bank, and several others had negative capital and were 'technically insolvent'. Kereskedelmi suffered, like other large Hungarian banks, from a wave of failures among its corporate borrowers after Hungary put into effect western-style bankruptcy legislation in 1992. Hungary's banks began last year to calculate loans by international standards, revealing the poor quality of their assets and requiring a large one-off increase in reserves. However, Kereskedelmi is particularly exposed to an agricultural sector hit by confusion over property rights and drought. Under Mr Geza Lenk, the managing director, Kereskedelmi has been slower than counterparts such as Budapest Bank in making provisions against default by clients. Kereskedelmi Bank reported a 1992 loss of just Ft1bn. The privatisation authorities last year named Hambros, the UK merchant bank, to advise on the privatisation of Kereskedelmi Bank. But, after last year's losses, management has delayed a move into the private sector for another two years and advisers say Hambros's mandate is a 'sleeping contract'. Kereskedelmi Bank is reported to be looking to dilute its stake in Ibusz Bank, a small institution specialising in currency exchange and hard-currency deposits. Of the Hungarian state-owned banks, only Magyar Kulkereskedelmi Bank (MKB) and Budapest Bank are moving quickly towards privatisation. Bayerische Landesbank of Bavaria is taking a 25 per cent stake in MKB, a foreign trade bank, which was advised by JP Morgan, the US investment bank. In parallel, the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is acquiring a 17 per cent shareholding. Management at Budapest Bank, advised by Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, is also pushing hard for private investors. Austria's Creditanstalt Bankverein has strong ties with Budapest Bank and a focus on eastern Europe. Analysts identified it as the most likely bidder. But it is understood that Creditanstalt's board has decided against a bid, preferring to concentrate on development of its own Hungarian subsidiary.</p>

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Extractors to be VAT free EXTRACTOR FANS and smoke detectors installed in new buildings are to be exempt from value added tax immediately, HM Customs &amp; Excise has ruled. Relief for new domestic housing has in the past been restricted to exclude items not normally installed by builders such as electrical appliances. But Customs has reconsidered the ruling following new building regulations on fire safety and ventilation in kitchens and bathrooms requiring the installation of fans and detectors. In separate concessions resulting from recent court cases, Customs has changed its position on two other VAT items connected with property. Builders and developers will be able to claim back tax on that proportion of their property portfolio which is prepared for sale, but not on those for which they levy rental income. The ruling follows decisions by the High Court to uphold the decision of VAT Tribunals in cases brought by two companies, Briararch and Curtis Henderson. In a fourth judgement, Customs also said yesterday it would introduce extra-statutory concessions so tenants fitting out a building would not be liable for tax costs already levied on builders. This follows a ruling by the Scottish Court of Session favouring an original property builder.</p>

			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV READIES FAST, RADICAL ECONOMIC CURE;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: HE SEES NEED TO SHIFT FROM CENTRAL CONTROL TO A MORE  ENTREPRENEURIAL SYSTEM.  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Tuesday that he intends to take a series of  quick, radical measures to pull the Soviet economy out of its profound crisis  and shift it from central planning and management to a more entrepreneurial  system based on market forces.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, addressing the first session of the country's new, policy-setting  Presidential Council, said that the program will attempt to "radicalize  economic reforms" and will undertake "the controlled transfer to market  relations" and thus introduce a mixed economy here.  </P> <P> A package of integrated measures aimed at establishing "a normal, fully fledged  market" will be ready within two weeks, Gorbachev said, and will include a new  mechanism to set state prices, an end to the government's chronic budget  deficit, banking reform, a revamped credit policy, a new system of fiscal  controls and the break-up of the state's present industrial monopolies.  </P> <P> Other steps will be taken shortly, he continued, to put into effect  agricultural reforms, including the allocation of land to farmers for  cultivation outside the plans of state farms or collective farms.  </P> <P> In the future, state-owned enterprises will continue to predominate in the  Soviet economy, Gorbachev said, but the ways that they are managed will change  substantially. There will also develop new, small enterprises, many owned by  collectives, others by entrepreneurs and their families and some the result of  foreign investment, he said.  </P> <P> Altogether, at least 20 measures are planned, according to informed Soviet  economists, with some, such as the establishment of a bond market and setting  new state prices for agricultural produce, to be enacted by presidential  decree. Others would be introduced as emergency legislation, including laws on  price reform and foreign investment.  </P> <P> While all these measures have long been debated by Soviet economists and many  have been accepted in principle by the government, Gorbachev told the council  that he now intends to implement them, using his new powers as executive  president when required.  </P> <P> "We are at a critical point that calls for well-considered decisions,"  Gorbachev said, according to an account of his speech by the official news  agency Tass, but he gave no details of the actual policy changes nor a  timetable.  </P> <P> Social discontent is rising quickly, Gorbachev noted, attributing this to the  lack of economic development and arguing that the "further radicalization of  perestroika" is the only solution.  </P> <P> "Society is unquiet and unstable," he said. "Order and discipline have  slackened. Inter-ethnic relations have become exacerbated. People experience a  lot of difficulties and disappointments and want a quicker solution to problems  and a calm and normal atmosphere. . . .  </P> <P> "It is this failure to solve economic problems," he continued, "that is the  cause of the social and, to a considerable extent, ethnic tension."  </P> <P> The government's reforms up to now have not succeeded in transforming the  country's economy, Gorbachev said, and in many respects have made it worse,  largely because many of the reforms were never or only half-heartedly  implemented.  </P> <P> With state enterprises monopolizing the market and without the economic levers,  such as taxes, fiscal controls and price policy, that are common in capitalist  countries, the Soviet Union has had no real market governed by supply and  demand, and little has changed, he said.  </P></p>

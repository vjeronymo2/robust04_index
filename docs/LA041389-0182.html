			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> AGENCY FIRES 20 IN PROBE  </P> <P> The city has fired 20 employees and suspended 11 others in the Department of  Water and Power after an extensive investigation of drug use and theft at the  city maintenance yard.  </P> <P> The city notified 33 of the department's 280 employees last month that they  would be dismissed, suspended or demoted after an investigation found that  workers were using cocaine, marijuana, amphetamines and alcohol on the job,  that drug sales had taken place at work and that some employees had stolen  personal property and city property.  </P> <P> Department supervisors had recommended the dismissal of 26 employees, but David  Plumb, the department's general manager, reduced the penalty for six of them  after reviewing the evidence and conducting conferences.  </P> <P> In addition to the dismissals, Plumb suspended 11 employees and ordered salary  reductions for two others.  </P> <P> Deputy City Manager Ed Aghjayan said those who were dismissed can file appeals  and grievances, but they cannot return to work during the appellate process.  Employees who were suspended for drug use can return to work only if they agree  to random drug testing, he said.  </P></p>

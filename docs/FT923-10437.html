			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Dream Team fantasy worth every dollar - Peter Berlin peers beyond the hype to see what makes America's basketball players the toast of the Games SO FAR the matches in the men's Olympic basketball tournament have followed a simple formula. A team with one man who plays in the National Basketball Association - the top US professional league  - will beat a team with no NBA players. A team with two NBA players will beat a team with one. And a team with 11 NBA players pulverises everyone. The German team offers a perfect example of the power of the NBA. It has one NBA player: Detlef Schrempf. Last year Schrempf was voted the league's best 'sixth man'. In a sport in which teams have five men on the court, this is a dubious honour. Schrempf would no doubt prefer a more prominent role but on a strong team, such as his Indiana Pacers, the sixth man is important. Schrempf cannot walk on air like Michael Jordan, sink impossible shots like Larry Bird or conjure passes like Magic Johnson. He does not dominate under the basket like Patrick Ewing. But he is versatile. He jumps, shoots, passes and rebounds better than the average NBA player and a lot better than any of his German team-mates. After two games, Schrempf leads his team in practically every statistical category. He has played nearly every minute. He has scored 35 per cent of their points. Schrempf is responsible for nearly half his team's defensive rebounds and half their steals. Against Spain, Germany trailed early on. Schrempf sparked their recovery. Against unfancied, unknown Angola, Germany were behind by seven points at half-time. Schrempf led the fight back, though in the dying minutes Angola steadied themselves. Predictably the smaller, quicker Angolans made Germany look ponderous and unimaginative. But the Angolans were also making the Germans look stupid. The agile, brave Jean Coceicao attacked the basket at every opportunity. When the Germans fell back to block his routes, Manuel Sousa and Anibal Moreira used the space and time to score with three-point shots. German defenders began to shout at each other. But Schrempf stayed cool. He sank his shots while team-mates missed and rallied the defence. As Angola's last-second surge ended in a collision of bodies, Schrempf stood alone beneath the basket coolly clasping the ball and a one-point win in his hands. On Monday, Croatia took on America's Dream Team. 'I never saw that kind of defence before,' said a Croat when the US won 103-70. The only Croats who looked comfortable against the Americans were Drazen Petrovic, even though he tried to do too much himself, and the 7ft 1in, 18-stone Stojko Vrankovic, in his limited role of the beast under the basket. The quality in depth of the US Olympic team is unprecedented. As a team it is capable of a level of play unseen even in the NBA. There are many critics who would rather it remained unseen. In part, this is because the US team has carried the once-amateur Olympics to new commercial extremes. One of the US Olympic Committee's sponsors, Reebok, has designed an especially garish track suit for Americans to wear at medal ceremonies. 'And I will be watching to make sure there is compliance,' said John Krimsky, the committee's deputy secretary-general. 'He can watch as much as he likes,' countered Jordan, who has a contract with Nike, 'but there is no way in the world I would wear a suit made by Reebok.' 'You are not dealing with a sports team, but seven or eight rock stars,' said Dick Pound, the International Olympic Committee member responsible for the Olympics' more aggressive commercial approach and certainly not a critic of the Dream Team. 'We may have to give some thought as to whether we go the rock star route or have a rock star quota.' Olympics administrators are not the only ones to view the Dream Team's appearance in Barcelona as an experiment. As one US journalist said: 'The test of whether this has been worth it for the players will come next spring after they have been playing for 18 months non-stop.' Even Olympic team-mates feel ambivalent. Mike Barrowman, the US swimmer, said: 'This is the Olympics, not the NBA. I love these guys. I want them to kill everybody. But this is our chance to come through for our country. We only get that chance every four years. They get it every day.' According to Dick Pound: 'Americans get excited if they win anything. It doesn't matter if the Dream Team take on a girls' high school team, they enjoy it. NBC's ratings seem to grow with the Dream Team's margin of victory. It is certainly disturbing that the people of the world's only superpower enjoy seeing their boys beat up small, weak nations, but it is hardly the team's fault.' After beating Croatia, Jordan said: 'There is not a single team in the tournament that can beat us.' While the Croatians may secretly hope to ambush the US in the final, they know that Jordan is right. Even so, they want the Dream Team in Barcelona. After Tuesday's game Petar Skansi, Croatia's coach, said: 'We have players with the talent to play against the NBA players. But to do that they must play in the NBA. Kukoc can't play better in Europe. He is the very best player here. Not there.' The fans want the Dream Team in Spain, too. They roared when Croatia staged small rallies. But when the Americans replied by producing their most breath-taking play, the response was tellingly different. The roar was replaced by gasps and by the shutter-snap of 1,000 cameras. The Dream Team's games are unlikely to produce the wrenching tension of Germany's win over Angola or Spain's 101-100 victory against Brazil. But when the US players do things the spectators never imagined humans could do; when Jordan walks on air; when Magic makes the ball disappear behind his back and materialise in a team-mate's hands, and when Charles Barkley, the pantomime villain, slam-dunks and swings on the rim against the backdrop of a Milky Way of twinkling flashbulbs - why, then, the Dream Team provides the fantasy that sport should offer.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Record UK loan losses shrink NatWest results RECORD losses on UK loans in 1991 led to a collapse in the profits of National Westminster, the UK clearing bank, to their lowest level since 1975. As a result, the bank plans to cut staff numbers by at least 4,000 this year, having shed 6,400 jobs last year. NatWest's pre-tax profits last year dropped 78 per cent to Pounds 110m (Dollars 192m) due to a bad debt charge of Pounds 1.99bn, which included losses on UK lending of Pounds 1.45bn, the biggest ever incurred by a UK bank. The poor results - which meant that NatWest had to withdraw Pounds 220m from reserves to pay a maintained dividend of 17.5p a share - represent a sharp reversal in its fortunes. Only three years ago it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.41bn, more than any other UK bank before or since. None the less its trading surplus in 1991 rose 20 per cent to a record Pounds 2.03bn, largely due to a sharp rise in commissions. NatWest's bad debt charge meant that its UK financial services division  - the heart of its business and including its 2,816 branches - made a loss, of Pounds 5m, for the first time. Lord Alexander, chairman, said that there had been 'some departures from the principles of sound lending'. Mr Tom Frost, who has been group chief executive since 1987 and retires next year, said it was bad banking practice to sack staff for making bad loans. Bankers 'would not lend any money at all', if they feared their jobs were on the line for lending mistakes. NatWest's losses to the Maxwell empire were lower than expected, at Pounds 50m, according to analysts. Lex, Page 14 Background, Page 20</p>

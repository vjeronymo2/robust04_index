			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Complaints to gas watchdog rise by 130% THE NUMBER of serious complaints to Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, rose last year by 130 per cent, Sir James McKinnon, director-general, said yesterday. Sir James stressed, however, that this was due more to the effectiveness of regulation and growing expectations of service standards among consumers, rather than any deterioration in British Gas's performance. Ofgas's annual report detailed 858 complaints, compared with 366 in the previous year. Sir James said: 'The number of complaints we see is the tiny tip of the iceberg - people come to us as a last resort. But customers are increasingly aware of their rights and are more confident about seeking redress.' British Gas said that 406 complaints had been referred by Ofgas to the company, or one for every 45,000 customers. Mr Cedric Brown, senior managing director, said: 'We have a good record but are not complacent and must continually strive to improve.' Sir James said the Citizen's Charter would increase British Gas's obligations to customers. The new tariff formula, which would take effect in April, included a scale of service standards which the company had to meet. During its five-year life the tariff formula will save every household on average Pounds 200 in real terms, Sir James said, compared with current gas prices. 'In the longer term, I want consumers to be able to get better service by choosing their supplier.' The government plans to introduce competition for domestic business by 1998. Before that, British Gas must reduce its share of the industrial market to 40 per cent by releasing gas to rivals. Sir James said talks on the gas release were proceeding slowly. He raised the possibility that the company could still be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission if it failed to agree details quickly. He said gas should be released to the market in a controlled way which could be clearly monitored. 'We have to pricing . . . and that competitors can get their gas through British Gas's pipeline system unimpaired.' Nine companies, supplying 1,900 customers, currently compete with British Gas. They have about 10 per cent of the overall industrial market. Mr Ian Powe, director of the Gas Consumers' Council, said complaints had risen by 5 per cent over the year to 28,389. 'British Gas has a way to go, but is doing an extremely good job in increasing its standard of service,' he said.</p>

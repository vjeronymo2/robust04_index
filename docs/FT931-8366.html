			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Takeover creates Europe-wide retailer: The deal between Kingfisher and Darty KINGFISHER'S takeover of Darty not only creates Europe's largest electricals retailer, it could be a stepping stone on the way to its becoming the first Europe-wide retailing group. The deal was warmly welcomed yesterday by the City, and contained no unpleasant surprises. It values Darty's equity at FFr4.45bn (Pounds 560m). Kingfisher has agreed to acquire the whole of the issued share capital of Financiere Darty, which owns 95.3 per cent of the Darty retail group, for a cash payment of FFr1.65bn and 68m Kingfisher shares. This will give Darty shareholders a significant stake of between 10 and 12 per cent in Kingfisher. Kingfisher will also take on borrowings valued at Pounds 477m on January 30. It will make a cash offer for the 4.7 per cent of Darty which is held publicly after consultation with the French authorities. The UK group will strengthen its balance sheet with a Pounds 313m, one-for-seven rights issue, at a price of 450p each. The issue will be in two stages, with a first instalment of 225p payable by March 15 irrespective of whether the takeover is completed. The second will only become payable if the takeover is approved. That would take Kingfisher's gearing to 66 per cent, but Mr James Kerr-Muir, finance director, said he expected the group's strong cashflow to enable this to be reduced by a 'significant amount' in a 'fairly short time'. He said interest cover of six times provided further reassurance. Analysts were enthusiastic about the deal. Mr John Richards of NatWest Securities said in the long term it offered the prospect of creating the first 'major European power-retailer'. The two managements will work together closely, with Sir Geoff Mulcahy, Kingfisher's chairman, joining Darty's board, and Mr Philippe Frances, chairman of Darty, joining the executive committee of Kingfisher. A first priority will be to examine areas of 'synergistic benefit' between the two chains in areas such as information technology and logistics, distribution and marketing. Mr Frances said the companies would be considering strengthening their buying operations, but they were unlikely to pool sourcing activities other than for their largest common suppliers. The deal should also enable Darty to accelerate its expansion programme. Mr Frances said the group planned to open 30 or 40 stores in France over the next five years, and 40 new units thereafter, taking the total to about 200. Darty also intends to extend its operations outside France, at present restricted to a joint venture in Belgium with retailer New Vandenborre. Mr Frances said it would not be moving into the UK but 'there are lots of other European countries where we'd like to be'. Germany, Spain and Italy are all seen as areas of potential growth.

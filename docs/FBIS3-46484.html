			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary: "An Important Stance"] </F>   [Text] Cambodia's concern about the attitude of the  countries which still have contacts with the Khmer Rouge was an  important topic during a recent summit meeting of top counselors  from the Thai National Security Council and officials from the  Thai Ministries of Foreign Affairs and National Defense.    The Thai officials attending the meeting concluded that  Thailand should try its best to emphasize its attitude and  intention [words indistinct] between the two countries. These  Thai officials also called on the Thai Government to take  (?steps) to assure Cambodia that the Thai Government fully  supports the new Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] and that  Thailand does not interfere in Cambodia's internal affairs.    This is another very important stance displayed by Thailand  to contribute to the strengthening friendship and stability  between the two countries, Cambodia and Thailand. They are  moving forward in whichever direction toward national  development.    During his recent visit to Cambodia, His Excellency [H.E.]  Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri also emphasized this matter.    We believe that if Thailand adheres to the current stance  that it recognizes only the RGC, Thai Prime Minister Chuan  Likphai's coming visit to the Kingdom of Cambodia will certainly  achieve good results in strengthening the relations between the  two countries [words indistinct]. Moreover, this will further  weaken the Khmer Rouge rebels [words indistinct] who are  attempting to renew the war.</p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / France criticised on terror suspects Pressure is mounting on the French government to explain why it sent two Iranian murder suspects back to Iran last week, in the process breaking a formal agreement to extradite them to Switzerland. The US State Department said in a statement that it was 'seeking clarification' from the French government. 'The US believes that the rule of law should be applied to terrorists,' it said. Earlier, Mr Arnold Koller, the Swiss justice minister, said in a newspaper interview that France's explanations for the move, which violated the European conventions on extradition and the repression of terrorism, had so far been 'wholly inadequate'. In France too, criticism was growing. Mr Gerard Fuchs, a Socialist party leader, said the government had dishonoured France. 'It is sad that France has to take lessons from Switzerland on how to fight terrorism,' Mr Fuchs said. Prime Minister Edouard Balladur merely reiterated to journalists at a new year meeting yesterday what his officials said when announcing the decision, that it was related to the national interest. Mr Alain Juppe, foreign minister, claimed in a radio interview that France had not given in to pressure from Iran, and had nothing to learn from Switzerland when it came to fighting terrorism. The two Iranians, Moshen Sharif Esfahani and Ahmed Taheri, were arrested in France in 1992 at the request of the Swiss authorities in connection with the murder of Kazem Radjavi, the brother of a Mujahadeen leader, in a Geneva suburb in April 1990. Following their release on December 29, the Swiss foreign ministry made an official diplomatic protest, but officials said there was nothing more they could do as they did not want to sour relations with France. However, Mr Koller's remarks suggest a subsequent toughening of the Swiss position, possibly in response to suspicions among the Swiss public that Bern was reacting spinelessly. He said the matter would be taken up at the meeting of the federal council (cabinet) next Wednesday. He rejected accusations that Switzerland, like France, was not unhappy with a quiet resolution of a matter that could have sparked off fresh terrorism in both countries.</p>

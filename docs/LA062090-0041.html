			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL OKS LOAN OF $1.4 MILLION TO BUILDER  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council voted Tuesday to lend an additional $1.4 million  to a developer seeking to build a 241-unit subsidized housing project in Sun  Valley.  </P> <P> The request for the additional money was sought by the city's Community  Redevelopment Agency, which stepped in a year ago to save the project by  agreeing to lend Thomas Safran, the Brentwood-based developer, $5 million.  </P> <P> The project, to be built on a 9-acre site between Strathern and Lorne streets,  has been in the works for five years. The total projected cost of the  development is now $24 million.  </P> <P> Boosting the CRA's loan by $1.4 million was needed to cover additional costs,  including those of complying with a new city fire sprinkler ordinance.  </P></p>

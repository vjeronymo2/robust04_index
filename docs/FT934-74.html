			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Arts: Hard times for innovative productions - Opera in 1993 / Although lack of money has meant a rash of revivals of old favourites, there have also been some truly bold achievements The high point of 1993 came almost at the year's end. The way it came provided a handful of topical insights, not altogether cheering, into the direction opera in Britain now seems headed. For one 'public preview' and three concert performances, the London Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, in company with a choice cast containing several British debutants, assembled on the Barbican Hall platform for a once-in-a-lifetime account of Berlioz's Trojans. At the time of writing this, days after the final of the three (the one I attended), I feel myself still utterly rapt in recollection of an awesome experience - and, what is more, I keep bumping into 'ordinary' members of the public anxious to relate a similarly durable sense of thrall. The presence on the podium of Colin Davis, the LSO's chief conductor-in-waiting, was all-important: this performance was the fruit of a lifetime's championing of the composer in general and his magnum opus in particular. The conductor's tender encouragement of the three leading newcomers to their roles - the dramatic mezzos Jane Henschel (Cassandra) and Markella Hatziano (Dido) and the tenor Vladimir Bogachov (Aeneas), all nobly responsive - could be felt at every moment. The long span, tensile strengths and imaginative potency of Berlioz's five mighty acts were drawn on, and out, in myriad incalculable ways, fostering a more complete Trojans 'production' than any I had previously seen or heard. This was a concert performance to raise again the old question, do we really need anything more? In other words, do we really need the machinery, trappings and brouhaha of an opera house? The extraordinary thing is that the LSO Trojans launched a tripartite December festival of concert-opera in London - a matter of pure coincidence, really - all three parts of which maintained similar high standards and raised similar questions. At the Albert Hall, the Royal Philharmonic and a galaxy of star singers (including the marvellously opulent-voiced soprano Galina Gorchakova) from the Kirov Opera under the St Petersburg chief, Valery Gergiev, seem to have done wonders for Tchaikovsky's underrated last opera, Iolanta. At the Queen Elizabeth Hall Monteverdi's Coronation of Poppaea, given twice by John Eliot Gardiner and his trusty 'period' cohorts, was minimally staged, with singers (Sylvia McNair, Anne Sofie von Otter, Michael Chance and the Italian bass Francesco Ellero d'Artegna) schooled to tap a high voltage of dramatic energy from the text. For me the opera was never more gravely beautiful, nor more terrifyingly pitiless in its view of human affections and ambitions. So, at a time when our national opera companies face the immediate prospect of painful shortfalls in their sources of public funding, is concert-hall opera an art-form worth cultivating? Can such a thing perhaps be relied upon, even encouraged, to 'make up the difference' in the money-starved future? (The LSO has a Davis Idomeneo already planned, the RPO-Kirov combination an enticing Rimsky-Korsakov rarity, and the Gardiner-English Baroque Soloists' Mozart series is still in action. In addition, such London bodies as Opera In Concert have their next offering lined up for March, a Royal Festival Hall Ernani with the Russian soprano Maria Guleghina.) The answer is, of course we need the 'real thing' more than the concert substitute. It only requires a memory-nudge back to another Barbican-LSO opera-concert, much earlier in 1993 - Peter Grimes, all but reduced to musical and dramatic blether by the insufficiently prepared (to put it euphemistically) Britten conductor, Mstislav Rostropovich - to point up the countervailing argument. That is: opera-concerts not mounted with the highest degree of preparatory zeal can prove a far more inadequate realisation of the operatic experience than the most ordinary opera-house revival. Likewise, Glyndebourne's occupation of the Festival Hall. This was the year without the Sussex festival proper, the year given over to the building of the new Glyndebourne Theatre (due for opening next May). Two of the three Glyndebourne-LPO concert performances put on in London as makeweights, Beatrice and Benedict and Fidelio, were sad disappointments, showing little evidence of that fine-fingered, lengthily-brewed ensemble interplay for which Glyndebourne performances are renowned. (I missed the third, The Merry Widow, which my colleague David Murray enjoyed rather more than I had the preceding Berlioz and Beethoven.) In any Grand Opera staging, the larger the scenographic requirements - and Berlioz's for The Trojans bulk among the largest in all opera - the more probable it is that the theatrical dimension will in the end compromise the musical. That is still no excuse for our theatres to shirk tackling the biggies of lyric theatre. In spite of all I said earlier about this latest Davis Trojans, I still pray that we may have him back at Covent Garden one day, at the head of a brand-new Trojans production. But that needs money, of course. While the fortuitously-arranged London concert-opera festival was unfolding, and indeed during the time of the Kirov Iolanta, it was painful to recall that Covent Garden was being forced to put on its umpteenth Tosca revival with principals - Sergey Leiferkus and Anna Tomowa-Sintow - who, but for the philistine strictures of the Arts Council's Warnock Report, should have been gracing a revival of the Royal Opera's marvellous 1990 Prince Igor. The gloomy fact that, for the foreseeable future, the house will have to avoid the 'risk' provided by such elevating challenges as the Borodin epic - or indeed, the War and Peace that the company shares with the St Petersburg house but now cannot afford to bring to London - should put the satisfactions provided by even the best kind of concert-opera in the proper perspective. It was not, in sum, an annus mirabilis for opera in Britain. While good things were encountered during its course, and much that was better than good, a general awareness prevailed that the main companies were only just managing to keep their heads above water. Long runs of Figaro, Barber, Magic Flute, Mikado, Tosca and such-like became the rule. Design costs were cut to the bone - often a stimulus to dramatic ingenuity (as in Opera North's admirable new Don Carlos and superlatively fine Wozzeck), sometimes (as in the Royal Opera's new Onegin and borrowed-from-Scotland new Flute and English National Opera's new Lohengrin) a distinct, all-too-visible handicap. The effect of rehearsal schedules pared down for money-saving reasons could be felt on more than one first night. Hard times. It is necessary to report them with an unflinching gaze; but this year I prefer, instead of a case-by-case survey of all our companies, to record more summarily the occasions on which, in spite of handicaps, the positive outweighed the negative. At the Royal Opera this meant, inter alia, the new Stiffelio - little-known Verdi mounted with love and understanding under Edward Downes's wise Verdian baton, not vocally ideal (Jose Carreras, Catherine Malfitano and Gregory Yurisch the leads) but illuminated by rare commitment. The shoestring Onegin was lifted to glory by the presence of those already-mentioned Kirov stars, Gergiev as conductor and Gorchakova, Leiferkus and the tenor Gegam Grigorian. The resonant Russian accent and full-bodied delivery of the score made up for the exiguous quality of the staging. Earlier in the year, Colin Davis had indeed conducted Berlioz in the house - a borrowed staging (by Harry Kupfer) of La Damnation de Faust which I found endlessly enthralling and others simply loathed. Die Meistersinger returned, in a first-ever Graham Vick production conducted, also for the first time, by Bernard Haitink. Though it gave me less bounteous satisfaction than many of my colleagues, there was a salient freshness of style about the show that was summed up in the brilliant first-time Beckmesser of Thomas Allen. In June the ENO ruling triumvirate of Mark Elder (conductor), David Pountney (producer) and Peter Jonas (general administrator) duly retired. The overview of their achievements will take a while to gain final clarity; already we are aware - because he came back in November to impress us all with a superbly mature, long-breathed account of the new Lohengrin - how considerable was Elder's contribution to those achievements. Likewise, the question whether and how the new team of Sian Edwards (conductor) and Dennis Marks (administrator) are settling in is not to be answered by reference to the offerings of their first few months - above all not, I should like to hope, by the evidence of the house's comprehensively disappointing new Boheme, of which Edwards offered a worryingly coarse musical traversal. Since the ENO's 1980s team made its reputation via a 'house style' - interventionist, image-conscious - now supposedly outdated in the less carefree 1990s, it gives me particular pleasure to recall as one of the highlights of the year the company's David Alden production of Handel's Ariodante, a typical dream-world re-thinking that for all its 'radical' excesses created a vital, individual new form of Handelian opera-theatre. The excellence of conductor (Nicholas McGegan) and cast (led by Ann Murray and Amanda Roocroft) must not go unremembered. Elder's last new ENO production was of Jonathan Harvey's Inquest of Love, which in defiance of an unhelpful staging by David Pountney came across as the most substantial premiere offered at the Coliseum in a long while (this is, unfortunately, less of a compliment than it sounds, given the recent ENO record with regard to new opera). Opera North's farewell to the years of Nicholas Payne's administration was a bumper package of daring ideas cunningly carried out: Don Carlos, La Gioconda and by and large the tautest, sharpest Wozzeck I have seen - a notable debut in opera by the theatre director Deborah Warner - were three of the year's boldest achievements. To do Gioconda, an Italian Grand Opera warhorse, on small-house means and succeed with it at all, let alone proudly, takes an admirable combination of knowhow, foresight and plain daring. I failed to visit Scottish Opera this year; my visits to Welsh National brought mixed pleasures, among them a Tristan und Isolde made deeply eloquent more by Jeffrey Lawton and Anne Evans in the title roles than by Charles Mackerras's energetic conducting (the staging was feeble). But I was sorry that a period of autumn illness caused me to miss the company's highly-praised Massenet Cendrillon: please Mr Epstein, bring it back] In the domain of new opera, and in addition to the Harvey Inquest, I was specially grateful for the British premiere of Siegfried Matthus's Cornet Rilke's Song of Love and Death, a long-overdue first British production of any opera by this former East German composer. Short, beautifully made, cunningly devised to function as opera, dream-vision and poetic metaphor all at one go, Cornet Rilke proved the highlight of a generally classy autumn season by Glyndebourne Touring Opera. Prior to its opening, this most valuable of British touring companies had been placed under notice of death sentence by the Arts Council of Great Britain. At the time, passionate protest was aroused, as it should be, by the sheer folly of such a decision; but since then, worries over the future of GTO have tended to be obscured by the brouhaha aroused by the Arts Council's 'beauty contest' method of deciding the future funding of three of the four independent London orchestras. Now that this ludicrous piece of judicial irresponsibility has ended in the shambles it so richly deserved, and abuse is being heaped on the council from all sides, those GTO worries seem to have been forgotten. At the moment the Arts Council itself seems headed either for extinction or else for a well-merited overhaul: but will Glyndebourne Touring Opera be dragged down with this particular sinking ship?</p>

			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: BANKING / FINANCE  </P> <P> UniCare Financial Corp., an Irvine holding company for a workers' compensation  underwriter, may be looking for a change in ownership.  </P> <P> The company recently said it has retained the investment banking firm of Smith  Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. "to explore alternatives to maximize shareholder  value."  </P> <P> UniCare's president, Russell Leatherby, would not comment further.  </P> <P> Company executives have long thought the firm has been undervalued on Wall  Street. Hiring an investment banker to look for ways to increase value,  however, often indicates that a sale or management buyout is in the offing.  </P> <P> Leatherby took over as president and assumed more responsibilities this year as  the heir apparent to his father, Ralph Leatherby, the company's chairman and  largest stockholder, with a 60% stake.  </P></p>

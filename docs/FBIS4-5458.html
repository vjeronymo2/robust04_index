			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "It's Time-wasting Telling Burma What Press </F> Freedom Is About"]    [Text] After the 1988 uprising in Burma, it was said that  the Thai Ambassador to Rangoon was summoned to the Burmese  Foreign Ministry and berated by a minister for something he had  not done and had no control over -- Thai press reports of the  Rangoon government's atrocities and persecution of its people in  the aftermath of the State Law and Order Restoration Council  [Slorc] takeover.    When the ambassador entered the office of the Burmese  minister, the latter reportedly slammed a copy of one of  Thailand's English-language dailies on the table before the Thai  envoy could take a seat, and demanded: "What's the meaning of  this? Why does your government allow the press in your country  to publish lies about us?"    The Thai diplomat was stunned by such behaviour coming from  a  high-ranking official. He had not even had time to calmly reply  that there is such a thing as freedom of the press in his  country. It seems, however, the words of a Thai diplomat hold no  water in a country where the word freedom is rivalled by its  powerful nemesis -- imprisonment.    Now we hear that the Thai Foreign Ministry has invited  Burmese Information Minister Myo Thant to Bangkok on Wednesday  to explain the Government's policy on a free and liberal press.    The invitation is aimed at erasing Rangoon's doubts that the  Government supports press criticism of the State Law and Order  Restoration Council, according to sources in the Interior  Ministry. The sources added that the visit will provide  Brigadier General Myo Thant the opportunity to see that the Thai  press has the freedom to express its opinion without Government  control.    How the Government is going to do this, we do not know, but  one thing we do know is that it will be a waste of the Thai  Government's time, money, and energy to expect a non-believer in  basic human rights to understand what freedom of speech means.    As members of the press, we strongly object to the  Government's plans to display us like freaks in a sideshow to  the Burmese military while at the same time pursuing a policy of  "constructive engagement" with the so-called Burmese government,  which has been shunned by most of the international community.  We do not believe in the staging of a Richardson-Suu Kyi-like  circus to try to fool the world into thinking that  authoritarianism does not exist in Burma, when in fact it does.  In short: Don't use the press like Khin Nyunt does, for his own  selfish reasons.    If freedom of press does exist in this country, as the  Government claims, then there is no reason to shout it for the  rest of the world to hear, especially Burma, which is calling  itself Myanmar and has changed its flag without the consent of  its people.    The Thai press knows how much freedom it has and where to  draw the line when reporting on events that affect national  security or when criticising a high-ranking government or  military official. This is called responsible journalism or  self-censorship, depending on how one looks at it. It is said  that the press in Thailand is the most free of all those in the  ASEAN countries. We praise the Government for showing such a  high degree of tolerance for the fourth estate.    The Rangoon government already knows the Thai press has the  freedom to air its opinions, if and when it sees fit, without  government control, even when criticising Burma or other  countries. This paper has even assailed Foreign Minister Prasong  Sunsiri's decision to invite Rangoon to attend the ASEAN  conference in July as guest of the host country.    The generals in Burma also know that the press in Thailand  has a voice of its own because it refuses to address that  country as Myanmar and its capital as Yangon, despite the  acquiescence of this Government and the United Nations. The  BANGKOK POST and THE NATION have turned down repeated requests  by the Burmese Embassy on Pan Road to stop calling its country  Burma. We choose not to comply with their request because doing  so would mean recognising an illegitimate government. As one  prominent Thai editor put it: "Burma remains Burma until the  Burmese people decide for themselves after elections whether the  name of their country should be changed."    So if this Government is to invite the Burmese Information  Minister here just to prove that there is a free press in this  country, then it is wasting its time. It's plain stupidity to  cast pearls before swine, or as the Burmese themselves say, to  woo a buffalo with the melodious sounds of the harp.    Instead, we suggest that the invitation be extended to the  silenced members of the Slorc-controlled media. They would  appreciate the chance to see for themselves how their  counterparts in Thailand practice journalism in a free society  without interference or intimidation from the powers that be.</p>

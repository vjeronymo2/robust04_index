			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Vestey's new management prepares finance changes The Vestey Group, one of the largest privately-owned companies in the UK, has appointed SG Warburg as adviser to help refinance the company. Warburg is believed initially to be focusing on normalising financial arrangements between Union International, the indebted trading arm of the Vestey group, and Union's bankers. It is understood that Union is about the come out of the standstill arranged with its bankers last year and that medium-term banking facilities will be established, allowing it to operate under normal trading conditions. Peat Marwick, the accountant, is believed to be advising on ways of restructuring the group's debt while NM Rothschild, the merchant bank, has been called in by Mr Terry Robinson, chief executive of Union, to advise on floating part of its east Asian businesses on the stock markets in Australia and New Zealand. The changes are part of a strategy being put in place by a new management comprising Sir John Collins, former chairman and chief executive of Shell, who was appointed chief executive of Vestey in September with effect from next month, and Mr Robert Cooper, former director and head of corporate finance at Robert Fleming, who has been appointed finance director. Union has been reducing its net debt, now believed to be a little more than Pounds 100m. Earlier in the year, it reported it was operating profitably and that its net debt was down to Pounds 202m in the year to December 31 1992 from Pounds 327m 12 months earlier.</p>

			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOKED FOR TRAVEL: GUIDEBOOK LOOKS AT HIGHS, LOWS OF CALIFORNIA  </P> <P> "California -- the Ultimate Guidebook," by Ray Riegert, details the state from  below sea level to more than 11,000 feet in elevation amid redwood forests,  sun-bleached mining towns, fishing villages, Spanish missions and remnants of  old wagon trails.  </P> <P> The book divides the state into 13 areas and has 36 specific maps. From posh to  economical, it provides a cross-section of places to eat, stay and see. Each  entry comes complete with information on amenities, including vignettes of  historical note, events or attractions. The text is bright with lots of  information and doesn't offer a clutter of photos (Ulysses: $13.95).  </P> <P> Arthur Frommer's "1990 New World of Travel" may be among the best all-purpose  guides. It details new destinations, modes of travel and inexpensive lodgings.  </P> <P> The guide demonstrates with sufficient photos how to separate yourself from  tour buses, charter flights and camera-toting tourists. It also gives readers  the opportunity to experience events, life styles, attitudes and cultures  different from the normal.  </P> <P> More than 1,200 alternative-travel companies and resorts in the United States  and abroad are listed.  </P> <P> The text discusses brainy tours, health expansion and in-depth explorations of  the unusual, including classes in Balinese dancing, mask-carving in Bali,  gourmet cooking, cattle-herding or gold-panning. While reading, you may wonder  why you ever took some of those other expensive and sometimes dissatisfying  vacations.  </P> <P> Information is complete for each destination. A real bargain at $17.95  (Prentice Hall).  </P> <P> So you had another boring and tiring trip on the road. Maybe it's time to  discover the unusual: a brief, relaxing, soothing dip into a pool of naturally  warm springs.  </P> <P> "Hot Springs and Hot Pools in the U.S.," by Jayson Loom, David Bybee and  Marjorie Gersh, detail about 1,500 locations, many of them just short drives  from each other.  </P> <P> These natural hot springs and pools are in primitive settings. While you soak  away your tensions you can envision Indian tribes of the past that used the  same springs for health and spiritual benefits.  </P> <P> The guide zeros in on many sites, some just a few steps from an icy cold  stream, on cliffs overlooking the crashing surf or in secluded areas. Many of  the mineral hot-springs resorts furnish massages, special cuisine and sports  activities.  </P> <P> It includes maps and hundreds of photos. Not to worry about costs, because hot  springs belong to everyone when they are on public land. The guide is  comprehensive, with information by region and state (Publishers Group West:  $17.95).  </P> <P> Most every community in the United States today hosts an annual festival or  celebration. The Poppy State is no exception. Julie Hicks-Herman and Darrin  Craig have listed more than 350 of these year-round events in "The 1990  Festival Hopper's Guide to California."  </P> <P> There's the bean or garlic festivals and stagecoach or street-painting days.  How about a cantaloupe roundup or crab races?  </P> <P> For an unusual adventure try snow golf and snow softball contests at Lake  Tahoe. All events feature food booths, art and crafts, wine tasting, parades,  live music and dancing.  </P> <P> For only $11.95, the guide is an excellent introduction to some unusual  entertainment. It also discusses camping spots, RV facilities, and places to  stay and eat. Each event is pinpointed on maps and offers phone numbers for  more information.

Pamela Lanier's "Condo  Vacations" lists more than 20,000 units available in the United States, Hawaii,  the Caribbean and Canada.  </P> <P> Many feature suites with a minimum of one bedroom and sleeper sofas. Most have  complete kitchens, heat and air-conditioning units and include color and cable  TV. Daily maid service and baby sitters also are available. Many accommodations  feature bathrooms with tubs or Jacuzzis.  </P> <P> If you want to cut costs, you can dine in the quiet of your own place instead  of eating out. It's sort of like having your cake and eating there, too.  </P> <P> Each entry furnishes phone numbers, addresses and tells where to get more  information. It's a bargain for $14.95 at bookstores from Ten Speed Prees.  </P></p>

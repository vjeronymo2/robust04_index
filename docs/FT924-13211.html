			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / West's fears delay repair to reactors: E Europe's crumbling N-plants AN INTERNATIONAL convention to smooth the way to repair of eastern Europe's crumbling nuclear reactors is being held up by fears among western governments and companies that they will be held liable for future radioactive leaks. As governments wrestled with the problem at a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency conference in Vienna yesterday, the Ignalina reactor in Lithuania, the world's largest remaining Chernobyl-type reactor, was shut down for the second time in two months after an internal radiation detector reported 50 times the normal level of radioactivity. Lithuanian radio said there was no danger to local residents. At the same time, environment officials in Bulgaria said the accident-ridden Kozloduy nuclear power plant almost exploded last month when the main switch on a 1,000MW unit short-circuited. Kozloduy has been described as Europe's most dangerous reactor, and the EC has provided emergency funds for repairs. It cannot be shut down because it supplies half Bulgaria's electricity, and its output was due to be increased in the next few weeks because of colder weather. The week-long IAEA meeting has been split over a proposal to make United Nations countries collectively foot the bill for cleaning up after future nuclear leaks. The convention will determine who is liable. The question of liability has become an acute concern since the European Commission began providing funds in the past two years for urgent repairs to the eastern European and former Soviet reactors. Piecemeal repairs are proceeding but many companies have refused to accept liability. Mr David Kyd, spokesman for the IAEA, said: 'There has been great uneasiness among western manufacturers that if something goes wrong in those reactors they could face law suits because their name is on the equipment.' He added: 'This convention will eventually cover that issue, but maybe not soon enough to solve the immediate problems.' The IAEA and Germany have proposed to the agency's standing committee on nuclear liability, which is drawing up the convention, that all signatories should collectively assume liability, including liability for former Soviet and eastern European reactors to enable them to obtain finance for repairs. However, Britain and France have objected that other countries should not be forced to pay for accidents at the eastern European reactors. The IAEA standing committee has moved towards a consensus that there should be an international commission to settle claims for liability, although Britain and France have also resisted this move. A final decision on the liability question is unlikely before the standing committee's next meeting in March.</p>

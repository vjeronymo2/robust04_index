			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hayim Shibi from Washington] </F>   [Excerpts] The Clinton administration is close to deciding  to place the Kakh and Kahana Hay movements on the list of terror  organizations. [passage omitted]    If indeed the U.S. Justice Department decides to place Kakh  and Kahana Hay on the list of terror organizations -- the very  membership in which constitutes a criminal act -- this would be  the first time in U.S. history that Jewish organizations will be  on that list, along with Arab terror organizations.    This might create a situation in which Israel Defense Forces  reserve officers who, according to Kahana Hay leaders, conduct  training camps for the organization members in the United  States, might be listed as members of a terror organization and  become a target of a criminal investigation by the FBI.    Mike Gozovsky, the Kahana Hay Movement spokesman, told our  correspondent that the organization includes 8,000 members who  pay annual membership fees of $36 each. A fund-raising dinner  the movement organized in New York recently, was attended by  some 500 people who paid $125 each.    Another serious problem that might arise if the  organizations  are listed with other terror organizations, would be that  raising funds for them would be banned. Israeli sources in  Washington view with concern the administration acceptance of  the Palestinian request to hold up "fund-raising campaigns for  extremists" in Israel. It is feared that a broad legal  definition would create a dangerous precedent which will create  difficulties for a wide range of fund- raising campaigns in the  future.    It should be noted that the Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza  Settlements Council, the City of Ari'el, and a series of Israeli  public institutions have a regular fund-raising organ based in  the United States. Americans also make donations to the belt  neighborhoods around Jerusalem.</p>

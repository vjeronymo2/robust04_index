			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / BBC in Polish radio application BBC World Service Radio has teamed up with GWR, the Bristol-based commercial radio group, to apply for a commercial radio licence in Warsaw, Raymond Snoddy writes. It is believed to be the first collaboration between a language section of the BBC World Service and a UK commercial broadcaster. Under Polish law foreign broadcasters are only allowed to hold a 33 per cent stake. The two British broadcasters would team up with Zycie Warszawy, the Warsaw daily newspaper. GWR, through a subsidiary, Central European Broadcasting - which already has an interest in a Prague radio station - would probably take a one-third stake. The BBC would have an option for 10 per cent of that stake. Its main role, through its Polish section, would be as a news and programme supplier. The decision on the licence is expected next month.</p>

			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Hanging on for the US 17.1) At the last minute yesterday, an exceptionally humdrum week for the markets turned exciting for the wrong reasons. The US employment figures were yet again bad enough to dash hopes of imminent economic recovery. The market, having decided that a further cut in US interest rates was off the agenda, is now back to expecting one shortly. The dollar, which strengthened on the last rate cut in hopes that the economy had finally reached bottom, has weakened sharply again. Given that the Bundesbank is meanwhile adamant that it will not cut German rates in the face of inflationary wage settlements, it looks rather as if the UK is stuck in the middle again. Even before this news, the UK equity market had contrived to drift downwards every day this week. Nothing in the background is particularly helpful. There were no big company results in the week, or statistics on the domestic economy. The longer the opinion polls go on depicting the two main parties close together, the nearer the market gets to its least favourite outcome of a hung parliament. Meanwhile, the results season looms; and whether or not dividend payments are maintained, very few company chairmen will feel ready to offer any hope of an upturn. Perhaps the best that can be said for the UK market is that it is 160 points down on its record of five months ago. But that is a mere 6 per cent. The worrying thing is that in September the market was not only wrong about the timing of the recovery. It may also have been wrong about its scale.</p>

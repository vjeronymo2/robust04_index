			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / World Trade News: US farmers win subsidies pledge US farm subsidies and programmes will not be cut to make up for the shortfall in government revenue caused by the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, according to Mr Leon Panetta, outgoing director of the budget office, Jeremy Kahn reports from Washington. Mr Panetta made the pledge while speaking before a House agriculture committee. The administration has yet to account for about 25 per cent, or Dollars 3bn, of the tariff revenue that the US will lose under the Uruguay Round. Mr Panetta's assurances to the House committee were intended to quell rumours, circulated by Gatt opponents earlier in the week, that the administration is planning to slash agricultural aid in order to cover the lost revenue.</p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: TI upset Shares in UK engineering company TI Group were hit by reports that Continental Airlines, the fifth largest US carrier, which filed for Chapter 11 protection in December 1990, was about to formally cancel an order for 20 Airbus aircraft. TI's subsidiary Dowty Group, acquired by the company last year after a bitter takeover contest, makes the landing equipment for the aircraft. Continental was also known to have had an option on a further 26 aircraft. The shares fell sharply in response and at the day's worst were down 15 at 308p. Analysts however pointed out that the decision would not be a surprise and, coupled with the strong market trend, the stock recovered to close a net 5 lower at 318p, with turnover having risen to 5.3m. Insurance and pension group Legal &amp; General, whose results on Thursday cheered the market, moved forward, adding 8 to 489p, after BZW upgraded current year profit expectations. The securities house increased its 1993 figure by Pounds 10m to Pounds 174m, and has now pencilled in Pounds 203m for the following year. Sentiment was improved further when BZW also advised investors to switch Prudential and into Legal &amp; General. Shares in Prudential responded by falling 5 to 334p. In a perky building sector, Marley continued its strong run following its results this week. The shares gained 6 to 120p. Spring Ram, which more than halved in price on Thursday following a profits warning, recovered to close 9 1/2 ahead at 73p in turnover of 18m. Selected leisure stocks also benefited from a mood of recovery among investors. Granada Group gained 5 to 371p, buoyed by continued talk that it is poised to buy a big stake in Yorkshire Television. Ladbroke added 8 to 205p as NatWest Securities said 'buy'. The broker believes the group will gain from changes to the rate of ACT and the proposed designation of foreign income dividends. As a result, NatWest raised its EPS forecast by 6 per cent. Forte rose in sympathy, up 4 to 202p. First Leisure jumped 8 to 370p. Brewing stocks, which had languished after the Budget, also caught the revivalist mood. Bass rose 8 to 585p, Allied Lyons 10 to 574p and Whitbread 'A' 13 to 479p. The reports about Continental Airlines were said to have checked the advance of British Aerospace from where analysts emerged from a visit with a positive view about the prospects for the Rover car subsidiary. Following an initial retreat, the shares closed unchanged at 280p. Credit Lyonnais Laing was said to have raised concerns about the accounting methods at Siebe, and was also reported to have executed an overnight sell order in the engineering group. However, another securities house also had a large line of stock on its books. The shares gave up 9 to 472p. Speculation that GKN would soon be on the receiving end of an Pounds 800m order for its Warrior armoured vehicle from Kuwait helped the shares advance 8 to 476p. A press article on Manoplax helped maintain momentum in Boots. The shares jumped 15 to 527p as the stock also continued to bask in press speculation that the OTC market is to be restructured in favour of the larger prescription drug companies. WH Smith was unsettled by a sell note from NatWest Securities, the 'A' shares falling 6 to 434p. Food retail stocks nursed a hangover from the bearish note struck by BZW on Thursday, the broker turning cautious about food price inflation costs. Kwik Save was the worst casualty, retreating 9 to 824p. Asda bucked the trend as NatWest Securities reiterated their positive stance, the shares up a half penny to 75 3/4 p. J Sainsbury bounced back, jumping 10 to 525p. Turnover in Hanson rose to 11m following its subsidiary Peabody's settlement with construction group Costain. Shares in Hanson closed 2 up at 238 1/2 p, while Costain improved 4 to 35p. Oil shares closed an eventful Budget week with share prices under some pressure as profits were taken and sterling strengthened against the dollar. British Petroleum traded fairly calmly at 13m shares and managed to hold on to the overnight quotation of 300p. Similar factors inhibited Shell which gave up 4 to 568p in unimpressive trade of 3.8m shares. There was activity in Lasmo, which at first gained ground but then turned off as a seller appeared. Turnover of 5.1m shares left Lasmo 3 down at 183p.</p>

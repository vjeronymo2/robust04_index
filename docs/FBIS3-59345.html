Analysis of the  Reasons for Inaccuracy in Population Statistics and Regularity  of Family Planning Statistics    There are many reasons for the inaccuracy in population  statistics and in the regularity of family planning statistics.  Some are due to the statistics themselves, but others are due to  non-statistical aspects. For a clear analysis of the reasons for  the inaccuracy of population statistics in relation to the  regularity of family planning statistics, we shall here  distinguish, according to whether the errors are man-made and  intentional, between unintentional and intentional errors.    A. Unintentional Errors    Unintentional errors are then those that are not man-made  and  not intentionally caused by human action. This kind of error may  be due to statistical or also due to non-statistical causes. The  following are some circumstances that generally cause such  errors:    1. One of the major reasons for statistical omissions and  reporting errors are the disfunctional conditions of basic  statistical recording and in card management. Some regions have  not yet set up basic statistical records and cards. Others, that  have already set up statistical records and cards, are  disorderly in keeping these records, or, having set them up  once, neglect keeping them up-to-date. These records will then  be as at a standstill and useless. In some cases they are also  not kept properly classified by items.    2. Inappropriate statistics organization, incompetent  statistics personnel. Statistical work requires a statistical  organization and statistical personnel at six levels, namely at  the state, provincial, prefectural, county, town, and village  levels. At present, many localities do not fulfill these basic  requirements. Below the town level there is on the whole no full  time statistical personnel, and statistical affairs are taken  care of concurrently by cadres in charge of family planning, or  by people who are not released from production or other duties.  Most of these people are poorly educated, they have also  generally not received the necessary training and are hardly fit  for what is a fairly complicated job.    3. Lack of a scientific and rational system of population  and  family planning indices. Certain indices which should not be  included within the scope of family planning, are listed as  important indices in some localities. For instance, it is for  the civil administration or the public security agencies to  register divorces, deaths of spouses, and remarriages, while  family planning work is mainly to guide people to reproduce  according to plan. Besides, there are large differences between  different localities in some indices concerning the same matter.  For instance, for the index to show multiple births, what are  actually used are indices called rate of multiple children,  extra-plan multiple children, number of extra-plan pregnancies,  number of multiple children, etc. Furthermore, the rate of  plan-conforming childbirths are given different meanings. Some  places take as plan-conforming childbirths those that have been  arranged for according to the present year's plan and for which  childbirth certificates have been issued, while others take as  plan-conforming births those that conform with the state and  local family planning plans. Others again consider the first  childbirth at mature age and the second childbirth permitted by  state policy, that conform to the plan, as plan-conforming  childbirths. These differences make comparisons between  districts very difficult and at the same time hinder examination  and checking of indices at the various localities.    4. Statistical methods and methods of checking the quality  of  statistics are comparatively backward. Registration of original  data and much of the summarizing of statistical data from all  levels below the provinces (municipalities), prefectures, and  counties are carried out by hand, and the original records at  many places are not taken down whenever events happen, but are  done in a rush at the end of the month. It is very easy for  mistakes in recording and summarizing to occur in this manner.  There is also no efficient method for an effective check of the  quality of the statistical data, and any examination and  supervision of the quality of the statistical data will  therefore hardly help control statistical errors.    5. Leading cadres in charge of family planning at all levels  and personnel engaged in family planning work are still not yet  fully aware of the important meaning of population statistics as  related to the regularity of family planning statistics, and  they do not attach sufficient importance to the quality of  regularity statistics. These too are important reasons for the  untruthfulness of statistics. There is also the fact that the  "Law Governing Statistics" has not been seriously implemented.  There is a law, but it is being disregarded, and as a result the  law concerning population regularity statistics cannot fully  exert its efficacy.    B. Intentional Errors    Intentional errors are man-made and purposely created  errors.  They have to do with the ideological and moral qualities of  persons, and are not due to the statistics in themselves. They  generally comprise the following kinds:    1. Due to the comparatively serious social, economic, and  educational backwardness in China's rural areas, the desires of  many peasants with regard to childbirths are not in conformity  with what government policy demands. As a consequence, an  excessive population is being created in violation of government  policy on planned childbirths. To evade punishment, the peasants  will conceal facts by every possible means. Personnel in charge  of family planning work will thus be left ignorant of the true  situation and will submit incomplete reports.    2. Family planning statistics at the basic level in the  rural  areas are in general prepared concurrently by cadres in charge  of family planning. In order to ensure fulfillment of the plan  handed down by higher authority, and in order to get credited  with good achievements, these cadres will conceal some facts and  omit them from their reports. In actual work situations, there  are in general two circumstances that will have basic level  personnel in charge of statistics intentionally submit  incomplete reports. One is that work at the basic level is of  poor quality, that great difficulties are encountered, and that  it is impossible to fulfill the plan, or that some higher  ranking family planning department, to retain some extra margin  within the plan norms at its own level, when distributing  population plan norms, will retain a margin for itself at every  level, thus making basic plan norms excessively high and tight,  to satisfy the plan, and will then intentionally compile  incomplete reports to evade responsibility. The other kind is  the effect of unhealthy tendencies in society and consists of  the intentional omission of registrations in order to be  credited with better achievements.    3. Some cadres in charge of implementing government policy  or  some leading cadres, especially those at the village level, are  affected by unhealthy tendencies and submit false reports of  achievements. It was particularly after it was pointed out in  the "Resolution on Strengthening Family Planning Work and on  Strict Control of Population Growth," passed May 1991 by the CPC  Central Committee and the State Council: "We shall make  effective family planning work and fulfillment of population  plans important indices in the assessment of official  achievements of party committees and governments at all levels,"  that family planning work could be "one count against" in the  assessment of an agency's achievements. Thus, population as  related with family planning became of crucial importance in the  assessment of governments and of the achievements in the  official careers of major leading cadres at all levels, which  would then also be critical for their promotions or demotions.  Some leading cadres of less than perfect character would then  resort to deception and falsify or forge statistical data. This  is the main reason for intentional false reports.    The above-mentioned three kinds of intentional false reports  are usually interrelated and made use of together. Because  incomplete and false reports occur at the three levels, namely  with individuals among the general public, with statistics  personnel, and with leading cadres, taking all these together,  the intentional false reports have become the primary cause for  the inaccuracy of population statistics as related to family  planning statistics. At the same time, their joint occurrence  has the effect of increasing the obstruction against the  elimination of false reports and of increasing the difficulties  of such efforts.

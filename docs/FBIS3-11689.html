			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Beth Velloso] </F>   [Text] The Senate voted against increasing deputies'  salaries. Meeting the request of Chamber of Deputies President  Inocencio Oliveira and other leaders, the federal Senate buried  the deputies' dream of increasing their salaries: 54 senators  voted yes, two voted no, and four abstained from voting on the  decision to maintain President Itamar Franco's veto of plans to  make congressmen's salaries equal to the highest ones paid to  Federal Supreme Court members.    Based on the Constitution, Deputy Paulo Delgado (Workers  Party) requested that the 16 March session be annulled. During  this session, the congressmen voted against three other vetoes  of salary increases for public employees working for state-owned  companies and other official organizations and the government  decision to establish ministers of state's salaries as the  ceiling for all public employees' salaries. Delgado made a  motion to the Chamber of Deputies Constitution and Justice  Committee calling for annulment of the session and was supported  by Chamber of Deputies President Oliveira.    [Begin recording] [Delgado] We deem [words indistinct]  ceiling the fastest possible to be able to take the issue to a  plenary session and thus annul that day's voting on these vetoes.    [Unidentified reporter] Therefore, there will be no  immediate  salary increase.    [Delgado] None at all. I believe this is an extremely  difficult moment in which the country is calling for austerity  in all sectors of society and we must set an example. [end  recording]    If the Constitution and Justice Committee decides to annul  the latest congressional session, a plenary session will still  have to be held but at least the possibility of increasing the  salaries of deputies and senators by 23.5 percent has been  entirely dismissed.    In a live report from Congress, reporter Alessandra Anselmo  has more news:    [Begin relay] Chamber of Deputies President Inocencio  Oliveira, who also attended the Planalto Palace meeting seeking  to solve the crisis among the three government branches,  reported that regarding the vetoes of salary equalization --  which were voted against by Congress -- it has been decided that  the government will send Congress another draft bill  establishing the ceiling for public employees' salaries at 90  percent of the salary of a minister of state. Thus, the problem  caused by the presidential veto of the high salaries paid by  state-owned companies, which had been voted against by the  national Congress, has been solved. [end relay]</p>

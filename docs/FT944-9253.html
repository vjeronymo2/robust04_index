			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Symonds returns to the black Symonds Engineering, the sheetmetal and toolmaking specialist, swung back into the black in the six months to September 30 as the benefits of its restructuring programme came through. Concentration on customers requiring higher added value products generated improved margins and resulted in turnover expanding 52 per cent to Pounds 3.21m (Pounds 2.1m) and transformed losses of Pounds 126,000 into pre-tax profits of Pounds 174,000. HBH, the toolmaker acquired for Pounds 560,000 in March, was successfully integrated, according to Mr Rod Ackrill, chairman, and made a 50 per cent contribution to profits. 'HBH has given us a strengthened client base and increased capacity.' Earnings per share emerged at 1.3p (losses of 1.27p) and the interim dividend is restored with a 0.25p distribution.</p>

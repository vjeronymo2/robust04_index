			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Hiroaki Ito from Washington; from the "Kiryu </F> [Air Current]" column: "Groundless U.S. Criticism Against  Japan"]    [Text] During the process leading to the "breakdown" of  the new Japan-U.S. economic consultations, U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor and other officials had repeatedly  voiced the criticism that "no results have been achieved in all  33 past agreements between Japan and the United States," giving  the impression that Japan had not abided by the agreements.  However, such an accusation seems to be groundless.    After the recent Japan-U.S. summit, Kantor told ASAHI  SHIMBUN's General Bureau for America that "we will show you the  list of 33 agreements." However, a spokesman for Kantor later  said, "The list does not exist. We do not have enough material  to compile an official list." "I think somebody briefed the  USTR based on old materials." Thus, no concrete evidence was  presented at all for the criticism.    This criticism constitutes a basis for asserting "Japan is a  nation that will not come up with results unless there are  criteria for gauging the degree of market liberalization in the  future." It has been an important basis for the U.S. position  that "objective numerical criteria are indispensable."    Senior U.S. Government officials also repeated the same  criticism in public and at news conferences at least four times,  and this has certainly influenced public opinion.    However, if the USTR explanation is true, it means that the  United States' repeated official criticism against another  country did not have any clear basis.    The Japanese Government has looked into past agreements, and  compiled documents showing examples of remarkable results of  Japanese efforts -- such as "Under the NTT [Nippon Telegraph and  Telephone Corporation] procurement agreement of 1980, the  purchase of foreign products increased by 46 times in 12 years;  and under the 1988 beef and orange agreement, beef imports  increased by 1.9 times in four years" -- to refute U.S. claims.  It is asking the U.S. government for an explanation.    The Japanese are strongly critical of the United States  because "in past negotiations, the United States has also  criticized Japan based on dubious statistics." "This is the  usual American lawyers' tactic of reiterating arguments that  suit their purpose," (according to a Japanese negotiator).    The main reason for the recent "breakdown" in the framework  talks was the lack of trust between the two parties. What is  needed now is not one-sided criticism and threats, but a  "mature" attitude of not doing anything to aggravate this lack  of trust.</p>

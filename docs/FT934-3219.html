			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Survey of Global Custody (3): Goode ideas lacking - Pension Funds Many custodian banks in the UK were disappointed by the Goode Committee, which released its report, Pension Law Reform, at the end of September. Hopes of a flood of new business for independent custodians were dashed. The Goode Committee, after all, had been appointed to investigate the appropriate legislative responses to the Pounds 400m raid by Mr Robert Maxwell on his various group pension schemes, especially that of Mirror Group Newspapers. One obvious possible recommendation was that assets should be placed in the care of truly independent custodians who would be charged with protecting them against all fraudsters, even those who were renegade company bosses or trustees. This kind of set-up is the practice in the US under the Erisa legislation. There is usually a master trustee which has custody of the assets and deals with a variety of separate investment managers. In the UK, however, there has been no requirement for separate custody at all. Trustees can hold the assets directly if they wish. In practice it has been more common for external investment managers to maintain their own in-house custody arrangements so that Mercury Asset Management, for instance, the market leader, will as a matter of course use its parent bank SG Warburg as its custodian, while Phillips and Drew Fund Management has its own custody offshoot. Naturally the Maxwell scandals raised awkward questions about the security of custody arrangements and many pension funds initiated investigations into their own situation. For example, Fleming Investment Management says that, since the Maxwell crisis broke more than 50 of its pension scheme clients have inspected the custody set-up, which uses the facilities of the parent bank Robert Fleming. Some clients sent trustees and others sent their auditors. But when the Goode Committee looked into the pros and cons of independent custody it decided that this was a blind alley. One crucial characteristic of pension funds, it considered, was that assets were always being changed. 'To deposit securities and other assets with a custodian is not like locking them away in a box to be opened years later when a distribution comes to be made,' the report asserted. There is a constant flow of instructions in connection with securities transactions, and moreover schemes may be involved in stock lending as a matter of routine. As things stand, custodians are not expected to question the propriety of instructions so long as they appear to be in order. If fraud is committed by individuals or a group of people acting within the scope of their apparent authority, the fact that assets are held by a custodian will not by itself be a decisive point. The committee accepted that the intermediation of a custodian may confer some additional degree of security, but not enough to justify the expense and complication of imposing a compulsory custodial role. 'Indeed, there is a danger that the use of custodians may well give the semblance of protection without the reality,' said the report. Instead, the Goode Committee confined itself to some lesser observations. It did suggest, for instance, that trustees had a duty to review their custody arrangements periodically and satisfy themselves that they were satisfactory. The report also discussed the question of the authorisation of custodians. Oddly, custodians are not necessarily regulated in the UK at present, although they may be subsidiary operations of businesses which are regulated, such as banks or investment managers. In practice, many custodians are therefore subjected to indirect regulation through the Bank of England, which issues guidance notes on custody to banks, or through the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation, which imposes detailed rules on regulated fund managers. At the moment the Securities and Investments Board, the top investment regulator, which usually delegates through Imro in the area of professional investment management, is in the process of a formal review of custodians, including the question of whether they should all be directly authorised. In the meantime it seems likely the normal UK practice will continue, namely that most pension fund investment managers are responsible for their own custody arrangements. Although the big US custodian banks such as State Street, Chase Manhattan and Bankers Trust have been making a push for business in the UK, the structure of the pension fund investment business does not favour the domination that the independent custodians have achieved in the US. There, pension plans typically employ a large number - often more than a dozen - of specialist managers which are often quite small. The role of a central (or master) custodian is therefore quite important. In the UK it is still quite rare for pension schemes to have more than about four managers: most have only one or two. A separate custodian therefore represents an extra cost and, possibly, extra complexity. This is especially true because the biggest fund managers have their own proprietary back office systems, which may not easily link with those of independent custodians, and moreover they bundle up custody fees with the normal portfolio management charges. According to Mr Michael Robarts, director in charge of administration at Fleming, his firm is willing to deal with outside custodians if the client desires it. But, he says, 'there will be no reduction in fee'. This is because of the extra cost involved in adjusting to cope with different systems. In the wake of the Goode Report, therefore, it looks as though the idea that independent custodians might provide an easy answer to the security problem has been rejected. Any improvements may have to come from closer control of the way in which instructions are transmitted. In the circumstances, some in the pensions industry are disappointed that neither the Goode Committee nor Imro has yet developed ideas in this area. The aim would be to formalise such questions as signing authority. Perhaps this would not prevent determined fraudsters, but at least it would be easier to allocate blame for any losses, and perhaps that might make those receiving instructions that much more vigilant.</p>

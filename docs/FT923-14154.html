			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Silver steadier after Tuesday's plunge SILVER PRICES recovered slightly yesterday after the sharp drop on Tuesday caused by extraordinarily heavy selling by the National Commercial Bank of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia's sole private bank. An NCB official told Reuter that the quantity - sold in only two hours  - was less than 20m ounces. The silver sales were 'a purely commercial transaction' on behalf of big Saudi clients, said the official. However, traders were sceptical about this claim. Some suggested it would have required between 40m and 50m troy ounces, or more than 1,244 tonnes, worth Dollars 160m, to have driven the price down so steeply. This represents about 12 per cent of annual world demand for silver, used mainly by the photographic and electronic industries. Traders continued to link the sell-off with Tuesday's resignation of Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, deputy general manager of the NCB, who is fighting charges by a New York grand jury that he defrauded depositors of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International. After its plunge by 20 cents an ounce on Tuesday, silver closed in London last night up 4 cents at Dollars 3.91 an ounce. Traders suggested that the market had been unable to absorb all the Saudi silver and more metal was likely to be sold if the price rallied above Dollars 3.95. In 1990 the NCB hit the gold market with heavy sales and there was some relief yesterday that the Bank had concentrated only on silver on Tuesday. Some New York speculators sold gold short (sold metal they did not own, hoping to buy it later at a lower price) on Tuesday, gambling that the NCB would also drive down the gold price. They later had to scramble to cover their positions and this helped gold to rise yesterday. It closed in London at Dollars 347.70 a troy ounce, up Dollars 2.05.</p>

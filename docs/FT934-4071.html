			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Taxation - an anachronistic argument and a proposed reform Sir, John Plender's interesting article on taxation ('Revolutionary forces which will destroy income tax', November 27) unfortunately repeated the anachronistic Treasury argument against hypothecation: namely that if taxes are earmarked, spending oscillates in line with the economic cycle rather than with need. In an era of financial sophistication there is no more reason why this should be the case for an earmarked tax than for government revenues as a whole, or indeed for businesses. Any half-way competent chief executive of the National Health Service receiving an earmarked tranche of income tax would naturally plan spending and investment to take account of the business cycle rather than being a slave to the rigidities of the annual budget. There are good arguments against hypothecation but, like the oft-repeated claim that because few people fully understand the uses of national insurance payments today they could in no way grasp a more transparent and earmarked tax system, this is not one of them.

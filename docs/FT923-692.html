			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Urbane Brooke aims for patient progress: Mellor's unexpected successor WHEN he was Northern Ireland secretary, Mr Peter Brooke once leaned out of a large window overlooking Horse Guards Parade in London. He watched the crowds dispersing in the fading evening light after a ceremonial display of troops Beating the Retreat. 'Isn't that picture just like a Canaletto?' he asked the guests he was entertaining. Few at Westminster yesterday regarded the traditionalist, slightly-fogeyish Mr Brooke, 58, as a natural choice as heritage secretary and the job of overseeing the eclectic world of the arts. He has not deliberately cultivated an image as a man of aesthetics. His reputation is more as a gracious, if unremarkable, former Treasury minister who fared badly as party chairman but somehow defied expectations to bring Northern Ireland's feuding political leaders to the negotiating table. Mr Brooke nearly fell from the cabinet in January after singing 'Oh my darling Clementine' on an Irish television chat show only hours after an IRA bomb had murdered seven civilians in County Tyrone. He finally left the cabinet for the backbenches after the general election - deliberately, in order to contest the election for the Commons speakership, Downing Street revealed yesterday. He failed in his bid. But Mr Brooke's style of politics is not narrow-minded or ideological. He at least tries to cultivate an artist's eye. He interests are listed in Who's Who as 'churches, conservation, cricket, pictures and planting things'. Mr Brooke's greatest strength is probably his patience, exemplified by his frequently protracted deliberations with Northern Ireland's political leaders. His style is to persuade, not provoke. He is unlikely, for example, to seek a confrontation with either the BBC, whose future lies largely in his hands, or with the competing interests anxious about the forthcoming national lottery. Perhaps most surprising is the prime minister's decision to bring Mr Brooke's back into his cabinet. Although a senior Downing Street official described the two as 'old friends', they are not political bedfellows. Mr Brooke is a conservative with a small 'c' and gently paternalistic by character. But Mr Major appears to have been impressed by Mr Brooke's performance at the Northern Ireland Office. Mr Brooke is also loyal - any tension between the two has never surfaced publicly. To a prime minister facing a cabinet embroiled in near-public splits over European and economic policy, a senior politician who can be trusted to back the official line in areas outside his department is a valuable ally.

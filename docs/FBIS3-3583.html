According to local officials, Yunnan exported machinery and  electrical products worth 102.75 million U.S. dollars in 1993,  up 48.2 percent compared with the previous year.    Bordering Myanmar [Burma], Laos and Vietnam, the province  has  been making efforts to make full use of its geographical  advantages over the past few years.    In opening up markets for its machinery and electrical  products, it has adopted a policy of giving priority to the  development of the Southeast Asian market while strengthening  traditional markets in Hong Kong, Macao, Europe and the United  States.    Besides building more special production bases for machinery  and electrical products in the province and sending missions to  hold fairs of machinery and electrical products in neighboring  countries, the relevant local departments have also adopted  flexible ways of trading to boost exports of such products,  including spot exchange trade, barter trade, buyer's credit and  seller's credit, and have achieved marked results.    For instance, the province has experienced a rise of 81  percent in its exports of machinery and electrical products to  the United States.    So far, Yunnan exports more than 70 kinds of machinery and  electrical products, as against only a dozen kinds in 1984,  since when the quality of its products for export has kept  improving. The proportion of products for export with higher  technical content and machinery, and instruments and meters with  higher added value is increasing rapidly, the officials added.</p>

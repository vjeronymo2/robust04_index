			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUP ATTEMPT AGAINST GEN. NORIEGA  </P> <P> In response to "Bush Takes Residence in an Indecisive House of Halfway  Measures," by Charles Krauthammer, Op-Ed Page, Oct. 6:  </P> <P> This column claims that the United States government should have intervened in  the failed Panamanian coup. It viciously slashed at President Bush's lack of  action in what appeared to be an attempt to overthrow Noriega.  </P> <P> I would just like to point out that the rebels were not freedom-loving  democratic white knights. They were a bunch of power-hungry Noriega wanna-bes  who wished to " . . . help him retire quietly." This was not a coup. Rather, it  was a feeble attempt to wrest power away from Noriega by his own followers.  This is clearly illustrated by the fact that they neglected to eliminate  Noriega when they had the chance. These rebels did not want to change  Panamanian society for the better; nor did they want to right the social  injustices and cruel inhumanities wrought by Noriega's regime. They wanted  power for themselves. They were motivated purely by greed.  </P> <P> Now I ask Krauthammer: Why should the U.S. involve itself in the petty internal  affairs of some Latin American nation, when the involvement could only hinder  American foreign policy objectives in Central America? Is it worth it to get  rid of one "two-bit drug-runner?"  </P> <P> CHRIS LOHR  </P> <P> San Clemente  </P></p>

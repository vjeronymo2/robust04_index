			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo Uncertainty in European bond markets and profit-taking by domestic institutions ahead of the September book closing are expected to weigh on Japanese government bonds this week. The higher yen supported bond prices last week on hopes of dampening prospects of an economic recovery, but such expectations were dashed by government comments that the economy was gradually pulling out of a slump. Overall activity may be subdued as many investors are on their Obon holidays until mid-week. But traders say more banks are shifting their Japanese government bond portfolios into euroyen straight bond issues. The moves come as the year's fall in government bond prices has left many financial institutions with unrealised losses. A Tokyo Stock Exchange disclosure rule requires listed companies to release unrealised losses on listed securities portfolios if the figure is equal to or more than 30 per cent of pre-tax or net profits. Institutions reluctant to reveal their loss-making positions are switching into unlisted euroyen straight bonds from government bonds. 'There is a big switch going on as the supply and demand situation for various classes of bonds are changing,' says Mr Marshall Gittler, bond analyst at Merrill Lynch in Tokyo. He says the trend is raising yields in government bonds.</p>

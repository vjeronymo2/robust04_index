			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> AN ONGOING BATTLE OVER FISH INSPECTION  </P> <P> In the latest twist of the convoluted turf battle over fish inspection, the  Food and Drug Administration and the National Marine Fisheries Service --  backed by the Bush administration -- are proposing to strengthen the present  voluntary fish inspection program, with industry picking up the tab.  </P> <P> FDA and NMFS are already getting criticism from consumer groups and industry,  who in a rare meeting of the minds, have been jointly fighting for mandatory  fish inspection.  </P> <P> The plan is also making waves in Congress, where there are nine bills pending  for mandatory legislation, and in the Agriculture Department, which had hoped  for a piece of the action.  </P> <P> Unlike meat and poultry, seafood is the only flesh food not under  comprehensive, mandatory federal oversight for wholesomeness and safety. Two  agencies provide a patchwork of seafood protection:  </P> <P>  -- A voluntary National Marine Fisheries Service inspection program affected  approximately 11 percent of the total seafood consumed in the country last year  and 7 percent of the processors. The program, which processors pay for, focuses  primarily on quality and appearance of seafood, not safety.  </P> <P>  -- The Food and Drug Administration visits the nation's more than 4,000  seafood processors and wholesalers approximately once every four years,  conducts lab analyses for the presence of contaminants, and maintains a  shellfish safety program with the states in which there have been repeated  instances of nonconformity.  </P> <P> Neither NMFS nor FDA certifies boats, while efforts to monitor imports are  spotty and there is widespread agreement that shellfish harvesting regulations  need to be better enforced.  </P> <P> Under the new NMFS-FDA plan, vessel owners, processors and distributors who  choose to pay the government for inspection services could opt for a more  safety-oriented regime, known as Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point.  </P> <P> Instead of the traditional meat-and-poultry inspection system where an  inspector is continuously on hand checking all facets of an operation, under a  HACCP system, only those points where contamination is most likely to occur are  monitored.  </P> <P> The system -- which checks everything from the maximum time fish can remain on  a loading dock to the temperature of the room where filleting is being done to  the length of time that breaded shrimp are chilled after cooking -- has been  broadly supported.  </P> <P> Visual and hands-on inspection is largely viewed as antiquated and generally  inadequate at spotting the invisible bacteria that can lead to food poisoning.  </P> <P> The seafood industry, which has been working for several years on developing  the standards and methods for HACCP, supports the approach. It is concerned,  however, that the two agencies are plunging ahead with an incomplete program  that raises more questions than it answers, and that it may become a substitute  for a mandatory program instead of an interim solution.  </P> <P> In addition, the voluntary nature of the program defeats the purpose of HACCP,  which is designed to monitor all the critical points of the fish as they travel  from the water to the table, according to Richard Gutting, vice president of  government relations of the National Fisheries Institute, the trade group  representing the fishing industry.  </P> <P> Thomas Billy, director of NMFS's Office of Trade and Industry Services, said it  is hoped that the plan would have a trickle-down effect; a wholesaler who chose  to participate would only purchase fish from a participating processor who  would buy only from an HACCP-inspected boat.  </P> <P> As for questions that remain, Billy admitted that the plan is "still in the  formative stage" and that "it's not like we have all the answers. We're really  looking for public input."  </P> <P> They're already getting it. "The idea is a bunch of hogwash," said Rep. Gerry  Studds, D-Mass., whose district includes the major fishing port of New Bedford.  "While we're working here diligently to get (mandatory) legislation through,  FDA and Fisheries talk about a voluntary system that is unacceptable to  virtually everyone."  </P> <P> Billy of NMFS disagrees. "Since we have begun to talk about the idea, we've  gotten some very favorable responses from a number of people in the seafood  industry that believe it is important that we get started now while we wait to  see what, if any legislation gets passed."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, some industry, consumer and Congressional staffers view the FDA  and NMFS proposal as a power grab and a way to end run more comprehensive  legislation. In five of the nine bills pending in Congress, the Department of  Agriculture is designated as the responsible agency.  </P> <P> FDA and NMFS "are the two agencies which stand to lose authority under some of  the legislative proposals," said Gutting of NFI, which would like USDA to be in  charge of fish inspection. "We know that they not only very much want to retain  their authority but also increase it. It's not surprising that some people have  concluded that this is an effort to cut off more comprehensive legislation, but  the agencies, to be fair, have not told us those are their intentions."  </P> <P> Derailing legislation, said NMFS' Billy, "is not the intent at all."  </P> <P> An FDA official added that "it's more of a power grab for USDA. The program is  ours today. There's nothing wrong with it except that it's a little anemic."  </P> <P> What's more, even though Billy believes that in the current budget climate,  user fees may be the only way to fund such a program, skeptics of the plan  object to industry paying for its own regulation.  </P> <P> "Inspection of food is a public purpose function and should be paid for under  the treasury of the United States because people's health and safety are  involved," said Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan. "We don't have user fees for meat and  poultry. You're talking about public health. And this is the biggest public  health issue that Congress will have to face this year."  </P> <P> Just how much of a public health risk seafood poses is difficult to ascertain  as seafood-associated disease data are largely recognized to be incomplete.  While federal officials do not believe consumers face a serious health problem  from eating seafood, they do believe there is some risk posed by a limited  number of species -- primarily raw molluskan shellfish.  </P> <P> Aside from the health implications, the new plan touches a sensitive chord in  the Bush administration's indecision about which agency should be given  responsibility for fish inspection.  </P> <P> Last year, a number of meetings were held between the administration and the  agencies involved, but the administration declined to take a position, instead  deferring to Congress to make the decision.  </P> <P> An administration official who was involved in the meetings admits that "it  would have been a lot neater" if the White House had favored an agency to take  charge. "The bottom line is that the agencies had their own strong personal  views and desires and it was not felt that a compromise was possible. It was  not a big enough matter to go to the president, and have him say 'one of you  wins and other two lose,' " the official said.  </P> <P> Then, more recently, $14 million earmarked for improving fish inspection showed  up in the administration's 1991 Budget. According to Billy of NMFS, the  Fisheries Service and FDA proposed a mandatory scheme (with user fees) to  budget officials at the Office of Management and Budget, who declined to  provide the $90 million to start up the program. NMFS and FDA then came up with  the idea of strengthening the present voluntary program.  </P> <P> Yet to some wishful observers, policy officials in the administration are still  undecided about fish inspection, even though budget officials have already  designated additional money for FDA and NMFS for a voluntary program.  </P> <P> Secretary of Agriculture Clayton Yeutter, who from the start has been lobbying  for USDA to take over the responsibility, is reportedly not pleased with the  current proposal. In speaking to reporters recently, Yeutter said, "I still  think it would be a good idea and I still think it (USDA) is a proper place to  have that kind of program, but obviously any official pronouncements on that  subject must be reflective of an administration consensus and to my knowledge,  that consensus has not yet emerged."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, White House deputy press secretary Alixe Glen said the  administration does support the new FDA-NMFS plan.  </P></p>

			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / International Company News: Austria's savings banks get deadline Austria's savings banks have until the end of February to agree on radical restructuring plans for the savings bank sector or face a solution imposed jointly by Bank Austria, the country's largest commercial bank, and Erste Oesterreichische Spar-Casse, a leading savings bank, according to Mr Rene Alfons Haiden, BA chairman and chief executive. Proposals by the Erste envisage the establishment of a holding company in which all or most savings banks would participate. This would be accompanied by a reorganisation of GiroCredit, which is both clearing institution for the savings banks and a commercial bank in its own right. Erste owns 21 per cent of GC. Under the plan, BA, which holds almost 31 per cent in GC, would sell about two-thirds of its holding to a consortium consisting of Erste, the provincial savings banks and Austria Collegialiat Versicherung, a leading insurance company. The shares would be held by the new holding company. The plan however, has so far failed to generate much enthusiasm from provincial savings banks, which fear they will lose power and influence as a result. However Mr Haiden says the discussion must end. 'We've been discussing (proposals) for a year and a half, and that's too long. 'If (the proposals) are not successful, then it is the responsibility of Bank Austria and Erste together to see what can be done and to take responsibility for GiroCredit,' he said. He added that this was likely to involve changes on GC's management and supervisory boards, as well as a thorough re-assessment of the bank's priorities and tasks. Such changes would have to be approved by an extraordinary general assembly of GiroCredit shareholders as the next general assembly is not due until the end of April.</p>

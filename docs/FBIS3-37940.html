			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Feb 23, BNS -- "The border was of course  violated in this case," Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gylys said,  commenting on unauthorized transit of a Russian echelon through  Lithuanian territory Feb. 19.    The Russian echelon crossed the Lithuanian border from the  side of the Kaliningrad region last Saturday [19 February]  without any official permission of Lithuanian authorities and  even without an advance warning. The train carried 26 infantry  fighting vehicles, which were escorted by armed Russian  soldiers. The Russian servicemen did not have special  permissions for carrying weapons on Lithuanian territory.    Lithuanian authorities let the echelon pass, to avoid any  accumulation of military equipment near the state border.  Lithuanian border officials followed the echelon until it  crossed the country's eastern border and entered Belarusian  territory.    On Tuesday, Gylys called in Nikolai Obiortyshev, Russian  ambassador to Lithuania, to explain the incident.    "I spoke with Ambassador Obiortyshev, we analyzed the  happening and I asked that the Russian side pay attention to  this unpleasant event and that such cases are not repeated  again," Gylys told Lithuanian TV.    Judging from the interview, Lithuania did not register any  official protest over the incident.    The Lithuanian minister noted that Lithuania and Russia do  not have any treaties on military transit. Russian military  transit from the region is carried out in accordance with the  established order of Russian transit from Germany via the  Mukran-Klaipeda ferry.    But Gylys pointed out with satisfaction that Russian transit  is mainly outward bound, i.e. moves from the region to Russia.  The minister said "only fuel and other goods, food but not  weapons, not soldiers" move in the direction of Kaliningrad.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ever Rincon] </F>   [Text] The Army is continuing its intensive search  operations in an attempt to rescue U.S. citizen Ramon Rissen  safe and sound. Rissen is the security chief at the Summer  Linguistic Institute in Loma Linda, Meta Department. General  Luis Bernardo Urbina Sanchez, commander of the Army's 7th  Brigade, has commented on this kidnapping and other issues for  Radio Caracol.    [Begin Urbina recording] He was riding a motorcycle along  the  highway between the municipal capital of Puerto Lleras and Loma  Linda, where the Summer Linguistic Institute operates. During  the trip he was intercepted by individuals we believe are--or we  are certain are--members of the 43d Front of the FARC  [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]. They violently took  him away. We had certain information about where they initially  took him, but we learned later they had moved. We have been  unable to recontact them. [end recording]    Urbina also said there is no information on the whereabouts  of the two U.S. missionaries Steve Welch and Timothy Vandyck,  whom FARC guerrillas also kidnapped in the hamlet of San Jose,  near Villavicencio, on 16 January.</p>

(``PSE'' or ``exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change to amend PSE Rule 6.87, ``Automatic Execution System,'' to allow the Options Floor Trading Committee (``OFTC'') to be authorized to increase, on an issue-by-issue basis, the size of the equity option orders that may be eligible to be executed through the Exchange's Automatic Execution System (``Auto-Ex'') up to a maximum of 20 contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34702 (September 22, 1994), 59 FR 49729 (September 29, 1994).

Participating market makers are designated as the contra side to each Auto-Ex order. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  Participating market makers are assigned by Auto-Ex on a rotating basis, with the first market maker selected at random from the list of signed-on market makers. Auto-Ex preserves public Limit Order Book (``Book'') priority in all options. If Auto-Ex determines that the Book price is at or better than the market quote, the Auto-Ex order is executed against the Book. Automatic executions through Auto-Ex are currently available for public customer orders of 10 contracts or less in all series of options traded on the PSE's options floor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission recently approved an Exchange proposal setting forth certain standards for market makers participating on Auto-Ex. The standards include restrictions on the number of Auto-Ex trading posts at which market makers may participate and mandatory log-on requirements to assure that market makers do not withdraw from the system during volatile market conditions. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32908 (September 15, 1993), 58 FR 49076 (September 21, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchanges proposes to amend PSE Rule 6.87 to increase the maximum size of equity option orders eligible for Auto-Ex and to provide the OFTC with the authority to designate such changes on an issue-by-issue basis. Under the proposal, the OFTC is authorized to increase the size of orders eligible for an execution on Auto-Ex to a size of up to 20 contracts without separate approval from the Commission. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  The PSE states that the proposed rule change is designed to enhance the Exchange's ability to compete for options order flow. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission recently approved an Exchange proposal to allow the OFTC to increase the size of Auto-Ex-eligible orders in one or more classes of multiple traded equity options to the extent that other options exchanges permit such larger-size orders to be entered into their own automated execution systems. The rule provides that if the OFTC intends to increase the Auto-Ex size eligibility pursuant to the rule, the Exchange will submit a proposed rule change to the Commission pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) under the Act. See securities Exchange Act Release No. 34131 (May 27, 1994), 59 FR 29316 (June 6, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PSE believes that any implementation of the proposal by the OFTC will not impose any significant additional burdens on the operation and capacity of the POETS system in general or on the Auto-Ex system in particular. In that regard, the Exchange has submitted a separate capacity statement to the Commission setting forth the basis for this contention. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  The exchange also represents that the OFTC will determine that adequate market making capacity exists prior to increasing Auto-Ex order size eligibility. The OFTC will make such a determination notwithstanding the fact that floor officials may require market makers who are members of a trading crowd to which a particular option class is assigned to log onto Auto-Ex in the event that there is inadequate participation in that options class. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Letter from Michael D.

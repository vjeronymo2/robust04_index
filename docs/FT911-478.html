			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Books: Murky Vichy water - Britain's murderous involvement ASSASSINATION IN ALGIERS by Anthony Verrier Macmillan Pounds 20, 302 pages ON CHRISTMAS Eve, 1942, 21-year-old Fernand Bonnier fired two shots into the stomach of Jean-Francois Darlan, the Vichy leader in North Africa. Two hours later Admiral Darlan died. The assassin, who had expected to escape, was shot after a court martial in Algiers. Behind this assassination was a complex and tangled story which Anthony Verrier has tried to unravel using British and American secret service papers and interviews with informed British and French respondents to compensate for the lack of officially available documents. The Darlan saga was part of a series of conflicts not easy to explore in a short book. The most important was the growing divergence between the pro-Vichy and savagely anti-Gaullist Roosevelt, who believed Darlan could deliver North Africa into Allied hands, and Winston Churchill, favourably disposed towards de Gaulle despite moments of irritation bordering on fury and with a far more realistic view of the Vichy gamble. Having persuaded the Americans to invade North Africa, Churchill found it necessary to propitiate Roosevelt by acquiescing in the president's pro-Vichy line without abandoning his preferred alternative. The divisions between Frenchmen were even more complicated. The situation in North Africa differed markedly from that in France. The main contenders for control in Algiers, Darlan, Giraud and de Gaulle, each had wider political ambitions which made control of North Africa pertinent to the French situation. In France, the London-backed Resistance looked to de Gaulle, and by 1942 the British were pledged to the Gaullists though many had strong doubts about their leader. In the overwhelmingly pro-Vichy North Africa, the Gaullist element represented a tiny minority. Time and circumstance determined local loyalties; supporters hedged their bets and changed sides. Roosevelt's political emissary, Robert Murphy, was lost in this quagmire of shifting political alliance. He ultimately opted for Darlan who, as Verrier confirms, ran circles around the American. The British had no equivalent political figure in Algiers until Harold Macmillan in 1943, but they had two SOE missions in place, 'Brandon' and 'Massingham', building up an anti-Vichy front. The real Anglo-American divide came with the bargain struck in November, 1942 between Darlan and General Mark Clark confirming the former's authority over North Africa in return for a French ceasefire. Eisenhower, in command of 'Torch', was to remain loyal to this bargain despite growing doubts about Darlan's loyalty. On the British side, after months of equivocation in London, it was agreed that Darlan was an impossible choice. The British were committed to de Gaulle and the Free French. Diplomatic pressure from the British and Gaullists failed to move the Americans. In this unequal contest, the British felt forced to turn to clandestine operations. It is at this point that Verrier's account is of gripping interest and where his reconstruction of events, if accurate, makes for fascinating reading. All the tangled threads are brought together. If, as the author argues, there was no concerted plan to eliminate Darlan, the measures taken by British Intelligence described in this chapter made his assassination inevitable. Desmond Morton, Churchill's chief intelligence adviser, was involved, and Colonel Keswick, second in command of 'Massingham', began new operations in the murky world of Algiers. There was a key meeting in Gibraltar, on December 4, with Morton present, for those to be involved in Darlan's removal. Henri d'Astier, an equivocal figure serving on Darlan's staff, was recruited to operate covertly with the British and given funds by OSS; his brothers, Jean Bernard and General Francoise d'Astier, were with de Gaulle; the latter was sent to Algiers for discussions with an unwelcoming Eisenhower but also to warn Henri that the Gaullists should lie low, The final role was played by Bonnier, one of a small group of young anti-Darlan Frenchmen, who had been given uniforms, rations and pay by 'Brandon'. On November 18, Bonnier to his horror drew the short straw. Verrier cannot say what or who finally pushed Bonnier over the edge. Giraud, though absent from Algiers at the time, took power, wasting little sympathy on Darlan but demanding that Bonnier be tried. At his court martial the young man claimed to have acted alone. It was decided by d'Astier that he was not to be rescued. The Darlanites had a victim; the anti-Vichyites a youthful martyr. Verrier provides vivid descriptions of the clean-up operations in Algiers and the subsequent contest between Giraud and de Gaulle. There is much new material here and the discriminating reader will be richly rewarded. The difficulty is that this book falls between two stools. Despite Verrier's efforts and simplification, the general reader will find this a tangled trail to follow. The better informed will bridle at some of the author's unqualified generalisations and at the lack of any but the most perfunctory scholarly apparatus. The author has shown in previous studies that he has special access to intelligence sources. Many of his most startling disclosures have been confirmed by papers that have come into the public domain. In this account, however, references to open sources are unacceptably sparse, irregular, and incomplete. The notes are tantalisingly brief. No one is helped by the fact that this book is badly written. One cannot help but feel that Verrier had a different book in mind. The result is everyone's loss.</p>

			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / International Company News: IBM considers plan for PC division A SEPARATE personal computer division may be the latest step in International Business Machines' strategy to transform itself from a monolithic giant into a loose federation of smaller, more competitive, business units. Industry analysts attending a meeting with IBM executives earlier this week were told of plans to create a new subsidiary which would design, develop, manufacture and market IBM personal computers. It would have worldwide revenues of about Dollars 7bn, on a par with those of most leading computer manufacturers. The plan is thought to be the brainchild of Mr James Cannavino, the energetic head of IBM's PC business, but the company this week refused to confirm or deny that he had been given the go-ahead. A spokesperson said several avenues were being considered in the company's efforts to improve the competitiveness of its PC business. IBM is the world's largest manufacturer of PCs, but its profitability has been badly affected by falling hardware prices as components have become cheaper and fierce competition from manufacturers of copies ('clones') of IBM's machines, which have become the industry standard. The plan to set up a separate PC subsidiary follows moves in Europe and Canada to set up separate organisations to market low-cost PCs in direct competition with the clone-makers. There is sound logic behind the idea of casting loose the company's PC business. Culturally, PC operations, which depend on fast responses to market conditions, do not sit comfortably within large mainframe computer companies. IBM's shares fell Dollars 2 1/8 to close at Dollars 88 1/4 in New York on forecasts that there would be little or no growth this year in its mainframe business. Hewlett-Packard said projected earnings for the fiscal third quarter ended July 31 would be below analysts' expectations of Dollars 1.12 a share, Reuter reports. The US computer and electronics group said earnings could range from about equal to the 76 cents a share earned in the same period last year to 15 per cent higher. It said orders in some businesses, such as printers and medical equipment, remained strong, but weak capital spending was affecting its orders in other areas, such as test and measurement equipment.</p>

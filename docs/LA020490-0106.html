			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORDING A CRITICAL 'RIGOLETTO'  </P> <P> Both of these recordings purport to use the recent critical edition, but only  Muti's is the real thing. No official mention of an edition of any kind is made  in the actual London release. Apparently, such reference is too complicated for  American consumers. British purchasers, however, get a program note from  Chailly explaining that he consulted with the singers before deciding to keep  in certain "performance traditions." Translated, that means if Pavarotti,  Anderson and Nucci didn't want to learn new passages and wanted to keep  accustomed high notes, they were given permission.  </P> <P> Chailly offers a brisk, no-nonsense performance with strong dramatic accents.  Anderson's Gilda shows both purity of tone and bravura brilliance. She commands  Sutherland-like solidity in the middle and lower ranges, if not her  predecessor's perfect trill. Pavarotti gives his most thoughtful, nuanced and  imaginatively characterized singing on records in years. Nucci's contribution  is generally monochromatic, hard pressed in the climaxes. Verrett's Maddalena  is tentative (she sounds as if she's sight-reading) and barely audible in the  middle register. Ghiaurov remains a smoothly effective Sparafucile.  </P> <P> Muti's grasp of the score is masterly, and the splendid Scala orchestra  responds with brio, but "Rigoletto" is not just a conductor's opera. No high  notes here, and considering his cast, it's just as well.  </P> <P> Although Zancanaro's suave baritone is superior to Nucci's, Dessi is a rather  acidic Gilda whose soprano turns ugly when pressure is applied. La Scola's dry,  constricted tenorino might be appropriate for Arturo in "Lucia," certainly not  for the elegant Duke. Senn is an ordinary Maddalena, but Burchaladze's bass,  though wobbly, creates a subtly menacing assassin.  </P> <P> VERDI: "RIGOLETTO." Leo Nucci, June Anderson, Luciano Pavarotti, Shirley  Verrett, Nicolai Ghiaurov; forces of Teatro Comunale, Bologna, Riccardo Chailly  conducting; London 425864-2 (2 compact discs).  </P> <P> VERDI: "RIGOLETTO." Giorgio Zancanaro, Daniela Dessi, Vincenzo La Scola, Marta  Senn, Paata Burchaladze; forces of La Scala, Milan, Riccardo Muti conducting;  EMI 7 49605 2 (2 compact discs).  </P></p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: BAA The temptation for BAA to try to replicate its winning UK formula in overseas markets seems, at first glance, irresistible. BAA's expertise in the low-cost construction, retail management and controlling of airports is clearly in demand. Australia's airport privatisation, for which approval at the Labor party conference this week would clear the way, is unlikely to be the last programme initiated by a cash-strapped government turning to the private sector to fund airport infrastructure. But so far the benefits of BAA's internationalisation have proved elusive. Its management contract at Pittsburgh has, in just one year, lifted spending from less than Dollars 4 per passenger to more than Dollars 6, but the operation adds little to BAA's bottom line. The danger is that by offering such consultancy services BAA sells off its blue-prints for success. To make a good return the company needs to take equity stakes. But there are few countries willing to cede control of their airports to foreigners. In any case, BAA does not need to internationalise. The group expects passenger volumes at its UK airports to increase 4 per cent a year, lifting passenger numbers at Heathrow alone from 48m presently to 80m by 2016. Passenger spending can also be raised. In spite of BAA's undoubted skill, most of its terminals still yield less than Singapore's Changi or Amsterdam's Schiphol. The group is busy expanding retail space by 80 per cent. The first stage, at Heathrow's terminal four, raised spending per passenger by 30 per cent. Given such opportunities at home, the rewards overseas will have to be alluring to make them worth the distraction.</p>

			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Mortality up in northern areas Death rates for some age groups in the poorest areas of northern England have risen for the first time since the 1930s, according to a study into inequalities in health. The research highlights a widening gap between affluent and poor areas of north-east England and Cumbria in the 1980s. It shows the health and mortality record improving for the wealthiest, but deteriorating for the poorest. The study is based on detailed analysis of health and mortality records in all 678 wards of north-east England and Cumbria from the 1981 to 1991. It shows that in the most deprived 20 per cent of wards the death rate rose for the first time in 50 years for men aged 15 to 44 and women aged 65 to 74. It also indicates a rise in low weight births (below 2.5 kg) in the poorest areas. The report says that with the social and economic changes of the 1980s it should not be a surprise that the population's health echoes economic indicators which point to growing polarisation between the fortunes of the affluent and the poor. It says mass redundancies and a contraction of employment opportunities due to steady industrial decline in the region in the first half of the 1980s left a legacy of very high long-term unemployment, which was compounded in the second half of the decade by cuts in state benefits.

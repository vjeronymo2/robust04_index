			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Sukhova: "Briefing at the Ministry of </F> Foreign Economic Relations: Russia Does Not Want To Give Up a  Positive Trade Balance with the West"]    [Text] Oleg Davydov, minister of foreign economic  relations of Russia, talked at yesterday's briefing about the  negotiations that were held in Switzerland with OPEC leaders and  also about certain prospects for the decentralization of foreign  economic activity.  <H5>  Concerning Negotiations with OPEC leaders </H5>   The main theme of the negotiations was the sharp drop in oil  prices (to $12-$12.5 per barrel). However, as Mr. Davydov noted,  the Russian delegation was also disturbed by the situation  concerning gas prices. The world consumption of oil at present  amounts to 63-64 million barrels per day, of which OPEC covers  24 million, or a maximum of 28 million, barrels. The remainder  is supplied by so-called "independent exporters." In Mr.  Davydov's words, the OPEC proposal on Russia's joining the  "independents" was discussed at the negotiations, but Moscow is  not yet ready to adopt it, just as it is not ready to join OPEC.  At the same time, the minister thinks that "coordination in the  actions of Russia and the cartel should be activated," at least  at the level of consultations.  <H5>  Concerning the Import Tariff </H5>   The MVES [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations], in the  words of the minister, is against increasing the import tariff,  although there are different opinions in the government. In Mr.  Davydov's opinion, given the absence of competition in the  domestic market, an increase in import duties will provoke a  price increase. Mr. Davydov noted that "political figures of the  Zaveryukha type" forget that in today's economic situation it is  not "customs duties that are to blame but the absence of  consumer demand on the Russian market." The minister urged  everyone not to forget about responsibility for adopting such  protectionist measures, because similar retaliatory measures  against Russia can be employed on the part of the West. Mr.  Davydov named acting Minister of Finance Sergey Dubinin and  Deputy Prime Minister Anatoliy Chubays among his allies.  <H5>  Concerning Exports of Cartels </H5>   The head of Russia's MVES directed attention to the question  of control over exports. In his opinion, exporters should  control the market themselves and come to an agreement among  themselves about export volumes and prices. For this, Mr.  Davydov proposed to create a special organization of  exporters--cartels. But "the initiative must come from them  themselves." The state, in the form of the MVES, "should get out  of export-import deliveries altogether and implement them only  along the line of critical imports (for example, medicines)."  <H5>  Concerning Decentralization of Foreign Economic Activity </H5>   The state, in the words of Mr. Davydov, is generally  "striving to get out of centralized imports." Today, there is a  positive balance of several millions of dollars in trade with a  number of Western countries. But Russia refuses to satisfy the  requirement of Western partners to equalize the trade balance,  and to use the "difference" for the purchase of their products.  Moscow proposes to use acquired currency resources to stabilize  the economy.</p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / International Company News: Suez sees summer sale for Victoire Suez, the French financial and industrial holding company, hopes by early summer to conclude the sale of Victoire, its insurance business, Mr Gerard Worms, chairman, said. Victoire has been for sale since last autumn when Suez, which on Tuesday announced a return to the black with a net profit last year of FFr1.6bn (Dollars 270m), took full control of the company by acquiring the minority shareholding previously held by Union des Assurances de Paris. Mr Worms said that 'several European companies' had expressed interest in Victoire, which is valued at FFr18bn in Suez's accounts. He added that bidders had been asked to submit detailed offers over the next few weeks. A number of prospective purchasers, including BAT Industries, the UK conglomerate, have already withdrawn from negotiations. The Victoire sale forms part of an aggressive programme of asset disposals by Suez. The group, which has financial and industrial interests, has been rationalising its activities. Mr Worms said Suez envisaged a future dual role as a financial services conglomerate and a majority shareholder of other businesses. Lex, Page 18</p>

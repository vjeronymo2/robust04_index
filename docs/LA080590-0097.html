			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORE ROSEANNE  </P> <P> With respect to Roseanne Barr's national anthem escapade, I am truly  embarrassed by the people who booed her.  </P> <P> However, embarrassment turned to confusion when President Bush publicly  concluded that her singing was a disgrace.  </P> <P> Isn't it a greater disgrace for Bush's son to be involved in the billion-dollar  Silverado Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Assn. scandal? To me, that is a real  profound disgrace.  </P> <P> At least Roseanne knew the words to the "Star-Spangled Banner." Do we have such  short memories that we can't recall Pia Zadora's miserable attempt to sing the  national anthem over network TV? She forgot the words, or didn't know them.  </P> <P> My hat is off to you, Rosie. You sang your best and I, for one, appreciate your  effort.  </P> <P> CYNTHIA McMILLAN  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

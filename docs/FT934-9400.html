			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Nextel plans US digital network NEXTEL, a rapidly expanding US mobile data communications services company, plans to construct an advanced digital communications network in the US that will compete with existing cellular telephone services. Under the plans, Nextel is buying licences to operate mobile communications services in several of the largest metropolitan areas in the US from Motorola, the makers of semiconductors and communications systems, in a deal worth around Dollars 1.8bn. Nextel has purchased licences from Motorola covering the use of more than 2,500 radio frequencies in 21 states. Motorola will receive a 20 per cent stake in Nextel and is providing Dollars 260m in new financing. These arrangements will result in a total of more than Dollars 500m in financing being provided by Motorola, Nextel said. 'We view this transaction with Motorola as the capstone of our acquisition campaign,' said Mr Morgan O'Brien, chairman of Nextel. Nextel's goal is to upgrade all of these systems with digital technology developed by Motorola, which will provide the company with equipment and technical assistance. For Motorola, the biggest operator of dispatch services in the US, the sale reflects its previously announced decision to offer technology and equipment rather than provide services. Nextel also announced that it has reached a technology alliance with Nippon Telegraph and Telephone of Japan. NTT has also taken an equity stake in Nextel, purchasing 1.5m shares for Dollars 75m. NTT will assist Nextel in developing its digital wireless network. When fully constructed in 1995, Nextel's networks will be capable of reaching 180m people across the US, the company said. Services will include mobile telephone, dispatch, alpha-numeric paging and data transmission from a single mobile telephone handset. Already, Nextel has started offering its integrated digital services in southern California. The company said that its services will cover most of the state within the first quarter of 1994. New services will be available in New York and Chicago by mid-1994. Nextel said the services will represent 'the wireless portion of an information super-highway'.</p>

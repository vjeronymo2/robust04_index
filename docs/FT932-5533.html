			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Arts: Gabriel ascends to super stardom - Rock For a superstar Peter Gabriel is oddly self-effacing. When he broke away from Genesis to go solo he hid himself behind make up and masks; then absorbed himself in WOMAD, his admirable if doomed attempt to bring the music of Africa, Latin America, everywhere, to a record-buying public; and now, on his first global tour in six years, he has handed over his performance to the hot Canadian director Robert Lepage. Since Gabriel never possessed a mind-blowing voice this is no bad thing. Lepage has served him, and the audience, proud. We get not one stage, but two. A square back area, surmounted by the inevitable screen, is joined by a moving walkway to a circular stage thrust into the stadium. But this is just the start of the spectacle. On 'Shaking the Tree', a mature tree grows up in seconds. For 'Blood of Eden', the most affecting of the songs on the new album which lies behind this visit, we get not mechanical gimmickry but waif-ish Sinead O'Connor, bald and barefoot and oddly Eve-like. By 'Digging the dirt' Lepage is in overdrive. In addition to the mouth mike, Gabriel's head is cluttered with an inward looking camera which offers to the screen close ups of his facial tissue usually only permitted to a beautician. At the same time he fondles a white structure on stage which materialises into a plaster cast of his face. And on and on, each song choreographed to excite the eye, with only 'Sledgehammer' stripped down to a rock solo, complete with thrusting pelvis. Near the end the excellent band makes its way along the catwalk to the next gig to disappear in turn through a suitcase while Gabriel displays his stellar status by making a significant exit, enveloped from above by a descending dome. The spacecraft rises to reveal the regrouped musicians playing 'In your eyes' and then the resonate 'Biko', Gabriel's moving tribute to the assassinated African politician, which always closes his show with political correctness and an irresistible chorus. As a Peter Gabriel sceptic I was completely won over by the spectacle, if not by the music. You hardly think about the cost: just enjoy the vision. It is emotional spoonfeeding of the most extravagant kind, but extremely pleasant - for a while.</p>

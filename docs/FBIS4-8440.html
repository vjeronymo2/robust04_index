			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 14 (CTK) -- The heads of state of  seven Central European countries will gather on Friday against  the background of the colorful, culturally rich East Bohemian  town of Litomysl for two days of informal talks on the  perspectives for cooperation in this region at the heart of  Europe.    Czech President Vaclav Havel is host to the meeting, which  will be attended also by: Thomas Klestil (Austria), Richard von  Weizsaecker (Germany), Arpad Goncz (Hungary), Lech Walesa  (Poland), Michal Kovac (Slovakia), and Milan Kucan (Slovenia).    The seven presidents will discuss long-term possibilities  for  cooperation throughout the continent, but primarily in Central  Europe. They do not intend to form any kind of union, adopt  some initiative, or sign any strategic documents.    Four specific themes have been identified as topics for  discussion. First is the definition of Central Europe, its  position and perspectives, and possibilities for cooperation  within the region. Second is the position of Central Europe  within an overall European context. Third is the problem of  Russia and the Balkans. Fourth is the present condition of  Europe, its problems and tasks, the threats it faces, and  perspectives on its integration.    On Saturday the seven presidents will hold a live televised  discussion, moderated by French political scientist Jacques  Rupnik.    The April 15-16 meeting follows up a last year's meeting of  Havel, Goncz, Klestil and Weizsaecker at the Salzburg Music  Festival. Like that meeting, the current one will include  several cultural events.    The two days may also include some bilateral discussions,  although none are formally planned. At the request of Austria's  President Klestil, Havel has expressed his willingness to  discuss the Temelin nuclear power plant being built in southern  Bohemia.    Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus will pay a brief visit as well,  and will have dinner with the presidents on Friday night.    At the conclusion of the conference on Saturday, six of the  presidents will bid farewell to President von Weizsacker, who is  leaving office later this year.    Besides the hundreds of officials, police officers,  journalists and others, local residents are also eagerly  awaiting the presidential gathering. The last head of state to  visit Litomysl was Austro-Hungarian Emperor Franz Josef I, who  stayed there in the 1880s during some military exercises.    Litomysl is being repaired and cleaned up for the visit, but  "we are not building any Potemkin village," Mayor Miroslav Brydl  said. He added that he intends to invite the heads of state to a  glass of slivovice (plum brandy), but is not sure if the  beverage meets the requirements of diplomatic protocol.    The six guest presidents will spend Friday night at the  Hotel  Cernigov in nearby Hradec Kralove, while Havel is being prepared  a room in Litomysl Castle.    On Saturday and Sunday the castle will also host a symposium  of Central European intellectuals under the title "A Shared  Solitude," organized by +Stredoevropske noviny+ (Central  European News). Participants will meet with President Havel on  Saturday. Among them are Czech Culture Minister Pavel Tigrid,  former Slovak Culture Minister Ladislav Snopko and Czech writer  Ivan Klima, political scientist Jacques Rupnik, and former Czech  Premier Petr Pithart.</p>

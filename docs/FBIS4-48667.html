			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Message" from Paul Kagame, chairman of the Rwandan </F> Patriotic Army High Command, to the Rwandan Government forces;  place and date not given]    [Text] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] Army's High  Command has again found it necessary to inform the officers and  men of the Rwandan Government forces of the following:    1. The [word indistinct] clique in collaboration with some  members of the military leadership have continued to deceive and  misguide the Army into fighting a suicidal war and committing  atrocities against innocent civilians. The clique has time and  again carried out propaganda that the Army should fight to the  last man. The clique is using the Army to protect themselves  from the consequences of the atrocities they have committed.  This propaganda has been carried out notably by some privileged  officers and men as a result of discrimination. These are  responsible for atrocities. They have, for example, continued to  tell lies that the government Army is winning the war when you  know the reality because you are the ones who are fighting.  Soldiers should not be fooled. They should use their  intelligence to see that they have had many defeats and should  not allow themselves to be finished for the sake of the clique.    2. The Rwandan Patriotic Army is aware that there are some  good elements in the government forces who have continued to be  misled and misused. It is for this reason that we call upon all  the good elements to reject being used and fighting desperate  wars.    3. The Rwandan Patriotic Army calls upon the good elements  within the government forces to dissociate themselves from the  clique and find ways of joining the Rwandan Patriotic Army.    4. The Rwandan Patriotic Army receives anybody who chooses  to defect or desert the group of criminals. The propaganda by  the clique that we kill those who cross to our side or that we  kill prisoners of war is absolutely false and is aimed at  discouraging you from isolating the criminals.    We already have members of the government Army who have  defected to our side and prisoners who have later chosen to join  hands with us. The interviews of these people will pass over  Radio Muhabura. Those of you who may not be convinced by this  assurance can send a few people to the areas we control.    5. Political party youthwingers who have been compelled to  join hands with the notorious Interahamwe [militias] for fear of  losing their lives should denounce this association and find  ways of going to safe areas.    Finally, all those who may wish to cross over to our side  are  assured that they will be safe.</p>

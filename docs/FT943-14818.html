			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Geneva faces Bonn rivalry on WTO site As this week's deadline nears for a decision on the headquarters site for the new World Trade Organisation, the two European candidates - Bonn and Geneva - are stretching every sinew to capture the glittering prize. Trade diplomats in Geneva, headquarters of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, say the German government has put up an unexpectedly tough fight for the WTO, backing a financially attractive offer with intense diplomatic lobbying of Gatt's 120-plus members in Geneva and in national capitals. While Geneva remains the favourite, Bonn has come from a rank outsider to a serious challenger. This has forced the Swiss to upgrade their own offer. Both cities now stand ready to spend millions of dollars for the privilege of hosting the WTO, its 500 or so staff and associated diplomatic missions, and the revenues they will generate. The deadline for a decision was initially set for this Friday. While there are still hopes that this deadline can be met, a large number of countries had not off-icially made up their minds by yesterday and the choice could be postponed until a meeting of the WTO prep-aratory committee on July 22. 'My bet is that the consensus will be to stay in Geneva,' says a senior developing country ambassador. 'But Bonn's offer has had to be taken seriously.' In terms of free office space, conference facilities, car parking and diplomatic privileges, the two cities are running neck and neck, trade officials say. Bonn initially claimed an edge in having a ready-made conference centre for WTO use - but a group of Gatt ambassadors who visited Bonn last week judged the centre inadequate. Like the Swiss, the German government has now offered to build a new centre. However, the 'inertia factor' looks like tipping the balance in Geneva's favour. The costs of moving, in human and organisational terms, would be enormous and would prevent the hoped-for smooth transition from Gatt to the WTO. 'We would lose six months' work,' predicts one senior trade diplomat. Many of Gatt's present staff are settled in Geneva and do not wish to move. Geneva is home to a number of UN organisations with which the WTO will have to work closely. In addition, countries that currently cover Gatt alongside the other UN bodies in Geneva would have to open separate WTO missions in Bonn.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Stepan Sulakshin, chairman of State Duma </F> Military-Industrial Complex Subcommittee, under rubric "What  Lawmakers Propose": "Two Quarters on Starvation Rations"]    [Text]    [Box insert]    That is the position in which defense enterprises may  find themselves if the State Duma does not support its Defense  Committee and Industry Committee.    [End box insert]    The state of affairs in the defense complex presently  is one of the questions demanding the most careful attention of  society, specialists, lawmakers, and the executive  department.    We recall how for several years it was impressed on the  country that the military-industrial "monster is devouring  taxpayers' money, squandering labor, energy and resources" and  so on. But then economic reforms and avalanching conversion  burst forth (Americans ooh and aah over five-percent reductions  and conversion of military production, but for us they are  measured in tens of percentage points in a year). In 1993  compared with 1991 the production volume of arms and military  equipment was 21.7 percent, capital investments and RDT&amp;E  financing volumes were halved, and the export of military  products decreased by more than three times.  <H8>  What Did Reforms Give Us? </H8>   It is without question that the militarized economy needed  reforming, but let us have a look at whether or not the federal  budget deficit dropped after the engagement with the so-called  monster, and in essence with ourselves. Who in the country began  to live better and who was helped by debts and advances unpaid  to the defense establishment, by insufficient funds of defense  and of the budget of financed products, and by interest on  enormous credit discount rates? Is structural perestroyka under  way? How are conversion programs being fulfilled? Why did the  country reject the billions of dollars it could have received  from export deliveries? Is it possible to underfinance the Army  with defense capability and sociopolitical consequences in mind?    Finally, how did it happen that the state and government  began to consider it permissible for themselves to take away  products of the defense establishment, but not pay for them, or  to specify a state order, but not pay an advance for its  fulfillment, not index the working capital of enterprises, and  so on?    Answers to these questions are provided by life itself. Here  are the facts. Quite recently the number of defense enterprises  and organizations exceeded 1,800 and employed 4.5 million  persons (including 800,000 in the sphere of science). If we  figure in the "family" factor, then this is 12-15 million  persons. The defense industrial complex includes over 70  so-called monofunctional city-plants with an isolated production  and life support infrastructure. One does not have to be a state  figure to understand that reforming such a complex without  losses (present and future) for the country's defense capability  and without social shocks for people or at least with minimum  losses is a task not just for a single year. But what is  happening in the defense complex today has no logical  explanation.    There is another side to the question. A significant portion  of defense design bureaus, scientific research institutes, and  plants having unique technologies, equipment and cadres already  were supporting production of consumer products long ago. In  1993 the proportion of civilian products put out by defense  enterprises was 78.3 percent of the overall volume. It seemed  clear to everyone that conversion programs also require large  investments of funds, but it very often happens that  enterprises, having prepared 50, 70, or 90 percent of production  capacities for output of consumer goods, do not receive the  remaining money from the state to begin production. Private  capital also is in no hurry to invest. The majority of directors  say with substantiation: we work and attract, but neither the  domestic nor the foreign entrepreneur comes to us and hardly  will come in the next few years! Help can be expected from  nowhere except the state.    To sum up briefly, no positive results are seen from past  reforms, with little exception. On the other hand, devastation  in the defense complex and the increased potential of  technological, structural and sociopolitical dangers are quite  evident not only from the standpoint of defense capability, but  also for the country's sociopolitical situation as a whole.  <H8>  It Is Very Costly To Economize on Defense </H8>   The extremely serious situation in defense sectors of  industry at the present time is the result of an avalanching  reduction in military expenditures, an avalanching conversion,  which reached 80 percent, and a monetary system utterly wrecked  by mutual non-payments, by credit and debit indebtedness, by a  delay of payments for fulfilled orders on the part of the  Russian Federation Ministry of Defense and other clients, by  late payment of conversion credits and subsidies, by the  lengthiness of noncash banking transactions, and by an absence  of working capital.    As of 1 January 1994 the indebtedness of the Russian  Federation Ministry of Defense, i.e., the state, was R1.217  billion and that of customer enterprises was R770 billion.  Because of late payment of the state defense order, enterprises  of the defense complex were forced to pay R400 billion from  budgetary funds for use of bank credit, basically to commercial  banks. Overall indebtedness for payment of wages is up to R200  billion.    The price increase on material resources and energy carriers  of almost 11 times compared with 1992, the significantly lesser  price increase (by 6.6 times) on manufactured products, and also  late charges brought the majority of enterprises to the verge of  bankruptcy--artificial bankruptcy, we will note.    The number of workers at enterprises of Goskomoboronprom  [State Committee for the Defense Industry], 4.5 million, dropped  by 500,000 over the last three years basically because of an  outflow of highly skilled cadres. The drop in the number of  associates of many scientific research institutes and design  bureaus was from 30 to 50 percent. Experimental, test and range  facilities are in a depressing state. There has been a sharp  reduction in the scope of tests and experiments being carried  out. At least 1.2 million persons from defense sectors may be  let go in 1994 because of a reduction in budget appropriations,  including around 400,000 from the scientific sector, which will  lead to irreversible consequences for the defense complex.    The 1993 state defense order for certain kinds of arms and  military equipment busied only 10-15 percent of production  capacities. The order fell below the minimum permissible level  for many kinds of articles, and as a result this is leading to  degradation and loss of high-tech industries.    Thus, appropriations for 1991-1993 were reduced by almost  8.3  times for military RDT&amp;E and by more than 5 times for  civilian  RDT&amp;E. A further reduction in appropriations both for  purchasing  arms and military equipment as well as for RDT&amp;E is envisaged  for 1994, which in particular will permit only paying debts for  1993, paying for products manufactured during January-March  1994, and paying for reserve property. No funds remain for the  rest of defense products envisaged by the state order for 1994.    The 1993 state order has been fulfilled only by 47.9 percent  and the actual financing of military RDT&amp;E in 1993 was  around 30  percent. Financing for these items is envisaged at the 20-22  percent level in 1994. As a result of such actions, entire  directions for development of combatant ships, special  communications systems, combat subsystems and military aviation  elements will be terminated, work to create a reserve of advance  scientific work essentially will cease, work to develop military  science and technology as a whole will stop, and creative  scientific-design collectives formed over the years will break  up once and for all.    The bill "On the 1994 Federal Budget," introduced by the  Russian Federation government and approved in the first reading  by the State Duma, provides for allocating defense expenditures  at the level at which existing Ministry of Defense indebtedness  essentially equals the volume of allocated funds. Enterprises  will not even be on starvation rations for essentially the two  remaining quarters... In evaluating the situation  professionally, members of the State Duma committees for  Defense, for Industry and others cannot agree with the proposed  draft budget. There also is a positive attitude of the President  of Russia toward bringing corresponding expenditures for the  defense complex to the minimum permissible. Amendments to the  second reading of the law on the budget have been prepared and  the Duma should approve them, while at the same time taking a  tougher approach to forming the income part of the budget.  <H8>  Not Just the Manufacturer Is Responsible for the State Order </H8>   The astounding system of interaction of state, government as  a whole and Ministry of Finance which has been revealed,  particularly with the defense complex, demands changes. There  must be real responsibility (right up to judicial liability and  dismissal of responsible government persons) for ensuring  fulfillment of the state defense order and financing it. Under  market conditions the system of placing the state order must  become competitive for enterprises of all forms of ownership,  with guarantees of necessary profitability and concessions on  the part of the state. In the absence of working capital (there  also is a presidential edict on this subject), all work must  receive a mandatory advance.    It is necessary to determine the rank of the government  [kazennyy] defense enterprise and compile a list of these  enterprises. The rest should be relieved of exorbitant overhead  expenses and the system of mobilization reserves should be  revised. The formula in this case is simple. If the state cannot  finance, release the enterprise and perhaps it "will provide  for" itself. But now even the state order is sent down and no  advance at all is given!    Laws "On the State Defense Order," "On Mobilization  Reserves"  and "On the Government Enterprise" are about to be adopted.  These laws are in the Duma's portfolio of bills. The law on the  state defense order is in the June plan.    The time has come to revise export policy. Not only would  many defense enterprises be able to survive, but they would be  able to develop successfully even with minimum export  deliveries. A law on military-technical cooperation with foreign  states is needed. The task is to return lost markets and  currency earnings to Russia.    Of course, each problem touched upon is a subject of  independent analysis. On the whole, however, it is clear that  Russian reforms of the economy cannot be carried out by cutting  off the branch on which we sit. After allowing a sharp slump in  industrial production, in profits and in taxes into the budget  (budget incomes in the first quarter were around half of those  planned), it is now impossible to find money to pay for these  same reforms. There are no grounds to expect outside investments  as well as investments of private and banking capital in the  next few years. This means it is necessary to restore the base  nucleus of industry and not allow a further production slump. An  adjustment of economic policy in the country is necessary. The  State Duma and its specialized committees are working in this  direction, but the legislative process is not rapid. Operational  management decisions and adjustments to the economic course in  the country are up to the government and the president. It must  be hoped that the long awaited expeditious actions on problems  being discussed today also finally will follow.</p>

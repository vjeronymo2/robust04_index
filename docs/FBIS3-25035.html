			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Emilio Manhique] </F>   [Excerpt] The big news today might have been that the  training and refresher course for commanding and other senior  officers of the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces [FADM] began  today. That course is being attended by 50 men from both sides.    However, what really arrested the attention of those present  -- including guests such as UN Special Representative Aldo  Ajello, among others -- were the remarks made by Lieutenant  General Mateus Ngonhamo, of the Mozambique National Resistance,  Renamo, armed forces. After thanking Portugal for its role in  the formation of the FADM forces, Lt. Gen. Ngonhamo proceeded to  cause controvery when he said that all countries posed a threat  to Mozambique. He was referring to the role that the FADM are  supposed to play.    That Renamo military officer also noted that certain  Mozambicans are secretly training troops and hiding weapons,  directly accusing General Eduardo Nihia, Mozambique Liberation  Front, Frelimo, Party first secretary for Nampula Province, of  being involved in the training of 1,000 men. At this point, Lt.  Gen. Ngonhamo affirmed that the United Nations has been informed  and that a commission (?sent) to investigate the matter had been  prevented from working on the ground.    Indicating that the United Nations had not done that work,  UN  Special Representative Aldo Ajello shook his head while Ngonhamo  made those remarks. [sentence as heard] Later, Aldo Ajello told  journalists that he was unaware of that problem but he added  that he will order an investigation if it is indeed true.    Subsequently, we interviewed Lieutenant General Tobias Dai,  of the Mozambique Armed Forces, who expressed great surprise  about those serious accusations by Mateus Ngonhamo.  Nonetheless, he said that, should they be true, the government  will take note and will try to investigate the matter on the  ground. [passage omitted]</p>

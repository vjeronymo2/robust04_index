			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SAVVY TRAVELER: IF THE PLANE BUCKS, IT'S BETTER TO BE BUCKLED-UP;  </P> <P> AIRLINES: THE REAL DANGER WHEN FLYING IS FROM UNEXPECTED MODERATE TO SEVERE  IN-FLIGHT TURBULENCE.  </P> <P> If you're like most airline passengers, you board your airplane, stow your  carry-on baggage, take your seat and fasten your seat belt.  </P> <P> About two to three minutes into most flights, the captain will turn off the  "Fasten Seat Belt" sign. Being an obedient passenger, you unbuckle your seat  belt.  </P> <P> That could be a big mistake. When you least expect it, the plane could be  buffeted by moderate to severe turbulence, and you could seriously injure  yourself.  </P> <P> Although most airlines don't like to publicize it, there is a real danger of  passenger accidents resulting from in-flight turbulence.  </P> <P> On Nov. 24, 1983, an Air Canada L-1011 flying above South Carolina encountered  turbulence. Twenty-five passengers were injured, five of them seriously.  </P> <P> On March 3, 1986, near Honolulu, nine passengers were hurt (two seriously) on a  United Airlines 747 that was hit by turbulence.  </P> <P> On July 13, 1986, an Eastern Airlines A300 flying near West Palm Beach, Fla.,  was rocked by turbulence. Thirty passengers were injured.  </P> <P> On Nov. 11, 1987, a Pan Am A300 flying across the Atlantic was also hit by  severe turbulence. Thirty-five passengers were hurt.  </P> <P> In almost every case, the passengers injured were not wearing seat belts when  the turbulence occurred.  </P> <P> Officially, these are classified as "Part 121" accidents, meaning an accident  in which there are passenger or crew injuries or substantial damage to an  aircraft.  </P> <P> There are, of course, different kinds of turbulence. Turbulence can be created  by weather fronts and storms, by the vortices of exhaust from airplanes in  front of you, or the most severe -- and usually unexpected -- kind: CAT, or  clear-air turbulence.  </P> <P> Weather experts say that turbulence occurs when warm and cold air masses  collide near the jet stream at the cold/warm air boundary. They will also tell  you that turbulence occurs more often during the winter months, due to  seasonally colder air temperatures.  </P> <P> "Still, forecasting turbulence is an iffy business," according to Ken Plunkett,  director of research for the nonprofit Aviation Safety Institute in  Worthington, Ohio. "The FAA will issue reports of suspected turbulence, but  more often than not they are general in nature."  </P> <P> For example, the FAA might warn pilots of suspected turbulence in a large  geographic grid stretching from Michigan to Florida at altitudes 18,000 to  47,000 feet.  </P> <P> Other turbulence warnings come from "Pireps" -- pilot reports filed by captains  flying either immediately in front of you or in the general vicinity of your  airspace.  </P> <P> "But the problem," said John Galipault, president of ASI, "is that no one  agency, airline or pilot can really anticipate when turbulence will occur.  Airlines are very good at making people fasten their seat belts for takeoffs  and landings, but what about in-flight?  </P> <P> "Most fliers take for granted that once an aircraft is flying at its cruising  speed, nothing short of a crash will significantly disrupt the flight. That's  not true. Few airlines promote the idea of keeping passenger seat belts  fastened securely at all times because they're afraid it might worry  passengers."  </P> <P> Actually, you should be worried about what could happen if you don't keep your  belt fastened during the flight.  </P> <P> Plunkett recently studied data from the National Transportation Safety Board  indicating that nearly 25% of all airliner accidents between 1983 and 1988  involved in-flight turbulence.  </P> <P> Not only were passengers seriously injured, but flight attendants were  especially vulnerable.  </P> <P> In many cases, an airplane might suddenly lose altitude. When that happens,  flight attendants in the aisles -- as well as unrestrained passengers -- hit  the ceiling . . . literally.  </P> <P> As the pilot fights to regain control and return to altitude, those flight  attendants and passengers are often thrown to the floor.  </P> <P> Again, having your seat belt fastened is only part of the solution. You must  fasten it tightly. "On one flight when we hit turbulence," said Lenore Kadish,  a TWA flight attendant, "an elderly woman who had fastened her seat belt was  pulled out of her seat by a sudden loss of altitude.  </P> <P> "When she hit the floor, it started to happen again. The only thing that saved  her was that other passengers grabbed her and held her down until things  smoothed out."  </P> <P> As might be expected, policies about seat belts vary from airline to airline.  Some airlines politely suggest that you keep the belts loosely fastened. Other  airlines insist that their flight attendants adhere to a strict employee  seat-belt rule.  </P> <P> "I was astounded when I came to work for this airline," said flight attendant  Susan Marshall, who joined Delta Airlines after flying for another carrier for  many years.  </P> <P> "My previous airline was very lax about what flight attendants could and  couldn't do at various stages of the flight. Delta is unbelievably cautious  about flight attendants wearing seat belts.  </P> <P> "For example, we are not allowed to get up from our seats until the seat-belt  sign goes off. The same rule applies when the plane is taxiing. It's an  important rule, and I'd like to see other airlines adopt it."  </P> <P> But what about new rules for passengers?  </P> <P> For the moment, to protect yourself, don't wait for the FAA. Abide by your own  rules.  </P> <P> Unless you have to go to the bathroom, keep your belt tightly fastened. And on  longer flights, if you want to sleep, fasten your seat belt on the outside of  your blanket, where it is clearly visible to flight attendants.  </P> <P> If you find yourself in severe turbulence -- and assuming you've already  fastened your seat belt -- quickly bury your head in your arms. That way, you  can also minimize the damage caused by objects flying through the cabin.  </P></p>

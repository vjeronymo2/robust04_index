			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Portugal (5): A three-times victor - The Social Democrats and Cavaco Silva AS A student, Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva was a keen athlete and, so it is said, a highly effective hurdles runner. Close associates say the prime minister not only maintains a runner's gait, but he applies his skills to the art of politics: always preparing for the next hurdle as he leaps over the immediate one. Whether or not that is the secret of Mr Cavaco Silva's success to date, his achievements are real enough: three consecutive general election victories, the last two with resounding absolute majorities, have left his opponents standing in the blocks and in disarray. The moderate socialist party (PS) is at war with itself, the small right-wing Christian Democratic party (CDS) is in the midst of purification rites, the once-powerful hard-line Communist party (PCP) is in decline and fighting for survival. All of which leaves the prime minister's right-of-centre Social Democrats (PSD) with as near enough a free hand to shape the political agenda as it could wish. Leadership of the opposition should fall to the Socialist party, but riven with internal strife, and incapacitated by personal rivalries and ambitions, it appears ill-fitted for the role. After its general election defeat in 1991, the PS elected Mr Antonio Guterres, then leading the Socialists in parliament, as new leader, with great hopes that he would modernise the party's image and give it a new impetus. But his honeymoon was short- lived, and groups within the party have resumed their small wars. Instead much of the focus for discontent has shifted, willy-nilly, to President Mario Soares, whose relationship with the prime minister is polite but hardly warm. Now in his second, and last, five-year presidential mandate, Mr Soares has emerged as the main source of irritation in the Sao Bento prime ministerial residence. Though the president has few real powers, he can delay legislation by presidential veto which he has been doing with increasing frequency - at times to the surprise of his socialist supporters. Mr Soares denies any intention to interfere with government, but he says he must speak out on issues that affect the country's well-being and against what he perceives as creeping 'conformism and monolitism', and what he claims are the 'hegemonic' tendencies of the ruling party. Mr Cavaco Silva dismisses the accusations. 'We have a majority, and we have to govern even if that means taking some unpopular decisions,' he says. As PSD leader, he has steered his occasionally quarrelsome party with a firm hand, and ensured its electoral success. He has no real contender within his party, and the opposition is too weak to pose an effective challenge. The principal reason for Mr Cavaco Silva's success is simple: he is perceived as the main architect of Portugal's relative prosperity and as guarantor of political stability. Though it was President Soares, then socialist leader and often prime minister, who led the courtship with the European Community at a time when Portugal was still struggling to overcome the debilitating after-effects of right-wing dictatorship and leftist revolution, it was Mr Cavaco Silva who tied the knot. And it was Mr Cavaco Silva's pragmatic, reformist, and market-oriented diligence which ensured Portugal would get the most out of its EC membership. Since 1986 when it joined the EC, Portugal has undergone a dramatic transformation. The economy went through an unprecedented boom, it has been liberalised and modernised, the constitution has been reformed, standards of living have risen, unemployment at around 4 per cent is among the lowest in the Community, and Portugal has rediscovered a sense of national pride. There is still poverty, and living standards remain below those in the Community's richer countries, but for most Portuguese, the past few years have been a time of unquestionable progress. The future is more uncertain. The international environment is no longer as propitious as it was in the 1980s, and some of Portugal's main trading partners are in recession or face serious economic difficulties. The European Community itself is facing a crisis of confidence, and the Portuguese economy has began to slow. This gives the opposition a new chance as the government prepares to embark on a further bout of unpopular reforms in its drive for modernisation. With eyes fixed on European economic and monetary union, the government is preparing to tighten the screws. A rigorous 1993 budget aims to reduce the government deficit from above 5 per cent to less than 4 per cent of GDP. Public expenditure will fall in real terms, as will public sector wages if the government succeeds in convincing trade unions to accept 5.5 per cent pay rises for next year, and if its inflation target of 5-7 per cent is achieved. Ministries will cut recurrent expenditures by 5 per cent, the civil service will be trimmed, the health service reformed and partly privatised, the armed forces rationalised and cut, the police reorganised, university fees will be raised, and labour relations will be tightened up with a new strike law. All these proposals have brought vocal opposition from unions, professional associations, students, army officers, and interest groups which feel threatened by reform. But with single-mindedness, the government is pressing ahead on all fronts at once, knowing it will meet opposition and that it will cost the government in popularity, but convinced it can see its programme through. 'We can't be accused of delaying measures which we think are important for the modernisation of the country,' Mr Cavaco Silva says. These are the immediate hurdles. Further down the track are municipal and local elections next autumn, a general election in 1995, and presidential elections in 1996. The government calculates that now is the time to push through unpopular measures, and that there will be time enough later to reap the rewards of success. If the strategy works and Portugal emerges successfully from the current uncertainty, then Mr Cavaco Silva could comfortably face the prospect of re-election in 1995, or even try his luck at the presidency in 1996.</p>

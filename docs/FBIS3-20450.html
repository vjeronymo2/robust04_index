(Part One of  Three): The "Reflection" Report Used the Term, "Beijing  Disturbance"; Jiang Zemin Wrote a Comment, Accusing Me of Right  Deviation and Saying That I Should Be Transferred    During the 4 June disturbance, many employees of the Hong  Kong Branch of XINHUA SHE and Chinese-owned institutions  participated in activities in support of the students' patriotic  activities at Tiananmen Square. After the 4 June Incident, the  CPC Work Committee decided that "no punishment should be given  to any of those who had committed mistakes" by participating in  activities such as giving signatures, taking part in marches, or  soliciting donations, and that they should learn lessons by  themselves but should not be required to make oral or written  self-examinations. The committee also decided to submit a report  to the CPC Central Committee. Ji Pengfei [1213 7720 7378]  quickly notified us, indicating approval for the idea of the CPC  Work Committee. During the Fourth Plenum, I reported to the new  general secretary, Jiang Zemin, on the idea. With his approval,  we transmitted the idea to all the units, thereby calming the  employees who had been unsettled.    However, when I was attending the Hong Kong and Macao work  conference in Beijing presided over by Ji Pengfei in July, the  conference demanded that all units supervised by the CPC Work  Committee "reflect" on the "problems" which had occurred in Hong  Kong during the 4 June Incident period. The so-called  "reflecting" is a synonym of "making self-examinations regarding  the mistakes committed." At that time, in Beijing institutions  ranging from those at the municipal level to those at the  central level and individuals as well as party committees at  institutions were all engaged in "reflecting." In fact the  practice of "having everyone go through the ordeal" was used,  and activities of "account settling" were rampant. Ji Pengfei  had notified us of the approval for the CPC Work Committee's  idea of "no punishment for mistakes already committed," and  Jiang Zemin had also expressed his approval. But now it was  demanded that "reflecting" be conducted. In this way they went  back on their words. I responded with silence, and did not  indicate my attitude. Seeing this situation, Zhou Nan [0719  0589] tried to smooth things over: "Where is the harm in doing  some reflecting? We at the CPC Foreign Ministry group have also  reflected." I nodded, and indicated my compliance reluctantly.    After returning to Hong Kong, I transmitted the instruction  at a meeting of the CPC Work Committee, and then indicated my  attitude: "Throughout the 4 June Incident period, I said more  than once that if the CPC Work Committee should make any  mistakes in handling the matter, you (referring to the other  members of the CPC Work Committee) might shift the blame onto me  when there should be efforts to find out who was responsible. In  fact the decisions were made by me. We have already told our  subordinates that there would be no punishment for the problems  which occurred during the 4 June Incident period. Now the center  demands that we reflect. I think that we have not made any  mistakes, but on the other hand refusing to reflect will not be  tolerated. I ask all of you to think about how to handle the  matter. If there is to be reflecting, only the CPC Work  Committee will reflect. Perhaps this instruction should not be  transmitted to the subordinates, and it should not be demanded  that they reflect. If any mistakes were made, I am responsible,  and I do not want to have everyone be held responsible." Few  people spoke at the meeting. The final conclusion was: "Write a  reflection report!" The difficult task of "writing" it was given  to She Mengxiao, deputy director of the branch and secretary  general. I thought about the matter for several days, and then  discussed with She Mengxiao the issue of how to "write" it. She  had also prepared a preliminary draft. We agreed that we had not  made any mistakes about which we should conduct  self-examinations, and that we should "write" about the  "understandings" achieved for the purpose of learning a lesson.  How to describe the student's patriotic movement in Beijing and  the support movement in Hong Kong and Macao? The most important  issue was whether to use the term "disturbance" or "rebellion"  to describe the nature of the movement in the written  "reflection." After repeated considerations, the term, "Beijing  disturbance," was used.    Written in this way, the "reflection" passed the CPC Work  Committee and was submitted to the center. During the Fifth  Plenum in October, to my surprise, Ji Pengfei said, when talking  about the CPC Work Committee's "reflection" report: "Your  reflection report is very well-written!" I could not believe my  ears.    In July-August a cadre of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs  Office told me privately that Jiang Zemin had written a comment  on the CPC Work Committee's "reflection" report and that the  gist was: "It seems that Xu Jiatun is suffering from right  deviation and should be transferred from his post." The General  Office of the CPC Central Committee had sent the "comment" to  the secretariat of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, and  then had someone take it back before it had been delivered to  the secretary general, Li Hou. The person who had come to take  it back had not made any explanation. I believed what that cadre  told me. For not long before, he had also told me another thing:  Jiang Zemin had spent two days on listening to reports made by  Li Hou [2621 0683] and Lu Ping [7627 1627]. He had not known  what had been reported. Judging from the look on his face when  he said those things, I understood that this was not good news  for me.    During the Fourth Plenum, Jiang Zemin had taken the  initiative in having a talk with me after he had assumed the  high office of general secretary. The two of us had talked in a  harmonious manner. At that time, he had been in agreement with  the CPC Work Committee's idea that whatever the situations  involved, none of those employees of the Chinese institutions in  Hong Kong and Macao who had participated in the support  activities during the 4 June Incident period should be punished.  He had been the party's general secretary, and thus he had in  fact given approval to the CPC Work Committee's decision on  behalf of the CPC Central Committee.    He had changed his attitude after listening to the reports  made by Li Hou and Lu Ping. I had been to Beijing several times.  When I had been there I had asked my secretary to contact his  secretary to request an opportunity to report to him. His  secretary had been taken by him from Shanghai to Beijing, and  had been friendly toward me. Once he had received a call from my  secretary, things would be resolved. But now he had changed his  tone, speaking in a "bureaucratic tone." First he would say that  Jiang Zemin's schedule had been full and that he would notify me  when time could be found. But nothing would happen afterwards.  It would be all right if this had happened just once, but it had  happened twice or even three times. Consequently I had not only  felt that people would change after becoming high officials but  also sensed that Jiang Zemin had changed his opinion of me.    The message given by this cadre testified to what I had  felt,  that is, that Jiang Zemin had labelled me as a  "right-deviationist" and was planning to carry out "settling of  accounts."    This would be the reason why during the Fifth Plenum I took  the initiative in talking to Song Ping [1345 1627], head of the  Central Organization Department, asking the center to approve my  retirement. The details will be related later. (Installment No.  123)  <H5>  [5 Sep 93 p 2] </H5>   [Text] Will There Be "Account Settling"? (Part Two of  Three): Zeng Jianhui [2582 1696 1798] Criticized That WEN WEI  PO's and TA KUNG PAO's Cursing the CPC Was Unthinkable; Chen  Bojian Said That He Was Prepared To Be Transferred Back To  Beijing and Put Into Prison at Any Time    After the 4 June disturbance died down, the center, the CPC  municipal committees, institutions, agencies, units of the armed  forces, schools, organizations, leaders of units, and  individuals all conducted self-examinations and "reflected," and  there were large-scale activities of "account settling."  Although the CPC approved the CPC Hong Kong and Macao Work  Committee's practice of "imposing no punishment for mistakes  already committed in all cases" in Hong Kong, in practice it  applied pressure continuously in an effort to "settle accounts."  The difference was that whereas there was across-the-board  "account settling" in Beijing, there were only efforts to clean  up individual spots in Hong Kong.    Toward the end of June the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs  Office  specially notified the CPC Work Committee, asking me to go to  Beijing and attend a meeting to discuss the problems in the  reporting of newspapers in Hong Kong and Macao during the 4 June  Incident period. I and Zhang Junsheng discussed the matter and  decided that when reporting we should stress the situation in  Hong Kong society at that time. We intended to argue that  although the two newspapers had gone too far, we had declared  that there would be no punishment for mistakes already committed  in all cases. We also intended to argue that there should be no  haste in terms of effecting "change" in the future, that a  gradual approach should be adopted, and that the focus should be  placed on making everyone learn a lesson.    I and Zhang Junsheng attended the meeting together. Ji  Pengfei presided over the meeting, and those several people from  the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and the Foreign Ministry  also attended the meeting. Zhu Muzhi [2612 4476 0037], head of  the central external propaganda task force, and Zeng Jianhui,  deputy head of the Central Propaganda Department, specially  attended the meeting.    As soon as the meeting began, Zeng Jianhui asked in a  reproachful manner: "What was the matter with WEN WEI PO and TA  KUNG PAO?" His tone was almost the same as the reproaching tone  used by Li Peng when he had met with me on the 25th. Zhu Muzhi  immediately joined the exercise, demanding that the CPC Work  Committee report on the problems of WEN WEI PO and TA KUNG PAO.    Zhang Junsheng reported according to the prepared outline.  Zeng Jianhui interrupted and criticized continually: "The CPC's  own newspapers cursed the CPC; this is really unthinkable!" I  guessed that they had come, with the imperial sword in their  hands, and thus waited for them to issue "instructions." Zhang  Junsheng reported on the CPC Work Committee's principle on  handling the matter, that is, that it would be necessary to  adopt a gradual approach in effecting change, that there should  be no haste, that the employees of the two newspapers should be  allowed to go through the process of accepting the change and  learning the lessons because otherwise there could be problems,  and that society should also be allowed to go through a process  of coming to show acceptance. At that juncture I saw Zeng  Jianhui shaking his head continuously.    I still made some supplementary remarks. At first I still  expressed the views that I had presented to Li Peng: It would be  necessary not to apply the hinterland standards to the two  newspapers, and it would be even more necessary not to use the  hinterland's post-4 June way of handling things in handling the  two newspapers. During the 4 June Incident period the two  newspapers had been forced to do what they had done. At that  time the masses in Hong Kong society and inside the newspapers  had been so agitated that it had been very difficult for the  leadership to keep control. Even we at the CPC Work Committee  had encountered the same situation. The newspapers had adopted  the contingency measures only for the purpose of preventing the  newspapers from being brought down by the masses inside and  outside and of preserving the battlefield position. We should  imagine the circumstances confronting the newspaper leadership  at that time. I emphasized that there should be no haste in  handling the cases of WEN WEI PO and TA KUNG PAO, especially WEN  WEI PO, and that it would be even more necessary not to use the  hinterland methods. (At that time the news organizations of the  hinterland were carrying out large-scale activities of "account  settling" and of "having everyone go through the ordeal." And a  large number of reporters and editors who had supported the  students' patriotic activities were transferred, dismissed, or  even arrested.) Since the center-approved policy of "imposing no  punishment for mistakes already committed in all cases" had  already been declared, we could only enhance education on the  existing basis, and effect change gradually, letting them go  through a process of coming to learn the lessons.    After hearing what I said, Zhu Muzhi and Zeng Jianhui looked  at each other and indicated neither approval nor disapproval. It  seemed that the other participants also did not want to say  anything, and Ji Pengfei did not indicate his attitude either.  As they did not openly express any disapproval, I thought that  they approved of my views.    Eventually Zhu Muzhi talked. He asked: "How about publishing  a party organ, like RENMIN RIBAO, in Hong Kong?" Zeng Jianhui  further asked: "How about turning either TA KUNG PAO or WEN WEI  PO into a party organ?" Then Ji Pengfei also took part in the  discussion.    I expressed my unfavorable opinion of the idea. A RENMIN  RIBAO-like party organ in Hong Kong would not be successful, as  the experience of RENMIN RIBAO HAIWAI BAN would show. But, in  view of atmosphere then, I could not show my opposition, and  could only try to evade the issue: "We will study the issue when  back in Hong Kong." They also expressed their consent. In this  way the meeting ended.    After we returned to Hong Kong, the CPC Work Committee held  a  discussion meeting, and invited the CPC-member president and  vice president of the two newspapers, Yang Qi and Chen Bojian,  to attend the meeting as non-voting participants. After the  transmitting exercise, everyone felt that there were heavy  pressures, but insisted that it was necessary to adhere to the  principle that while the two newspapers should be "changed,"  there should be no haste nor the application of pressure.  "Change" should be achieved through using the "dilution" method  so that those inside and outside the newspapers might go through  a process of coming to show their acceptance. Work within the  party and work outside the party at the two newspapers should be  carried out together. The CPC Work Committee decided to have  Zhang Junsheng inform Li Tzu-sung, president of WEN WEI PO, of  the relevant views of Beijing and the CPC Work Committee, asking  for his understanding and support.    The persuasion work proceeded very unsuccessfully. This was  understandable. The problem was that Chen Bojian, vice president  of WEN WEI PO, was overly hasty and tended to fail to use the  right words, and that as a result the conflict could not be  alleviated. He himself was in a very abnormal mood, and often  clashed with Zhang Junsheng. Once he told others that he was  prepared to be transferred back to Beijing and to be expelled  from the party and put into prison at any time. I specially  talked to Chen Bojian about the issue. I said: "Your problem  related to the movement is not that serious. You are now of  advanced age, and should already have retired. Don't take things  too seriously. The worst that can happen would be that some  disciplinary action is taken against you. This may be the last  test that people like us have to face. Don't be too nervous. We  still should do our job well now." I had been his old friend.  When the XINHUA SHE headquarters had asked him to retire, it had  been I who had kept him here and asked him to work at WEN WEI  PO. I said half-jokingly: "We have done the same thing. If there  should be any problem, let us advance and retreat together."  Unexpectedly what I said came true later. After I came to the  United States, he was also relieved of his duties and  transferred back to the hinterland. Not long afterwards I saw  the newspaper report of his death, and felt gloomy for quite  some time. (Installment No. 124)  <H5>  [6 Sep 93 p 2] </H5>   [Text] Will There Be "Account Settling"? (Part Three  of Three): It Was Reported That Friends of WEN WEI PO Wanted To  Make WEN WEI PO Independent; I Misjudged the Situation; I Felt  Guilty With Regard To Li Tzu-sung.    Relations between Chen Bojian and some colleagues on the one  hand and President Li Tzu-sung on the other became very tense.  Li Tzu-sung and some colleagues opposed the "change," and had  not come around, while Chen Bojian was overly hasty. A newspaper  would have to present itself to the readers every day.  Especially some people in Beijing were watching very closely to  see how this newspaper in which "Communists have cursed  themselves" would "change." There were reports of clashes  between Chen Bojian and other people almost every day. Finally  the issue of Friends of WEN WEI PO exploded, causing an even  more serious conflict.    At the informal meeting (daily meeting) of the CPC Work  Committee, Zhang Junsheng said that it had been reported that Li  Tzu-sung had a dinner with Liu Binyan, Lu K'eng, and Chin Yao-ju  the other day, discussing the organizing of Friends of WEN WEI  PO and intending to make WEN WEI PO "independent" so as to take  it out of the leftist camp. The background was not clear. It was  estimated that it was perhaps Taiwan or another country which  was involved, and that it was most likely Taiwan. He also said  that Friends of WEN WEI PO had issued a public statement, asking  WEN WEI PO to "rise up" and become "the bridgehead for the pen  and the gun." The situation seemed very serious. After  discussion it was decided that firstly Chen Bojian should gather  a meeting on the newspaper's internal affairs, that efforts  should be made to have Li Tzu-sung attend the meeting, and that  if the report was found to be true, there should be a public  statement to clarify the matter. It was also decided that  secondly a report be submitted to Beijing for record-keeping  purposes so as to prevent the difficulty in giving an account in  case "independence" should really happen.    Chen Bojian immediately went back to the newspaper to gather  the meeting, and drafted a "statement." Li Tzu-sung had  different views on the "statement." Chen Bojian thus gathered an  enlarged emergency meeting of the newspaper's committee, and had  the "statement" passed. Li Tzu-sung refused to attend the  meeting, and issued a written announcement, dismissing Chen  Bojian from the post of deputy president on the ground of Chen  Bojian's overstepping his authority by unlawfully gathering the  enlarged emergency meeting of the newspaper's committee (it had  been President Li Tzu-sung who had issued the letter of  appointment as deputy president to Chen Bojian).    It was after 8:00 in the evening. Zhang Junsheng asked that  the CPC Work Committee convene an emergency meeting to hear  reports on developments at WEN WEI PO. He was of the view that  Li Tzu-sung's sudden dismissal of Chen Bojian had proved the  information on Friends of WEN WEI PO to be correct, and that if  no countermeasures were taken, then WEN WEI PO might be "taken  away."    During the discussion it was proposed that WEN WEI PO's  board  of directors and committee be reorganized and that Li Tzu-sung  be relieved of all his duties. The other people involved would  also be dealt with properly. But WEN WEI PO was a united front  newspaper. Furthermore such a method would not be in accord with  the legal procedures in Hong Kong. For a time no appropriate  methods could be formulated. On the other hand, there was the  worry that if the matter was not disposed of, Li Tzu-sung might  take further actions to change WEN WEI PO the next day, thereby  resulting in an irreparable situation.    I agreed to taking resolute measures, but did not approve of  relieving Li of all his duties. Li Tzu-sung had been our party's  old friend. He did not initiate the Friends of WEN WEI PO  activities. But things had developed to such an extent that the  problem could not be resolved without removing him from his post  as president. But some room should be left. I proposed that he  retain his post as chairman of the board of directors of WEN WEI  PO, and continue to enjoy all the benefits (political and  economic). Everyone expressed agreement.    We went on to discuss several other issues, including the  issue of how to announce the removal of Li Tzu-sung from his  post as president. It was argued that the phrase, "discontinue  employment," was comparatively mild; everyone agreed on it.    The next issue was how to transfer the WEN WEI PO shares to  agents appointed by the XINHUA SHE. As one-third of the Hong  Kong WEN WEI PO shares were still owned by the Shanghai WEN WEI  PO, it was necessary to contact the CPC Shanghai Municipal  Committee, asking them to support transferring the shares here.  Some were nominally owned by the former editor-in-chief Chin  Yao-ju. Chin Yao-ju had now left. Those shares should also be  transferred so as to ensure the shareholding on the part of the  Hong Kong Branch of XINHUA SHE.    As Chin Yao-ju had participated in Friends of WEN WEI PO  activities, it was proposed that Chin Yao-ju be removed from his  post as director on the board of directors. I was not in favor  of pursuing those implicated. Besides, in order to remove a  director, it would be necessary to hold a meeting of the board  of directors. XINHUA SHE could not act on its own with regard to  this matter. Thus the proposal on punishing Chin Yao-ju was not  accepted.    It was proposed that Beijing's approval be sought. I  understood that it was late into the night and that there should  no further delay, and reasoned that if a report was submitted to  Beijing, they might say that the CPC Work Committee was being  "soft" and ask for more severe punishment. Therefore I said that  we could not wait and that it would be all right if we should  submit a report for record-keeping purposes.    In the end the meeting decided that Zhang Junsheng go to WEN  WEI PO that night and announce the decision on behalf of XINHUA  SHE, and that the next morning I go to Li Tzu-sung's home to  talk to Li himself.    The next morning, I, while feeling guilty, went to Li  Tzu-sung's home to "talk" to him. What could I say to this  patriotic, righteous old man? At that time I could only ask for  his understanding and advise him to take care of his own health.  I suggested that he take a rest and do such things as visiting  the hinterland. I indicated my willingness to make all the  arrangements for him. I said sincerely: "Mr. Li, you are still a  friend of the CPC." (At that time I was still the representative  of the Communist Party of China in Hong Kong.)    I felt guilty with regard to Li Tzu-sung. Especially, when I  learned later the facts about the Friends of WEN WEI PO  activities and realized that the report had been untrue, I  became even more sorry. Now I would like to use the space here  to say sorry to Mr. Li! (Installment No. 125)</p>

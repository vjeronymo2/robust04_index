			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Network Profits Increase: All three television networks posted modest to robust  profit increases last year, according to estimates published by Broadcasting  magazine. NBC network revenue declined 8% to $2.78 billion, principally due to  lack of Olympic advertising it had in 1988, while operating profit rose 35% to  $393 million.  </P> <P> Capital Cities/ABC network TV revenue rose 1% to $2.42 billion while profit,  after accounting adjustments, came in at $165 million. Even third-place CBS  earned an estimated profit of $103.5 million on revenue of $2.31 billion,  thanks largely to cost-cutting moves and a strong advertising market. But the  big earners continued to be the TV station divisions, which earned $410 million  for Cap Cities, $156.3 million for CBS and $270 million for NBC.  </P></p>

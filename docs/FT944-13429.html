			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Matif ready to launch rapeseed futures - Derivatives Today, just a few cleaners and electricians are quietly carrying out their tasks around a nondescript polygonal desk at the Bourse de Commerce building in Paris. From tomorrow, in their place will be traders and officials noisily getting to work on the first day of a new derivatives market. The latest product from Matif, the French financial futures market, is rapeseed futures - only the second in the world after Winnipeg, Canada. 'After two years' hard work, we've done it]' says Mr Charles-Etienne de Cidrac, business development manager. Rapeseed production began in earnest in Europe in the 1970s, in response to agricultural policies designed to make the continent less reliant on US soyabean imports for vegetable oils and animal feeds. The crop's yellow flowers are now a familiar sight, with 1993-94 production in the EU running at 6.2m tonnes, or nearly a quarter of the world total. In France alone, last year's crop was 1.6m tonnes. However, for many years the price of rapeseed was controlled through the EU's common agricultural policy and was only deregulated in reforms in July 1992. French farming syndicates approached the Matif at the time to ask for a way of hedging against the volatility of the product. Contracts on the new market will be available for between 4 and 19 months from tomorrow - the deliberately high maximum expiry date reflecting interest by the rapeseed industry in understanding long-term price trends. Mr de Cidrac says a number of features distinguish the market from others operated by Matif. It will operate using traditional brokers who operate across the range of its products, but also with physical brokers trading only in rapeseed. It will use the 'open outcry' system, but also have 'order book officials', or Matif staff, to buy and sell for others. It will be quoted in D-Marks, the strong currency in the continent from where most demand is expected. Foreign exchange forward contracts, to hedge into US dollars and French francs, will also be offered. Mr Gerard Pfauwadel, president of Matif, says rapeseed represents one of the few new types of product into which his organisation can diversify. It already offers most of the financial products it believes are viable; commodities derivatives represent a remaining area of growth - and one he sees as attractive in France, given its strong agricultural roots. Almost 1,000 people have attended Matif training sessions on the rapeseed market since the start of the year. When it opens tomorrow, there will be 15 traders at the 17 available spaces around the table. 'The question is whether the interest will turn into trading,' says Mr de Cidrac. 'It's a new contract for a big number of participants. As long as it is traded we will continue, and do more marketing if necessary. We are obliged to operate the markets. For us it's a strategic move. We are looking to provide a service to customers rather than find a source of profit.' Mr Pfauwadel says: 'Rapeseed is a new product and a test for others. It is clearly not a big contract. If we had more than 300 contracts a day I would be extremely happy. We are rich enough to support a low volume for a certain period - certainly the first full season and probably several years.' If things go well, Mr de Cidrac says there is the possibility - not yet under serious discussion - of options in rapeseed, and futures in related products such as sunflower oil. More generally, Matif is considering contracts in wheat and other commodities as their prices are liberalised. On the other hand, there is no guarantee of success. Coffee futures were dropped in April this year through lack of interest. More poignant still, the very trading room in which rapeseed futures will be based has been empty for two years, since Matif abandoned its cocoa futures market.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rights issue helps to unsettle equities HOPES for a near term rally in UK equities were punctured yesterday when a Pounds 404m rights issue by Royal Insurance exposed both the institutions' lack of cash and their sensitivity to corporate news. Selling of the Footsie futures contract quickly drove the stock market below the FT-SE 2,800 mark so recently regained and a late rally still left the Index down by 16.1 at 2,796.5. Concern over how long it will take before the economic recovery shows itself in company results and dividends returned following disappointing trading reports from, among others, BAT Industries, Trafalgar House, and Philips, the Dutch electronics and consumer group. Although Wall Street held up well overnight and was only 2.35 Dow points off as London closed yesterday, worries over the apparent check in the US economic recovery continued to plague the UK market. However, the significant factor was again the relative lack of volume in equity trading. The day's Seaq total improved to 539m shares from 422.8m on the previous day. But Tuesday's retail, or customer-originated, business in equities only just topped the Pounds 1bn mark now seen by the London securities community as the minimum acceptable daily figure. Equities opened lower and an attempt to rally was quickly swept aside when the June future contract on the FT-SE Index opened. The Footsie 2,800 mark was lost at mid-morning and further selling drove the Index down to the day's low of 2,786.4, down 26.2. Selling pressure fell mostly on the insurance sector as investors weighed the implications of Royal's rights move and trading statement, which included an estimate of Pounds 5m losses on last week's terrorist bombing in the City of London. But shares drifted lower across the wider range of the stock market. Textiles and electronics were among the weaker sectors. While some strategists took comfort from the market's success in holding in the 2,790 area, others warned that yesterday's session showed how vulnerable share prices are at the moment. With institutional funds heavily committed to the sale of the remaining Government holding in BT, to the demerger of Zeneca from ICI, and also to the monthly funding programme in UK gilt-edged stock, there is little cash to spare. This would leave the stock market vulnerable to any renewal of the rights issue flow; some sector analysts fear that Royal's move could spur other composite insurers to follow. A slight weakening in the pound failed to help the overseas earning stocks, whose export pricing has been threatened by sterling's firmness. Strategists now fear that UK interest rates may not be reduced again unless the Bundesbank opens the way by cutting German rates sharply, or unless sterling's strength forces the UK authorities to reduce rates. The downward pressures on the Footsie stocks imposed by selling of the Footsie futures was matched by a setback in second line issues. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which is compiled of a wide range of non-Footsie as well as Footsie shares, fell 14.4 points to 3119.1. Trading volume in the non-Footsie issues made up around 61 per cent of the day's total, in line with average levels for the past few months.</p>

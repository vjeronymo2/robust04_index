			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The Joint Statement on Ulster: Reynolds basks in opposition plaudits After weeks of criticism from the opposition benches in the Irish parliament over his approach to the Anglo-Irish peace initiative, Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, yesterday basked in an unusual display of cross-party support. The three main opposition parties, Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats and Democratic Left, have been concerned that Mr Reynolds, in pushing hard for an accommodation of nationalist aspirations in the joint declaration, would alienate unionist opinion in Northern Ireland and exacerbate political tensions and violence there. Ms Mary Harney, leader of the Progressive Democrats, who has been one of Mr Reynolds' sharpest critics, described the declaration as 'fair and balanced'. Mr Prionsias de Rossa, leader of Democratic Left, paid tribute 'to the drafting skills of some of the best brains in both the Irish and British public services'. Mr John Bruton, the Fine Gael leader, congratulated the two prime ministers on reaching an agreement. But he was concerned at a 'lack of clear timetables or mechanisms' for the resumption of inter-party talks and hoped the formula for dropping the republic's constitutional claim to Northern Ireland in the context of an overall settlement 'would not be used as an excuse to defer all action on constitutional reforms into the indeterminate future'. The declaration invited the unionists to suggest topics which 'can be represented as not being fully consistent with a modern democratic and pluralistic society' and offered to discuss and consider 'ways of removing such obstacles'. Mr Bruton warned against establishing too many bodies for discussing issues in the north. On the legislatively powerless Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which unionists are to be invited to join, he said there should not be 'competing institutions trying to solve the same problem'. Mr Reynolds indicated yesterday, however, that the real objective of such a forum was to provide a further incentive for Sinn Fein to renounce violence.</p>

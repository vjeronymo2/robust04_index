			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Pedro Aguilera Flores] </F>   [Excerpt] Planning and Cooperation Minister Luis Maira  Aguirre has confirmed to MUNDO ECONOMICO that in April, a Cuban  Government delegation headed by the director of the Planning  Board and the deputy principal of the main Havana institute of  economic studies visited Santiago. The objective of their visit  was to collect data on the Chilean economic model.    As a result of this visit, last week, Minister Maira  reported  the implementation of a cooperation plan with the Caribbean  island.    Pressed by its worst crisis since the 1959 revolution, the  Fidel Castro regime is opening up its economy as the only  solution to the crisis that followed the fall of the Soviet  communist bloc in 1991.    Last week, Castro's administration implemented drastic  reforms and austerity measures to fight the scarcity of  currency, the budget deficit, the drop in the production level,  and the black market. Among these reforms and measures are an  increase in the price of basic services; new taxes; and the  freezing of bank accounts with deposits higher than 10,000 Cuban  pesos.    Along with these measures, Cuba also began to send expert  missions to collect information on the economic experiences of  five countries. One of the countries chosen by the Cuban  Government was Chile.    For a week, the Cuban experts talked with officials from the  Chilean Central Bank and the Ministries of Finance, Foreign  Affairs, and Planning and Coordination. "They wanted to learn  about the mechanisms of administering Chilean economic policy  and the technical instruments with which we work," Maira said.    The Cuban experts took copies of already executed programs  from the Planning and Coordination Ministry as well as plans for  integrated projects and the national investment system. They  also learned about regional policies in detail.    At the Central Bank, the Cubans analyzed subjects such as  monetary, banking, and credit policy. They collected  information on similar subjects in other ministries. According  to Maira "it was something like an exhaustive trip to learn  about the Chilean economic system, and they collected useful  information because they are studying deep economic reforms.  The short-term work they are carrying out here will therefore  be very important for them."    He stressed that "the Cubans know they must adjust their  administrative apparatus, as their planned economy is  inefficient," and that is why they are studying various  experiences throughout the world that could inform their own  decision.    "They are seeking changes that will allow them to preserve  the national elements of independence and the accomplishments  attained through their former economic model. Their greatest  asset is that from being a colony in 1959, they have become a  country with national dignity," Maira said.    He added that "we showed the Cubans our house; we explained  to them our procedures, and they thanked us for this  information." Maira said the Cuban delegation received a good  impression of the capability and efficiency with which Chileans  have administrated their economy in the public and private  sectors.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "U.K.": "Wieslaw Kaczmarek on the Strike in the </F> Katowice Steelworks: `Meeting the Demands Endangers the  Enterprise'"]    [Text] Since 1 June, an occupation strike has been  in progress in the Katowice Steelworks, which was begun by the  "August 80" trade union and was joined by a significant portion  of the employees. Meeting the demands of the striking workers  would cause a loss of the enterprise's financial liquidity and  make it impossible for the enterprise to meet its obligations,  including salary obligations. The Katowice Steelworks would  then end the year with a 720 billion zloty [Z] deficit and with  an increase of salary costs amounting to Z130 billion, Ownership  Transformations Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek told journalists on 6  June.    The Ownership Transformations Ministry has also conducted  estimates of two other possible options. The first one envisages  further activity by the steelworks, without changes in the  salary situation. Under that option, the company would have a  chance to end the year with a surplus of Z160 billion. Under a  second scenario, where it is assumed that agreements signed on  31 May by six trade union centers would be implemented, the  steelworks would end the year with a deficit of Z86 billion,  with salary costs having risen by Z45 billion.    Because of the enterprise's particular significance for the  country's economy (steel pig-iron) and a network of cooperative  ties, the strike's impact will be felt not just by the  steelwork's employees. If there is someone who is deliberately  leading the enterprise to disaster, he should be aware of the  consequences, Minister Kaczmarek said. He added that, in this  situation, it will be the government's duty to have the  necessary imports of steel for domestic industries, even though  he would not like to threaten anyone with that.    Katowice Steelworks lived through its worst crisis in the  1991-92 period. The year 1993 showed the first symptoms of  overcoming the crisis--the steelworks ended the year with a  positive result of Z590 billion and a net profit amounting to  Z180 billion. At the same time, conciliation proceedings with  banks were conducted as a result of which the steelworks' debt  level was reduced by 30 percent. The remainder is to be repaid  in 18 installments by the end of 1994. The company also  received governmental guarantees for an investment in a  continuous steel-production division. These measures created a  chance for a better future for the enterprise. The current  situation creates the danger of wasting what has already been  achieved. I am afraid that the outcome of this will turn out to  be dangerous for many companies in Poland that will have nothing  to produce with. Already at this stage, trains with steel  pig-iron are being prevented from leaving, and that is called  anarchy.    I am hoping that the strike organizers will come to their  senses. In addition, all measures should be undertaken within  the confines of the law, Minister Kaczmarek said.</p>

The mass action is organized by the republic's striking  committee, whose headquarters told BELINFORM that the most  serious events are expected in the capital, as well as in Orsha,  a major railway junction, and Soligorsk, the republic's mining  center.    It appears that the call to strike has not met with support  in most work collectives. The official trade unions have said  in a statement that the action was premature, and many major  industrial enterprises have declaimed to join. The call for  mass action was condemned by the leaders of the parliament and  government.    As of this hour, the action concentrates on independence  square in Minsk, where tens of thousands of strikers from across  the republic first met in April 1991. Now no more than 2-3  thousand people have converged on the square.</p>

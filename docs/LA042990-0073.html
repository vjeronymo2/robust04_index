			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: STEINLEN'S CATS BY FRANCOIS FOSSIER (ABRAMS: $14.95)  </P> <P> Although a relatively obscure figure today, Theophile-Alexandre Steinlen  (1859-1923) was one of the most popular poster and graphic artists in belle  eepoque Paris.  </P> <P> He obviously adored cats, and depicted their every mood, capturing the gloss of  a sleek coat, the extension of a stretch or the sensual luxury of a pose in a  few sensitive lines or brush strokes. His realistic lithographs are  exceptionally tactile, while the glowering, stylized feline on his famous  poster for Rudolph Salis' Chat Noir cabaret must rank as the ultimate Halloween  cat. An ideal gift for a cat lover.  </P></p>

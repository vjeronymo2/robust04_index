			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM scorns utilities' windfall tax LABOUR'S plan for a windfall tax on privatised utilities was brushed off by Mr John Major yesterday as a product of the 'anti-business' thinking of the 1960s and 1970s, Philip Stephens writes. But as the gas, telephone, water and electricity companies escape the chill of the recession, Labour believes its proposal to claw back their 'excess' profits will strike a chord with the electorate. The plan - presented yesterday by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor - starts from the premise that the regulatory authorities have been ineffectual in holding the profits of the utilities to a sensible level. Mr Brown drew a parallel with the windfall tax imposed on the banks by the Conservative government in 1981. Lord Howe, who was then chancellor, judged that the banks had been unfairly shielded from the impact of the early 1980s recession. The cumulative profits of the utilities in the four years to 1992-93 will amount to more than Pounds 35bn, Labour estimates. Since 1989-90 they will have jumped by 70 per cent to Pounds 10.5bn a year. That contrasts with a severe squeeze on most corporate profits. Labour concludes that the utilities have been unfairly cushioned by their pricing structures and by the monopoly nature of their markets. The party's calculations suggest that rates of return running at 11 per cent or so for the water companies and at over 20 per cent for British Telecom are out of line with the risk faced by the industries and with their investment needs. Mr Brown will not put a figure on the 'excess', but one suggestion is that it ranges from a minimum of Pounds 500m to perhaps as much as Pounds 2.5bn. Mr Major stressed that the regulatory authorities could curb 'excess' profits by forcing lower prices, as in the case of British Telecom. But Mr Brown judges that the initial popularity of the privatised utilities has given way to resentment at their profits. He may have made also a blunter assessment: it is easier to propose taxing BT's profits than to suggest raising income tax.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Osaka, May 23 KYODO -- The Kansai Economic  Federation (Kankeiren) on Monday [23 May] appointed Tetsuro  Kawakami as its chairman to succeed Osamu Uno, who is retiring.    The selection of Kawakami, chairman of Sumitomo Electric  Industries Ltd., was adopted at a board meeting. The federation  is a business lobby representing Kansai-based firms.    Uno told a press conference after the meeting that the last  days of his seven-year term were focused on pulling the economy  out of the recession.    Kawakami chose as one of his priority projects during his  term a grandiose scheme to build a commercial and residential  town near the Kansai International Airport, slated to open in  early September, as well as other projects designed to boost the  status of Osaka as a key hub of Asia.</p>

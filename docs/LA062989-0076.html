			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY;  </P> <P> CODES, HOTEL TAX BOLSTERED  </P> <P> Funding for a code-enforcement task force and an increase in the hotel tax were  among the changes approved in the final operating budget adopted by the City  Council Monday night for the fiscal year that starts July 1.  </P> <P> The task force will consist of two officers now working in building and  property code enforcement, two additional officers, a deputy city attorney to  prosecute violators, and two staff people, said Finance Director Robert  Norquist. The cost of the task force, including computer and office equipment  is $260,000.  </P> <P> "This group will encourage and promote Culver City as a nicer, cleaner place to  live and work by making sure property is kept up to a certain level and  deterioration doesn't set in," Norquist said.  </P> <P> The council also approved an increase in the transient occupancy tax -- the  city's levy on hotel and motel rooms -- to 12% from 10%.  </P></p>

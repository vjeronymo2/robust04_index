			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN NEW SIGNAL OF SLOWING, APRIL FACTORY OUTPUT FELL  </P> <P> The nation's mines, factories and utilities operated at a lower rate last month  than in March, with a sharp drop in the output of motor vehicles and parts, the  Federal Reserve Board said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The new signs of economic sluggishness followed reports last week that retail  sales weakened in April while wholesale prices dropped from March levels, which  economists said might encourage Fed policy-makers to consider lowering interest  rates.  </P> <P> The Fed said industrial production for April fell 0.4%, the first decline since  January, when it fell a steep 1.0%. The rate rose 0.5% in March and 0.9% in  February.  </P> <P> The Fed said production of autos and light trucks fell nearly 14% in April from  March. But excluding motor vehicles and parts, industrial output was unchanged  in April and has shown little movement since January, the Fed added.  </P> <P> "We are accumulating a dossier that the economy lost some momentum during the  last month," said economist William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.  </P> <P> Joseph Carson, an economist at Chemical Bank, said that when all of the recent  data is analyzed collectively, the greater risk for the economy is slow growth,  not rising inflation.  </P> <P> "What today's data tells us is that the manufacturing sector has yet to hit  bottom and that talk of an inventory-led rebound in the economy is mistaken,"  he said.  </P> <P> Consumer goods production was down 1.0% in April after rises of 0.9% in March  and 1.1% in February. Business equipment, a category also affected by the auto  industry, dropped 0.9% last month after gains of 1.5% in March and 1.6% in  February.  </P> <P> The Fed said output of construction supplies also weakened in both April and  March, erasing gains from last fall and early this year when unseasonably warm  weather made it possible for builders to continue projects.  </P> <P> As a result, industrial operations ran at only 83.0% of capacity in April  compared to 83.5% in March and 83.2% in February.  </P> <P> The last time the rate was lower was in January, when capacity use fell to  82.7% because auto producers cut output and laid off workers temporarily while  dealers reduced stocks of unsold cars left over from late 1989.  </P> <P> Manufacturing output dropped to 82.2% of capacity in April from 82.9% in both  March and February, the Fed said. Operating rates for auto plants dropped to  65.1% in April from 75.6% in March.  </P> <P> In contrast, mining output increased to 88.3% from 87.4% because of gains in  the oil and gas sector and continued strength in coal mining, the Fed said.  </P> <P> Utility companies' operating rates were up to 87.1% in April from 86.6% in  March.  </P> <P> Carson believes the Fed will not change its credit policy in a hurry, but when  it does it will be toward reviving the economy with easier interest rates.  </P> <P> INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION  </P> <P> Seasonally adjusted index, 1987=100  </P> <P> April,'90: 108.7  </P> <P> March,'90: 109.1  </P> <P> April,'89: 108.6  </P> <P> CAPACITY UTILIZATION  </P> <P> Seasonally adjusted percent of total capacity  </P> <P> April,'90: 82.2%  </P> <P> March,'90: 82.9%  </P> <P> April,'89: 84.2%  </P> <P> Source: Federal Reserve Board  </P></p>

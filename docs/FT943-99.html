			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Denway earnings drop to HKDollars 19m Denway Investments, which indirectly controls a 46 per cent interest in Peugeot's car manufacturing business in Guangzhou, has reported a 90 per cent drop in first-half net earnings, down to HKDollars 19m (USDollars 2.46m) from HKDollars 201m. This is just a fraction of the HKDollars 132.9m earned in interest income from its massively popular public offering last February. Setting a new record in a market renowned for excess, Denway's issue was 657 times oversubscribed pulling in HKDollars 240bn - or around one-third of Hong Kong's GDP - for HKDollars 402m worth of stock. Even stripping out last year's one-off interest income, profits were still down by 68 per cent, which the group attributed to changing market conditions in China. However, car sales fell only 17 per cent. Earnings per share tumbled 92 per cent to 1.45 cents from 19.24 cents. Directors are recommending an interim dividend of 0.5 cents.</p>

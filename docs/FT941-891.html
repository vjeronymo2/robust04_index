			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Personal View: Labour needs to prove love of markets The UK Labour party says that it has come to love the market. Labour's leading figures proclaim they are committed to the mixed economy. But can we believe them? The party's attitude to the government's public sector reforms shows a deep-seated and enduring hostility. Labour continues to oppose market-type reforms in public services such as health and education. Yet evidence that such reforms can improve the quality of public services is growing nationally and internationally. This should make reform attractive to a party committed to raising standards. And market-type reforms appear to offer the only way of reconciling the conflicting pressures public services are under. Voters increasingly expect public services to be more responsive to their individual needs, as many private sector services have become. At the same time, they seem to have become reluctant to vote for higher taxes to pay for better services. So parties that promise to improve public services must explain how they will do it without raising taxes. Market-type reforms offer the solution by creating competition between suppliers of public services such as hospitals and schools. One immediate consequence is that the users can choose the type of service they prefer. If these organisations are rewarded according to the number of users they attract, they have incentives to meet individual needs. But competition also provides incentives for greater efficiency, especially if the suppliers are given the same sort of managerial freedom enjoyed by entrepreneurs in the private sector. More public services can be provided for the same budget if costs can be cut. For reasons such as these, governments of left and right, from Labor Australia to the UK Conservatives, have adopted what is known in the jargon as the purchaser/provider split in public services. The organisations that supply public services, the providers, are separated from those that commission and pay for them, the purchasers. The purchasers shop around among the providers to find the best value for money in internal markets. Providers compete for a share of the budget by striving to meet the needs of the users. The attractiveness of this strategy is hardly surprising. If market competition can raise efficiency, encourage innovation and cultivate concern for the customer in private sector services, it can provide similar benefits in the public services. Yet Labour has repeatedly attacked market-type reforms in *something in here (HP) * services such as health and education. Typically it describes them as 'commercialising' these services, distorting provision through competition and creating two-tier services. The very use of the term 'commercialising' in this negative sense betrays Labour's underlying attitude to the market. The purpose of public services is not changed by the introduction of internal markets. In most cases, they remain available according to the need, free at the point of use. The claim that the internal market distorts provision is just another way of calling for a return to central planning. It suggests that Labour still thinks bureaucrats in Whitehall, regional health authorities or town halls know best how to spend taxpayers' money. And the accusation of a two-tier service is another way of demanding equality of outcome, something that most people are unlikely to find attractive. One of the merits of internal markets is that they produce different outcomes as providers are rewarded for meeting individual needs. Some providers will be more successful than others in raising standards. But this does not mean creating a two-tier system forever: those that are less successful will have to improve their performance if they are not to lose customers. Such incentives are largely absent in top-down administered public services. This is not to deny that there can be undesirable side-effects of market-type reforms. An active competition policy is needed to stop monopolists or cartels milking the taxpayer. Transaction costs can rise excessively, especially if reforms artificially separate functions without introducing real competition. The most serious fear for Labour is that such reforms will reduce equity, a key value for a party of the left. This would happen if providers began to exclude people who make greater demands on them ('cream-skimming'). But cream-skimming can be best handled within the internal market, by increasing payments for people who make greater demands on public services. This gives providers an incentive to take them on, manipulating the market intelligently to achieve desired outcomes. Sadly, Labour finds it hard to think positively about how to use market forces in public services. The party's endorsement of the market economy will be hollow until it concedes that market-based reforms of the public services can yield similar benefits to those generated in the private sector.

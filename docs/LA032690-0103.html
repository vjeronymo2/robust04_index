			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> ROTARY CLUB TO OPEN IN MOSCOW  </P> <P> Rotary International, an independent business and charitable organization, will  open its first club in Moscow this week and hopes to start chapters in half a  dozen other Soviet cities, the organization's president said today.  </P> <P> Twenty-five Muscovites, including two lawyers, a theater manager and a  professional translator, will meet officially for the first time after three  years of difficult negotiations seeking guaranteed independence for the club.  </P> <P> "The (Soviet) government wanted to appoint the Rotary club members but we  backed away from that," said Hugh Archer from Rotary's headquarters here. "They  also wanted us to join the Committee for Youth Organizations but we refused to  have connections."  </P> <P> There are also groups ready to start clubs in Leningrad, Kiev, Irkutsk and the  Baltic republics of Lithuania and Latvia.  </P></p>

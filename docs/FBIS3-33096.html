			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Havana, 16 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- It was reported here  today Cuban Defense Minister General Raul Castro had rejected  the possibility that Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR) officers  and soldiers will surrender or desert massively in the future    "They cannot dream about massive surrenders or a generalized  collapse. The fight against us is to the death," the top Cuban  military commander has said in a speech to commanders, officers,  and midranking personnel of the western Army.    Raul Castro has said the Cuban Government will act  forcefully  and coldbloodedly, "will not fall for provocations or allow them  to take the initiative on any terrain."    Raul Castro, who is also the second secretary of the  governing Communist Party, has inaugurated the annual training  period of this section of the public force, which encloses the  western provinces of Pinar del Rio, Havana, Havana City, and the  special municipality of Isla de la Juventud.    He said although the Cuban Armed Forces budget has been cut  50 percent, the training program for FAR commanders, officers,  and midranking personnel would be consolidated in 1994.    Up to the beginning of this decade, the former Soviet Union  furnished the Cuban Armed Forces with planes, weapons, and  ammunition, and top-ranking Cuban officers received military  training in that country as well.    At the event, which was held at the San Antonio de los Banos  Air Base, President Fidel Castro's brother said despite the  current economic crisis in Cuba, FAR made "a giant effort" in  1993 to ensure that its combat capacity not be eroded.    He added he had recently visited Army units in the central  and eastern regions of the island and was able to see how the  troops were trained, the maintenance given to weapons, the  preparation of the military operations area, and how the  soldiers tilled the land.</p>

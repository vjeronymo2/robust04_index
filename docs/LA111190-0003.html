			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> With interest in ETs and UFOs soaring, it is time to bring back "The Invaders,"  the well-executed series from 1967 that focused on a young architect's quest to  thwart an alien takeover of terra firma. Roy Thinnes, the star of that series,  could take up where he left off, combatting the invasion.  </P> <P> Franklin R. Ruehl, Glendale  </P></p>

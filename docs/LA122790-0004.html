			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY  </P> <P> Petite France, 1835 Newport Blvd., Suite D-156, Costa Mesa. Open daily, except  Sunday, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. (714) 650-9363.  </P> <P> About the only hints that this storefront stand is a low-budget operation are  the foam serving trays and plastic utensils. The quality of the food -- from  beef Bourguignon in red wine sauce to prawns sauteed with cilantro -- is light  years beyond the nearest Happy Star. Yet most entrees are under $5.

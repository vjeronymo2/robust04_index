			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Row over EC regional commissione THE political impartiality of Mr Bruce Millan, the EC Commissioner for regional policy, was questioned by Mr Edward Leigh, junior trade and industry minister, in the Commons yesterday, Ivor Owen writes. He accused Mr Millan, a former Labour cabinet minister, of holding back Pounds 109m in EC funds intended to benefit coalfield communities in Britain. The minister claimed that while Mr Millan was dissatisfied with the accountancy procedures of Italy, the Netherlands and France in respect of EC funds, he had chosen to withhold only grants due to Britain because of arrangements designed to ensure that the level of public expenditure was determined at Westminster and not in Brussels. Mr Tam Dalyell (Lab Linlithgow) attacked Mr Leigh for a 'slur' on Mr Millan, and recalled that a leaked draft letter disclosed that Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, had argued that the government's arrangements for dealing with the EC funds were 'no longer tenable'. OIL REVENUES: The Treasury has gained Pounds 72bn from North Sea oil revenues since 1969-70, or Pounds 112bn at today's prices, Mr John Maples, economic secretary to the Treasury, said in a Commons written reply yesterday.</p>

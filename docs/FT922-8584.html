			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / International Company News: BA, KLM, Lufthansa close to Hungarian carrier stake BRITISH Airways, Lufthansa and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines have all emerged as the leading contenders to acquire a minority stake in Malev, the Hungarian national airline. The contest between the three big European carriers to forge an equity partnership with Malev is now reaching a critical stage. Price negotiations between the various candidates and the Hungarian authorities are scheduled to start later this month with Hungary hoping to complete a deal by the middle of this year. The deal, for about 35 per cent of the group, would not only lead to a partial privatisation of the Hungarian carrier but strengthen it financially and operationally through a partnership with a big western airline. The funds raised by the equity sale will help Malev fund its Dollars 400m estimated investment needs over the next two years. The airline is bringing two Boeing 767-200 aircraft into service for routes to North America and the Far East, and is linking up to international computer booking systems. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the multilateral institution to promote economic recovery in eastern Europe, is also evaluating an equity participation in Malev alongside the winning airline bidder. Credit Suisse First Boston, the investment bank, is acting for the Hungarian authorities which will retain the remaining interest. The attractions of Malev to airlines like BA, KLM or Lufthansa include one of the most modern and profitable fleets among east European carriers as well as access to Budapest's revamped Ferihegy airport. At the geographical heart of eastern Europe, the airport could emerge as an important hub. The proposed Malev transaction is similar to the recent investment by a consortium including Air France and the EBRD in CSA, the Czechoslovak state carrier. Air France and its partners agreed to invest the equivalent of Dollars 60m for a 40 per cent shareholding of CSA. But Air France itself put up only Dollars 5m in cash. Given the strong competition for Malev, bankers are hoping that the terms of the western bid will be substantially better than that for CSA. EBRD merchant bankers said yesterday that the bank's participation - important in sweetening the deal for airline investors - would depend on the nature of the airlines' offers. The EBRD appears anxious not to repeat the controversy over its involvement in the CSA acquisition. A US official argued that investment by a state-owned company like Air France did not amount to privatisation, ran counter to the EBRD's mandate of encouraging the private sector in eastern Europe, and therefore should not be repeated.</p>

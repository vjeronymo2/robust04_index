			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: WHEN DID PROBLEMS BEGIN? IT'S ACADEMIC  </P> <P> If you're still catching up on those copies of Sports Illustrated piled next to  your night stand, you might want to skim ahead to Page 56 of the Sept. 3 issue,  near the end of Douglas S. Looney's cover story on USC quarterback Todd  Marinovich.  </P> <P> Looney wrote that Marinovich could turn professional early, adding: "Another  indication that he might not stay at USC for the full term is that, as his 2.23  grade-point average attests, he has little interest in being a student."  </P> <P> Add Marinovich: Tuesday, he was suspended by Coach Larry Smith and will not  play in today's game against Arizona State at Tempe, Ariz., partly because,  Smith said, Marinovich violated a team rule by repeatedly missing classes.  </P> <P> In the Sports Illustrated story, Marinovich told Looney: "One of the first  things the older guys laid on me when I got here was that C's get degrees, and  sometimes D's."  </P> <P> Smith told Looney: "(Marinovich's) biggest academic weakness is getting up."  </P> <P> Trivia time: What do the Boxing Hall of Fame, the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame and  the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Hall of Fame have in common?  </P> <P> Cutting class, Part 2: We won't know until this afternoon whether Brigham Young  quarterback Ty Detmer snatched victory from the jaws of defeat Friday.  </P> <P> During a zoology lab session, Detmer was dissecting a shark when his scalpel  slipped, opening a cut in the palm of his left (non-throwing) hand that  required two stitches.  </P> <P> Detmer practiced with the Cougars Friday but had no trouble taking snaps. And  he's expected to have less trouble with New Mexico today than he had with the  shark.  </P> <P> No need: The Denton (Tex.) Record-Chronicle recently reported that during a  girls' under-12 soccer game between the Lewisville Blaze and the Denton  Solhers, the fathers of two Denton players became so frustrated with the  outstanding play of Lewisville's 10-year-old goalie, Natasha Dennis, that they  asked league officials to verify Natasha's gender.  </P> <P> Said Natasha: "I think they should go somewhere and check and see if they have  anything between their ears."  </P> <P> Buhdeeuhbuhdeeuhbuhdee: Tom Archdeacon of the Dayton Daily News, reporting on  Evander Holyfield's third-round knockout of Buster Douglas, began his story:  "As one Porky now should say to the other: 'That's all, folks!' "  </P> <P> Expert commentary: Before Thursday night's heavyweight championship bout, Times  staff writer Thomas Bonk briefed his 3-year-old son, Tanner, on the names of  the fighters.  </P> <P> Friends came over to watch the fight, and Tanner joined the group.  </P> <P> Friday at breakfast, Bonk pointed to the photo on Page 1 of The Times' sports  section, which showed Douglas lying on the canvas.  </P> <P> Bonk asked: "Who's this guy?"  </P> <P> Said Tanner: "Buster Gutless."  </P> <P> She's no whiner: After her Independence (W. Va.) High School girls' basketball  team had lost to Princeton High this week, Coach Kathy Daniels said: "It's a  little ridiculous. I'm upset about it."  </P> <P> Princeton won, 116-7.  </P> <P> Add girls' basketball: Asked about the halftime discussion in the Princeton  locker room, assistant coach Robin Beamer said: "There's not a whole lot to go  over when you're up 59-1."  </P> <P> Princeton Coach Debbie Ball denied that she was trying to run up the score,  adding: "I could've put them in a full-court press."  </P> <P> With good reason: From the Associated Press, previewing one of today's eastern  college football matchups: "First things first. While a date with Notre Dame  looms ever closer, Navy will not be looking past James Madison toward next  week's encounter with the third-ranked Fighting Irish."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: None of them has a building.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Montreal Expo third baseman Tim Wallach, on being named the team's  most valuable player for the second consecutive season: "I don't know if it's  because we've lost a lot of good players or I'm getting better."

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Chelsfield climbs to Pounds 4m at midway Chelsfield, the property company chaired by Mr Elliott Bernerd which came to the market last December, announced interim pre-tax profits ahead from Pounds 2.04m to Pounds 4.03m and plans to press ahead with a large central London office development. The company also announced the sale of a 50 per cent stake in Wool House, an office block in the St James's area of London's West End, to AMP Asset management for Pounds 20.5m. The price is equivalent to half the book value of Wool House in Chelsfield's accounts. Chelsfield will use the proceeds to build up to 120,000 sq ft of new office space in partnership with AMP. Mr Bernerd said that rents were moving in the company's favour, so the decision had been taken to start development without pre-letting space to tenants. In the six months to June 30 net income from properties amounted to Pounds 8.4m (Pounds 6.9m). Mr Bernerd said that the outcome of rent reviews due to take place at the Merry Hill shopping centre in the West Midlands, in which Chelsfield has a 50 per cent stake, will have a big impact on future rental income. Interest costs were sharply lower at Pounds 4.41m (Pounds 7.38m), and administration expenses were Pounds 2.32m against Pounds 2.83m. Earnings per share were 2.1p, adjusted for shares issued at the time of the float, against 2.2p. The interim dividend is 1p and the company plans to make a 1.4p final pay-out. The shares closed unchanged at 163p against an offer price of 155p in December.</p>

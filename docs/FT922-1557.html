			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / US Money and Credit: Economic data prove disappointing IT IS NOT exactly another double dip (or, to be exact, a triple dip), but Wall Street is having to revise its forecasts in the wake of the most recent economic data. After the solid 2.4 per cent growth achieved in the first quarter (that figure is due for revision this week but little change in the number is expected), economists are now predicting the economy will have probably grown not much more than 1.5 per cent during the second quarter. The reason for this depressing downward revision is last week's raft of economic statistics which suggested that the economy is not growing as fast as originally hoped. The clearest indication of the need to revise second-quarter GDP numbers came from the April trade data. The figures released by the Commerce Department on Thursday showed that the merchandise trade deficit widened in April from Dollars 5.6bn in March to almost Dollars 7bn, the largest trade shortfall since November 1990. The reason for the widened deficit was a 1.9 per cent drop in the value of exported goods (down to Dollars 36.4bn) and a 1.6 per cent increase in imported goods (up to Dollars 43.3bn). The drop in exports was particularly worrying, as it confirmed that the economic travails of foreign countries could prove a drag on US economic growth over the next six to 12 months. Until April, the US was at least able to rely on steadily growing export sales to aid the domestic recovery. If that particular prop is now removed, the recovery in the US may prove to be even more anaemic than feared. What is more, the rise in imports during April was not necessarily evidence of increased domestic demand, but more a reflection of higher oil prices. Hence the downward revision in forecasts for second-quarter GDP, and economists are now predicting flat export and modest import growth over the rest of the second half, neither of which is much use to the US economy. Most of the rest of last week's news was also on the bearish side. While May housing starts rose a handsome 11 per cent, all it did was reverse two months of declines. Clear proof of a sustained increase in housing activity has yet to be discerned. The latest snapshot of retail sales was also unfavourable, with the Johnson Redbook service reporting that department and chain store sales dropped 4.5 per cent on a seasonally adjusted annual rate between May and the first half of June. Labour market conditions also show little sign of improvement, with weekly jobless claims falling a meagre 2,000 in the latest week. So will all the economic gloom presage another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve? Probably not, judging by the Fed's 'Beige Book' report on economic conditions, released last week. The tone of the book was cautiously optimistic and suggested that the economy continued to improve across the country, albeit at a slow pace. The Beige Book depressed the Treasury markets because its message seemed to be: steady as she goes. Some economists, however, are hopeful that the Fed will ease policy one more time. They believe that if retail sales, labour market conditions and the housing market all remain weak - or at least not strong enough to fuel a strong recovery - then the Fed will lower interest rates again. Although predicting the Fed's actions is a dangerous game, bond market optimists think both the Fed funds rate and the discount rate will be cut by half a percentage point within the next month, quite possibly in early July.</p>

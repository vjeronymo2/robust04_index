			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Alcatel/Northern Mr Michael Heseltine's referral to the MMC of Alcatel's proposed acquisition of Northern Telecom's undersea cables business raises some ticklish issues of international competition policy. The EC has sidestepped consideration of the deal because it did not reach its turnover threshold. Yet it is not immediately clear why UK competition authorities should become so agitated, given that national market shares are somewhat meaningless in the undersea cables business. After expressing some earlier reservations, even BT refrained from making representations to the OFT. From a global perspective, however, there is perhaps cause for consternation. The international market is consolidating fast, raising fears of cartelisation. Alcatel suggests that of all the undersea fibre-optic cable installed since 1985, AT&amp;T accounts for 37 per cent of the Dollars 10bn market, Northern 23 per cent, Alcatel 19 per cent, and a Japanese consortium 18 per cent. Even considering Mr Heseltine's fondness for European industrial champions, consummation of the proposed merger would represent a worrying degree of concentration. In the past, national competition authorities have acted together to block contentious international acquisitions - Gillette's proposed deal with Eemland being the most notable example. But this is an unsatisfactory and haphazard procedure. Nascent proposals to include international competition issues in the next round of Gatt talks should be developed.</p>

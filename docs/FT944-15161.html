			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (3): Green with ambition / Political profile of Jup Weber Mr Jup Weber, the first Green that Luxembourg has sent to the European Parliament, is a man of ambition who would like to work himself out of a job, at least a political one, writes David Gardner. 'I said 10 years ago that my dream was that in 10 years' time we wouldn't be necessary any more. But the fact is that we are still very, very necessary,' Mr Weber says. Before he retires from the fray, he can envisage an eventual stint as environment minister in one of the coalitions that habitually govern the Grand Duchy, none of which have yet extended to ecologists. Mr Weber, a genial 44-year-old forestry engineer, first won election to Luxembourg's national assembly in 1984 as part of the first wave of ecologists entering parliament across Europe, or at least the more prosperous and environmentally aware northern parts. It is not difficult to see why Luxembourg - the richest European Union country on a per capita basis and the only country in the Union where growth did not turn negative in the recent recession - should feel it can afford a green conscience. But this is not to deny the achievement of Mr Weber as that conscience's main expression, particularly in unifying the fissiparous Green constituency in the Grand Duchy around his own pragmatic, or 'Realo', faction. The Greens, along with the Christian Democrats and Socialists - who have formed three successive government coalitions since 1984 - and the Liberals, can now lay claim to be mainstream players in Luxembourg politics. Indeed, the Luxembourgeois Greens, polling some 12 per cent in the Grand Duchy's national and European elections last June, got the best score of any environmental party in the Union. This reflects not only the comfort of prosperity, but acute ecological challenges facing Luxembourg which, as a micro-state at the junction of France, Germany and Belgium, has only a loose grip on environmental levers. Citizens fret about motorways and waste dumping, greenhouse gases and the ring of their neighbours' nuclear power plants surrounding them. The already extensive motorway system is being extended and widened, partly to ease the congestion caused by high per capita car ownership and the flood of foreigners who commute to work in Luxembourg - but also, it seems to many residents, for the benefit of through traffic and road freight which just uses Luxembourg as a motorway. There has been virulent local opposition to a new waste recycling plant planned for Mamer near the border with Belgium. Because of its tiny size, Luxembourg traditionally exported its waste to neighbours for recycling, but it is bowing to EU pressure for waste management close to source. Luxembourgers worry about emissions from their steel industry, the original source of their wealth, which even in much-slimmed-down form makes their country the highest per capita producer of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in the EU, at more than four times the Union average. The link between Arbed, the large Luxembourg steel manufacturer, and imported nuclear-generated electricity, is one of Mr Weber's particular bete noires. Arbed, as part of its restructuring, is converting to electric arc furnaces and will be buying in electricity from Belgian and French nuclear plants, including Cattenom, just over the French border and 25km from where Mr Weber lives in Junglinster. The Green leader sees this as long-term endorsement of the nuclear power option - with the difference that Luxembourg has no regulatory control over the actual plants producing the electricity. Instead, he wants gas turbine plants built inside Luxembourg. 'I can see being environment and energy minister in five to 10 years time,' he says confidently, 'and going to Paris to ask them to close it (Cattenom), and being told, quite correctly, that Arbed depends on it.' Another of Mr Weber's prime targets has been the Grand Duchy's petrol prices, significantly below EU rates because of minimal excise taxes. He wants an end to the 'scandalous gasoline tourism' this generates through drivers filling up in the Grand Duchy. In the June elections, the Greens called for immediate equalisation with neighbouring petrol prices, and then incremental tax rises thereafter. Opponents painted this as a price quadrupling, which 'cost us two seats in the Luxembourg parliament,' Mr Weber claims. Yet he believes that an important battle was won, because he is convinced that when Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, the current finance and labour minister, takes over as prime minister in December, eco-taxes on petrol and non-recyclable packaging and containers will gradually be introduced. 'I've been preaching for 10 years that we should have eco-taxes, and now they're going to do it,' Mr Weber predicts confidently. Scaremongering did not prevent the Greens winning their coveted seat in the European Parliament, which Mr Weber regards as 'a fantastic instrument for international networking.' He has long advised the Green group at Strasbourg on forestry conservation, and will now be working with the parliament's environment, agriculture, and external economic relations committees. Mr Weber, trained as a forestry engineer at the University of Vienna and with a background in Luxembourg's own forestry administration, has combined politics with half-time work for his own consultancy, presently engaged in pilot forestry management projects in Siberia and Canada. Luxembourg law defines an MP's role as a half-time profession requiring an average 20 hours a week; 'a very good system for avoiding addiction to politics,' Mr Weber smiles, and one he intends to continue as an MEP. 'I'm involved in a fascinating project in Siberia and I'm not going to give that up,' he says firmly. He has already given an earnest indication of his independence at Strasbourg, annoying his fellow Euro-Greens by being the only one of their number to vote in July for Mr Jacques Santer, the outgoing Luxembourg prime minister, as successor to Mr Jacques Delors presiding over the European Commission. 'I had fierce problems,' he recalls, 'but I too was annoyed with their argument that a small country equals a weak president.' For a Luxembourg Green, small is beautiful, but - as the ecological challenges which the Grand Duchy faces demonstrate - it is also problematic.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] President Mario Soares and Prime  Minister Cavaco Silva "have buried the hatchet," even if the  length of the truce is yet unknown, writes Fernando Madrinha in  the 5 February Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO. On the president's side,  it is being said that "a sort of tacit agreement" has been  reached to avoid conflicts, Madrinha notes. On the other hand, a  Cavaco aide is cited as pointing out, with regard to Soares's  new attitude, that "his words do not always match his deeds."  While there are indications that cohabitation is going well and  that "institutional peace is now a fact," no predictions are  made on whether this is a "short-term truce" or whether it will  be a "lasting peace" in light of the fact that both sides have  recognized the impossibility of hurting each other with  impunity. According to Madrinha, one ought to keep in mind, as a  motive for the appeasement, that polls repeatedly revealed the  Portuguese people's dislike for confrontations at the highest  level. Soares, who is "inexorably marching toward the autumn of  his active political life," must now take care of his place in  history, a fact he knows well, Madrinha remarks. The president  may have decided that tranquil cohabitation will ensure him a  "glorious exit" from the political scene, he concludes.</p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / CIA gave wrong data on Iraq loans THE Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), in an unusual public statement on intelligence matters, has admitted that it provided the US Justice Department and federal prosecutors with incorrect information about illegal loans to Iraq, made by the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL). While denying it had made any effort to cover up knowledge of the BNL affair, the CIA admitted that its response to a prosecutor's request for information on the alleged involvement of BNL's Rome head office in the Atlanta scandal was 'incomplete'. Two weeks ago, the Justice Department made public a September 17 letter from the CIA which claimed its only knowledge of Rome's awareness of the Iraqi loans came from 'publicly available information.' This, however, was soon contradicted by other CIA reports. The issue of CIA knowledge of the illegal Iraqi loans is at the heart of the BNL case since the Bush administration has argued in court that the entire Dollars 5bn loan operation - of vital importance to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's nuclear, chemical and missile projects - was single-handedly organised by BNL's former Atlanta manager. Immediately after the CIA claim was made, however, a firestorm of criticism was directed by Congressional leaders at Mr Robert Gates, CIA director. He was accused of having provided misleading information, since classified CIA reports sent to Congress explicitly stated that the CIA had independently confirmed press reports that 'more senior BNL officials in Rome' knew of BNL Atlanta's activities, and that some Iraqi loans had even been approved in Rome. The CIA's knowledge is also relevant since a federal judge said in Atlanta last week he did not believe the US government's case. He ordered a full BNL trial of the former Atlanta manager. The judge also said CIA documents he had received provided 'definite' proof of Rome's involvement. Judge Marvin Shoob also demanded that a special prosecutor investigate the BNL case, a call that was also made by Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate. Other documents released in Atlanta included a memo from one prosecutor who was worried he might have accidentally stumbled onto a CIA covert operation to arm Iraq by using BNL loans. Mr Mark Mansfield, CIA spokesman, yesterday said there was no intention to mislead anyone or to hold anything back. 'It was the result of an honest mistake and a record system that is somewhat less than perfect,' he said. Mr Mansfield added that Mr Gates had requested the CIA inspector-general to conduct a review of the BNL issue and to report back by the end of the year.</p>

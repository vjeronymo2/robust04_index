			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Now to Rwanda, where a cease-fire has been declared  by the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] rebels, starting from  midnight last night. It comes after three weeks of massacres in  several parts of the country during which tens of thousands have  lost their lives. Rwandan Government forces have also announced  a cease-fire starting today. But the United Nations has been  unable to get the two sides together to agree on the ground  (?rules). RPF Secretary General Theogene Rudasingwa is in  Nairobi at the moment. On the line Robin White asked him if the  cease-fire was holding:    [Begin recording] [Rudasingwa] Our forces began respecting  the cease-fire, which we declared on Saturday [23 April], with  effect from midnight last night, but the government troops have  been shelling our positions until actually early this afternoon.    [White] Does that mean you will not keep the cease-fire any  longer?    [Rudasingwa] We are going to keep the cease-fire but, of  course, we do have a legitimate obligation to respond to some of  these violations at the time of our own choosing.    [White] So, how long will you give government forces to obey  before you start fighting again yourselves?    [Rudasingwa] First of all, we had expected that the troops  would immediately respect the cease-fire because the cease-fire  takes two to respect. Secondly, we have given a 96-hour grace  period within which the government forces must stop the killings.    [White] Now, what is the current military position now, as  you said. How much territory do you currently claim to control?    [Rudasingwa] Well, we do control, I think, close to half of  the territory of Rwanda and the position -- the latest which I  have -- is that they had an upper hand shortly before we  declared the cease-fire and they are remaining in those  positions.    [White] How far have you advanced since the fighting  started, since the death of President Habyarimana?    [Rudasingwa] We have definitely advanced close to Kigali.  As you know, we do control some stratetic locations within  Kigali.    [White] But how many miles have you actually advanced?    [Rudasingwa] Well, the distance we are talking about may be  close to 40, between 40 and 60 kms occasionally.    [White] And do you control any territory at all south of the  capital?    [Rudasingwa] As of now, no. I am not aware of any position  that we do control in the south of the capital.    [White] Do you have any plans, if the cease-fire breaks  down, to try and take over territories south of the capital?    [Rudasingwa] Well, if the cease-fire fails, then we continue  with the struggle elsewhere. We shall continue with the  objective of contributing to the restoration of law and order.  If that means that we should hold some positions anywhere in  the territory of Rwanda, then we shall proceed to do that.    [White] I am wondering if in the back of your mind you are  thinking of the partition of the country, with you controlling  the north and forces which are basically Hutu controlling the  south?    [Rudasingwa] (?Unfortunately no), I am sorry to [words  indistinct] because we do have a national agenda. We do have a  patriotic obligation to rescue the entire people of Rwanda, to  rescue the entire territory of Rwanda, and it would be  inappropriate and highly irresponsible on the part of anybody to  leave any part of the country or any section of the population  to some of the people who have unleashed a lot of terror on the  population.

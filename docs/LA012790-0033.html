			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PBS BROADCAST OF AN ISRAELI VIEW OF INTIFADA  </P> <P> "Solid Ground" presents Israeli terrorists-in-uniform as soft-hearted  youngsters forced to do "disagreeable duty" in self-defense. It paints the Arab  world as the faceless threat to the pretty children of a beleaguered land; it  attacks the victims of Israeli brutalities and encourages the attackers; it  does violence to truth and justice with a callousness that brings PBS hypocrisy  to a new low.  </P> <P> The result of the TV broadcast is to perpetuate Israeli oppression by  misrepresenting the intifada to Americans and by creating an atmosphere in  which the United States can continue to fund repression and rights violations.  </P> <P> HAMID BOROUMAND, Claremont  </P></p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Inflation news fails to give Dow lasting lift Wall Street RETREATING bond prices and concern about passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement through congress saw US stocks end mixed yesterday in spite of posting solid early gains in the wake of surprisingly good inflation news, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 7.83 down at 3,640.07, about 30 points below the day's high. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended just 0.12 up at 460.33, while the American SE composite lost 0.58 at 476.02, but the Nasdaq composite gained 3.63 at 769.84. NYSE volume came to 276m shares. Stocks rose from the opening, buoyed by a sharp rise in Treasury prices  - during the morning the benchmark 30-year issue advanced more than a point and the yield fell to 6.118 per cent - and good news on inflation, which came in the form of a 0.2 per cent decline in the October producer prices index. Analysts had been expecting a small increase in the PPI. There was even better news in the form of the 'core' measure of the PPI (this excludes the volatile food and energy components), which fell by 0.5 per cent last month. The surprisingly positive inflation figures not only lifted bond prices, but also helped allay what ever fears equity investors might have had that the Federal Reserve would be forced to put up interest rates to prevent a resurgent economy from reigniting inflation. Stocks stumbled during the afternoon, however, as bond prices began to retreat from their highs following a disappointingly weak auction of new three-year notes. Share prices were also undermined by growing concern about the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The vice-president was due to debate with Nafta opponent Mr Ross Perot on US television last night, and the markets remained worried that congress might not vote to ratify the treaty next week. News that RJR Nabisco is putting up cigarette prices by 4 cents a pack raised hopes that the cigarette price war is over and boosted tobacco stocks. RJR improved Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 6 3/4 in volume of 6m shares and Philip Morris advanced Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 55 3/4 . A broker's upgrade lifted Banc One Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 37 in active trading. Smith Barney Shearson put out a buy recommendation on the stock. Good quarterly earnings helped WalMart gain Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 28 3/4 and The Limited put on Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 20 3/8 . Motorola moved ahead Dollars 1 to Dollars 99 3/4 on news that it has purchased a 20 per cent stake in Nextel, the mobile communications service provider. Nextel climbed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 47 1/4 on the Nasdaq market. Canada TORONTO stocks were solidly higher in extremely heavy trading. The TSE 300 index ended 34.9 up at 4,251.4, with advances leading declines by 435 to 345 after a record turnover of 105.2m shares. Volume was swollen by 34.8m shares traded in Bramalea, which jumped 10 cents to 48 cents. The company said it had not made any announcements which would cause the increased activity in its shares, but reiterated that it is well ahead of its cash flow targets for the fiscal year that ended last month.</p>

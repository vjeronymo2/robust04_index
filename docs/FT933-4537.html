			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: Heinz surprises Wall St with rise in first quarter H. J. HEINZ, the US food group, yesterday surprised Wall Street by posting improved earnings for the first quarter. For the three months to July 28, Heinz posted net income of Dollars 152.2m, or 59 cents a share. A year earlier the company had underlying earnings of Dollars 143.8m, or 55 cents, before charges for accounting changes of Dollars 133.6m, which reduced reported net income to Dollars 10.2m, or 4 cents. Sales edged slightly higher to Dollars 1.58bn in the latest quarter from Dollars 1.56bn a year ago. On Wall Street yesterday, shares in Heinz rose Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 37 1/2 by midday, but later fell back to close Dollars  1/8 down on the day at Dollars 37 1/8 . In recent weeks the stock price has slumped, reflecting investors' concern that the food industry might suffer from a price war. Most analysts had expected Heinz to earn 57 cents a share in the latest quarter. The Pittsburgh-based company said its pet food products posted volume gains in the latest quarter, as did its Ore-Ida food industry potatoes, especially in the UK, Italy, Spain and central Europe. However, these gains were offset by volume declines in its StarKist tuna, Weight Watchers frozen food and Heinz grocery ketchup products. Sales were lifted by a 1.3 per cent increase in prices in the latest quarter and by the acquisition of the Wattie's Limited business in New Zealand, which lifted sales 6.3 per cent. The benefits of the Wattie's acquisition was offset by the impact of a stronger US dollar against most currencies. Mr Tony O'Reilly, Heinz chief executive, said he was pleased with the latest results, 'given the current economic environment in the US and overseas'. In June, Heinz said it would take a Dollars 192m pre-tax charge against fourth-quarter earnings to cover a number of cost-cutting measures including an 8 per cent workforce reduction and a cut in its UK operations. Mr O'Reilly said the restructuring charge would hasten productivity improvements and concentrate a three-year rationalisation programme into 12 months. But analysts saw the move as further evidence of the intense competition in the retail sector which is putting pressure on the big consumer products companies.</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> MEXICO CITY VENDORS BATTLE POLICE; 15 HURT  </P> <P> Hundreds of unauthorized street vendors near the presidential palace fought a  pitched battle with riot police, and reports said 15 people were injured.  </P> <P> The confrontation took place Tuesday evening on a block of Venustiano Carranza  Street where some 300 vendors sell trinkets, transistor radios and other goods  in makeshift stalls. The street is in the city's central district of historical  buildings.  </P> <P> A police department news release said the riot squad was deployed when the  vendors, who were blocking pedestrian and vehicle traffic, refused to clear the  street. The injured, none of whom were seriously injured, were given first aid.  </P> <P> For many months, shopkeepers have been complaining that the vendors, who pay no  taxes and are not burdened with overhead costs, have been taking business away  from them unfairly.  </P></p>

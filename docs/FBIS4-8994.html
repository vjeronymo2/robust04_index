			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with President Vaclav Havel by Petr </F> Dudek in Litomysl on 16 April: "The Main Thing Is a Good  Regional Atmosphere"]    [Text] The weekend [15-16 April] meeting involving seven  presidents fulfilled the expectations of host Vaclav Havel "to  the utmost" in several points. At a press briefing held after  the departure of his counterparts, the president hailed, in  particular, the congenial course of the in camera meetings.  Vaclav Havel granted an interview to LIDOVE NOVINY immediately  after the meeting.    [Dudek] Will the results of the Litomysl meeting manifest  themselves in the everyday lives of citizens in Central Europe,  or is this merely the start of a specific process and we will  just have to wait for it to bear fruit?    [Havel] I do not think we have initiated a definite  political process because the concept of a political process  usually means the preparation of something--for example, a  specific resolution, a declaration, a treaty, and so on. It is  not a process in this sense; it is something else. It is, as I  have already said several times, the creation or joint creation  of a good regional atmosphere. The more politicians get to know  one another, the more they exchange views, and the more often  they meet, the better they see into each other's souls and thus  create a more favorable environment for the political processes  about which you are asking.    [Dudek] In Saturday's [16 April] debate, President Klestil  commented that the opening of long impermeable borders has also  brought certain problems--mass migration, for example. Is the  Czech taxpayer prepared to bear part of the burden that  migration may bring to the Central European region in the near  future?    [Havel] Of course, migration may cause various problems, and  it is causing them. Two tasks lie ahead of us. First, it is  necessary to somehow regulate migration because certain  countries may be prepared to a varying degree to accept  refugees. Each of them must gauge its potential; it cannot open  itself to everyone without limit. Not only the country's  citizens, but also the refugees would be the worse for this.  The second task is to remind our public again and again that  there were times when hundreds of thousands of people fled from  our country and found a warm reception in Switzerland, Canada,  and many other countries.    The fundamental issue--I would say directly that it is an  issue of universal solidarity--is that we must be capable here  and there of taking in someone in need, someone fleeing from  somewhere, especially if he is fleeing from armed conflict,  poverty, and suffering. We must understand and somehow help  him. It is impossible for us to keep on wanting someone to help  us and be unable ourselves to help anyone and turn up our noses  at those who are, at the moment, in a worse situation than we  are. There were times when even we did not have it so good.    I admit that, following decades of total isolation,  migration  is a new phenomenon that our society is not used to. It may  provoke all sorts of social tensions, but we must work on  ourselves in this issue.    [Dudek] Do the Czechs still have the capacity to make  sacrifices? Are we not at risk from the affluent indifference  your counterpart Weizsaecker referred to in Litomysl in  connection with the Germans?    [Havel] Thousands of the most multifarious good and bad  traits slumber in the soul of society. We can be at risk from  anything--good and bad. It is up to us which of our qualities  we activate, which ones we rely on, which ones we develop, and  for which ones we create favorable scope.    [Dudek] Western Europe, despite the fact that it officially  recognizes the integration of East and Central Europe, remains,  to put it mildly, hesitant about opening up its own markets.  During your talks, did your partners from Germany and Austria  show any sign of adopting a more accommodating stance?    [Havel] This was quite a topical subject, let us say, a year  ago. It seems to me that the situation has improved a little  since then--for example, certain quotas and restrictions applied  by the Austrian side to our goods have gradually been removed.  Our association agreement with the European Union is even  asymmetrical in our favor. It seems to me that this  protectionism is ceasing to be the most pressing problem.    Of course, it nevertheless holds true that all barriers  should be removed more and as much as possible and that we  should become part of a free economic environment. Allowance  should also be made for our specific situation. Allowance  should be made for the fact that our entire former--in essence,  artificial--market has collapsed and, therefore, that we are in  a more trying situation than other democratic countries that  were not so completely tied to an abnormal market.    [Dudek] When will a settlement be reached in mutual  Czech-German relations, as has already happened between Germany  and Poland? What is preventing an honorable solution to this  problem, a problem that is holding back Czech-German  cooperation? Did you discuss this with President Weizsaecker?    [Havel] Of course, we discussed this. We discussed it  privately, during unofficial occasions, at dinner, and so on. I  would say two things about this. First, the impression is  sometimes given that the two obstacles that lie between us, the  Sudeten-German issue and compensation, have prevented good  relations with Germany. There are a whole host of contacts and  ties--political, economic, cultural, and others--and these two  issues should be afforded the place commensurate to them. We  should not, as sometimes happens, turn this situation into  something more serious--more so on our side than on the German  side--than it actually is.    Second, I personally feel that the situation will turn out  well. After the German elections in particular, no matter who  wins them, some of the issues that have hitherto been blocked  will move forward very rapidly.    [Dudek] When I was following your debate on Saturday [16  April], it seemed to me that this was a discussion among  sovereign intellectuals. The meeting of intellectuals was  supposed to begin on Sunday. Did you have a similar impression,  and, if so, is this, in your opinion, in order?    [Havel] I do not know exactly how an intellectual is  distinguished from a nonintellectual. For this reason, I cannot  tell exactly which of the presidents present are intellectuals  and which are not. The purpose of this meeting was not to  resolve the specific political issues of the day but, rather, to  ponder the longer-term issues, prospects, or problems.  Understandably, the result of this was that the debate was  perhaps more general and perhaps less dramatic than many a  televised discussion. However, no one was obliged to watch it.</p>

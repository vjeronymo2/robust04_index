			<p>BFN     [Text] The arbitration court in Moscow has cancelled a  license issued to the Russian-U.S. oil venture calling itself  White Nights, well-informed sources told INTERFAX. The company  was expected to develop a new oil field in Tyumen region.    White Nights is the first oil producing venture formed by  Russia's Varyeganneftegaz and two U.S. companies -- Anglo-Suisse  and Fibro Energy -- in November 1990. Since then, the company  produced a total of 2.4 million [metric] tonnes of crude oil  from its Zapadno-Varyeganskii oil field. The project cost 53.7  billion rubles to implement. White Nights also has licenses for  the development of Tagrin and Roslavl oil fields of Western  Siberia.    The suit against the Russian Committee for Natural Resources  (Goskomnedr) and the administration of the Khanty Mansy  autonomous region was brought by a public group, Tayezhnik  (uniting several local clans) which owns part of the land where  the company operates.    The plaintiff on Monday challenged the legitimacy of the  company's license which was negotiated rather than won at a  tender. This is in breach of the federal law on mineral  resources adopted in February 1992.</p>

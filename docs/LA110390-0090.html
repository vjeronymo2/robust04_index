			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFTER THE FAIRY TALE;  </P> <P> IMELDA MARCOS SAYS SHE'S ENJOYING LIFE 'IN THE REAL WORLD'  </P> <P> Shorn of her bodyguards and far from the tumult of loyalists and enemies,  Imelda Marcos sat in her Beverly Hills hotel room nibbling at a pepperoni pizza  and noted that on her last visit here she was the First Lady of the Philippines  who dined with industrialist Armand Hammer.  </P> <P> Away from the crowds, she was reflecting Friday on her slide from being one of  the most visible foreign dignitaries in the world to the survivor of a  celebrated criminal trial that may have found her innocent but, to many, had  not cleared her name.  </P> <P> "Before it was Imelda in the Cinderella fairy tale. Now it is Imelda in the  real world," said the woman who once exchanged toasts with Fidel Castro, glided  on the dance floor with George Hamilton and swapped dinner conversation with  Ronald and Nancy Reagan.  </P> <P> "She had an enviable position then, and now she's down here," Marcos said of  herself. "But she's down with the real world and the real people, and I'm  enjoying it."  </P> <P> The fact that Imelda Romualdez Marcos is enjoying herself once again is both  liberating to her supporters and galling to her detractors.  </P> <P> Marcos remains a lightning rod of controversy not only in her native country  but in the Filipino-American community and among other Americans who watched  her plight as the first wife of a foreign head of state to stand trial on  criminal charges in the United States.  </P> <P> Marcos was charged with fraud and racketeering in New York for allegedly  joining her late husband, former Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos, in  looting their country's treasury of more than $200 million and using some of  the funds to purchase skyscrapers and other real estate in the city.  </P> <P> During a three-month trial that saw her lifestyle dissected, her face on the  cover of a tabloid newspaper with the headline "OINK," and her own lawyer  endorsing her reputation as a "world-class shopper," Imelda Marcos became the  punch line for comedians in two nations.  </P> <P> But last July 2 -- on her 61st birthday -- a federal jury acquitted Marcos of  all charges. She walked on her knees down the aisle of St. Patrick's Cathedral  in thanks.  </P> <P> Sitting in her Beverly Hills hotel room three months later, Marcos said she  still felt overwhelmed by her ordeal.  </P> <P> "For someone who is widowed and orphaned from a country and then alien in a  foreign land, what I went through was something awesome," she said. "Even the  Bible says there is a special place for those who oppress widows and orphans,  and I was both."  </P> <P> Marcos, dressed in a black, sequined gown with her hair pulled back, was still  basking in the boisterous reception she had received only hours before at the  Carson Community Center.  </P> <P> More than 600 supporters, including some who had traveled from San Diego and  San Francisco, had packed the hall Thursday night to welcome the woman they  affectionately called "Mom" -- short for both Madame and Mother or "Nanay" in  their native Tagalog.  </P> <P> As she entered the hall, Marcos was overwhelmed by the crush of supporters who  had spelled out her name in balloons, stood whistling on chairs and pushed for  autographs and pictures.  </P> <P> What Marcos' supporters got, in return, was vintage Imelda -- an hourlong  speech that defended her family, spoke tearfully of her late husband, quoted  both the Bible and Madonna, and poked fun at her rumored romance with George  Hamilton.  </P> <P> Imelda regaled them with stories. She sang. She wept. She laughed. And she told  the crowd that since her acquittal, she is ready to pay some of the reputed  millions of dollars of her family wealth to settle a massive civil lawsuit  filed against her by the Philippine government. In return, she said, she hopes  to be able to return home and bury her husband, who died two years ago before  he could be tried.  </P> <P> "Now that the verdict is in, that's good money," she said of her financial  offer. "That's clean money."  </P> <P> Others, however, disagree. Outside the center, some anti-Marcos protesters  displayed paper banners denouncing her appearance and called her acquittal a  sham.  </P> <P> "I'm appalled that she would be invited by Filipino people after all the  looting and plundering her family did in the Philippines," said Teresita  Salazar of Culver City.  </P> <P> Beside her stood her 6-year-old daughter, who carried a sign reading: "Imelda,  You Destroyed the Future of the Filipino Children." And her husband, Ludy, held  another sign aloft: "Imelda, the Whole World Knows You Are Guilty."  </P> <P> But the target of their scorn never saw the signs. Whisked to and from the  reception in a stretch limousine that avoided the protesters, Marcos was  constantly surrounded by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies and bodyguards.  </P> <P> Marcos, however, defended some of her expenditures and said they were part of  her role as the wife of a head of state.  </P> <P> "I was playing a part. I was the First Lady," she said in an interview.  </P> <P> As she spoke, Marcos fingered a gold compact case with her name inscribed in  jewels on the top, and she sought to explain a role that she said many  Americans do not understand.  </P> <P> Calling herself her country's "mother and First Lady," Marcos likened herself  to the queen of England. "I'm not trying to be royalty, but you know, what are  they there for? They are symbols and people live by symbols," she said.  </P> <P> Marcos, who is in Los Angeles to attend a judicial conference this weekend,  said she is negotiating with the government of Corazon Aquino in hopes of  returning home in the next few months. Marcos said she does not know the size  of her family's wealth, but her attorney, James P. Linn, said a partial  agreement has been reached that could mean some of her fortune will be returned  to the Philippine government.  </P> <P> "If what I hear is right, she is having problems," a smiling Marcos said of the  president who replaced her husband. "Here I am. I'm jobless. Maybe I can be of  help."  </P></p>

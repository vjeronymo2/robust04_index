			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE fails to penetrate 3,200 level A UK stock market beginning to display signs of running out of steam after the near-euphoric trading activity following Germany's interest rate cuts on Thursday, was given a fresh boost from across the Atlantic where Wall Street was threatening to push through its all-time trading high. The Dow Jones Average was trading above its previous closing high as London closed yesterday afternoon. Adding to the bull trend was a bigger than expected rise in UK gross domestic product in the third quarter. But the FT-SE 100 index, despite numerous attempts, just failed to penetrate the 3,200 level, although closing at a new all-time record. The FT-SE 100 settled 10.7 higher at a record 3,199.0, a rise of 78.2, or 2.5 per cent over the week, while the FT-SE Mid 250, 20.8 firmer at a peak 3,547.0, was 67.2, or 1.9 per cent higher over the five-day period. However, dealers said that activity in the Footsie future after the market had closed would have been sufficient to drive the underlying cash market through the 3,200 mark with relative ease. On senior marketmaker said: 'Demand in this market is becoming frightening; the recent charge was fuelled by the shorts panicking and closing their positions. This is new buying and any marketmaker still holding on to increasingly perilous short books is playing a very dangerous game.' The market's record-breaking performance was reinforced by the high levels of trading activity. Turnover yesterday was 658.5m shares. Gilts edged stayed in positive territory throughout the session ahead of news of a Pounds 500m tap stock of 7 3/4 per cent stock dated 2,006. Long-standing worries that the market has run too far, too fast were shrugged aside by senior marketmakers, now used to paying a high price to close any short positions. A widespread view around the trading desks was that traders had paid too much heed to stories about an overvalued Wall Street. Mr Richard Jeffreys of Charterhouse Tilney, the stockbroker, said he expected the equity market to become 'more tentative ahead of the Budget.' At Strauss Turnbull Mr Ian Harnett cautioned against what he described as 'a search for value in second-line stocks.' He said these had outperformed the leaders by around 6 per cent over the past year and recommended a move back into the leaders ahead of the Budget.</p>

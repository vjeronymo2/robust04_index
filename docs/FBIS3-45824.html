And no matter what, all the economic packages will affect  ordinary folk in the end.    China's plan to establish a socialist market economy is no  exception.    This year, the State will speed up its efforts to transform  its role in economic management.    This means China will establish a modern corporate system, a  nationwide open market, a more reasonable distribution of income  and a multi-layered social security system.    However, these efforts cannot succeed without complementary  personnel reforms. China is already moving in this direction,  said Personnel Minister Song Defu recently in Outlook magazine.    Administrative organizations under the State Council and  provincial governments are to develop a civil service this year,  he said.    And the few that don't should be encouraged to pursue open  and fair competition in personnel management.    The enrollment of low-rank civil servants should be done  through examinations.    Song revealed the State is now drafting regulations  governing  the exams and the employment and rating of civil servants.  <H5>  Wage </H5>   He warned not to confuse government institutions and  administrations in the civil service as the two will have  different wage systems.    Song said relatively independent institutions should make  their own decisions on personnel affairs, using various methods  including public bidding to select their staff.    All government institutions should try to support themselves  and stop receiving State aid, Song said.    As for institutions that rely on full State subsidies, such  as those engaged in basic research and education, a subsidy  quota should be set regardless of the number of employees. This  is designed to improve efficiency.    Song said managerial and technical personnel should sign  contracts with enterprises to clarify their rights and  responsibilities.    The salary packages should suit the actual conditions of  enterprises, institutions and administrative organizations.    State enterprises may decide employees' wages for themselves  according to the supply of labour and demand for jobs, provided  that the growth rate of their payroll is slower than growth of  their economic returns.  <H5>  Social Security </H5>   He went on to discuss the multilayer social security system  which he said would cover unemployment benefits and pensions.  This system should be gradually established, first in  government departments and institutions.    The State, institutions and individuals should all pay for  the system, instead of the State paying alone.    Song said that various types of social security system  should  be tested in different regions.  <H5>  Talent Market </H5>   On the establishment of a talent market, Song suggested it  should play a bigger role in the transfer of personnel.    But the market must be regulated by laws governing personnel  flow, Song said. These will be enacted later this year to  ensure the smooth operation in the market and protect the rights  of both individuals and enterprises.    The State should encourage talented people to work for key  State projects.</p>

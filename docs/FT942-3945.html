			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Yeltsin acts to curb financial advertising Russian President Boris Yeltsin has issued a long-awaited decree banning dishonest advertising, which has enabled crooked financiers to make fortunes at the expense of gullible investors. The Russian Information Agency said a decree at the weekend, aimed primarily at extravagant promises made in TV and newspaper advertisements, prohibits companies from promising specific levels of future dividend payments or guarantees of the future performance of a given investment. Some observers believe that after seven decades of communist propaganda TV viewers in Russia's newly-developing market economy have proven vulnerable to perceiving advertising as fact. One investment fund which promised to turn citizens' privatisation vouchers into 'gold' was recently found to have defrauded investors of millions of dollars. Another suggested to investors they might make enough on a Rbs10,000 (Pounds 3.30) privatisation voucher to buy a house in Paris. Many small banks have attracted small savers with promises of astronomically high interest rates. But authorities say they have been powerless to stop television stations and newspapers from carrying advertising even months after it has been officially denounced as fraudulent. From now on, businesses can only advertise actual dividend and interest rates they have paid in the past. The decree, to be enforced by Russia's anti-monopoly committee, obliges advertisers to withdraw within three days any advertising found to violate the decree.</p>

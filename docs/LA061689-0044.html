			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENVOYS DID 'DAMNEDEST' FOR AMERICANS, STATE DEPT. SAYS  </P> <P> The State Department, responding to complaints that it was slow to react to the  violence in China, said Thursday that U.S. Embassy staff members in Beijing did  "their damnedest" to evacuate Americans.  </P> <P> "The perception is certainly there that the U.S. Embassy in China did not  anticipate and, therefore, was not prepared to deal adequately with this crisis  in China. We should have known!" California Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton),  chairman of a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee, said at a hearing.  </P> <P> He said many American students told of difficulty in leaving China and had not  gotten much help from the U.S. Embassy.  </P> <P> But Richard Williams, acting deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian  and Pacific Affairs, said Ambassador James R. Lilley and the embassy staff  worked around the clock to help Americans in China after the violence in Tian  An Men Square early on June 4 when Chinese troops fired on demonstrators.  </P> <P> "More than 6,000 Americans left China safely over the past week, one of the  largest evacuations of Americans in a crisis situation since World War II,"  Williams said in his testimony.  </P> <P> "No American died in the crisis in China, and only two U.S. citizens were  injured. Maybe it wasn't perfect. But they (the embassy staff) gave it their  damnedest."  </P> <P> When Americans were advised to leave China, Williams said, embassy officials  contacted as many of them as possible and organized convoys to the Beijing  airport for more than 200 Americans.  </P> <P> Williams said that about 1,000 Americans remain in China, including 182 U.S.  government employees.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a senior Administration official said the turmoil in China does not  necessarily mean the country has turned its back on economic and political  reforms, the Associated Press reported. The official, who requested anonymity,  suggested that the United States still can do business with supreme leader Deng  Xiaoping despite the military crackdown and the massacre of hundreds -- perhaps  thousands -- of people.  </P></p>

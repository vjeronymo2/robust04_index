			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BANK INSURANCE FUND FALLS AGAIN, FDIC SAYS;  </P> <P> BANKING: THE SECOND STRAIGHT ANNUAL DROP LEAVES THE RESERVE AT ABOUT HALF THE  LEVEL REQUIRED BY LAW.  </P> <P> The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said Tuesday that its bank insurance fund,  which insures 13,200 banks, fell for the second consecutive year to about half  the level the law requires.  </P> <P> The fund that backs up the nation's federally insured bank deposits declined by  $851 million in 1989 to $13.2 billion, when 207 banks failed or required  government assistance to remain open, the FDIC said in a preliminary, unaudited  financial report.  </P> <P> The 1989 loss was down from a $4.24-billion loss in 1988 when a post-Depression  record of 221 banks failed.  </P> <P> While last year's loss was less severe than the 1988 drop, the report said "the  continued high level of closed or assisted banks is having a detrimental impact  on the fund," which insures all bank deposits up to $100,000.  </P> <P> The fund's $13.2-billion level at year-end represented 0.7% of the value of all  insured bank deposits, a little more than half the 1.25% level required by the  savings and loan bailout law enacted last summer.  </P> <P> The loss results because the FDIC was forced to pay more to take over the  failed banks than it received in insurance premiums paid by healthy banks.  </P> <P> FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman predicted that the bank insurance fund could  return to profitability this year if it is not forced to take over any large  banking institution.  </P> <P> "Although the bank fund declined in 1989, the drop was considerably less severe  than the previous year," Seidman said.  </P> <P> A heavy blow to the fund in 1989 occurred with the failure of MCorp. Regulators  have estimated that the failure of the Dallas-based bank holding company could  end up costing $2 billion, making it the second costliest bank failure in  history.  </P> <P> Seidman predicted that bank failures could decline to 150 to 175 this year,  still a large number compared to the 10 bank failures in 1980.  </P> <P> Seidman said his forecast was a very rough estimate based on the rate banks  have been failing so far.  </P> <P> "Much depends on future interest rates and future real estate markets," he told  reporters.  </P> <P> A financial institution becomes insolvent when the value of its assets,  primarily in the form of loans it makes, drops below the level of its  liabilities, represented by its customers' deposits.  </P> <P> Despite the back-to-back losses, analysts said they believed that the FDIC  would be able to escape the sort of trouble that befell the Federal Savings and  Loan Insurance Corp., the sister fund set up to insure deposits at savings and  loan institutions.  </P> <P> Because of the record number of S&amp;L failures, the FSLIC became insolvent,  requiring the government to step in with the costliest bailout in U.S. history.  </P> <P> Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution said the FDIC situation deserves  close attention to keep it from escalating into another S&amp;L crisis.  </P> <P> "The key lesson we learned is don't delay," he said. "The thrift crisis got out  of hand because Congress and the regulators did not act."  </P></p>

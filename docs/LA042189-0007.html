			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXTENDING HEALTH COVERAGE  </P> <P> The poor are not the only group with health insurance problems. Those people  with pre-existing conditions cannot obtain health insurance today in  California. Even if one is in very good health and willing to pay, health  insurance is not available.  </P> <P> The Legislature should require that the health insurance industry accept  everyone who applies and is willing to pay. Those with pre-existing conditions  could be in an "assigned-risk" category and pay higher premiums.  </P> <P> MARGARET BUSHER  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BOYS' BASKETBALL DIVISION II/V SEMIFINALS;  </P> <P> EVERYBODY HELPS AS UNIVERSITY CITY TOPS TORREY PINES  </P> <P> University City's Anthony Hill said his coach told the team before Wednesday's  night Division II San Diego Section boys' basketball semifinal that they were a  better team than Torrey Pines.  </P> <P> Were they ever.  </P> <P> Third-seeded University City dominated top-seeded Torrey Pines in every phase,  including three-point shooting, and rolled to an easy, 75-58 victory at San  Dieguito High.  </P> <P> University received career performances from just about all eight players, but  it was Hill who was most instrumental.  </P> <P> He scored a game-high 22 points, 11 in each half, had six steals and hounded  Torrey Pines' Kyle Armstrong into a miserable, one-for-nine shooting night.  </P> <P> Armstrong had been averaging 12 points and two three-pointers a game.  </P> <P> "I thought he was kind of cocky, from what I could see against Helix (in the  quarterfinals)," said Hill, a 6-1 senior-point guard. "I wanted him."  </P> <P> Hill also gave Armstrong a three-point shooting lesson, hitting four from  three-point range to Armstrong's one.  </P> <P> "He played the best game of his life," University Coach Tom Medigovich said of  Hill.  </P> <P> Medigovich probably could have said the same thing about reserve forward John  Schweller, who scored 10 second-half points and grabbed four rebounds. He even  took one away from teammate Jerome Price, the state-long jump champion.  </P> <P> "He had no business in there," Hill said of Schweller's rebound and subsequent  basket in the lane.  </P> <P> University also got six points off the bench from Joel Mitchell and four from  Elliot Alexander. Price finished with 12 points, 12 rebounds and three blocks,  and Supe Hooper added 14 points.  </P> <P> Bart Brandenburg led Torrey Pines with 17 points, and Carter Brown added 14.  </P> <P> University City led, 13-9 after a quarter 31-22 at halftime and 49-37 after  three quarters.  </P> <P> Torrey Pines shot just seven for 21 in the first half and 12 for 29 in the  second. University City shot 19 for 36 in the second half and 11 for 25 in the  first.  </P> <P> University City improved to 23-4. Torrey Pines finished at 26-4. DAVE McKIBBEN  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY WORKER SUSPENDED OVER PERSONAL  PROJECTS  </P> <P> A Los Angeles County Public Works Department foreman has been suspended for 30  days for ordering workers to build boat racks, duck decoys and other items for  his personal use.  </P> <P> But the shop manager who filed the complaint says such abuses have gone on for  15 years and extends far beyond the one shop that the county investigated.  </P> <P> "We've stopped it here at this yard, but it goes on today all over this  department," said Rudy Rico, manager of the department's Pasadena instrument  shop.  </P> <P> Foreman Larry Parrish was suspended after an audit showed at least 30 hours of  county time had been used on projects for his personal benefit.  </P> <P> A recommendation to fire the foreman was rejected after county attorneys  learned that other workers had gone unpunished for similar offenses, said  county Chief Auditor J. Tyler McCauley. Parrish declined to comment except to  say that he had been made a scapegoat.  </P></p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (6): Investment bankers' hour Investment banking in Turkey is still in its infancy. Capital markets are primitive. Mergers and acquisition activity is limited, and the scope for advisers even more so. Treasury operations are unsophisticated, given the absence of complex financial instruments. Even so, demand for investment banking services is bound to increase as the economy, companies and the financial system develop. Already, banks and brokerages are gearing up for a big fight in investment banking. Garanti Bankasi, Turkey's most profitable bank, bought into the investment banking business as far back as 1992 when it acquired Tasarruf Kredi Bank and renamed it Garanti Investment Bank. This year it moved its broking arm to the investment bank to further strengthen its presence in the market. Dormant mergers-and-acquisitions business may also pick up with the approach of customs union in 1996 with the European Union. Istanbul bankers think Europe-based companies will want a greater presence in Turkey, just as local companies may have to exit competitive sectors. Initial public offerings are advancing steadily, despite the stock market's poor health. The trouble is that deals are usually small by international standards, and many companies avoid using banks altogether. Last year, there were 18 initial public offerings. There were 13 by October this year, with flotations varying from under Dollars 2.0m to nearly Dollars 50m. Privatisation will mark the beginning of megabuck investment banking deals in Turkey. It may still be a distant prospect, but bankers are confident that privatisation will generate millions in fees, and transform narrow capital markets, enabling bigger and more sophisticated deals to follow. Some of the biggest companies in Turkey - the telephone network and national electricity utility, for instance - are on the government's privatisation list. A bigger local market would prevent even relatively modest deals migrating offshore, especially to New York's ADR market. The advent of private funding for infrastructure projects will also require capital market backing. Although the government has talked for years about introducing build-operate-transfer rules for projects like dams, roads and power stations, not a single one has come off the drawing board. Nonetheless, the bankrupt state will eventually have to cede big-ticket projects to the private sector. Electricity consumption is growing by 10-12 per cent a year. BOT deals will probably require a blend of conventional project lending with more innovative investment banking products. The downside is that high-tech investment banking is a difficult, fast-moving business in which even the biggest local participants will be overshadowed by the New York- and London-based giants. They will have to scramble for the crumbs when it comes to handling big projects.</p>

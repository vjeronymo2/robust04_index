			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / GM workers end Ohio stoppage SOME 2,300 employees at a General Motors' metal-stamping plant in Ohio were back at work yesterday after the leading US motor vehicles group reached an agreement with the United Automobile Workers (UAW) union to end a nine-day strike. The end of the strike, perceived by some Wall Street analysts as a test of GM's ability to cut staff and costs, came with less drama than might have been expected. Ms Linda Cook, a GM spokeswoman, said GM's key concession was to agree to keep a tool-and-dye shop at the Lordstown, Ohio, plant operating until January 1994 rather than to close it down this autumn. The tool-and-dye shop employs 180 people. The ending of the strike means that car assembly operations, employing nearly 43,000 GM workers at nine plants across the US, will begin functioning again this week. GM had shut down the plants because of a shortage of components caused by the strike. The first car assembly plants - manufacturing the Saturn model and some Pontiac and Chevrolet models - will begin running again tomorrow . The UAW said a skeleton crew was back in the Lordstown facility by Saturday evening. Agreement between the UAW and GM had been reached just after 1 o'clock on Saturday morning. GM, which made a Dollars 4.5bn loss last year, wants to close a series of plants in the US and remove 74,000 jobs from its workforce to slash costs.</p>

			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOFFREY BALLET CRISIS GROWS -- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR QUITS  </P> <P> The management crisis of the Joffrey Ballet deepened Wednesday as Penelope  Curry disclosed that she had resigned as the company's executive director.  </P> <P> The resignation means that since the first of this month the renowned dance  company has lost its artistic director, Gerald Arpino; its executive director,  Curry; and the co-chairman of the board and principal financial angel, Los  Angeles developer David H. Murdock.  </P> <P> However, the departure of Curry and Murdock, who were counted as Arpino's  detractors, could signal the return of the artistic director and co-founder.  </P> <P> Curry, who has been with the company for 22 years and executive director for  the past four years, said she submitted her resignation on Tuesday to members  of the Los Angeles board at a meeting at the Music Center and through a  telephone hookup to board members in New York. She said she will remain as a  consultant to the company for the remainder of the Los Angeles season and  "beyond that."  </P> <P> Curry's resignation came hours after Murdock, who had been co-chairman of the  board with Anthony A. Bliss of New York, issued a statement reconfirming his  own resignation, which he had submitted on May 7.  </P> <P> Arpino resigned May 1 in a dispute with the bi-coastal board. Now, however, the  board is negotiating with Arpino in an effort to bring him back, according to a  source close to Arpino. Curry said Wednesday that "negotiations are going very  positively with Jerry," but declined comment on whether her resignation was  tied to the talks.  </P> <P> Earlier this week the company announced that Arpino had agreed to permit the  Joffrey to perform his choreography for the remainder of the Los Angeles  season. Arpino had withdrawn his works from the repertoire after his  resignation.  </P> <P> Arpino co-founded the company with Robert Joffrey in 1956, starting as a dancer  and eventually becoming the company's chief choreographer. Arpino was named  artistic director after Joffrey's death in 1988.  </P> <P> The Joffrey became the resident company at New York City Center in 1966, and in  1983 it adopted Los Angeles as a second home. Murdock was instrumental in the  company's move West. Arpino and Curry had reportedly been at odds over the  direction of the company. The Joffrey is nearly $2 million in debt, including  $828,000 due from payroll withholding.  </P> <P> Curry's disclosure of her resignation came almost casually. In a call to The  Times from the Joffrey office here, she said: "Our focus is on keeping the  company going. The only thing I can comment on, I did turn in my resignation  yesterday. I agreed to stay on for two weeks during any transition, and I will  be of help beyond that."  </P> <P> With a hint of sadness in her voice she added: "Twenty-two years is a long  time." At the same time she declined comment on what prompted her resignation.  "All my energy is being devoted to having the company survive," she said.  </P> <P> Murdock's statement noted that he has announced his resignation and quoted him  as saying: "I have been active as a co-chairman of the board for seven years  and I feel it is time to step down. It has been an honor and privilege to serve  with this fine ballet company."  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for Murdock said the announcement was reissued because the  multimillionaire financier had been inundated with phone calls. There had also  been reports that Murdock was playing a key behind-the-scenes role in the  Joffrey's negotiations with Arpino.  </P> <P> Murdock's departure only worsens the situation because he had reportedly  offered to erase that debt.  </P></p>

CSJM Judge of Inquiry Marco Rodriguez Huerta delivered his  report accusing the 18 officers to War Hall Auditor Luis  Delgado, so that he might request that the prosecutor formally  ask for a jury trial against these individuals.    The 18 officers have been accused of allowing the  embezzlement to take place, systematically and over a period of  a number of years, at the offices of the Peruvian attache in  Washington. The crime was discovered in November 1992.    Up until now it was believed that only 11 officers were  involved in the case.    The main culprit in the case, Enrique Villagarcia, an old  administrator in the attache's office, was condemned to eight  years' imprisonment in the United States in June of last year  for violating laws forbidding the use of illegal funds in U.S.  financial institutions.    Villagarcia confessed to that country's judiciary that he  spent most of the money on cocaine, race horses, and prostitutes.    Among the officers involved in the case are a vice admiral  and four rear admirals who occupied positions in the Navy  Economy Directorate and who were Navy attaches in the United  States.    The case was denounced by Peruvian President Alberto  Fujimori, who said that Villagarcia justified the use of the  money with forged deposit certificates, drafted with the  complicity of American Security Bank and Potomac Valley Bank  employees.</p>

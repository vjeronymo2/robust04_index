			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Institutions tackle 'short-termism' INSTITUTIONAL shareholders are asking companies to tell them more about their investments in research and development in an effort to counteract charges that shareholders are short-term in their outlook. Companies have complained that they are discouraged from spending on R&amp;D by shareholders who would rather see money spent on bigger dividends or on acquisitions. The Bank of England-backed Institutional Shareholders Committee will today announce a suggested format for companies beyond principles established by the Accountancy Standards Board. 'This paper attempts to break the impasse by setting out those facts about R&amp;D that it would be useful for institutional investors to know. The onus is now with companies to provide that information,' the ISC said. Mr Michael Sandland, chief investment officer at Norwich Union and ISC chairman, said he believed companies would adopt the new format, even though it was voluntary. 'If this document came out two years ago, it would have been laughed at,' he said. 'But now I think it will lead the way.' The drive for improved corporate governance and the concurrent demands of shareholders for more information were likely to encourage companies to comply, he said. The proposals urge each industry to establish its own detailed definition of R&amp;D to invite comparisons of expenditure among similar companies. It urges a particularly broad interpretation of development costs and asks companies to disclose all those relating to existing products and services as well as those under development. Companies are also urged to spell out which of their research expenditure is 'pure' or applied to specific products, along with a discussion of the potential returns from each category of expenditure. Because the information is broader than that required by the ASB, the shareholders' group suggests that companies disclose it in annual reports or in separate presentations to shareholders rather than in corporate accounts. The ISC proposed the rules after it was approached by the Electrical Equipment Association, an electronics trade body, whose members were concerned about short-termism.</p>

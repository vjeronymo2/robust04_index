			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Software at Work (7): Vallourec, the French steel maker - Company Snapshot Vallourec had a turnover of FFr7,480m in 1990 and FFr8,380m in 1989. The company's net profit was FFr403m in 1990 and FFr639m in 1989. Business activities: the tube-making operation, Vallourec Industries, is the biggest subsidiary. It consists of the Saint-Saulve plant, which makes steel and tubes, plus three specialist plants which prepare the tubes for customers in the automotive, construction, chemicals, oil and gas, mechanical engineering and power generation industries. Saint-Saulve produces 300 grades of steel and tubes of 15 different diameters. Independent steel specialists say the plant is tidy and well organised and its continuous rotary casting method of manufacturing seamless tubes, involving vertical, rotating moulds, is unusual and innovative, putting it among world leaders in this field. World scale: Saint-Saulve is seventh in the world in terms of tube production capacity (by comparison, British Steel is seventeenth). The plant runs 24 hours a day, 330 days a year. Production has grown from 150,000 tons to 480,000 tons since the plant opened in 1975. The three tube finishing plants need 600,000 tons, the balance being bought from outside Vallourec. Following the installation of the new monitoring system, Saint-Saulve aims to reach 600,000 tons a year in 1993.</p>

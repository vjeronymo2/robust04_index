			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / EU ruling hits contracting-out programme The government's compulsory competitive tendering and market testing programmes suffered a severe setback yesterday when the Court of Appeal ruled that European employment protection rules covered the transfer of a public-sector contract from one private contractor to another. The decision swept away one of the last remaining doubts about the extent to which the European Acquired Rights Directive applies to contracting-out of services. The Business Services Association, a public-sector contractors' lobby group, described the decision as 'a devastating blow to the government's policies of market testing and compulsory competitive tendering'. The government has no official line on whether the directive applies to contracting out. Its advice to contractors is to look at each case on its merits and bid accordingly. It is known to be anxious for contracting out to be excluded from the scope of the directive and has been lobbying hard in Brussels for change. The directive, which protects the jobs and conditions of employees when the undertaking they work for changes hands, was translated into UK law by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 - known as Tupe. When Tupe applies, contractors must take on the existing workforce on unchanged pay and conditions. This makes it difficult for private contractors to undercut public-sector costs. Yesterday's ruling was welcomed by Unison, the public-service union, which backed the appeal of 12 hospital cleaners who sued for unfair dismissal when the contract for cleaning Orsett Hospital in Essex changed hands in 1991. Mr Alan Jinkinson, Unison's general secretary, said the ruling was 'a significant step along the road of bringing our laws into line with civilised European standards'. Eight supervisors and 98 cleaners were made redundant by Initial Health Care Services when the company's tender to renew its contract with Basildon and Thurrock Health Authority was rejected in favour of Pall Mall Services. Nearly all staff were engaged by Pall Mall, but on less favour-able terms and conditions. The 12 who sued claimed the two companies had failed to give effect to Tupe. Their case was rejected by an industrial tribunal on the grounds that there was no transfer of an undertaking within the meaning of Tupe. That decision was upheld by the Employment Appeal Tribunal last August.</p>

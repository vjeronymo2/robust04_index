			<p>BFN     [Text] President Yeltsin does not intend to resign before  his term is up. He declared in an interview with ABC on Friday  that no matter how complex that might be, he was fully  determined to make reforms in Russia irreversible. "Much has  befallen my lot -- said the president. -- I often think of  resigning. But the capital restructuring with me involved has  got underway. This restructuring should be brought to  irreversible reforms, and for this reason, I drop this thought  of resignation. Before June 1996, I will not go," Yeltsin  declared.    He also disclosed that not long ago members of his team, "15  men or so" from presidential structures and government, "sharply  rebuked" him for his earlier expressed refusal to be nominated  for a second term. "I gave my word to all of them that I will  never answer these questions, even indirectly," Yeltsin remarked.    Asked about the state and prospects of Russian-American  relations, he voiced readiness to sign a partnership treaty with  the US. However, in his words, it should be signed along with  a protocol on arms parity, in which both sides should identify  the kinds and types of their weapons.    In this connection, Yeltsin fully ruled out the possibility  of biological weapon production in Russia, even without his  knowledge. "This is out of the question, he stressed. The  former leadership allowed cheating. The biological weapons have  been scrapped, as for the chemical weapons, we seek to destroy  them within the agreed terms."    On the situation in the Balkans, Yeltsin voiced the  conviction that air strikes would not resume. He denounced the  Bosnian Serbs for "not keeping their word."</p>

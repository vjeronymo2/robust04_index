For his part, Defense Minister Shaykh 'Ali Sabah al-Salim  al-Sabah, in a similar interview to the paper, has stressed that  the State of Kuwait was fully prepared to respond to any  provocation or any reckless action the Baghdad regime might  contemplate.    Shaykh 'Ali said "the situation on the northern borders is  changeable. It could be reassuring today and the opposite  tomorrow; however, our armed forces are prepared to face up to  all eventualities", pointing to the existence of coordination  with the states of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Egypt, and  Syria.    On the other hand, AL-WATAN has attributed to a high ranking  Foreign Ministry source as having said that the Foreign Ministry  had checked the reports circulated by the Iraqi opposition, and  it was ascertained that the 10th Division of the Iraqi Army has  moved from the marshes area to the north.    The source stressed to the paper that the situation was  under  control, an aerial surveillance operation was carried out every  two hours, all movements were monitored very closely and,  according to available reports, the picture had not changed in  12 days.    Iraqi opposition in Syria reported two days ago the  existence  of an Iraqi forces build up estimated at 180,000 soldiers on the  Kuwaiti borders.</p>

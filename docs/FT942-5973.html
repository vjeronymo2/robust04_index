			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Army of volunteers may be called up: A national community-service scheme for young people is gaining support Britain is the only country in western Europe not to have either military national service or a civilian equivalent for young people. Politicians - especially Labour ones - are wondering whether this anomaly should end. This week the party's Commission on Social Justice backed the idea of a citizens' volunteer service to encourage thousands of school-leavers to spend three months on community projects. It is an old debate, triggered by every wave of high youth unemployment or fears about a youthful underclass slipping through the employment and training net. But the idea of some sort of national scheme has a better chance of taking off now than in the early 1980s, when youth unemployment was even higher and inner-city riots more frequent. That is partly because the political tone has shifted against individualism and the main political parties are all looking for ways of expressing a new relationship between the citizen and the state which stresses both rights and duties. Mrs Elisabeth Hoodless, executive director of the lobby group Community Service Volunteers, believes there is also more interest now because fewer people believe that full employment will return. 'This is an idea whose time has finally come,' she said. 'There is a feeling that has not been so evident before of a huge gap between civil society and a large group of young people. A lot of young people in our big cities are just disappearing,' she added. Youth civilian service schemes can be divided into three categories: 'Elite' schemes such as the Peace Corps in America or Voluntary Service Overseas, for middle-class young people. The safety net schemes designed to catch inner-city youth before they slip into a life of crime. The most ambitious option, a compulsory national scheme for, say, those aged between 18 and 21 lasting between three months and a year. Two recent reports suggest that the net cost of such a national scheme - for anything up to 250,000 young people at any one time - would be less than Pounds 300m per year, including a small allowance for the young people. But that includes some big assumptions on savings from reductions in crime - Pounds 1.3bn over five years. There are also questions about the management of such schemes and how to prevent volunteer workers, in the health service for example, replacing paid workers, especially in the more aggressive commercial climate created by the purchaser-provider split. In Germany, which has military service, with the option of social service for a slightly longer period, a recent report warned that the health service would fall apart if the volunteers were removed.</p>

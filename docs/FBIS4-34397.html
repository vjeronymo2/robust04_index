			<p>BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 19 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Within the  framework of the presidential elections, Colombian guerrillas  have kidnapped 10 persons, including electoral delegates and  voting officers, in northeastern part of the country,  authorities reported today. Alvaro Dagon, government secretary  in the Santander Department, disclosed that the officials were  kidnapped by rebel units when they were getting ready to set up  the voting table in the Garcia Rovira Province.    Colombians today will elect President Cesar Gaviria's  successor, either Ernesto Samper of the Liberal Party or Andres  Pastrana of the New Democratic Force. Samper and Pastrana were  the candidates who obtained the highest number of votes in the  29 May elections; however, neither obtained the 50 percent of  the vote required for victory in the first round.    The source reported that among those kidnapped is the police  inspector of "El Cerrito" Municipality, which is near the site  of the kidnapping, approximately 460 km from Santa Fe de Bogota.  Despite the kidnappings, the local authorities guaranteed that  the elections will take place in a normal fashion, saying that  the officials had been replaced this morning.    In addition, 15 other electoral delegates resigned from  their  posts at "Santa Rosa de Simiti" Municipality in the northern  part of the country in light of the death threats received from  the Simon Bolivar guerrilla group, the report stated.    Meanwhile, at "Legrija" Municipality in the northern  Santander Department the rebels engaged in a confrontation with  government troops. One guerrilla died, the source reported.    Another adverse action was registered in Medellin, the  second  most important city in the nation, where rebel units set off  several home-made bombs causing no victims, although  considerable damage was reported.</p>

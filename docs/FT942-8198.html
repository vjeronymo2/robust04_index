			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Coffee wins over doubters The surge in coffee futures that began early in April was punctuated by analysts' warnings that the market had risen 'too far, too fast' and that a major downward correction could not be put off for long. In the middle of this week it seemed to many observers that that correction had arrived; but they were quickly disabused. Most of Wednesday morning's Dollars 113-a-tonne plunge in the July position at the London Commodity Exchange had been recouped by the close, and the rest was eliminated at Thursday's opening as a preliminary to a renewed charge to fresh five-year highs. Since then there has been little talk of retreat and the selling that pushed the July price down Dollars 97 to Dollars 2,150 a tonne at one point yesterday was shrugged off as 'gentle profit-taking'. By the close the price had recovered to Dollars 2,185, down Dollars 62 on the day but still Dollars 228 up on the week. There is no denying that the recent Dollars 800 advance has been fuelled by speculative funds attracted by technical considerations. But attention is now focusing more on the coffee market's constructive fundamental outlook. This was underlined yesterday by the latest supply/ demand assessment from FO Licht, the German commodity statistic agency, which cut its forecast of world production in 1993-94 to 89.85m bags (60kg each) from the 92m bags it was projecting in December. 'A short glance at the production side reveals the situation is even bleaker than last year,' Licht said, adding that this would lead to 'a significant drawdown in stocks'. The slow reaction of supply to changes in the world market would result in shortages continuing into 1994-95, it warned. 'Indeed, the situation could get out of hand if there should be any weather-induced production shortfalls in the forthcoming season.' Supply/demand factors have also underpinned the Dollars 400-a-tonne rise in copper prices over the past five weeks, though, as with coffee, constructive chart patterns may have exaggerated the movement. The London Metal Exchange three months delivery price closed yesterday at Dollars 2,229.50 a tonne, up Dollars 50.50 on the week but Dollars 50 below Thursday's 17-month peak. Near term moves for copper were impossible to predict in the current climate, traders told the Reuter news agency, but chartists said the correction could continue for some way before it even started to threaten the overall bullish pattern. This week's rise was encouraged by the announcement on Tuesday of an 18,625-tonne cut in LME warehouse stocks of copper, but yesterday's 6,350-tonne fall to 399,725 tonnes was much smaller than most dealers expected. At the London bullion market the silver market again led gold higher as encouraging economic indicators attracted buyers to the predominantly industrial white metal. Cash silver closed yesterday at Dollars 5.63 1/2 a troy ounce, up 21 cents on the week, while gold consolidated last week's move above Dollars 380 with a Dollars 3.85 rise to Dollars 384.20 an ounce. A bout of profit-taking hit oil futures following the rally that had lifted nearby positions by Dollars 4 from mid-February's five year lows. But the buyers soon returned and in late trading yesterday the August delivery Brent blend contract at the International Petroleum Exchange, which had dipped below Dollars 16 a barrel in mid-week, was back at Dollars 16.23, down just 2 cents overall.  ----------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ----------------------------------------- Aluminium         +6,675  to  2,655,025 Aluminium alloy   -1,360  to  35,240 Copper            -6,350  to  399,725 Lead              +3,650  to  350,325 Nickel             -  60  to  132,270 Zinc              +1,750  to  1,162,850 Tin                 +610  to  28,455  -----------------------------------------</p>

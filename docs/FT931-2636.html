			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: PRT Budget change may force Seafield Resources overseas SEAFIELD Resources, the USM-quoted oil and gas exploration and production company, yesterday warned Budget changes might force it to concentrate on overseas exploration. The warning came as the company announced a fourfold increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 256,000 in the 15 months to the end of December 1991, reflecting a change in year-end, to Pounds 1.06m in the 12 months to December 31. The biggest overhaul of North Sea taxation in 10 years was announced in Tuesday's Budget. The most controversial change would prevent companies from offsetting exploration and appraisal spending against income from fields which incur Petroleum Revenue Tax. Oil companies would pay about 64p net of every Pounds 1 invested, compared with the present 17p. Mr Roger Witts, finance director, said: 'Over time we may concentrate a greater part of our cash flow on overseas exploration if we think prospects are better.' The company was reviewing strategy, but the industry would interpret transitional relief arrangements broadly, he said. It would argue that the two-year extension of PRT relief for companies with existing contracts included those obligations attached by the government to licences. Others in the industry believed, however, the concession extended only to signed drilling contracts. UK operating profits, including a first full-year contribution of the Victor field gas were Pounds 1.27m, compared with Pounds 710,000, which included the first five months of Victor production. The group used about 90 per cent of the PRT tax shelter generated by Victor, giving a total tax charge of Pounds 200,000 (Pounds 120,000). Operating losses on US activities doubled to Pounds 600,000 (Pounds 300,000). Victor contributed turnover of Pounds 4.4m (Pounds 2.7m) to a total of Pounds 5.55m (Pounds 5.41m), the balance coming from US activities. Net interest receivable was Pounds 426,000, compared with a charge of Pounds 160,000 last time. Earnings per share rose to 1.7p (0.6p).</p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: Other Markets - Frankfurt The Bundesbank Council's regular meeting on Thursday will provide a focus for trading this week. UBS thinks that in the event of further dollar weakness, speculation about a supportive gesture by Buba is likely to increase. 'We feel, however, that domestic factors and concerns about its credibility should prevent the Bundesbank from performing such a step too early.' UBS adds that since the last cut in headline rates, inflation has only slowed by 0.2 percentage points and M3 growth argues for caution. Generally positive statements are expected from Lufthansa, ahead of its rights issue, and Phillip Holzman at their annual meetings on Wednesday, and from Mannesmann on Friday. Meanwhile, the market will be eagerly awaiting news of lucrative contracts for German companies as Li Peng, the Chinese prime minister, makes an official visit to the country this week.

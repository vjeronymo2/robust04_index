			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / International Company News: S African retailer lifted by tax changes Heavy pressure on operating margins meant that Pepkor, South Africa's biggest retail group, was only able to increase operating profit by 3 per cent for the year ending February, to R275m (Dollars 80.6m) from R267.2m. However, lower tax and finance charges meant that after-tax profit increased 16 per cent to R184.7m from R161.35m. Turnover rose to R8.24bn from R7.76bn, largely due to increased market share achieved by core operation Pep stores, which target the mainly black, mass market. Shoprite, the subsidiary that controls supermarket chain Checkers, also performed well, withstanding the effects of a five-week strike and a flat trading market to boost after-tax profits 27 per cent to R43.56m from R35.79m. Announcing the results, management declared 1994 as the 'most difficult (year) to date in the history of the group' but said the improving political and economic climate, particularly among the black consumers that constitute much of Pepkor's market, should help future performance. The company is also involved in negotiations which may lead to a bid for troubled UK retailer What Everyone Wants. Results of the bid will be known on Monday at WEW's annual meeting. Edgars, the clothing, footwear and textiles group in the South African Breweries stable, increased after-tax profit 11 per cent to R171.2m from R175.3m last year. Sales increased 16 per cent to R3.68bn from R3.18bn, boosted by the acquisition of Shoecorp. The results, which were boosted by a slight reduction in taxation and net financing costs, reflected an improvement in market share despite the continued depressed overall trading environment.</p>

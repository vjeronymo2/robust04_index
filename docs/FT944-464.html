			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / International Company News: Credit Suisse nearer to Budapest Bank stake Credit Suisse, the main banking arm of Swiss financial group CS Holding, confirmed that the Hungarian government has chosen it as the lead contender to take a controlling stake in the planned privatisation of Budapest Bank, reports Reuter from Zurich. A Credit Suisse spokesman said the Swiss bank would be ready to make a formal offer 'by the end of the first quarter of 1995', but declined to speculate on the possible size. The acquisition would considerably strengthen Credit Suisse's presence in eastern Europe. So far it only has a branch in Moscow and a representative office in Vienna. Earlier this year, it withdrew an offer to share in the privatisation of Austria's second-largest bank, Creditanstalt, following political opposition. CS First Boston, the investment banking arm of CS Holding, has been very aggressive in expanding into eastern Europe. Credit Suisse mainly targets commercial banking.</p>

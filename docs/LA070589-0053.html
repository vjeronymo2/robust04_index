			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Rap singer Tone Loc, whose "Wild Thing" single hit the Top 10, has been  arrested in Miami Beach for making "very hostile and belligerent" remarks to a  police officer. The Los Angeles rapper, whose real name is Tony Terrell Smith,  was charged with misdemeanor counts of disorderly intoxication and resisting  arrest without violence. Loc, 23, was booked at the Dade County Jail and  released on his promise to appear for arraignment at a later date. Loc was  lying on the beach with a woman when the arrest was made at 4:58 a.m. The beach  is closed to the public after midnight. The police report said he had bloodshot  eyes, slurred speech and a strong odor of alcohol on him. Loc's hit album  "Loc-ed After Dark" has been among the Top 20 LPs for much of the year.

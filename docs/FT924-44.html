			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Customs keeps up defences as EC's trade barriers fall TRAVELLERS may not notice customs checks after the single European market begins life at midnight tonight, but officials will still be keeping a close watch on them. Hundreds of uniformed officers and administrative staff at borders throughout the European Community will be replaced by more discreet surveillance and intelligence-gathering. 'The question is not what you see at the borders after January 1, but what you don't see,' said one British Customs and Excise official. Its planners estimate that while some 400 of the 3,500 UK border staff will be affected by the abolition of EC customs controls, only about 12 will lose their jobs. The authorities are confident that by reallocating staff, they will be able to curtail the efforts of smugglers and terrorists at least as well as now. They stress that all important drug seizures in recent years were based on intelligence operations, not random border searches. Some staff no longer required in person at the borders will still be needed in a more discreet role monitoring the flows of traffic and people. Similar changes to customs services are taking place in other EC countries, although many - particularly the southern European states - have routinely relied more on intelligence and internal controls than on border checks. Customs controls between the UK and Ireland have long been working in the way being adopted elsewhere, because fixed posts are too vulnerable to terrorist attack. Customs officials will no longer have the power to stop and search at random those travelling from other EC countries, but they will be able to interrogate any who match their 'profiles' of suspicious characters. Many staff are being reassigned inland as investigators in London and the 22 customs collection divisions around the country, where they will gather intelligence on the movements of suspected smugglers and value added tax fraudsters. They are coy about explaining how this will work, but it will include gathering tip-offs and assembling profiles of likely suspects to be pursued. Publicans in Dover have been approached for help in alerting officials to anyone they consider suspicious. Other employees will become excise verification officers. They have powers to search suspect vehicles anywhere in the UK and can inspect shops to check if supplies are coming from registered traders. Further staff are being moved to other customs duties, such as dealing with the new statistical and VAT procedures introduced from tomorrow. Many uniformed customs officers will still be needed at UK borders. They will cope with EC and non-EC citizens arriving from outside the Community, who will still pass through a green channel and stop at a 'red spot' if they have goods to declare. Travellers, of whatever nationality, arriving from elsewhere in the EC will pass through a new blue channel. Most of the job changes required will be complete by the end of 1993.

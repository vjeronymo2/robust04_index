			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: CBoT finds way to stay in Globex The Chicago Board of Trade said yesterday it would put forward a counter-proposal designed to allow the exchange to remain a partner in Globex, the electronic futures trading system jointly developed by the CBoT, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters. However, agreement between the various parties seems unlikely, unless the CBoT is willing to back down on several key issues. The CBoT board of directors voted on Monday to continue participation in Globex, 'subject to certain conditions specified by the board'. A CBoT spokesman declined to elaborate on the board's demands but said that 'it means that we are interested in continuing participation in Globex, if the CME and Reuters can agree to certain points'. Earlier this month, the CBoT declined to join a new agreement between Reuters, the CME and the Matif, the French futures exchange whose products have been most heavily traded on Globex. Under the new plan, Reuters releases participating futures exchanges from some financial obligations and creates a management consortium that gives any participating exchange an equal voice in the day-to-day running of the system. In return, the exchanges make a commitment to 'seamless' trading - starting Globex trading immediately after the exchange's official close  - and agree not to use any other electronic trading systems to compete with Globex. Unless the CBoT's new proposal shows a willingness to budge on these key issues, a fresh agreement including the CBoT seems impossible. Ms Ros Wilton, director of Reuters transaction products, said yesterday that Reuters believed these two issues were 'the main criteria for the success of Globex'. She added that she looks forward to hearing any proposals by the CBoT. Any fresh plan would have to be formulated before April 18, as the CME has given notice of its intention to drop out of the existing agreement. If that lapses, the two-year fall-back plan agreed last month would come into force, without the CBoT's participation.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Johan Cuppens: "Ambitions Must Not Outstrip </F> Means"]    [Text] The decision taken by the Belgian Government to  close the Belgian Embassy in Kigali and recall Ambassador Johan  Swinnen to Brussels is a wise one. After all, in a country that  is at the mercy of the most nightmarish horrors and where  nothing is certain any longer, the warring factions have equally  scant regard for the conventions associated with diplomatic  relations as they do for their fellow Rwandans' right to live.    But with the immediate, and justified, concern regarding  several hundred Belgian nationals whose lives were threatened,  and who had to suddenly drop everything and leave a country in  which many of them had been giving of their best for many years,  too little attention has probably been paid over the past few  days to the plight of the local population. Indeed, no aircraft  have been arranged to carry them off to some safer place.    The takeover of power by the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan  Patriotic Front (RPF) does not mean that an end to the misery is  in sight. The RPF has never bothered about human rights and  democracy in the field and nobody believes that its leaders will  suddenly change their tack in this respect.    This development is a cause for great concern. The fear is  justified that the RPF ranks will in turn commit horrific acts  of revenge, causing even greater bloodshed, this time Hutu  blood. On the other hand, the stream of refugees that has  formed over the past few days will continue to grow. This new,  endless stream of refugees means that in the not-too-distant  future, an entire region risks being completely disrupted, and  new outbursts of ethnic violence are highly probable.    The unease in Belgian Government circles is just as real as  the evacuation plans for the neighboring country, Burundi. The  caution with which the government is reacting to such a  catastrophic scenario is understandable. Hopefully it is not in  for any nasty surprises and just like the rest of the  international community, it will recognize the signals of a  further change in good time and take action accordingly.    By deciding to close the embassy, the government has thrown  in the towel. It is powerless and recognizes as much. At the  same time, losing Rwanda marks the failure of a particular  political approach. When Belgium considers where it stands in  political terms, realism and pragmatism must be allotted a  prominent role. The ambitions of a small country like Belgium  must not outstrip its means. However, before it reasserts its  presence, Belgium is entitled to demand guarantees from the  Rwandan counterpart, not only regarding security, but also any  joint action. However, so far things have been going rather  wrong.</p>

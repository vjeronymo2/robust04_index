By chance, General Octavio Vargas Silva's car was passing  by and his driver immediately went to the aid of the finance  minister and drove him away. The minister has not yet spoken to  reporters, but we are told that he has just telephoned President  Cesar Gaviria to inform him of the incidents that occurred this  morning at 0800.    [Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network at 1419 GMT on  17 January adds that the finance minister was traveling  eastbound in a gray BMW with license plate AH-4772. A bomb  exploded as the vehicle was about to cross the bridge on 5th  Avenue. The left part of the car was severely damaged.  According to reports received by Caracol, the explosive device  that was planted beside a utility pole contained between five  and six kg of dynamite. The Santa Fe de Bogota Metropolitan  Police and Administrative Department of Security experts are  currently evaluating the situation and are trying to determine  what type of bomb it was.]</p>

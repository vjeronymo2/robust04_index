			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Appointments: Deriving a client service As one of the few growth businesses left in the City, derivatives (futures and options) trading and broking seems to be spawning a host of boutiques to specialise in explaining this arcane corner of the financial world. One of these, the 12-month-old Derivative Securities Ltd, whose corporate logo reads delta sigma lambda, has hired two research experts from a competitor in order to bolster its private client service. Ian Rankine, 50, and Martin Price, 41, come from Anglo Pierson Options (APO), part of the ABN Amro group; APO's move towards an execution-only service is understood to have left Rankine and Price less than fully stretched. DSL was set up by Quentin Burrows, 39, who had headed the traded options desk at NatWest stockbrokers; Oliver Gillie, 51, who came from the metals business via a spell running his own estate agency concern; and Patrick Thompson, 30, who had worked for the London Traded Options Market. They reckon wealthy private clients are more interested in options and futures than the exchanges often give them credit for in their marketing strategies. They also think private clients are given a raw deal by big city firms; all the DSL team has to do is to show they can make money where their big competitors cannot. ***** Anne Colquhoun has become company secretary of MATTHEW CLARK in place of John Lake who has resigned. ***** Following a reorganisation, Brian Dudley becomes chairman of WACE UK while continuing as md of Wace - UK and European operations; Peter Vacher becomes chairman of Wace Print Group in the UK in place of Frans ten Bos who remains chairman of Wace Group. ***** David Abel Smith, formerly md of Benjamin Priest, is appointed group chief executive of MARLING INDUSTRIES. Paul Wiseman, group md, is leaving the company. ***** Ron Hilvert is appointed vice-president - human resources for HILTON INTERNATIONAL; he moves from the Hyatt Regency in Birmingham. ***** John O'Brien and Michael Leslie have become directors of KERRY Group on the retirement of Donal Counthan and Dan Lynch. ***** Kevin Wilson is appointed chief executive of WAGON INDUSTRIAL HOLDINGS' engineering division as well as of the automotive products division in place of Fred Thompson who has resigned. ***** Sue Godzicz is appointed financial director of WATSON-MARLOW, part of Spirax-Sarco Engineering, on the retirement of Alan Doidge. David Marchant has moved from Four Square to take up the new post of technical director.</p>

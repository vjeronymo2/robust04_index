			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / New York city's fiscal crisis deepens THE severity of New York's fiscal crisis was underlined yesterday by an official estimate that the municipal budget deficit will be two-thirds higher this year than predicted just two months ago. Ms Elizabeth Holtzman, city comptroller, blamed lower tax receipts, a swollen workforce, extra overtime and higher welfare spending, for the expected jump in the deficit to Dollars 505m (Pounds 282m) from Dollars 304m. The current fiscal year ends on June 30. About half the expected shortfall is due to an erosion of personal income, sales and other tax receipts. Ms Holtzman said the recession could lose New York 110,000 jobs in calendar 1991. Mayor David Dinkins is trying to put together a package of spending cuts, but the city's trade unions have refused to co-operate.</p>

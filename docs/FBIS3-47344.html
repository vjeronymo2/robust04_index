Vice trade ministers of the two countries kicked off three  days of talks on auto trade, one of the industrial sectors  covered by the bilateral "framework" trade negotiations agreed  on last July.    Sources close to the negotiators said Japan adamantly  rejected the U.S. request, reiterating that too much government  intervention in the private sector results in managed trade.    The U.S. side showed some understanding toward the Japanese  position, but asserted that the government has a role to play in  making it easier for U.S. cars to enter the Japanese market,  the sources said.    They said the discrepancy will delay an agreement on the  talks to next week or after.    Meanwhile, Jeffrey Garten, U.S. under secretary of commerce  for international economic affairs, met personally with Japanese  makers to persuade them to agree to help increase sales of U.S.  finished cars in Japan and entry by U.S. firms into the  country's parts repair industry.    A senior official of the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry said later in the day that the bilateral talks will not  be settled unless the U.S. drops its demand that Japan set  numerical targets to gauge the openness of Japan's auto market.    He noted there were no prospects of growth in the domestic  demand for motor vehicles.    "Under such circumstances, we can't urge domestic automakers  to buy more parts from U.S. parts suppliers because they have  shut down some of their factories and imposed tough demands on  their subcontractors," said the official, who declined to be  identified.</p>

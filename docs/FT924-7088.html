			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Lithuanian poll winner will preserve links with Russia THE newly elected Lithuanian leader said yesterday that he would continue to encourage western investment but promised to safeguard economic links with Russia. Mr Algirdas Brazauskas, leader of the former Communists who this week won the general election, said in an interview with the Financial Times that he had built strong links with the centrist Russian Civic Union bloc now bidding for power in Moscow. These forces were likely soon to prevail in Russia, said Mr Brazauskas, whose Democratic Labour party won an absolute majority in Lithuania's parliament. Russia and the other former Soviet republics still provide most of Lithuania's supplies and take the majority of its output. 'The former government said everything would come from the west - but where is it? They said we would get western investment. I don't see it,' he said. Mr Brazauskas is thought to prefer a gentler course towards a market economy than western-style shock therapy. His views accord with the criticism voiced about the Russian government by General Alexander Rutskoi, Russian vice-president, and Mr Arkady Volsky, head of the Russian Union of Industrialists. The election winner, however, reiterated his belief in market reforms. 'We will continue our agreements with the International Monetary Fund, but they must understand that one-third of the people live in poverty and that we may be on the verge of hunger in some areas,' he said. Mr Brazauskas, 60, said he would delay holding a presidential election for at least six months after his party takes power pending discussions with political parties and the passing of an electoral law. He will be chairman of the parliament - as was President Vytautas Landsbergis whose Sajudis nationalist movement lost Sunday's poll - but he did not say whether he would run for the presidency. He reiterated that his party would now be social democratic and not communist. Russian economic crisis, Page 3</p>

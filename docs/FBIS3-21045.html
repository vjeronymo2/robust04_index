			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unsigned article: "European Combat Plane's Initial Flight </F> Scheduled for April"]    [Text] Bonn--A spokesman for the German Ministry of Defense  announced on 30 December that the first flight of the European  combat plane (ACE) Eurofighter has been set for next April.    The Eurofighter Jagdflugzeug Gmbh company had indicated in  October that this initial flight was not likely to take place  before the beginning of 1994. The first test flight was to have  occurred over one year ago but the program schedule, upset by  the decision to build a simplified and less costly version of  the ACE, had been set back to last fall, then delayed once more  when the British firm CEC Marconi Avionics encountered problems  with flight control software.    The 3 January issue of the magazine DER SPIEGEL announced  that financing for the Eurofighter is short one billion  deutschemarks (about 3.5 billion francs). It also stated that  DASA, subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, billed an additional 940  million marks to the Ministry of Defense and 740 million marks  to NEFMA, the company managing the Eurofighter project. But the  1994 defense budget only allows 520 million marks for the  Eurofighter.    The Defense spokesman confirmed DASA's additional request,  asserting however that it only amounts to 650 million marks. He  also indicated that the amount for which the company is  responsible has to be determined.</p>

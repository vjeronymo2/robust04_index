			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Mongolia reform spurred MONGOLIA'S ruling People's Revolutionary Party ended its 21st congress at the weekend determined to boost the democratic and economic reforms wrenching the country from 70 years of communism, Reuter reports from Ulan Bator. It adopted a new platform of 'centrism', based on Buddhist avoidance of extremes, to replace the Marxism-Leninism that Mongolia rejected in 1990. The communist ruling party won a parliamentary majority in elections in 1990 but has since shared power with a democratic opposition. The country faces elections in June for a new 76-member single-chamber parliament. The second largest political party, meanwhile, has decided to leave the government coalition because of the slow rate of economic reform. Mr Erdenin Bat-Uul, chairman of the Mongolian Democratic Party, said his party had decided to mount a formal opposition challenge.</p>

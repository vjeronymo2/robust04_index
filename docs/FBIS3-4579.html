			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 28 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa apologized Monday [28 February] for causing confusion  over his repeated remarks that he will deliver a policy speech  to the Diet on March 7.    He told reporters he does not know when he will make the  speech, because the Diet's Steering Committees have the power to  make the decision.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news  conference that the coalition government will arrange for the  prime minister to make the speech on Friday.    Hosokawa reiterated Sunday that he would make the speech on  March 7, instead of this Friday as initially scheduled.    He said, "the government is scheduled to submit the fiscal  1994 budget on March 4. It is being argued on the basis of past  custom that the prime minister should make a policy speech on  the day when the budget bill is submitted to the Diet."    Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social Democratic  Party, said at a news conference that it will be difficult for  Hosokawa to reshuffle his cabinet prior to parliamentary  deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget program if the premier  delivers his policy speech on Friday.</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Paints and the Environment (3): Increasing sensitivity - Disposal of waste When the Wastewagon started rolling round Leeds in 1992, it set in train a new approach to dealing with waste paint. It toured designated districts collecting paint cans people had finished with - and any paint still in them, writes Ian Hamilton Fazey. The Wastewagon - a Ford Iveco van with a tail-lift - was sponsored by ICI. Backing also came from B&amp;Q, the DIY retail shed group; UK 2000, the clean-up-Britain charity; and Leeds city council. Monetary costs were only Pounds 4,500, but the more valuable help came in kind - people and resources. The experiment was a test of whether it was sensible to try and systematically collect waste paint and do something worthwhile with it. Success was confirmed last week when Leeds officially opened a permanent 'paint exchange' system. Ealing, a London borough, brought in consultants from the Leeds experiment and started a similar scheme last autumn. The Wastewagon, however, is no more. This proved a costly and inefficient method of collecting waste. It was better to provide collection points where people could dispose of it themselves. What the experiment proved was that there is now a substantial amount of re-usable paint in most people's waste. Ms Isobel Howe, research consultant to Swap - Save Waste and Prosper, a not-for-profit agency which did the experiment, says this amounted to 20 per cent of collected waste and came to about 750 litres. But who would want to re-use it? Charities, says Ms Howe - 'more than enough recipients were attracted to use all the collected paint, with demand far exceeding supply. It was quite clear a permanent scheme would have no problem finding plenty of takers, given the right links to social services departments and the voluntary sector.' Most people have waste paint in their homes. Used cans with paint still in them are left in cellars, box rooms, cupboards or garages. When they are thrown out, it is usually with the household rubbish - sometimes after paint that is still liquid has been poured down the drain. Leeds has now set up 'paint banks' at three municipal waste dumping centres. Each has three skips - one for empty tin cans, one for empty plastic containers and one for containers with paint still in them. Empty tins cans go for recycling, as do those of the plastic variety which are suitable. Containers with small quantities of paint that has solidified are classed as empties. They are shredded prior to recycling and the waste paint can be collected as it fragments. The skip for liquid, possibly re-usable paint, has racks to keep containers upright when the skip is moved. Sorting is at a community training base by a workforce undergoing youth training, in effect giving them a proper project to learn on. What cannot be re-used goes for recovery and recycling - or safe disposal if it so old it contains now-banned toxic ingredients like lead. A stocklist system will ensure incoming containers are logged by volume, manufacturer, colour, age and re-usability. This could come into its own if other local authorities follow the Leeds and Ealing leads, with a database of second-hand paint available for charities and community projects. Waste is likely to become an increasingly important issue if such schemes proliferate and public consciousness is raised. This could also rebound on paint manufacturers. Little attention was paid to waste disposal in the past. Indeed, on the basis of 'the polluter pays,' who is responsible for waste decorative paint? Is not the customer, the person disposing of unwanted paint or empty containers, the polluter? But with the ownership of decorative paint production now concentrating into fewer large groups - all of them more vulnerable to public opinion than an industry in fragmented ownership - sensitivity is increasing. 'Waste paint is not so much a hazard as a nuisance,' says Mr Chris Joyce, ICI's technical manager for decorative products in Europe. 'We need to get together with everyone concerned and find the right approach.' The industry is setting up a group to run further pilot projects on the Leeds lines to encourage more public paint banks and systems to manage them. Education is also part of the process, says Mr Joyce, starting with not over-buying in the place through better calculation of how much paint might be needed for a job. Companies wanting to improve their waste management could start with a simple DIY training manual published by Athena Training International of Bootle, under licence from ICI Paints. Its aim is to change people's attitudes to waste - from producing less of it, to managing and disposing of it better.</p>

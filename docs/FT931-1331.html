			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / BP defends oil tax from attacks: Rig owners reject BP claims  -Warning of further closures / Capacity exceeds orders BRITISH Petroleum yesterday attacked claims by other oil operators that tax changes announced by the chancellor in the Budget would severely curtail North Sea activity. But oil rig owners said yesterday that four drilling programmes had already been cancelled since last Tuesday, when Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, proposed to reduce the rate of petroleum revenue tax from 75 per cent to 50 per cent, and to abolish tax allowances for exploration and appraisal work. Today representatives from Amerada Hess, the North Sea exploration company, are to meet Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury. The company, one of the most active in North Sea exploration, has threatened to halve its exploration programme this year if the government insists on its proposed changes to the tax regime. The divergent views of the winners and losers in the largest overhaul of North Sea taxes for 10 years are generating a serious row in the oil industry over how to respond to Mr Lamont's proposals. Mr John Browne, ex-ploration director at BP, said the attacks on the proposed changes by the UK Offshore Operators' Association, the industry group, were 'hasty and inappropriate.' Mr Browne said the tax reforms were overdue. The taxpayer had spent 30 years subsidising what has sometimes been wasteful oil exploration. BP says the proportion of wells drilled which result in commercial oil finds has dropped in the past five years from one in four to one in seven. The proposals would give exploration work a stronger focus and make it more cost-effective, he said, and the reduction in the tax rate for existing fields would encourage companies to improve recovery of oil. 'Even the most efficient fields leave 40 per cent of the oil in the ground. Many of those older fields would be nearing depletion by the end of the decade. They will now have a longer life,' he said. One analyst estimated that the industry as a whole could recover 500m to 1bn barrels from existing fields given the incentive of lower taxes. BP is a net beneficiary of the changes - analysts estimate they could add as much as Pounds 140m a year to its profits. The company has the third-largest drilling programme in the North Sea and is set to spend Pounds 90m on exploration this year. Mr Browne said much more oil could be recovered from existing fields than will be found in small discoveries of 10m to 20m barrels. He said the changes would help bring new areas, such as the recent west-of-Shetlands discovery, on stream more quickly. However, owners of drilling rigs have written to Mr John Major, the prime minister, and to Mr Lamont warning of the consequences of the proposals. Mr Mike Salter, chief executive of Smedvig, a drilling rig operator, and chairman of the British Rig Owners Association, said the proposals would increase the number of rigs idle and crews out of work. He said 40 per cent of drilling rigs in the North Sea were already idle. Exploration work fell 32 per cent last year because of low oil prices and high costs.</p>

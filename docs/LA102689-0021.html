			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PUMPKINS &amp; OTHER SQUASHES;  </P> <P> FROM JACK-BE-LITTLES TO AUSTRALIAN BLUES, SQUASHES PROVIDE AUTUMN MENUS WITH  NUTRIENTS AND COLOR  </P> <P> Among the first vegetables cultivated by American Indians were those called  askutasquash or isquoutersquash. Thanks to the pilgrims, however, the word for  this vegetable family now is simply squash.  </P> <P>  The native American gourd, which originally meant "eaten raw," has become a  mainstay on our tables as both an edible menu item and as a table decoration.  </P> <P> This is the proper time of the year to rediscover the hard-shelled,  summer-grown crops of the Cucurbita maxima family. In familiar language,  they're known as winter squash, so-called because they store well for winter  eating. So forget the canned substitutes, get the cleaver and mallet out and  enjoy your share of these ever-appealing vegetables.  </P> <P> Blending with the brilliant colors of fall, the squash family includes  pumpkins, in various shades of tangerine and now white and blue as well.  Pumpkins range in size from a 641-pound mammoth (this year's record holder) to  minuscule 3-inch Jack-Be-Littles. Common winter squash varieties include Acorn,  Butternut, Hubbard and Buttercup, which come in many shapes, colors and  stripings, displaying rugged to smooth exteriors.  </P> <P> For the tough-skinned pumpkin, however, this year's harvest wasn't easy.  </P> <P> "Pumpkins have been hurt due to the rains," said Dimetri Gardikas, a produce  distributor in Downey. "The rains damaged some portion of the larger sizes. A  good portion of the mini-pumpkins were wiped out while the white pumpkins  suffered extensive damage. Adding to the problem, we got more mud in the  pumpkins."  </P> <P> On the brighter side, consumers still will find a heap of jack-o'-lantern  pumpkins for carving and pie-making because supplies have arrived from out of  state.  </P> <P> "The 20 to 30% (local) loss was also offset by a heavier crop this year,"  Gardikas added. Good news is that pricing is about the same as last year, with  a slight half-cent-per-pound increase.  </P> <P> Although the familiar pumpkin remains the unanimous choice for Halloween and  fall decorating, its eating quality is not that of its sister winter squashes.  "Some (winter squashes) are so sweet that you don't need anything on them,"  said food consultant and stylist Marlene Brown, who devoted an informative  chapter in her new book, "International Produce Cookbook and Guide" (H P Books:  $12.95) to squash.  </P> <P> Consumer acceptance of squash improves each year, she said. "New varieties are  being introduced, and people are becoming more aware that squashes are packed  with nutrients, are high in fiber and are superb sources of Vitamin A --  especially the orange-meat squashes." Brown suggests choosing a squash that's  hard and solid and heavy for its size.  </P> <P> New, improved hybrids also have inspired the comeback of older favorites.  Gardikas said he feels secure handling the popular sellers, such as Butternut,  Acorn, Spaghetti squash and sometimes Banana squash. On the other hand,  suppliers such as Melissa's Brand (formerly World Variety Produce) and Frieda's  Finest expressed growing positive responses with specialty squashes.  </P> <P> One of the newer entries into the winter squash field is the Australian Blue,  which Brown said is her current favorite because it's very rich and meaty, with  brilliant orange flesh. According to Trudy Hernandez, marketing manager for  Melissa's, the bluish-gray shelled squashes, which were once available only in  Australia and known as Queensland Blue Pumpkins, are now grown just north of  Bakersfield, Calif. Because of their washed-out blue shade, some people are  already planning to use them as Southwest-style jack-o'-lanterns or as  centerpieces before cooking them.  </P> <P> "These blue squashes were considered a staple in Australia. Because  refrigeration of the squash was not necessary even after opening, the blue  pumpkins were served at almost every pub Down Under," Hernandez said.  </P> <P> Highly successful members of Melissa's and Frieda's squash lines are two  small-size varieties that make excellent one-serving vegetables: the Gold  Nugget, a small, round, orange squash of the buttercup type; and Sweet  Dumpling, a squat-shaped squash with a cream-colored shell and indented dark  green striping.  </P> <P> Another reason why winter squashes are gaining in popularity is that they are  all microwaveable, said food consultant Cathi Hofstetter. "They keep their  flavor and texture in the microwave," she explained. "It's so convenient and  fast this way; it frees up the oven during the holidays and doesn't scare  people into thinking that they have to spend so much time preparing squash the  stove-top way."  </P> <P> Hofstetter also prefers baby squashes because they cook faster and are tasty  plain or stuffed. Of the special varieties, she prefers White Acorn for baking  and the long, slender Delicata for its corn-and-sweet-potato flavor.  </P> <P> To vary presentations and to make soup, rice or vegetable casseroles more  appealing, a trend (borrowed from the early American Indians) is to use medium-  to small-size precooked squashes as serving vessels.  </P> <P> Drawing from international cuisines, we've developed some interesting  suggestions on how to use winter squash and pumpkin. For an all-American  pumpkin pie, try Julia Child's Fluffy Pumpkin Pie from her latest cookbook,  "Julia Child's The Way to Cook" (Alfred Knopf: $50). The filling is light and  moist, the butter crust so flaky and rich, it melts in your mouth.  </P> <P> Pumpkin seeds have a unique application in the savory, pastel green sauce for  orange Pumpkin Ravioli, a recipe from the new "Betty Crocker's Southwest  Cookbook." There's also a brightly colored Squash Soup With Cranberry Dollop  from Marlene Brown's produce cookbook.  </P> <P> Use your imagination. Substitute squash purees, chunks or slices for potato or  sweet potato in recipes. Tempura or creme brulee? You'll be surprised that  squash works in both applications.  </P> <P> Of course, it's hard to beat the delicate perfection of plain cooked squash,  swathed in butter and accented with a sprinkling of fragrant herbs and spices.  </P> <P> Food Styling by Minnie Bernardino and Donna Deane.

Pulse 5 to 6 times to roughly break up butter. Add shortening, turn on  machine and immediately pour in 1/2 cup ice water, then pulse 2 to 3 times.  Remove cover and feel dough. It should look like a bunch of small lumps and  will just hold together in a mass when pressed together. If too dry, pulse in  droplets more water.  </P> <P> Turn dough out onto work surface and press into rough mass. Rapidly and  roughly, with the heel of hand, push egg-size clumps of dough in front of you  in 6-inch smear.  </P> <P> Gather and form dough into two cakes. Wrap in plastic and chill at least 2  hours. Roll out each dough and fit into two (9-inch) pie pans, making strong  fluted rim that extends about 1/2 inch above top of pan.

Reserve.  </P> <P> Mix flour and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt in large bowl. Make a well in center.  Beat tomato paste, oil and eggs until well blended. Pour into well. Stir with  fork, gradually bringing flour mixture into center, until dough forms a ball.  If dough is too dry, mix in up to 2 tablespoons water. Knead on lightly floured  cloth-covered surface, adding flour if dough is sticky, until smooth and  elastic, about 5 minutes. Cover and let rest 5 minutes.  </P> <P> Divide dough into 4 equal parts. Roll dough, one part at a time, into  rectangle, about 12x10 inches (keep remaining dough covered). Drop pumpkin  mixture by 2 level teaspoons onto half of rectangle about 1 1/2 inches apart in  2 rows of 4 mounds each. Moisten edges of dough and dough between rows of  pumpkin mixture with water.  </P> <P> Fold other half of dough up over pumpkin mixture, pressing dough down around  mixture. Trim edges with pastry wheel or knife. Cut between rows of filling to  make ravioli. Press edges with fork to seal. Repeat with remaining dough and  pumpkin mixture. Place ravioli on towel. Let stand, turning once until dry,  about 30 minutes.  </P> <P> Prepare Pumpkin Seed Sauce. Heat until hot and keep warm.

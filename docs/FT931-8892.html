			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Lost duty free contract hits outcome at Allders ALLDERS, the department store and duty and tax free shops group, suffered a fall from Pounds 22.6m to Pounds 15.2m in pre-interest profits for the year to September 30. Its annual report shows turnover fell 2.3 per cent to Pounds 555.6m, with sales in the department stores down by 2.1 per cent to Pounds 259.1m and by 2.4 per cent in the duty and tax free shops to Pounds 296.5m. Mr Tony Collyer, finance director, said that the loss of an important duty free contract at Sydney airport had hit profits, but he said the group had won a number of other licences. The group, which was the subject of a management buy-out from Hanson in 1989, is looking to float at some point, although probably not in the current year. The department store side had been affected by the opening of two shops, the first new stores since 1985, and closure of one. The group also launched an out-of-town format, At Home with Allders, at five sites. Mr Collyer said they were expected to generate sales in a full year equal to one department store, but at a fraction of the cost. During the year capital expenditure totalled Pounds 20m, he said. The high level of debt from the buy-out had not stopped the group investing, especially as a refinancing in 1991 had deferred repayments of the debt. The group had net debt of about Pounds 90m at the year-end and the interest charge was Pounds 10.6m, down from Pounds 16.2m, thanks to lower interest rates and the effect of a refinancing. However, exceptional debits took Pounds 8.1m, compared to a credit of Pounds 36.8m from the refinancing, leaving a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.4m, against a Pounds 43.2m profit. The exceptional item related to unusually large pre-opening costs of Pounds 3.7m on two new department stores, a Pounds 1.7m provision for rent on two unused properties - a closed department store, where the site is now being redeveloped, and a warehouse now sold - and a Pounds 2.7m adjustment to the value of the closed store.</p>

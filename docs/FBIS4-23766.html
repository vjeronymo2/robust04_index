			<p>BFN     [Text] The government has announced its intention to  station a permanent battalion in the north-eastern part of the  country. This is to enable the military to be in a better  position to quickly respond to future conflict situations in the  area. The minister of defense, Alhaji Mahama Iddrisu, announced  this in Parliament today, during a brief on the inter-ethnic  conflict in the Northern Region.    Alhaji Mahama, who is also the chairman of the National  Emergency Committee, said it is the view of the committee that  the stationing of such a battalion will ensure the traditional  presence of the Army in this conflict-prone area.    As a temporary measure, the defense minister said, even  though the military will hand over to the police in the conflict  zone, it will continue to maintain a limited presence at places  it considers as priority areas. These include Salaga, Yendi,  Krachi, and Saboba districts.    The House approved the appointments of Major Emmanuel Tetteh  as the Eastern Regional minister and Mr. Sam P. Yalley as deputy  minister of environment, science, and technology.</p>

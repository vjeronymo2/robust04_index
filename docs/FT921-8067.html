			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Howard renews attack on union links MR MICHAEL HOWARD, employment secretary, renewed the government's assault on the consequences of Labour's trade union connections, David Owen writes. He said last year's figure of 800,000 days lost to strikes compared with more than 29m days lost in 1979. That was the winter of discontent which had seen 'the collapse of the last Labour government's economic policies'. Having been through 'difficult times', Britain was 'on the point of reaping the rewards for low inflation, and for our strike-free industrial relations'. Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, said there would be 'no return to the trades union legislation of the 1970s' and suggested the government was 'refighting' the battles of that era because it had no solutions to current problems. After combating unemployment, the main priority, he said, was to 'improve the education of our workforce'. Britain had less than a quarter as many apprentices as Germany, he said, criticising the government's decision to cut training expenditure.</p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: Fresh sources to fund recovery - The French government is breaking new ground with its latest bond IT has been dubbed the 'Feel-Good Bond', the 'Balladur Bond' and the 'Recovery Bond' by government debt specialists. The new FFr40bn French government bond issue - announced earlier this week by Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister - is specifically intended to finance Mr Balladur's economic recovery programme. It has already attracted considerable interest among bond analysts: many are wondering what impact it will have on the French bond market, one of the European debt markets most closely watched by overseas investors. The government will employ two innovative features to attract individual investors: convertibility into shares in forthcoming privatisations and the right to hold the bonds in tax-exempt savings plans. Analysts point out the government is tapping a new source of money with this latest initiative. Private investors are expected to switch their savings out of money market funds, where a recent fall in interest rates has meant a decline in return. In addition, traditional share investors may be wooed into buying the bonds, given they may convert them into new privatisation stocks. 'The government is trying to take advantage of the fact that interest rates are coming down. It will be standing there with a bucket to catch some of the FFr1,200bn currently held in the Sicav (money market funds) as the money comes out,' says Ms Marie Owens Thomsen, international economist at Midland Global Markets. Mr Steve Major, European bond analyst at Credit Lyonnais, predicts that by targetting these investors, the new bond is unlikely to spark a sharp switch out of existing government debt. As a result, bond prices - notably in the four-year area where the new issue will be launched - should not weaken dramatically. He says that while the new bond would have the same credit rating as existing French debt issues, it might even trade at a slight premium to current issues because of the conversion and tax advantages. However, other bond experts say it is not clear yet whether the new issue will be particularly liquid. 'If private investors decide to hold on to the bonds (until conversion), they would be very illiquid,' says Mr George Magnus. of SG Warburg Securities. He says it is still unclear whether the French houses will be asked to make markets in the new issue. The prospect of a further FFr40bn of new supply - on top of the government's forecast of total OAT (bond) and BTAN (note) issuance of FFr480bn for 1993 - has not upset the French bond market. As Ms Thomsen says: 'The new bond is equivalent in size to one regular monthly bond auction.' Ten-year French government bond yields have fallen from 9.2 per cent last July to a low of 7.04 per cent in April, and the spread over comparable German bonds has narrowed dramatically. French interest rates have been cut steadily since the March general election but, like other members of the European exchange rate mechanism, France may now have to wait for the Bundesbank to cut rates. Mr Magnus points out the Bank of France is unlikely to have scope to cut rates again unless there is a strong move in the franc. 'The market still has fresh memories of unilateral rate cuts (by the Bank of France) which were too fast and had to be reversed,' he says.</p>

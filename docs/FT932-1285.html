			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Observer: Chip off the old block Noting that top people in their field are referred to as 'the writer's writer' and so on, an ambitious character in a novel by William Faulkner set out to become 'the son-of-a-bitch's son-of-a-bitch'. By the same token, the European Commission can have few rivals for the title of 'the bureaucrat's bureaucracy'. It is certainly proving a worthy successor to the labyrinthine former Soviet Union, not least in its handling of attempts to help Russia to set up a proper stock market. A blueprint - ironically including proposals to stop foreign aid from being wasted by do-gooding agencies - was completed by consultants Garside Miller and solicitors Norton Rose last November. The EC got around to approving it in March but, although the report is keenly awaited by numerous outfits working to develop the stock exchange system, the Commission has since refused to make the document available. True, Garside Miller thought it had made a breakthrough when it recently won permission to release a single copy to the FT, plus the addresses of two of the EC's branches which could distribute more. One was its co-ordination unit in Moscow, which responded with uncharacteristic haste. Why had its address been listed?, it demanded of the FT over the phone. Then, on being told permission came from Brussels, it snapped: 'This has not been approved by the Commission', and hung up. Callers approaching it for copies have been given the same message, and told to try again in 10 weeks - by which time the the weed-like growth of stock exchanges in Russia may have gone too far for the blueprint to be of use. No wonder Russia's finance minister has moaned about too much western aid going into 'reports that never get read'.</p>

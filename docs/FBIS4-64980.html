			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["hal"-signed report: "Yeltsin Visit: Economy on the </F> Agenda"]    [Text] Bonn, 10 May -- It seems that Russian President  Boris Yeltsin does not want to discuss problems concerning  German-Russian economic relations during his three-day German  visit that starts this Wednesday [11 May]. In any case, there  is no comprehensive round of talks with representatives of  German industry on such critical issues as Russian taxation or  crime on the agenda. Even so, Economic Minister Guenter Rexrodt  would like to raise the subject of taxation problems and ways of  improving the conditions for investments, which include the  delivery of railroad carriages for the Russian state railroad  and the construction of a machine plant in Kamas.    The Economics Ministry in Bonn says that despite its  difficult situation, Russia remains an important economic  partner for Germany. Business with the East continues to be  important, especially for the new laender, which exported 53  percent of their output to Russia in 1993. Total German exports  to Russia amounted to 11.4 billion marks [DM], and imports from  Russia amounted to DM10.7 billion. According to the ministry,  last year's collapse in trade between Russia and Germany has not  continued any further. Between 1990 and 1992, trade between the  two countries fell by almost one-half.    All in all, the Eastern Committee of German Industry  considers the development of trade with East Europe and the  post-Soviet republics as positive, despite all the difficulties.  The increase in Russian import duties in 1994 will probably  have a bearing on exports of microelectronic components,  electric home entertainment equipment, and cars. It is not yet  known to what extent general trade will be affected. All the  same, Russia has relaxed its tough import restrictions, a move  that affects the traditionally most important sectors of Russian  trade -- machine and equipment construction, says the Economics  Ministry.</p>

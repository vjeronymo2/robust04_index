			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Shoichiro Toyoda, Toyota Motor Corp. </F> chairman and new Japan Federation of Economic Organizations  [Keidanren] chairman, by Masaaki Sato, member of NIHON KEIZAI  SHIMBUN editorial board: "Shoichiro Toyoda Vows To Become a  Powerful Prime Minister of the Japanese Business World;" place  and date not given]    [Text] [Sato] When were you asked by the previous  chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa to be his successor? And how did you  feel when you were asked?    [Toyoda] He whispered in my ear during a party held on 13  January to celebrate the accomplishment of the economic report  by the Economic Reform Research Council [a private advisory  panel to Morihiro Hosokawa, the previous Prime Minister]. I did  not know what answer to give, because I was taken unawares by  his proposal. Moreover, the next day, I had to leave for Britain  on business. So, I replied: "Please let me have time to  consider it. I will give you a definite answer after I return."    [Sato] But, I suppose you had a hunch that you would be  picked as the new chairman, after Vice Chairman Akio Morita  [chairman of Sony Corp.], who had widely been viewed as the most  likely successor to Mr. Hiraiwa, suffered a sudden illness at  the end of 1993.    [Toyoda] No, I never had such an idea. I read on the  electronic newsboard that Mr. Morita was struck by a sudden  illness while on board a Shinkansen bullet train. Moreover, the  electronic newsboard further reported: "Opinions would be  adjusted within Keidanren, with Toyoda as the top candidate for  the next chairmanship." To speak the truth, I felt embarrassed  when I saw it saying that I was regarded as likely to take such  an important position of high responsibility.    However, I have been pondering over the matter since the  beginning of January, when Mr. Hiraiwa, the previous chairman,  spoke to me in private about the next chairmanship. After due  consideration, I decided to take up the post and fulfill my  duties by offering myself to the organization, since the post  must be assumed by someone, and since it came to be my turn to  take it.    When I explained my resolution to my company's honorary  chairman (Eiji Toyoda, honorary Toyota Motor Corp. chairman and  former Keidanren vice chairman), he got really angry with me.  He said, "What are you talking about? Our company will be  quite embarrassed if you undermine your health by assuming such  a post." However, he never said: "All right, take up the post  but just take it easy." (laughter) I think he wanted to say,  "Do your best but take care of yourself." His words are now  engraved in my mind.    [Sato] The business world is also being driven to reform  following the collapse in the summer of 1993 of the so-called  "1955 order" of one-party rule by the Liberal Democratic Party.  In terms of Japanese corporate management, the current  recession has killed the business world's 1955 order premised on  growth. The business world is now under pressure to restructure  itself.    [Toyoda] Yes, I am fully aware of the situation. In a word,  Keidanren's role under the 1955 order of the business world was  to represent corporate interests. Keidanren was built based on  the idea of the high-growth period; namely, the idea that  corporate interests are directly connected with improvement of  the nation's standard of living. Such an idea was warrantable  under an economic system based on high economic growth and  founded under the slogan "Let's catch up and pass the West."    However, whether we are willing or not, it is now  indispensable to build a new economic structure that gives  priority to consumers interests, given that the Japanese economy  has not only caught up with the West but surpassed it. This  inevitably brings on a change in Keidanren's role, and it is  only right for us to change our way of thinking.  <H5>  The Power of Execution Produces the Power of Execution </H5>   [Sato) This is why Keidanren's raison d'etre is now called  into question. Some people are of the opinion that since the  economic structure under which corporate interests were  equivalent to the people's welfare has disappeared, Keidanren's  mission is over. They say that Keidanren should now transform  itself into a think tank.    [Toyoda] It is true that, until now, Keidanren's activity  has been based on the idea that corporate interests are  equivalent to the people's welfare. However, it is not at all  the case that this was the only justification for Keidanren's  existence. Since its inauguration, Keidanren has made policy  proposals to the government and the relevant agencies, after  canvassing the opinions of major industries and companies.  Keidanren's definite opinion was a reflection of the times.  Keidanren once represented corporate interests, but from now  on, it will attach greater importance to the protection of  consumer interests. Making proposals does not represent the  only justification of Keidanren's existence. Translating these  proposals into action is also its raison d'etre.    For instance, until now, there have been many pertinent  policy proposals, such as the so-called Maekawa Report  [submitted in 1986, the Report called for changing Japan's  export-oriented economy to one led by domestic demand] and the  five-year economic plan for a better quality of life [submitted  in 1992]. Unfortunately, these proposals were not realized. In  the case of the Maekawa Report, right after it was submitted to  the government, Japan's domestic consumption rose sharply due to  the so-called bubble economy. This is why we got a false  impression that the proposals made by the Maekawa Report were  somehow put into effect. However, after the collapse of the  bubble economy, we realized that nothing had been carried out.    [Toyoda continues] Many important issues of the day,  including deregulation, are raised in the so-called Hiraiwa  Report submitted by the Economic Reform Research Council. The  proposed plan is realizable. Since it made the proposals,  Keidanren has to execute them in a definite way. That is  Keidanren's great mission.    [Sato] In September 1993, the previous chairman, Mr.  Hiraiwa, decided to stop channeling billions of yen in political  donations to political parties through the National Political  Association on the behalf of major industries and companies.  Many people now wonder what will be left to Keidanren, once it  is deprived of its function of passing along political  donations. The argument is that, because the organization's  influence on politicians and bureaucrats will decrease if its  function of passing along political donations ceases, Keidanren  will lack the power of execution.    [Toyoda] I have to correct this misunderstanding. I would  like to make it clear that Keidanren's influence has not been  grounded only on passing along political donations. Its  influence overlaps with its raison d'etre. As I just explained,  Keidanren gathers different opinions from major industries and  companies to make proposals. It also urges the Diet, the  government, and the concerned agencies to take the necessary  steps to implement these proposals. Meanwhile, member companies  act together to put them into effect. Our words are backed up  with deeds, and this is the source of our influence.    Keidanren played an important role in maintaining and  developing a liberal economic system during the Cold War era.  Channeling billions of yen in political donations to political  parties was simply a means to attain this end. However,  political donations are now perceived differently, given that  political parties differ little from each other in policy  following the 1955 order's collapse that triggered political  realignment. With the growing public opinion that political  parties should depend less on corporate donations and that  political fund-raising should be made more transparent,  Keidanren decided to abolish its political-donations role.  Keidanren's position is that political parties should depend on  government subsidies and private donations, while corporate  donations should be reviewed, or even abolished, after a certain  period of time.    With such a trend of the times, there is less and less  significance in passing along political donations. From now on,  Keidanren's influence should be based on its power to implement  its proposals. Therefore, I will stick with Mr. Hiraiwa's  decision to abolish Keidanren's political-donations role.  Moreover, to study how business and politics should be, I am  planning to set up a new committee within Keidanren. It will  called the Committee on Business and Politics.  <H5>  The Influence of Japan's Largest Manufacturer </H5>   [Sato] Your remark that implementing its proposals is the  source of Keidanren's influence has deep significance.    When we look at the history of Keidanren, we realize that  each time Keidanren has exerted great influence, its  chairmanship was always assumed by a business leader from a  major company that had a great influence on the Japanese economy  of the time. In other words, if the said company sets an  example to others by promptly translating Keidanren's idea into  action, Keidanren's other member companies are forced to follow  suit. Therefore, it is certain that your background will help  strengthen the power of execution not merely of Keidanren, but  of the whole business world. You come from the automobile  industry, one of the key Japanese industries of today.  Moreover, you belong to Japan's largest manufacturing company.    [Toyoda] Japan is a nation without natural resources.  Therefore, it imports materials, processes them, and exports the  resulting products in order to earn dollars. With the money  earned, Japan can buy food and oil from other countries. This  is the foundation of Japan, at the center of which is the  nation's manufacturing industry.    Personally, I do not feel that I am chairing Keidanren as a  representative of the automobile industry. I simply think that  the automobile industry's turn to take the chair has come  because of the needs of the times. Seen from the viewpoint of  industrial changes, Keidanren's top post should preferably be  assumed by a business leader coming from an industry that stands  half a step behind the leading edge, because unity and consensus  is forged more easily within the organization under a leader  coming from such an industry. It so happened that I have been  working for an industry that is half a step behind the leading  edge.    Of course, having a chairman from the automobile industry is  a plus for the organization in some respects. The automobile  industry has always walked in step with consumers. My  experiences may be useful in developing the theme of living  together in harmony with consumers, which will be the core of  Keidanren's future policies.    Let me add a few more words as the leader of a company that  bears the brunt of attack in the Japan-U.S. trade friction. Our  company has been ahead of the government in trying to ease trade  friction. When U.S. President George Bush came to Japan in  January 1992, we committed ourselves to increasing our purchases  of foreign auto parts and trying to sell more imported vehicles  in Japan. We have fulfilled our pledges. If you ask me,  automobiles have been raised as an issue in the Japan-U.S.  Framework trade talks, but there have been no problems in talks  between companies at the industry level. The problem is one of  macroeconomics rather than microeconomics.    [Sato] Let me now ask you about specific policy proposals.  What kind of new goals does the "Toyoda's Keidanren" have in  mind?    [Toyoda] Our first goal is deregulation. Since March,  Keidanren has announced a series of deregulation proposals for  each area. We put all these proposals together and submitted a  report to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on 13 May. We will now  strongly urge the concerned authorities, including the  government's office for the promotion of administrative reform,  to put them into practice.    In fact, deregulation is not likely to be implemented if we  continue to leave it to government officials to examine  deregulation plans and monitor their implementation at their own  discretion. This is why a third-party monitoring body composed  chiefly of individuals from the private sector is going to be  set up in accordance with the law. We are tentatively calling  it the "Administrative Reform Committee" and are planning to  implement deregulation through it. I have already asked  previous Chairman Hiraiwa to head the Committee.    Administrative reform, which is directly connected with  deregulation, is also an important issue. When companies try to  do something new, they generally meet strong administrative  resistance. We cannot achieve our goal as long as  interministerial barriers are not abolished. As an example, let  me explain the case of the Export Inspection and Design Council,  in which I am involved. This advisory body to the international  trade and industry minister still has many posts that were  created a long time ago when Japanese export products had to be  examined carefully because of poor quality. I am really  surprised that even a ministry like the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI] still preserves such  posts. However, if the ministry decides to abolish the  regulation related to export inspection, it will have to  relocate about 2,000 officials elsewhere. The fact is that it  can hardly eliminate the regulation immediately.    Deregulation inevitably inflicts pain not merely on  ministries and agencies but on the industry as well. Despite  the pain, we should promote deregulation. Otherwise, Japan will  fall into discredit with the world.    Once deregulation measures are implemented, the Japanese  market will be opened, bringing about a decline in prices. In  other words, we are convinced that deregulation will serve the  best interests of the Japanese people. To make our conviction  known to our overseas partners, we should make greater efforts  to promote deregulation.    [Sato] The Japan-U.S. framework trade talks have made clear  that Japan is not trusted by the world, right?    [Toyoda] I think that, when the bilateral framework talks  collapsed in February, what collapsed in particular was the  relationship of trust between Japan and the United States.  Although the United States expected that Japan would implement  income tax cuts for three consecutive years to stimulate  domestic demand, the Japanese side came up with a plan to cut  income taxes for just one year. Moreover, Japan was unable to  give specific figures to explain the impact of the yearly income  tax cut on the Japanese economy. Under such circumstances, a  relationship of trust can hardly be established between the two  countries.    [Sato] It is certain that the government's decision was  influenced by the Finance Ministry's firm resolution to accept  income tax cuts only in exchange for an increase in the  consumption tax to cover the loss in revenue. The problem is  that Japan passed up a precious opportunity to stimulate its  sluggish economy because of the Finance Ministry, which strongly  put forth such an argument from the very beginning.    [Toyoda] I once said to former Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa: "If we compare the government to a company, the  Finance Ministry is equivalent to the general accounting  division. If there is no prospect of good business, the  general accounting division would never say that the company can  spend as much money as it wants. However, the decision does not  lie with the general accounting division, but with the company  president, which is you, Prime Minister Hosokawa." Then, I  added: "Let's revive the national economy first by implementing  income tax cuts. We can expect extra tax revenue once the  economy picks up. The president should not leave the decision  to the general accounting division. He must decide by himself."    Unfortunately, all my advice was in vain. If the prime  minister had followed my advice, Japan would have not incurred  the mistrust of the United States. I really regret this.    [Sato] You may say so, but the problem is that Japan's top  leader changes too frequently. The general accounting division  probably exercised precaution against a possible change in  government (laughter). What do you think of the current  political chaos?    [Toyoda] It is very difficult to foresee future political  developments because Japanese politics is now in a transition  period. Starting with the Diet deliberations for the fiscal  1994 budget, the government must tackle a pile of pending  domestic and international issues, such as tax reform and the  G-7 summit meeting. Therefore, I want both the ruling coalition  and the opposition to proceed with the Diet deliberations in all  seriousness without producing a political vacuum, and to  cooperate with each other in dealing with the pending domestic  and international issues. Sorry for repeating myself, but I  would like to remind the government that if Japan disappoints  the United States again with its tax reform plan, it will  completely lose the confidence of its partner.    With respect to political realignment, the industrial world  is not in a position to say much, because this issue should  reflect the will of the people. However, I think it would be  desirable for Japan to have a political system of alternating  governments. I have no idea about the ideal number of political  parties. At least, however, I think that it is a problem to have  so many small parties, as we do now. There is no basis to the  argument that Japan must establish a two-party system like that  of the United States. However, it is no good to have 10 or 12  political parties.    [Sato] Concerning Japan-U.S. trade friction, what,  specifically, are your thoughts on plans to cut Japan's trade  surplus?    [Toyoda] Japan first has to achieve economic growth led by  domestic demand in a domestic economic recovery, that is,  through a revised and expanded public works program. We would  then promote a structural reform of the Japanese economy through  deregulation and market opening. There is no alternative to  putting these two sound proposals into practice.    It is also necessary to correct the value of the yen against  the dollar to an appropriate level that corresponds to the real  state of the Japanese economy. In my opinion, the Japanese  economy can tolerate appreciation of the yen to the 110-yen  level against the dollar. The ideal level would be around 120  yen to the dollar. Many companies, which recently announced  their performance for the past year, have said that they have  projected an exchange rate of 105 yen against the dollar for the  next term. They are all dispirited because of the gloomy  future. I think the 110-yen level is the maximum handicap that  Japan can overcome somehow or other by making strenuous efforts.    [Sato] Regarding the bilateral framework talks, there was a  long dispute over the question of whether or not to set  numerical targets as a political pledge. Seen from a  macroeconomics viewpoint, setting numerical targets is not  considered necessarily a minus for Japan.    [Toyoda] Numerical targets, which are directly connected to  managed trade, conflict with the spirit of GATT. Therefore, it  is not possible to endorse such an idea. Meanwhile, it is  certain that Japan will not be able to win the confidence of the  United States, as long as it does not clearly indicate its  policy to its partner.    Japan and the United States had previously agreed to apply  objective criteria to measure progress in sectoral talks, which  is part of the framework trade negotiations. Both sides had  agreed to use objective criteria, and not numerical targets.  However, the problem is that once the yardstick is fixed,  concrete figures can easily be obtained anytime through  measurement. I think Japan and the United States should bear  this in mind when they try to restore a relationship of mutual  trust.  <H5>  No Change in Nation Based on Processing Trade </H5>   [Sato] The upsurge of the yen against the dollar is fueling  fears over a hollowing out of Japanese industry. What kind of  measures are you considering to cope with this situation?    [Toyoda] A hollowing out of industry worries me the most.  Japan is based on processing trade, and this will not change in  the future. We must not forget that Japan is a country that  works hard and exports the fruits of its efforts, namely  high-value-added products. Therefore, if industry hollows out,  Japan is finished. Having said that, what is to be done?    First, industrial restructuring should be done quickly to  protect the international competitiveness of domestic  industries. Second, new industries should be created.    Concerning the creation of new industries, I think that  nothing is more pressing than improving the educational system.  Japan has heard the cry a number of times that there was a  crisis of hollowing out. Each time, Japan successfully created  new industries. Education is the source of new industries.    However, of present concern is the recent lag in education,  particularly in the teaching of science and technology. One of  the causes is the poor condition of the facilities at university  engineering departments. But I think that another problem is  corporate attitude. The corporate attitude on hiring has  perhaps been one of educating people once they enter the  company. Individuals with a master's degree are welcomed, but  those with doctorates are not needed. Therefore, companies  usually try to recruit postgraduate students right after they  have completed the master's course. This is not an environment  for bringing up creative people.    I think Keidanren can lend a hand here to help improve the  situation.    [Sato] Did your appointment to Keidanren's top post bring on  a change in your company's behavior? Toyota Motor Corp. was  once noted for what has been called the "Toyota Monroe  doctrine." Toyota used to withdraw into its shell.    [Toyoda] When I became chairman of the company, I completely  left the company's business in the charge of the new president  [Toyoda's brother]. I did not give any specific instruction to  my company after I was appointed Keidanren chairman.    As a matter of course, I want my company not to hesitate to  feel the pain of deregulation, because in some way, Toyota is  also living in peace within the framework of government  regulations. Will deregulation mean a conflict of interests  between Toyota and its partners? Or will Toyota try to change  its corporate culture to seek common interests with its  partners? That will be the problem. For the moment, I have  already warned our dealers and our auto parts suppliers that  Toyota will probably annoy them in the near future (laughter).    As for Toyota's behavior, I have been worried that my  company  might exercise severe restraint in its behavior because it  produced a Keidanren chairman, and that it might consequently  lose its vitality. On the other hand, I have also been worried  that my company might take an attitude of arrogant superiority  because it produced a Keidanren chairman, and that it might lose  its philosophy of working hard to provide good products at lower  prices.    Fortunately, I recently understood that there was no need  for  such apprehension, after observing the behavior of our  employees. It may sound paradoxical, but the current recession  is turning out to be advantageous to Toyota in this case. The  Japanese economic situation is so serious that our employees  cannot be in a festive mood just because their chairman was  appointed to Keidanren's top post (laughter).    [Sato] We understand that you decided the lineup of vice  chairmen in the new Keidanren after consulting with former  Chairman Hiraiwa. Do you think you made the best choice?    [Toyoda] For now, this is the best lineup. If possible, I  had wanted the four outgoing vice chairmen to remain. However,  that is expecting too much, because I have to follow Keidanren's  bylaws. I believe I made the best choice under the existing  bylaws.    If we consider that Keidanren consists of major industries  and companies, however, the securities and construction  industries are also needed. Considering the structure of  industry, I would like to request that those two industries join  us at some point.    Many people seem to find it strange that the steel industry  is missing from the new lineup. This is because I have asked  recently departed Vice Chairman Hiroshi Saito (Nippon Steel  Corp. chairman) to take up another important post, namely that  of chairman of Keidanren's council. There is no vice chairman  from the steel industry simply because my first consideration  was keeping a balanced representation.  <H5>  I Will Be a Chairman of the Toshio Doko Type </H5>   [Sato] Do you have any specific Keidanren chairman in mind  as your ideal?    [Toyoda] Personally, I am not very conscious of it, but  since I am from a manufacturing company, I should bear some  resemblance to the two former chairmen from Toshiba Corp.:  Taizo Ishizaka [who served as Keidanren's second chairman, from  1956 to 1968] and Toshio Doko [who served as the fourth  chairman, from 1974 to 1980]. As I do not know Mr. Ishizaka  very well, I feel closer to Mr. Doko. However, in terms of  personality, the person I know the best is Mr. Hiraiwa. So I  feel strongly inclined to follow Mr. Hiraiwa's pattern, because  I have a long acquaintance with him and because I am very  familiar with his ideas and remarks as Keidanren chairman.    As for Mr. Yoshiro Inayama of Nippon Steel Corp. [who served  as the fifth chairman, from 1980 to 1986], he had a strong  tendency to favor managed trade, such that he was even dubbed  "Mr. Cartel." There was always a conflict of opinions between  us. Each time I objected to him, he always said, "You may say  so, but I and the Prime Minister are the only Japanese that  really have the best interests of the nation at heart. You  fellows, you do nothing but think of your own companies." I  have now come to believe that there are many things to be  learned from his arrogant remarks.    [Sato] You said at the beginning that you have been told by  honorary Chairman Eiji Toyoda to take good care of yourself.  Are you still playing golf to maintain your health?    [Toyoda] These days, my score is always 90 or more. I get  into my stride on the front nine, but I go off my game on the  back nine because my stamina gives out.    A few days ago, I shot a 42 on the front nine. Although I  thought I would easily finish with a total of less than 90, I  shot a 48 on the back nine. I usually explain to my golf  partners that I am adjusting my score on the back nine to make  my partners win the game because I am now a shrewd merchant  (laughter).    [Sato] That's funny. This is why Mr. Eishiro Saito [who  served as Keidanren's sixth chairman, from 1986 to 1990]  jokingly said that you are like the chief of the secretarial  section, who makes every effort not to win the game when he  plays with important persons with whom his company has dealings.    [Toyoda] But now, even if I give my whole heart to the game,  my score differs little from the one of the secretarial section  chief (laughter).</p>

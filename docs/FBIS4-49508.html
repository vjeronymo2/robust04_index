			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Xu Changyin (1776 7022 6892)] </F>   [Text] Washington, 4 May (XINHUA) -- More than 700  Chinese students and scholars studying in the United States and  other countries recently wrote a joint letter to U.S. President  Bill Clinton, appealing to him to unconditionally extend the  Most Favored Nation (MFN) trading status to China. At a hearing  held by the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee today, the  students made their letter public.    In their letter, these students and scholars said:  Withdrawing China's MFN status would not only hurt the Chinese  people's interests but also American enterprises' business  interests and opportunities in Chinese markets as well as  American general interests in Asia.    They "firmly support the unconditional renewal of China's  MFN  status" and held that "the MFN should not be linked to human  rights."    A total of 722 Chinese students and scholars signed their  names on the letter. They are mainly from several universities  in the United States. Some students and scholars are studying  in other foreign countries.</p>

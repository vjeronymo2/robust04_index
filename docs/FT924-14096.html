			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Peugeot cuts car dealer margins PEUGEOT Talbot is joining Rover and Vauxhall in cutting its dealer margins on new car sales to 10 per cent. The move, effective from Monday next week, will leave only Ford among the UK 'big four' non-Japanese producers still giving its dealers margins of between 16 per cent and 17 per cent. As with the Rover and Vauxhall margin reductions, the move is expected to have little effect on the prices customers pay for its cars. New list prices from next Monday will be, on average, 5.5 per cent lower, but dealers' discretion to discount will have been reduced by a similar amount. The French vehicle group's wholly owned UK importer said last night: 'The intention is to bring some sanity to the market. All the research has shown that motorists do not like having to search out big discounts, and always having the suspicion that they might have got a better deal down the road.' Dealers were told of the restructuring at meetings last week and appear to support the move. It is also expected to create a more orderly used-car market for Peugeots, with stronger resale values. So far Ford, the UK market leader, shows no sign of wishing to restructure its dealer margins, insisting that larger margins give dealers greater operating flexibility. Meanwhile BMW (GB), the German executive carmaker's wholly owned UK importer, is understood to have told its dealers that it proposes to raise prices by 6 per cent and reduce dealer margins by 2 per cent from the start of next year, to compensate for the devaluation of sterling against the D-Mark. The proposal follows a warning that BMW would need price rises of up to 14 per cent to compensate fully for currency shifts, but that market conditions made a rise of such a size unrealistic.</p>

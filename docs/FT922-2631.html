			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Business pessimism wipes 2.5 per cent off Nikkei PESSIMISM carried over from last Friday's tankan, or quarterly business survey from the Bank of Japan, and the Nikkei index fell below 17,000 for the first time since April 22, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average lost 430.45, or 2.5 per cent, to 16,953.23. It opened at the day's high of 17,339.42 and dropped to a low of 16,926.23 just before the close on light arbitrage selling and small-lot profit-taking by dealers. Volume plunged to 200m shares from the 764m registered on Friday, which was the expiration day for June options and futures. Buying by institutions, which have indicated interest in purchasing at lower levels, remained small-scale. A fund manager at Dai-ichi Life, describing the herd mentality of Japanese fund managers, said: 'The cash ratio of our investments has increased, but no-one wants to be the first in committing money.' Declines overwhelmed advances by 884 to 113, with 141 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks retreated 22.89, or 1.7 per cent, to 1,305.47, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.00 to 1,015.17. Further deterioration of business confidence among company managers, as indicated in last week's tankan, left investors worried over the uncertainty of an early economic recovery. Comments by the Bank of Japan after the release of the tankan, denying the need for a change in monetary policy, failed to reassure investors. Traders stressed the need for monetary action by financial authorities. Mr Peter Johnson at Baring Securities said: 'The market now depends on a demonstration by the authorities of their understanding of how weak the economy is.' Turmoil on the political front also added to the nervousness, as opposition members of the House of Representatives handed in their resignations in protest of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's handling of the government's bill to send Japanese forces on United Nations peacekeeping missions. Dealers and investment trusts unloaded speculative 'theme' stocks, bought for quick profits. Meiji Milk Products, the most active issue of the day, weakened Y22 to Y971, and Morinaga Milk Industry receded Y16 to Y874. High-technology blue chips fell on selling by investment trusts and foreign investors. NEC dropped Y22 to a low for the year of Y861, while Fujitsu slipped Y13 to Y620 and Hitachi Y18 to Y765. Investors stepped up selling of bank shares. Daiwa Securities said movements of bank stocks were the key to fluctuations in the Nikkei index. 'The index will fall sharply if the market sees another heavy selling of bank shares as in April,' said a Daiwa analyst. Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank declined Y30 to Y1,260 and Mitsubishi Bank retreated Y50 to Y1,650. In Osaka, the OSE average shed 377.30 to 19,957.42 in volume of 7.3m shares. Roundup KUALA LUMPUR stood out as the rest of the Pacific Rim got off to a slow start, dampened by the fall in Tokyo. Bombay's brokers boycotted trading because several companies refused to transfer shares sold by Harshad Mehta, the central figure in India's latest, and worst, financial scandal. KUALA LUMPUR saw small-investor interest in the afternoon following steady institutional morning buying, and the KLSE composite index ended 9.62, or 1.6 per cent, higher at 600.17. NEW ZEALAND eased after late falls in Carter Holt Harvey and Fletcher Challenge. Carter Holt slipped 9 cents to NZDollars 2.56 in light volume, while Fletcher Challenge lost 6 cents to NZDollars 3.56 in moderate volume. The NZSE-40 index closed 11.05 down at 1,532.11, in moderate turnover of NZDollars 16.6m after NZDollars 23.1m on Friday. Magnum Corp continued its recent rally, firming a cent to NZDollars 1.09 and taking its rise over the last three sessions to 6.9 per cent following the appointment of Mr James Strong as its new chief executive. MANILA, closed for a holiday last Friday, suffered from last week's decline of Philippine Long Distance Telephone (PLDT) on the American Stock Exchange. The composite index finished 5.39 lower at 1,575.56. PLDT tumbled 90 pesos to 1105 pesos. In the US, it had recovered from last Thursday's Dollars 40 7/8 to Dollars 41 3/8 on Friday, but this still compared with Dollars 43 1/8 on Wednesday. BANGKOK continued to concentrate on property stocks after last week's general surge, the SET index ending 2.68 stronger at 743.37. Bangkok Land topped the actives list and closed Bt1 higher at Bt148. AUSTRALIA declined in dull trading, the All Ordinaries index shedding 4.2 to 1,647.1 in turnover of ADollars 143m, after ADollars 196m. Gold shares, however, moved forward in line with the higher bullion price. Newcrest Mining rose 3 cents to 68 cents and Placer Pacific gained 2 cents to ADollars 2.57. TAIWAN finished lower in moderate trading. The weighted index lost 3.64 to 4,672.49 in turnover of TDollars 38.54bn, after Saturday's TDollars 46.33bn. SEOUL retreated as investors took profits after two days of gains. The composite index dipped 0.99 to 579.81 in turnover of Won382.5bn. SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index was up 3.01 to 1,519.88, after having kept to a tight range for most of the day.</p>

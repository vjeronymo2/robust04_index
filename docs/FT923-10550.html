			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Whipped-up taste for sour cream - John Thornhill explains how Sainsbury's turned creme  fraiche into a smash hit with shoppers Catherine Zeta Jones smiles seductively at the camera and purrs: 'It's irresistible.' The actress, who is the sweetheart of the tabloids after her performance in the television series The Darling Buds of May, is describing the attractions of creme fraiche in the latest of a series of 'celebrity recipe' advertisements run by J. Sainsbury, Britain's biggest grocer. She has demonstrated how to make a fresh fruit brulee using one of Sainsbury's new products, creme fraiche, described as having the smooth texture of double cream with a pleasant sharp flavour. The recipe seems to have tickled the taste buds of the nation and has been cooked for countless dinner parties as hosts attempt to beat the Joneses with their culinary skills. But the product also illustrates the marketing power of the big grocery chains and their ability to change the nation's eating habits. Sainsbury's is coy about releasing sales figures for fear of giving its rivals sensitive information. But Mr Tom Vyner, managing director, describes them as 'astronomic'. 'If a brand manager developed a product that sold Pounds 1m in the first month and Pounds 12m in the first year he would be happy', he says. Creme fraiche is selling more than that, he adds. Each year, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Safeway launch more than 1,000 own-label lines apiece and are powerfully placed to control a product's development from initial conception to in-store promotion. Their position in the market gives them valuable knowledge of consumer spending patterns and increasingly pitches them into competition with the big consumer products companies, such as Nestle. Last year, Sainsbury's spent Pounds 15m supporting its brand image in television and press advertising. Its arch rival, Tesco, laid out Pounds 24.9m, outspending every other consumer product brand in the UK. It, too, has created new markets almost overnight and cites the example of free-range chickens backed by television advertisements featuring a clucking Dudley Moore. Ideas for new products stem from many different sources, according to Mr Robin Whitbread, Sainsbury's marketing director. The company's buyers visit stores abroad to see what sells well. Its suppliers suggest possible new lines and its market research department sifts piles of data. 'We are looking for what sells in large volumes abroad but does not sell in the UK,' he says. The idea for selling creme fraiche came from one of its buyers who visited D'Isigny, a French food manufacturer in Normandy. Sainsbury's conducted trials to assess whether creme fraiche was acceptable to the British palate using a panel of 100 volunteer tasters. 'We thought that the product was absolutely right for the JS customer and complemented the rest of our dairy range' says Whitbread. Last year, creme fraiche was launched at selected Sainsbury's stores under D'Isigny's own label. Initially, it was promoted solely by means of shelf-edge labels describing where the product came from and how the French used it. Once Sainsbury's became convinced that the product had mass appeal, it decided to launch its own-label creme fraiche last March. The company's designers created the package and wrote an accompanying recipe leaflet. A press release attracted comment from food writers and magazine advertisements were also placed. Creme fraiche was launched in 170 of its 320 stores at a specially-reduced price of 69p for a 200ml tub. The regular price was set at 75p or 4p less than the D'Isigny branded product, which was subsequently withdrawn. After an encouraging response, creme fraiche was extended to all Sainsbury's stores and in May the company began supporting it with television advertisements. 'The celebrity is important but the food is the real hero,' Whitbread says. 'The campaign works both from a strategic and a tactical point of view. It emphasises both the values of the JS brand but also the attractions of individual products.' Some of the celebrity recipe advertisements have generated more than tenfold increases in sales of particular products and necessitate close liaison across all functions of Sainsbury's business: the buying department has to step up orders of related ingredients; the distribution experts have to push more products through the system; and the store staff have to know about various promotions to answer customer inquiries. Over the past 20 years, Sainsbury's has increased its number of lines by four times tempting the British middle classes with new products as varied as mangoes and pink champagne. The company claims it was also the first grocery chain to introduce fromage frais in 1984 helping prepare the palate for creme fraiche. Total UK sales of fromage frais are now Pounds 88m a year. But new food products and concepts do not always work. For example, Sainsbury's was disappointed with the results of its first experiment with ready-made chilled meals in 1985-86 - although it has since expanded its range with greater success. Other retailers would attest to the truth of that remark. Although Sainsbury's claims it was the first to sell creme fraiche in the UK market, the product briefly appeared on Marks and Spencer's shelves four years ago. 'We think it was ahead of its time,' the company said, adding that it was likely to reappear in its stores over the coming months as a result of its success 'elsewhere'.</p>

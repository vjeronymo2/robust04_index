			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> GOETZ EARLY RELEASE PLEA DENIED  </P> <P> Subway gunman Bernhard Goetz, two months into a one-year jail sentence on an  illegal gun possession conviction, was denied early release today by the state  Board of Parole.  </P> <P> A short statement issued by the board said releasing Goetz early "would  deprecate the seriousness of the crime and undermine respect for the law." The  board's decision means Goetz will likely have to serve his full one-year  sentence, minus any time off for good behavior. Goetz began serving his  sentence Jan. 13. He was convicted on the gun charge in connection with the  Dec. 22, 1984, shooting of four black youths on a New York City subway train.  Goetz is white.  </P></p>

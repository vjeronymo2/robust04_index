			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["bhr" report: "PLO Chairman 'Arafat a Guest of </F> Daimler-Benz in Stuttgart"]    [Text] Stuttgart, 2 May -- Two days before the planned  signing of the autonomy agreement with Israel, PLO Chairman  'Arafat expressed the hope in Stuttgart that the Palestinians  might learn from the experiences of the Germans, because the  Germans reconstructed their economy from scratch after World War  II. 'Arafat, who had come to Stuttgart on Monday [2 May] upon  invitation by the Daimler-Benz AG, said that since the entire  infrastructure in the occupied territories has been destroyed,  Palestine must "start from scratch."    Edzard Reuter, chairman of the Daimler-Benz AG board of  directors, said that European companies are willing to make  their contribution to ensuring peace in the Middle East. Peace  will last only if there is economic and social stability in the  entire region. "In the long run political peace can be achieved  and safeguarded only through strong and resistant economic  networks," Reuter said. It is to be hoped that in the Middle  East there will soon be peaceful coexistence, which includes the  Palestinian's self-determination just as well as Israel's secure  existence. The Daimler-Benz chief paid tribute to the PLO  chairman's credit in unerringly working toward giving peace  concrete shape, "against all resistance and despite all  setbacks, confronted by intrigues, violence, and terror."  Reuter promised 'Arafat a development study drawn up by the  corporations' subsidiary Dornier Management Consulting. The  study is to show how transportation and traffic systems can be  expanded across borders. It is also to continue information  about how border-crossing cooperation can be implemented in the  field of water supplies and telecommunication. Daimler-Benz  also wants to train Palestinian managers and craftsmen. 'Arafat  was particularly enthusiastic about Reuter's promise that the  corporation will finance the construction and operation of a  kindergarten for small Palestinian children in need. "We do not  want to talk about gigantomaniac projects," Reuter said, after  he had received his guest at Echterdingen airport, "but about  individual steps that provide progress to the people in the  Middle East."    Talks with Israeli Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign Minister  Peres in Israel in September 1992 obviously encouraged Reuter's  intention to invite 'Arafat to Stuttgart. Reuter expressed what  the corporation hopes to achieve by that as follows: "We do not  want to wait passively for the peace process in the Middle East,  but we want to play an active role in it." In addition, the  corporation wants to open up market opportunities in the Middle  East for itself -- in an area, whose number of inhabitants will  rise from the current 103 million to 125 million within a few  years. In the conversation with 'Arafat, Reuter said that the  Middle East needs political and economic managers so that one of  the world's most attractive economic regions can be established  there.    This February Daimler-Benz opened a corporation  representation in Jerusalem and Cairo. Reuter announced that  the company wants to develop a constructive network of business  relations in the Middle East. Some of the things that are  produced by the four company sectors of Daimler-Benz, was shown  to 'Arafat in the yard of the corporation headquarters in  Stuttgart-Moehringen: passenger cars, industrial vehicles,  Airbus planes, helicopters, and microelectronic parts, as well  as a model of the ICE [Intercity Express] high-speed train.    The corporation coordinated the PLO chairman's visit with  the  Chancellor's Office in Bonn as well as with Foreign Minister  Kinkel and FRG Economics Minister Rexrodt. The meeting in  Stuttgart was preceded by German managers' contacts with  politicians and companies in Israel, Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, and  Syria. The company has Social Democratic Party [SDP] politician  Wischnewski ("Ben Wisch") as Middle East adviser, who was also  present in Stuttgart on Monday. 'Arafat was accompanied by Mr.  Qaddumi, the PLO's expert for foreign policy and economy,  Executive Committee Member Nashashibi, and PLO representative to  Bonn Franji. A luncheon in the Baden-Wuerttemberg capital was  also attended by Minister-President Teufel and Mayor Rommel. In  the evening Teufel hosted a reception for 'Arafat in the New  Palace in Stuttgart, the former residence of the Wuerttemberg  kings.    The unusual event of an economic corporation inviting the  PLO  chief and thus stepping on foreign policy territory was  commented by Daimler-Benz general manager Kleiner by saying:  "We want creative togetherness of politics and economy while  not calling the primacy of politics into question."    'Arafat expressed confidence about the signing of the  autonomy agreement for Gaza and Jericho. Even though  difficulties still have to be overcome, "where there is a will  there is a way." The PLO chairman described his role in the  negotiations as follows: "It takes two to tango." He cannot  yet give the date when he will return to Jerusalem, Jericho, or  Gaza. This depends on when the Israelis will withdraw.</p>

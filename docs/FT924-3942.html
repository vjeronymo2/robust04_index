			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Spring Ram shares fall again THE SHARE price of Spring Ram Corporation, the kitchens and bathrooms group, fell 11 1/2 p yesterday to 89p following a press report on share selling and a downgraded profit forecast. The group's market value has collapsed from about Pounds 570m to Pounds 325m since news emerged on November 6 of false accounting at its Balterley Bathrooms subsidiary. Yesterday's report in the Daily Mail suggested that British Steel pension fund had sold a tranche of shares. This turned out to be untrue. County NatWest said it had placed 8.2m shares on Wednesday at 98p. 'We did it in six minutes and it was oversubscribed,' said Mr Angus Phaure, building materials analyst. However, he had downgraded his profit forecast for this year from Pounds 42.5m to Pounds 40m, before exceptional items. These will include additional losses of up to Pounds 3.5m at Balterley offset by a Pounds 5.8m gain on the sale of unused ACT capacity. A pre-tax figure of Pounds 40m would represent a 6.5 per cent increase on last year's Pounds 37.6m. Asked about current trading, Mr Stuart Greenwood, finance director, said the group was operating in tough markets. 'December is very important to us and all of that is before us.' Over the next couple of weeks directors will meet shareholders and analysts to answer questions about Balterley, where a recurring question has been: why is the loss so big - Pounds 5.6m in a subsidiary that only turned over Pounds 10m? Mr Greenwood said that the number was a maximum and the problem went back to 1989. He said the figure would include all the factors leading to an overstatement of profits: stock quantities, stock values, invoices, accruals and so on. Balterley had apparently been building up stock rapidly - from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 3.85m during 1990 and to more than Pounds 7m by the end of last year, but the build-up was illusory. Questions may also be asked about share sales by two directors in April. The company has said it thought the Balterley problem had been dealt with by then. The much greater extent of the falsification was not discovered until May.</p>

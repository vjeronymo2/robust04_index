			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Security alert disrupts London trains Several main-line stations in London were closed yesterday and services in Kent were disrupted after a security alert, Conner Middelmann writes. Investigations centred on the line to London from Sevenoaks, but nothing was found in searches lasting most of the day. The stations reopened in the afternoon but Network SouthEast said it was too early to say whether service would be back to normal for this morning's rush hour. 'We would advise people to listen in to their local radio stations to find out what the latest situation is,' a spokesman said. Network SouthEast said a caller using a recognised IRA code word telephoned at about 4.30am yesterday, prompting the closure of dozens of stations in the the south-eastern division. Buses were used to ferry passengers from outlying stations to central London. A bomb exploded on a Network SouthEast line near Woking, Surrey, last Tuesday, and two unexploded devices were found at nearby Brookwood station on Thursday.</p>

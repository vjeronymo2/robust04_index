Dmitriyev, St. Petersburg State Technical </F> University, St. Petersburg, Russia]    [Abstract] The surface temperature of gallium arsenide  crystals was determined when they were irradiated by laser  pulses of a threshold density. Changes of the polished surface  morphology occur at this temperature. This temperature turned  out to be about 900 K, which is significantly below the GaAs  melting temperature. Methods, based on studying relaxation of  the irradiated crystal transient conductivity were employed for  the temperature measurements. This involved applying the fact  that the transition temperature from impurity conductivity to  intrinsic conductivity can be taken as a reference temperature,  and the condition that when the temperature is exceeded during  irradiation, it is accompanied by appearance of a long lasting  component on the relaxation curve of the transient conductivity.  Using a set of crystals with a different concentration it was  possible to determine the temperature on the surface at a  particular irradiation density.

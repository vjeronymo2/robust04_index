The news analyst says:    Recently the Japanese Foreign Minister, Tsutomu Hata raved  that if the DPRK "refuses again to accept inspection or takes an  irresolute attitude," Japan would "sternly counter it," alleging  that the DPRK "is going to make nuclear weapons" and "is  suspected of having one or two nuclear bombs."    His outburst came at a time when the DPRK and the United  States have agreed on immediate steps of simultaneous action and  the third round of talks between them is soon to be held. This  shows the Japanese reactionaries intend to attain at any cost  their sinister purpose of accelerating their nuclear armament on  the pretext of the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK.    Japan's nuclear armament and overseas aggrandizement have  reached a serious danger line.    Japan has stockpiled a colossal amount of nuclear material  and laid a material and technical foundation for the manufacture  of nuclear weapons.    With Japan's nuclear armament presenting a nuclear threat in  actuality, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula cannot  be realised, and even if it is realised, it cannot ensure peace  and security in this part of the world.    Judging from facts, we conclude that however hard we may  strive to denuclearize the Korean peninsula, it cannot be  realised and, accordingly, the inter-Korean joint declaration on  denuclearization might be reduced to a mere sheet of paper.    Then we will have to reconsider our position toward the  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and the inter-Korean  joint declaration will have to be nullified.    In case the Japanese authorities' rash remarks worsen the  problem, Japan will be wholly to blame for it.    The Japanese authorities will have to account for their each  word and deed and dearly pay for it.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Affirming Pak-Iran relations"] </F>   [Text] The speaker of the Iranian Majles (parliament) 'Ali  Akbar Nateq-Nuri, while addressing a special session of the  National Assembly Monday condemned what he described as the  'selective morality' of the West, saying it wanted to deprive  the Muslim world of nuclear technology while closing its eyes to  the nuclear military capability developed by Israel. Speaker  Nuri also assured the Pakistani legislators of Iran's unstinted  support to the Kashmiris right of self-determination. In this  regard he called for a peaceful and just solution of the problem  in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions.  'Pakistan can rely on Iran's principled stance on Kashmir,' he  is reported to have declared, perhaps clarifying Iranian  position which came under fire after Tehran along with Beijing  asked Islamabad to withdraw its resolution pertaining to  Kashmiris' human rights violations, in Geneva.    It did come as a shock to an average Pakistani that Tehran  had played a role in this context and drew a reaction which  could not be called favourable, to say the least. Speaker  Nuri's assertion on Monday should set at rest fears in this  country that Tehran, in an attempt to cosy up to New Delhi  primarily for economic reasons, might proportionately have  distanced itself from Islamabad. Iran has been Pakistan's  friend for long and if certain reports are to be believed,  during Shah's period, Islamabad's primary source of information  on Israel. Diplomacy is a dicey game and involves juxtaposing  conflicting configuration of forces. Amidst everything,  principles notwithstanding, the national interest reigns  supreme. The kinds of pressures a country has to put up with in  fine-tuning a policy often remains hidden from public view.  Speaker Nuri was evidently voicing his country's policy when he  castigated human rights violations in Indian-occupied Kashmir.  Together, there is much that the two countries can achieve.  Iran could benefit from Pakistan in the field of civil  engineering and conversely, Pakistan could do with the Iranian  expertise in setting up oil refineries. As founder members of  the Regional Cooperation for Development (RCD), renamed ECO  (Economic Cooperation Organisation), there are many areas in  which the two countries can tap each other's potential. It is  perhaps time that we recast our approach to diplomatic  relations, purging it of the sentimentality one would normally  attach to personal relations.</p>

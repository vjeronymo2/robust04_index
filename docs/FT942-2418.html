			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Nuclear arms admission stirs Tokyo row The Japanese government is struggling to contain a controversy provoked by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's official acknowledgment that Japan has the capacity to make nuclear weapons. Mr Hata's remark, in reply to a parliamentary question, drew an instant attack from the opposition Liberal Democratic party, whose leaders are considering whether to launch a vote of no-confidence against the minority coalition. This first public recognition that Japan is able to make nuclear bombs challenges a taboo imposed by Japan's wartime experiences and its neighbours' suspicions - repeatedly denied - that it might develop nuclear weapons in response to a serious threat. Mr Hata said that Japan had the capacity to make nuclear weapons but had not done so because of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the self-imposed three non-nuclear principles of not owning, making or allowing the import of nuclear weapons. Mr Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic party, said: 'How could the prime minister make such comments when every nation is making efforts to resolve North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development programme?' Japan's world-beating technological achievements might make it more surprising if it could not make an nuclear bomb. However, Mr Hata's announcement created enough of a stir for Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, the government spokesman, to qualify the prime minister's announcement. Mr Kumagai stressed Japan's unshaken adherence to its non-nuclear principles and said Japan's use of nuclear power was limited to peaceful purposes, regardless of whether it could make weapons.</p>

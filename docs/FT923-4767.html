			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Hawthorn Leslie back in the black Lower debt in the wake of its restructuring agreement, together with a turnround in mobile telephone operations were behind the return to the black at Hawthorn Leslie in the first half. Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 were Pounds 434,000 (losses of Pounds 9.48m). Sales were Pounds 25.9m (Pounds 66.8m). The company is focusing on mobile telecommunications and HL Communications achieved profit of Pounds 2.2m before interest and tax (Pounds 1.37m deficit). The comparisons have been restated to reflect a change in the accounting policy regarding commission paid to dealers. The results also benefited from the absence of provisions for losses at CP Finance and Leasing, which is being run down. In 1991 provisions of Pounds 3.7m were carried. Directors said it was prudent to wait further before re-instating the dividend. The shares rose 1 1/4 p to 2 1/2 p.</p>

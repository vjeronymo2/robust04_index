			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO STATE FOOTBALL;  </P> <P> IF WINNING RECORD IS AZTEC CONSOLATION, THE PRIZE IS RIGHT  </P> <P> This game is not for the Western Athletic Conference championship or a bid to  the Independence Bowl. It does not come wrapped in hopes and dreams.  </P> <P> This one is about pride.  </P> <P> San Diego State plays host to Texas El Paso at 7:05 tonight in San Diego Jack  Murphy Stadium after a roller-coaster season and a heady week of bowl talk. The  Aztecs (5-4, 4-2 in the WAC), in the running for the Independence Bowl until a  Maryland-Louisiana Tech matchup was announced Wednesday, will try not to look  ahead to next week's nationally televised game with No. 2 Miami as they finish  WAC play with two goals in mind:  </P> <P>  -- Clinching a winning record, which would give them two consecutive winning  seasons for the first time since 1981-82.  </P> <P>  -- Finishing in a second-place tie in the WAC. This will happen if the Aztecs  win tonight and Colorado State loses at Hawaii.  </P> <P> After starting 2-4 overall and 1-2 in the WAC, accomplishing these tasks would  be cause enough for the Aztecs to break into Handel's hallelujah chorus rather  than the school fight song.  </P> <P> "A lot of very positive things could happen with a win (today)," Coach Al  Luginbill said. "No. 1, we'll finish 5-2 (in the WAC) and improve our  conference standing. And we have the opportunity, if Hawaii beats Colorado  State, to tie for second place.  </P> <P> "From where we were five weeks ago, that's a tremendous accomplishment. Having  a winning season is enough to play for -- at least for me," he said. "This game  will establish ourselves as a team to be contended with each year."  </P> <P> The only problem is, the Aztecs aren't sure exactly what they will face.  </P> <P> "They've changed everything (from game to game) this year, from a run-and-shoot  offense to a throw-it-up-50-times-a-ballgame," Luginbill said. "I don't know  which offense we're going to face Saturday."  </P> <P> This is the final game for UTEP (3-7, 1-6), which will be playing to avoid the  cellar. The Miners are tied with New Mexico (1-6) for last-place in the WAC.  New Mexico's season is over.  </P> <P> But here's the catch: UTEP quarterback Howard Gasser is back from a knee injury  suffered in the season opener against Brigham Young. He made his second start  of the season last week against Air Force and although the Miners lost, 14-13,  Gasser completed 32 of 48 passes for 364 yards.  </P> <P> "They're sort of like New Mexico," SDSU defensive end Pio Sagapolutele said.  "They're big up front. They're good run blockers, but their pass (blocking) is  kind of doubtful. We'll be going into this game blitzing more."  </P> <P> Also back is receiver Reggie Barrett, who has missed time this season with an  assortment of nagging injuries. Barrett still leads the team with 35 receptions  for 593 yards and three touchdowns, and he is one of the WAC's all-time leading  receivers. He is 15th on the all-time WAC list with 145 receptions and 10th  with 2,441 yards.  </P> <P> "It took until the end of the season for us to feel very good about ourselves,"  UTEP Coach David Lee said.  </P> <P> Gasser and Barrett will pump some life into the UTEP offense, ranked 100th in  the nation in scoring (16 points a game). Of course, they will be going against  SDSU's defense, ranked 100th (463 yards and 36 points a game).  </P> <P> UTEP is more concerned with its offense than SDSU's defense, though.  </P> <P> "When you're 100th in the nation in scoring offense, everybody you line up  against looks like the New York Giants," Lee said.  </P> <P> Giants? The shadow SDSU quarterback Dan McGwire (6-foot-8) casts over opposing  defenses continues to get bigger. He passed for a career-high 530 yards and two  touchdowns last week against New Mexico, and he seems to get better each week.  </P> <P> "He's been awesome," Lee said. "He stands up and throws the ball right over the  top of people. He's got the easiest, smoothest delivery I've ever seen. He's  got great touch. He's a great prospect. He's a pro quarterback playing behind a  very good offensive line. And gosh darn, (Dennis) Arey and (Patrick) Rowe are  fantastic. . . . You've gotta be perfect on every down to stop these guys."  </P> <P> Rowe is ranked first in the nation with 125.44 yards receiving per game, and  Arey, at 101.33, is fourth. Rowe has 1,129 yards receiving this season, and  Arey, at 915, is 85 yards from the 1,000-yard mark. SDSU likely will become  only the second team in NCAA history with two receivers over 1,000 yards in a  season. The first was Houston in 1988, when James Dixon and Jason Phillips both  surpassed the 1,000-yard mark.  </P> <P> This all adds up to an average of 41 points a game.  </P> <P> "We will continue to fight and play hard this year as we have all week," Lee  said. "It's our last one. We're coming to the coast where the girls don't wear  a lot of clothes and they're all suntanned and bronze. We have a lot of young  kids, and I'm concerned about that. I don't want a blowout ending this season  going into next season."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Aztec Notes  </P> <P> A crowd of only 18,000 is expected. . . . Injury update: SDSU reports no  serious injuries. For UTEP, fullback Kevin Bogan (knee) is out. Redshirt  freshman Patrick Bailey will start in his place. Bailey has played in two games  this season, gaining 48 yards on 16 attempts . . . Any chance the Aztecs will  be looking past UTEP toward Miami next Saturday? "There is so much riding on  this game, I would hope we're past that," SDSU Coach Al Luginbill said. . . .  SDSU won at UTEP last year, 34-31. Quarterback Dan McGwire passed for 282 yards  in that game but threw a career-high six interceptions.  </P></p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: Saab-Scania hoists profits as orders remain healthy SAAB-SCANIA, the Swedish vehicle and aerospace group, increased profit after financial items to SKr1.66bn (Dollars 275m) in the first nine months, a substantial improvement on the SKr947m recorded in the same period of 1991. Orders grew to SKr27.4bn from SKr18.6bn, mainly due to the development of the JAS39 Gripen fighter aircraft project. Consolidated net income advanced to SKr1.65bn from SKr1.02bn last time, while return on capital employed grew to 12 per cent from 9.6 per cent. However, Mr Lars Kylberg, group president, warned that his previous profits forecast for the year stood firm at around the SKr1.70bn achieved last year. This suggests that the reduced demand for trucks and commercial aircraft, as well as the growing losses at Saab Automobile, jointly owned with General Motors of America, will lower the group's profits in the fourth quarter. Mr Kylberg added that Saab-Scania was prepared for 'a difficult 1993 and for an upturn further ahead,' mainly thanks to extensive capital spending on new product programmes and rationalisation measures. The group suffered a 5 per cent cut in consolidated sales in trucks and buses to SKr15.89bn from SKr16.68bn in the first nine months. It reported a weak market for both products across Europe with 21,900 trucks and buses sold, compared with 24,200 for the same period of 1991. Income raised from the sale of aircraft fell to SKr2.84bn from SKr3.07bn. The order backlog for aircraft rose to SKr21.6bn from SKr11.1bn, of which the commercial operation fell to SKr6.1bn from SKr6.8bn. Investor, the Wallenberg family dominated investment and industrial company that fully owns Saab-Scania, announced a profit after financial items for the first nine months of SKr1.63bn, a drop from the SKr2.19bn for the same period of last year. The total value of Investor's share portfolio fell by 2 per cent to SKr17.84bn when the general Stockholm bourse index dropped by 24 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The People's National Assembly [APN] has issued  a press release that notes we are passing through a difficult  moment in the history of the battle of the people's masses, a  period involving all the reactionary forces, including macoutes  appointed by the bourgeoisie and U.S. imperialism to break up  the people's struggle to change their living conditions. The  APN says the Army and the Revolutionary Front for the Promotion  and Progress of Haiti [FRAPH] have been leading a (?knocking)  operation against members of people's organizations nationwide  since the end of April.    The APN reports that this (?knocking) operation continues in  Borgne. On 2 June, the unscrupulous Army and the wild animals  [lame sanmanman an avek tout kolonn bet sovaj] who are part of  FRAPH burned peasants' houses and gardens. They plundered and  stole oxen and food and staged a slaughter that prompted  peasants to flee the area. [passage omitted]    The APN adds that this (?knocking) operation is leading up  to  a military intervention, which will allow the U.S. imperialists  to occupy the country for a certain time, the only way to come  and protect the macoutes from the people who are asking for  justice.    The APN warns the people against the [word indistinct]  policy  that the bourgeoisie and the little avalanche bourgeoisie have  been carrying out for three years, a policy that has kept the  people waiting. It is a way to demobilize them and make them  believe that U.S. military forces will come to save (?them) from  the terror of the macoutes. The APN says this in light of the  U.S. military intervention hanging over Charlemagne Peralte's  country.    The APN asks President Aristide to stop (?changing his  words)  and to be courageous enough to take a clear stand on the  intervention issue if he does not want history to regard him as  a Haitian trading Charlemagne for Uncle Sam. The APN says  President Aristide should take a clear stand on the intervention  issue. The APN again says that it opposes any foreign military  intervention into the country of Dessalines and Charlemagne.  The APN concludes: Down with military intervention! Down with  reconciliation with macoutes! Up with the struggle resting on  the arms' strength of the people!</p>

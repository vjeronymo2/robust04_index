			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / UK Company News: A business with its sights set on gaining new heights - Andrew Baxter charts the growth of Simon Engineering's powered access division FOR the superstitious, ladders are best circumnavigated. For John Barker, head of the world's largest producer of powered access equipment, they mean competition - along with scaffolding. Over the past 18 years Mr Barker, managing director of Simon Access, has built up what is now a division of Stockport-based Simon Engineering from virtually nothing to a Pounds 150m business. But unlike his products, some of which can soar 200ft in the air, he is keeping his feet firmly on the ground. In its headquarters building on the edge of a rambling Gloucester industrial estate, Simon Access keeps a database on more than 350 competitors in the world powered access industry, and on all its markets by geography and product sector. 'If you asked me for a projection on the utility sector in Peru in 1994, I could give you one,' he says. The meticulous research allows Mr Barker to make a prediction which might look odd to observers of an industry that has been badly hit by the recession - especially in the US and UK construction markets. A world market worth just Pounds 1.2bn in 1990 could grow to Pounds 1.7bn by 1995, he says, and Simon plans to raise its share from 15 per cent to between 20 and 25 per cent. 'It's not pie in the sky,' Mr Barker insists. Instead, he says, it will require capi-talising fully on a 15-year global acquisition and development strategy that has turned the Access division into Simon's second largest be-hind process engineering, and an increasingly important part of the company as a whole. The development of Simon Access has coincided with the growth from infancy of an oddball industry producing hundreds of assorted pro-ducts ranging from simple powered platforms for industrial use to self-propelled scissor units and fire units for rescuing people trapped in blazing buildings. Apart from Simon Access, main groups are US-based or Japanese, but can be counted on one hand. Behind them comes a second division of strong regional or national producers, and then hundreds of niche companies. All are serving markets with very different characteristics and business cycles, and customers with contrasting preferences and traditions. In the US, for example, utilities prefer to work on live wires, whereas the current is normally turned off in Europe, leading to totally different design priorities. Mr Barker has therefore had to steer a steady course between recognising the necessity of staying close to his diverse customer base while deriving manufacturing, product and engineering synergies from a dozen acquisitions and internal expansion. Simon-Dudley, the original Simon powered access company, had suffered badly in the early 1970s with fixed-price contracts in an era of 20 per cent inflation, but was also based exclusively on truck-mounted platforms. Mr Barker determined to develop powered access as a global market, filling in geographic and product gaps - preferably simultaneously, and by by buying market leaders. A key move came in 1978 with the purchase of a Milwaukee-based company now called Simon Aerials, which had developed a range of self-propelled platforms. Three years later, Mr Barker bought Gala, a Thetford-based company with a complementary range of self-propelled machines. As Simon acquired companies, it tended to move them up-market, so in 1987, Barker went to Cork in Ireland to buy Eurolift, a manufacturer of smaller self-propelled machines, to maintain its position at the lower end of the market. The biggest acquisition came in 1988 with the purchase of Telelect, a leading US manufacturer of digger derricks, telescopic aerials and cranes. Simon paid an initial Dollars 33.6m, plus at least Dollars 7.26m based on Telelect profits over the next three years. By this time, however, Mr Barker was thinking of two important markets he had 'put to one side' because of earlier difficulties establishing a presence - Germany and Japan. In Germany, Mr Barker set up a new company in 1987 after previous acquisition attempts failed. Reunification and the subsequent upturn in construction activity produced 'a real success story' last year, he says. But until 1989 the most important gap was Japan, which accounts for 25 per cent of the world market. Ten years ago Mr Barker tried unsuccessfully to buy Aichi Sharyo, the market leader, but now has a joint venture with Tomen, one of the big Japanese trading houses. While Aichi and Simon pursue a ding-dong battle in Asia, in Japan the UK company is attacking the newer markets for scissor and self-propelled boom units rather than Aichi's stranglehold on the truck-mounted sector. With the Japanese joint venture, Simon Access has all but completed its global acquisition programme. 'We've dealt ourselves a hand, now we've got to play it skilfully,' says Mr Barker. But can it match an internal projection which would imply lifting sales to about Pounds 340m in 1995 - after a tough year in 1991? In its favour is its increasing emphasis on product sectors, such as the utilities business, which are less sensitive to recession. The business just about broke even in the 1980-81 recession, and, says Mr Barker, 'the whole plan nearly came unstuck.' Mr Barker hopes Simon Access will be able to take the next downturn on the chin, but this time round, profits are down sharply. Mr Tim Bennett of Albert E Sharp, the Birmingham broker, forecasts profits of Pounds 7m for 1991, down from Pounds 11.8m in 1990 - a figure which he has recalculated to reflect property profits made by Simon as a whole. Mr Bennett forecasts Pounds 8m for this year, which he hopes might prove conservative. There is real recovery potential, he says, at Simon Aerials in Milwaukee, and the possibility that some of the smaller-pocketed competitors in the US might withdraw. The real test for Mr Barker and Simon Access in the 1990s will be its ability to move equipment into new markets, and make the most of synergies that are not available to its competitors. Sourcing from the UK and US to sell into continental Europe or Japan will keep Simon busy, says Mr Bennett. Mr Barker believes that some of the cross-fertilisation he has developed over the past decade is beginning to acquire its own momentum, without smothering the small-company innovation enshrined in the division's federal structure. There is, though, a nagging problem for Simon Access that does not affect niche players nearly so much - global differences in standards and specification. Conversely, once common standards are introduced - and progress has already been achieved - an increased emphasis on safety and technology makes it harder for the smaller companies to compete. On Monday, Simon Access announced an order worth more than Pounds 1m to supply a cross-section of 23 machines built in the UK, Ireland and the US to Hertz Equipment Rental in Spain. Mr Barker will need plenty more orders like that to meet his targets.</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Rail terminal plea THE government should 'get its skates on' to develop Scotland's main railfreight terminal ready for the opening of the Channel tunnel, the Commons Scottish affairs committee said yesterday. The MPs said they were 'seriously concerned' that the building of the terminal at Mossend, near Glasgow, had fallen 'well behind schedule'. Meanwhile, the Pounds 130m Channel tunnel terminal at London's Waterloo station was opened yesterday, although trains will not run into it for at least a year.</p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Kohl pressed on plans for spending cuts Germany's newly re-elected government came under strong pressure yesterday from industry and the Bundesbank to stick to its plans for spending cuts and take strong action to reform the costly social welfare system. 'The burden of the welfare state will crush us if we fail to act,' said Mr Klaus Murmann, president of the German Employers' Federation. The steadily growing system of social benefits could no longer be financed in its present form - 'our main demand to the government and parliament is, therefore, to restructure the welfare state.' Mr Murmann said Germany's competitiveness had to be improved by reducing social security costs. He said total social expenditure - on sickness and accident insurance, pensions, unemployment and welfare benefits - was DM1,060bn (Pounds 434.4bn) in 1993, 50 per cent more than Germany's capital investment. In 1970, they had been roughly equal at some DM170bn. His proposals included a reduction in initial sickness pay and review of the pension system. Social insurance should be for the needy and people should be more prepared to make their own provision rather than relying on the state. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, warned the government against relying on the accelerating upturn in the economy to solve the country's long-term problems. 'The structural crisis of the German economy will take time to overcome. It will not be solved by the economic recovery.' Mr Tietmeyer did not mention the election result but it was clear both he and Mr Murmann were anxious that the narrowness of the government's majority might deter it from tough measures. The Free Democrats, the junior coalition party, won fewer seats in the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, while the opposition Social Democrats lifted their majority in the Bundesrat, the upper house, which can delay legislation. One of Mr Tietmeyer's main concerns is that too much federal borrowing could push up interest rates on the bond market. He warned against a 'crowding out' situation - in which heavy demand for funds pushes up rates - at a time of incipient economic recovery. Too much of the government's efforts to curb the budget deficit had concentrated on raising taxes and welfare contributions, he said. More effort should be devoted to cuts in spending. A further salvo towards Bonn was fired by Mr Edzard Reuter, chairman of Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest industrial company. He said the government should find the courage to tell people of the need to tackle 'a pile of unpopular tasks', including plans to reduce spending.</p>

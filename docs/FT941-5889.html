			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Malaysia upsets the Ipswich roadshow: The trade ban has dashed the hopes of many exporters Spare a thought for the 26 members of the Ipswich and Suffolk Chamber of Commerce who are visiting Malaysia. A week ago they packed their bags and headed east, hopes high for handsome trade deals. When they visited Malaysia last year they bagged more than MDollars 2m (Pounds 500,000) worth of contracts with a promise of bigger things to come. But the chamber reckoned without last week's Malaysian announcement banning government contracts with British companies in retaliation for British media allegations linking senior Malaysian officials, including Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, with under-the-counter payments by British companies. A British High Commission reception for the entrepreneurs of Ipswich and Suffolk has been cancelled. Chamber members who spent several thousand pounds on the trip are likely to find the business community in Malaysia less than pleased to see them. But while British business is busy calculating the many millions of pounds worth of contracts likely to be lost through the Malaysian move, there is growing concern on the other side of the fence as well. A senior manager in one of Malaysia's biggest companies said: 'I don't think the government really calculated the damage it was doing when it took its action. Business goes two ways. I'm very worried about the consequences of this.' Malaysian business executives have raised concern that Britain might seek to make the ban a European Union issue. By coincidence, Sir Leon Brittan, the European Commissioner, was in Beijing this week warning the Chinese that any attempt to punish British companies for the row over Hong Kong would be viewed seriously by the EU as a whole. There is also concern that the ban might be contrary to the spirit, if not the letter, of Gatt. Mrs Rafidah Aziz, the Malaysian minister of industry and trade, said the Malaysian move was limited to government contracts with British companies and did not therefore contravene Gatt. However the Malaysian government has wide-ranging influence over the private sector. There is confusion among foreign companies that have joined consortia with British and local companies to tender for government contracts. Many such consortia are not simple to disband. This is the case with the Pounds 3.5bn airport project outside Kuala Lumpur which was to have been undertaken by a UK/Japanese consortium. There are likely to be grumblings from local partners of British companies who will now lose their share in millions of pounds worth of contracts. Many of these companies are headed by influential Malay businessmen, some of whom are prominent members of the United Malays National Organisation, the dominant political party in the country. Several Malaysian companies have been planning fundraising exercises in Europe. The first stop for such roadshows is usually London. British fund managers have given no indication that they are going to withdraw any of the millions they have invested in the fast growing Malaysian market. But some awkward questions might be addressed to visiting Malaysian business leaders. There is also some confusion about what does and does not constitute a British company. For example, Shell, the UK-Dutch group, operates refineries and is involved, along with Petronas, the Malaysian state oil company, in one of the world's biggest gasification projects. Perhaps Shell will now be emphasising its 60 per cent Dutch ownership. Other companies might find it more difficult to assert non-British credentials. But the Ipswich and Suffolk Chamber of Commerce appears to be optimistic about a change in policy: it told local reporters it planned to send another mission to Malaysia next year.</p>

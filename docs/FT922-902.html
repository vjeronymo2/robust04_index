			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ghana polishes up gold coast image - Massive new investment in an underdeveloped, high potential area GHANA'S METEORIC gold boom continues unabated as a result of stable economic policies and massive new investment in one of the least developed high potential gold belts in the world. According to the Minerals Commission production surged last year to 844,674 troy ounces - a 56 per cent increase over 1990 production. The government is predicting that the 1m-ounce mark, the highest level Ghana has ever produced in its history, will be reached this year as new projects come on stream and operational difficulties in the major expansion activities are ironed out. Foreign exchange earnings from gold are forecast at USDollars 350m in 1992, making gold, for the first time in more than two decades, Ghana's number one foreign exchange earner. The gold mining boom is directly attributable to the government's overhaul since 1983 of the restrictive investment laws and incentives in the mining sector, its commitment to a radical economic adjustment programme and its flexible approach to foreign investors. Since 1983 at least Dollars 500m has been invested in the sector. Last year's huge production increase was clearest evidence to date of the successes of government policies. The giant of Ghana's gold industry Ashanti Goldfields Corporation, owned 55 per cent by government and 45 per cent by Lonrho, increased its production to 569,452 ounces, up 42 per cent from 1990, as a result of the opening of its new Sansu oxide plant and the continuing rehabilitation and development of its underground mines. Two other projects also became fully operational last year - the Dollars 100m Billiton Bogusu project, majority owned by the Shell subsidiary Billiton International Metals (Netherlands), produced 61,678 ounces in 1991 and Teberebie Goldfields, majority owned by Pioneer Incorporated of Boston, produced 79,111 ounces. These projects are expected to produce at least 100,000 ounces a year each when initial operational difficulties have been overcome. The future looks promising and the government is estimating annual production of 2m ounces by 1996. Several new projects, with ultimate estimated capital investments of up to Dollars 800m over five years are scheduled to take off in the coming months to increase production levels still further. The first, and most exciting, development is the privatisation of the two underground mines at Prestea and Tarkwa, owned by the State Gold Mining Corporation. Both mines, which last year produced a combined 48,000 ounces, have extremely high potential but have been severely constrained by poor management and inadequate new investment. Because of dilapidated equipment and outmoded mining methods they have production costs of about Dollars 350 an ounce. Mining operations in both areas have so far concentrated on narrow, relatively high grade, veins. Proposals for buying the mines have been submitted by, among others, two South African mining houses, Rand Mines and Gold Fields of South Africa, and by Billiton International Minerals. Both mines have considerable potential for expanding underground production and developing new surface mining operations of oxide and sulphide ores. One mining expert believes that if investment of Dollars 150m-Dollars 200m is put into each concession both Prestea and Tarkwa have the potential within three or four years to produce in excess of 200,000 ounces a year each. The Tarkwa mine has geology very similar to the vast gold deposits in South Africa's Witwatersrand area and the South African bids are tipped as the front runners. A government decision on the privatisation proposals is expected very soon. The second major expansion of reserves and production is being undertaken by Ashanti Goldfields Corporation, which has set a production target of 1m ounces a year by 1996. A recent evaluation of reserves by Minproc Engineers is believed to have suggested reserve levels of at least 20m tonnes with grades in the range of six to eight grams per tonne. A new financing package of about Dollars 250m for the next four years is being put together by the company at the moment. To reach the 1m-ounce level major capital investment is required in continued expansion and mechanisation of underground operations, development of additional open-pit oxide and sulphide reserves and installation of new refractory ore treatment facilities with capacity of at least 3m tonnes a year. Mechanisation and new investment will also help AGC to reduce its costs of production, currently at about Dollars 260 to Dollars 270 an ounce at the Obuasi mine, to the Dollars 200 an ounce achieved by Teberebie, Bogusu and AGC's own new Sansu oxide operation. The government has also said that it is preparing to divest itself of 20 per cent of the equity in AGC by December, reducing its share holding to 35 per cent, and is considering a joint placement on the London and Accra stock exchanges. Ghana-Australian Goldfields, majority owned by Golden Shamrock Mines of Australia, is scheduled to start production in September with reserves estimated at about 15.9m tonnes and an average grade of about 2.1 grammes a tonne. Estimated annual production is 100,000 ounces with a total capital costs for the project of about Dollars 60m. In addition decisions will be taken within the next 12 months on two more medium-sized, low-grade open-pit mining projects Cluff Mining (UK and Zimbabwe) has completed a feasibility study for a significant discovery at Ayanfuri, in Western Region, with estimated reserves of 7m tonnes and an average grade of 2 grams a tonne. The company has undertaken a rights issue to raise Dollars 15m on the London Stock Exchange for a total estimated capital investment of Dollars 25-Dollars 30m, which is expected to produce 40,000-50,000 ounces a year. Abosso Goldfields, majority owned by Ranger Explorations of Australia, is seeking finance for a drilling programme to confirm and expand reserves. So far 3m tonnes of resource have been identified with an average grade of 2 grams a tonne. In addition to these new projects both Teberebie and Bogusu are planning expansion programmes to realise production of 125,000 and 140,000 ounces a year respectively. Since Ghana, known as the Gold Coast in colonial times, started gold production at least 40m ounces have been mined. Considerable expansion is under way as well as efforts to reduce production costs among all producers to Dollars 200 an ounce. But mining experts point out that most recent mine development and exploration has occurred in established areas. Many other areas with known prospects and favourable geology have yet to be explored systematically. Such exploration, encouraged by further liberalisation of investment laws, could produce results to make Ghana a major world producer for decades to come.</p>

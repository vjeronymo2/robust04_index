			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / International Company News: ITT to launch L400bn offer for Ciga next week ITT, the US conglomerate which owns the Sheraton hotel chain, will launch its L400bn (Dollars 254m) bid for a further 35.25 per cent of Ciga, the Italian luxury hotels group, on September 19. The terms of the bid, which will be made through ITT's Sheraton International subsidiary, were outlined on Saturday. If successful, the L1,102 a share offer will double ITT's stake in Ciga to 70.5 per cent. Certain Italian fund managers, however, have already indicated that they would prefer to remain minority shareholders. Ciga shares closed on Friday night at L1,076. Consob, the Italian stock exchange watchdog, first announced that ITT would have to bid at the end of July. Since then the US company has bought further Ciga shares on the market at below L1,100. In the full-page prospectus, published at the weekend, ITT said its management plans would be 'better defined in the coming months'. However, it said it wanted to 'explore the potential synergies between Ciga Hotels and ITT Sheraton. 'ITT Sheraton can offer Ciga Hotels the benefit of a global marketing and distribution network, which Ciga did not have previously. Furthermore, ITT Sheraton can integrate Ciga into the financial and operating systems already used by the ITT group.' Ciga was controlled by the Aga Khan's holding company, Fimpar, until a rescue rights issue earlier this year, prepared by Mediobanca, the Milan-based merchant bank, on behalf of the debt-encumbered group's creditor banks. ITT was unable to acquire Ciga via that issue, as originally planned, and has had to accumulate shares on the market. The ITT bid, which will close on October 7, could end more than a year of uncertainty about the future of Ciga, which was courted last year by Forte of the UK and Host Marriott of the US. Sheraton International is advised by Euromobiliare and Milla. Meanwhile, the Aga Khan is due to decide this week how much he can afford to pay to bail out Fimpar, which urgently requires new capital. Reports at the weekend suggested he was ready to underwrite an increase in capital to the tune of L24.5bn, but that he would not pay the entire sum at once. Fimpar has postponed today's extraordinary shareholder meeting, due to consider the group's future, until September 19.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Revolutionary Heritage"] </F>   [Text] Former members and fans of the National People's  Army (NVA) of the SED [Socialist Unity Party of Germany] regime  plan to found a traditional association on 1 March. According  to the preliminary statute, anyone "who is committed to the  revolutionary heritage of the NVA" and does not "serve in armed  FRG organs" can become a member.    The East Berlin comrades, who are looking for  fellow-fighters  to "preserve our ideals" in NEUES DEUTSCHLAND and by circular  letters, have a clear enemy image: "According to the will of  the occupiers, everything was supposed to be abolished through  the counterrevolution in autumn 1989." The protest slogan of  the NVA nostalgics: "Let's not put up with that!"    The response is still meager. Nevertheless, the Bundeswehr  Association reacts nervously to the "alarm signal." In an open  letter, Berlin District Chairman Herbert Becker, a former NVA  lieutenant colonel, warns all 25,000 former NVA soldiers in the  capital against this "extremist organization." In the future  traditional association, which wants to "decide" contentious  issues "in an authoritarian manner if necessary," one can  "continue holding one's former service rank." And one who has  not yet flogged his NVA uniform on flea markets or to souvenir  shops "can" wear it "at closed events." The first opportunity:  "Our day of honor" on 1 March, 38 years after the founding of  the NVA -- provided that the initiators of the association  manage to settle "some organizational problems" by then. So  far, only about a dozen activists have rallied, and they are  industriously preparing the NVA resurrection project.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Swedish party's EC vote may split government SWEDEN'S Centre party will vote today at its annual conference on whether it wants the country to join the European Community. If it votes against EC membership the decision will precipitate a political crisis and split the Swedish government. As a member of the four party coalition which took office last October, the Centre is committed to an agreed policy of pressing for Swedish EC membership. But a large number of the party's members and an estimated two thirds of its supporters are against EC membership, with only 13 per cent in favour. Opinion appears to have hardened against Swedish EC membership since the Danish rejection of the Maastricht Treaty in the referendum on June 2. At present the Centre, which draws on support mainly from the rural areas, has around 7 to 8 per cent backing in the public opinion polls. Mr Carl Bildt, Sweden's prime minister and Moderate party leader, has already warned the Centre that if it commits itself to an anti-EC position its ministers will have to leave the government. Yesterday Mr Olof Johansson, the Centre party's leader and environment minister, praised the Danes for rejecting the Maastricht Treaty. He said he was also opposed to any idea of a future European Union. As a joint supporter of the all-party recommendation last year by the Swedish parliament of the application for EC membership, Mr Johansson added that he remained in favour of joining the EC if the right terms could be negotiated. These would include assurances that Sweden would not be involved in any future military alliance, that the EC would have a strong regional policy and decentralised decision-making.</p>

			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / International Company News: Weak quarter for Bankers Trust Bankers Trust has seen a sharp fall in its income from selling derivatives to companies and others in recent months, in the wake of losses reported by some of its customers. The bank, which has been the leader in using derivatives to devise risk-management products for companies and investors, attracted considerable adverse publicity when Procter &amp; Gamble said it had lost Dollars 157m on financial instruments bought from the bank. The company added at the time that it was considering suing Bankers Trust over the loss. The New York-based bank said profits from what it calls 'client financial risk management' dropped to Dollars 50m in the three months to the end of June, down from Dollars 114m in the previous three months, as revenues in the area fell by a third. During 1993, profits averaged Dollars 84m a quarter. Mr Tim Yates, chief financial officer, said the bank believed its share of the risk-management business had remained stable during the period. The decline reflected an overall fall-off in the use of derivatives, particularly more complex instruments which carry higher profit margins. Meanwhile, Bankers Trust failed to record the sort of rebound in profits from trading in financial markets that many analysts had expected. During the first three months of the year, it earned revenues of only Dollars 14m from trading, and reported a loss in the area of Dollars 49m. In the second quarter, revenues rose to Dollars 124m, while profits reached Dollars 52m - still well behind the Dollars 405m revenues of a year before. The bank added that a significant part of the trading profits in the latest quarter stemmed from the recent Brazilian debt restructuring and its holdings of Brazilian bonds. Mr Yates declined to disclose how much Bankers Trust had earned from this single event, or even whether it would have showed a trading profit without the Brazilian debt restructuring. Bankers Trust blamed the weak trading figures - which echoed trading figures published by other US banks in recent days - on poor conditions in the financial markets. 'Pure proprietary trading, while it has improved from the first quarter, is still in a difficult environment,' Mr Yates said. Overall, the bank's after-tax profits for the second quarter fell by 28 per cent to Dollars 181m, or Dollars 2.09 a share, from Dollars 251m, or Dollars 2.90, the year before. Half-year net income was Dollars 345m, or Dollars 3.99, compared with Dollars 481m, or Dollars 5.54, in the first six months of 1993.</p>

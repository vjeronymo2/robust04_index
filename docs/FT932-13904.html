			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: Argentina prepares for sell-off of stake in state oil company ARGENTINA'S financial community was due to be briefed yesterday in Buenos Aires on what could turn out to be be the largest international equity offering of the year, the sale to the public of a majority stake in the state-owned oil company YPF this summer. The fully-integrated company, the first state oil company in Latin America, has been drastically restructured for privatisation and is regarded by some as the jewel in the crown of a dramatic Argentine privatisation programme. Its 52,000 employees in August 1990 have been reduced to fewer than 12,000. After sales of non-core assets such as its shipping fleet and of certain oil and gas wells to dilute its monopoly power in the Argentine market, the value of the company's assets is put in the region of Dollars 6bn to Dollars 8bn. The government's economic team, led by Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, indicated earlier that a controlling stake in the company would not be sold to a single business operator as in some earlier Argentine privatisations. Officials also said they intended to transfer control from the government in the first stage of the privatisation even though, after it, the government would probably still be the largest single shareholder. Partly for this reason, the plan is to sell more than 50 per cent of the shares of the company in the initial offering, according to a banker close to the transaction. Some estimates have suggested up to Dollars 3bn could be raised in this first stage. Some 5 per cent to 10 per cent of the company is to be reserved for the workforce and a remaining 20 per cent is to stay with the government. As reported, First Boston and Merrill Lynch - which had advised YPF in its preparation for privatisation - have been appointed by the government as global co-ordinators of the initial offering. The offering is to be made using the US style of book building: this establishes the demand for shares at a range of prices, and is said by its proponents to improve chances that the shares are directed into firm hands. This system will be used for the first time in Argentina. The government is keen to avoid the experience of some previous auction-style privatisations where prices fell sharply soon after the auction leaving investors, many of which borrowed to finance share purchases, with heavy losses. Most of the shares are expected to be directed to the US market. While the outcome depends on the consultation now being held with underwriters and on the book building process, bankers now guess perhaps half of the shares offered will go to the US market, around 20 per cent to the Argentine market and 30 per cent into the non-US international market. With the capitalisation of the entire Argentine market now around Dollars 18bn, it would be impractical to direct the entire offering to Buenos Aires. Nonetheless, there have been some concerns expressed about the ability of the international market to absorb such a large amount of paper in a relatively short time. Filings are expected to be made with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to permit the offering to take place in late-June or July, earlier than the government previously publicly envisaged but one apparently designed to avoid a clash with Congressional elections due in September. According to officials, bankers and investors in New York are to be briefed at the end of this week on the offering and in London early next week. Co-managers for the offering are likely to be named by the end of the month.</p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / EC seen as threat to City success THE biggest threat to London's status as a leading financial centre comes from ill-conceived regulation, especially new EC directives. That is the preliminary conclusion of the first study by the City itself into what determines its success as a financial centre. The City Research Project's interim report, prepared by the London Business School with funding from the Corporation of London, identifies three issues  -regulation, the structure of markets and government policies to encourage internationally oriented businesses - as central to London's future success. The report, shows the remuneration of senior City executives is generally lower than on Wall Street or Tokyo. Senior fund managers, equity traders and foreign exchange dealers earn more in Tokyo and in New York than in London. However, cash compensation packages are higher than Frankfurt and Paris. The report found that corporate finance executives, who advise companies on takeovers and fund-raising, earn more in London - almost Pounds 160,000 a year on average - than elsewhere in the world. The preliminary report aims to identify areas needing further study. Mr Stanislas Yassukovich, former chairman of the Securities Association who initiated the research and is chairman of the project's governing board, said: 'Regulation is probably the top issue.' He highlighted dangers to the City from European Directives aiming to impose common rules on European financial centres. Markets were so different, he said, that uniform rules might not be appropriate. He cited the example of recent attempts by the EC and regulators of securities firms to devise a common standard for the amount of capital each securities firm must maintain - their capital adequacy ratios - as a protection against financial shocks. 'In the London market, securities firms have access to hedging instruments and can use devices designed to share risk with partners', he said. As a result, London securities firms might be less exposed to risk than rivals in Frankfurt or Paris. So it might be unfair to impose the same capital requirement and associated costs on a London securities firm as on a Continental-based firm.</p>

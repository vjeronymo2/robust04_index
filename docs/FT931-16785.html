			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / MMC chairman to head inquiry into ITV network SIR Sydney Lipworth, chairman of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, is to head the investigation into ITV networking arrangements. The commission's investigation has been requested by both the Independent Television Commission, the commercial broadcasting regulatory body, and by the ITV Association, the industry trade body. They are appealing against a finding by the Office of Fair Trading that ITV's networking arrangements were anti-competitive and unfair to independent producers. The referrals are the first to go to the monopolies commission under the 1990 Broadcasting Act. The investigation, the outcome of which is binding, is expected to take three months. The OFT, which has a responsibility under the act to ensure that the arrangements for the national networking of ITV programmes are fair, demanded two important changes in the proposed arrangements. ITV wanted to be able to buy the UK rights to an independent production for up to 10 years, with a further option for five years. The OFT decided the maximum should be five years with an option for two years. It also ruled that independent producers should have the option of being contracted directly by the ITV network centre rather than having to work with a sponsoring ITV company. Independent producers welcomed the OFT report, which was published last month, but ITV expressed outrage. The Independent Television Commission is principally concerned about how it could enforce compliance with broadcasting rules and regulations under the OFT regime. The 1990 act makes the individual ITV companies, rather than the television commission, responsible for what is broadcast. If an ITV company errs, the television commission can fine it, or as a last resort remove its licence. The television commission is asking what would happen if an independent producer contracted with the network centre were responsible for a breach of the rules. The television commission has no direct power over the network centre.</p>

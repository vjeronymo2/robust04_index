			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DREXEL PROBE MAY REVEAL EVEN MORE, SHAD SAYS  </P> <P> Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Chairman John S. R. Shad said Wednesday that the  federal investigation of insider trading "may well uncover additional  infractions" at the Wall Street investment banking firm.  </P> <P> But Shad, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said he  believes that "the bulk of the problems are behind the firm."  </P> <P> Drexel agreed at the end of last year to plead guilty to six felony counts of  mail, wire and securities fraud and to pay fines of $650 million in the  government's massive probe of insider trading on Wall Street.  </P> <P> Shad, who spoke at the firm's semiannual economic briefing for journalists, did  not describe the possible additional infractions. But he said Drexel is aiding  the Justice Department and the SEC in their investigations.  </P> <P> He said Drexel had hired new legal and compliance experts and said the firm's  board of directors and key executives "are committed to the highest standards"  of conduct in the industry.  </P> <P> Shad also said Drexel has formed a high-level oversight committee including  himself, former SEC Chairman Roderick Hills and Ralph Saul, a veteran  securities executive. Shad was elected chairman of the parent company in April,  the same time that Hills and Saul joined its board.  </P> <P> Drexel's investment banking, merchant banking and high-yield bond activities  remain healthy, Shad said.  </P> <P> Some of the operations that Drexel shed recently, including its retail  brokerage arm, had been unprofitable. "The dispositions tended to improve  operating profits," Shad said.  </P> <P> Drexel rose to prominence during the last decade through the huge profitability  of its high-yield "junk bond" department, formerly led by Michael Milken, who  himself faces a 98-count indictment charging him with securities fraud and  racketeering.  </P> <P> Drexel's settlement of criminal charges, which excluded Milken, is contingent  on its settling related civil charges with the SEC. Drexel Chief Executive  Frederick Joseph said final approval of the firm's settlement with the SEC may  take several months but added that a challenge by lawyers for Michael Milken  may delay it further.  </P> <P> Milken, who was placed on leave from the firm earlier this year after he was  indicted, has pleaded not guilty to all charges and is expected to go on trial  next year.  </P> <P> Joseph said that although the civil settlement has not been approved by the  U.S. District Court in New York, the firm is acting as if its provisions are in  place.  </P> <P> "The major impact is behind us," Joseph said, referring to the investigation  and the proposed settlement. He said the firm has had few if any defections  among clients.  </P></p>

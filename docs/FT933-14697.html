			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Smith's creditors mount challenge CREDITORS of Mr Clive Smith, the Midlands entrepreneur who recently avoided bankruptcy after incurring debts of more than Pounds 20m, are mounting a challenge to the individual voluntary arrangement which allows him to repay just 8.13p in the pound. Their appeal will be based on a clause in the insolvency act which allows court intervention if material irregularities at or in relation to a creditors meeting could be proved. The hearing is set for August. The challenge follows the creditors' meeting last month at which a majority of the debt was voted in favour of Mr Smith's proposals. However, disputing creditors are thought to be raising questions over the validity of debt claims from an offshore company linked to an associate of Mr Smith. Richard Pearce &amp; Sons, a Hong Kong-based company with an Irish address, is Mr Smith's largest creditor, with claims of Pounds 12.3m. Mr Kelvin Myles, who shares the same Irish address and has managed many of Mr Smith's offshore interests, has refused to identify Richard Pearce's owners to other creditors. At the creditors meeting last month Mr Smith denied he had any connection to Richard Pearce. The proxy vote in favour of the IVA was cast by Mr Graham Wilson, Mr Smith's insolvency practitioner. Mr Wilson, who was arrested last year on suspicion of defrauding creditors in an insolvency procedure, is currently on police bail awaiting possible charges. Mr Smith's creditors include the Inland Revenue, owed Pounds 1.3m, Societe Bancaire de Paris, Pounds 1.5m, and accountants Moore Stevens with Pounds 199,935. Creditors also include Mr Robert Pollock, the former chairman of Alpine Double Glazing, whose mortgage was guaranteed by Mr Smith's family vehicle, Finchley Investments.</p>

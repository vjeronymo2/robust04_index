			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Economic Viewpoint: The painful road to capitalism Last weekend I made my pilgrimage to the solid bourgeois house in which Karl Marx was born. This was in the former Roman garrison town of Trier, on the River Mosel, near where Germany, France and Luxembourg all meet and, indeed, a stone's throw from the village of Schengen, where ministers from five EC countries agreed to dismantle all frontier formalities. Apart from the lady who took the entrance money, there was not a single German to be seen in Karl Marx Haus, and hardly any Europeans. The visitors were mainly from the third world, predominantly Africa. They mostly treated their visit as a tourist outing, grinning and taking photographs. A more serious-looking young man, reading a Turkish newspaper, turned out to be looking at the sports pages, while drinking a bottle of coke. The visit put me in the right frame of mind to read the Annual Economic Outlook of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development on the problems faced by countries 'in transition', which are trying to escape from the Soviet variety of Marxism and restore capitalism. Forget the recent trouble at the top of the EBRD. The report, issued by the EBRD's chief economist John Flemming, is a thorough analysis of the economics of transition. It should remain a permanent reference for its treatment of property rights as a condition - in addition to markets, privatisation and macroeconomic stability - of a workable capitalist economy. And it is not as far from the rings of security police around the Russian parliament as it might seem. For the anti-Yeltsin opposition is basically trying to stop a transformation in property rights which would finally undermine its power base. Just as there are no special economic rules prevailing within 30 miles of Cambridge, there are no separate ones for the former communist countries either. Some of their most acute problems are familiar in the west under the dreadful name of 'corporate governance'. No ideal method has been found anywhere of performing the proprietorial role of monitoring the activities of, and if necessary replacing, professional managers. But in the transitional economies, property rights are also threatened by 'ill definition, continuing bureaucratic en-croachment and criminality'. Meanwhile, the birth pangs of capitalism are proving every bit as painful as Marx expected those of socialism to be. Anyone who believes that there has been a severe recession in the west should look at the EBRD best guess for output in Russia, which fell by a cumulative 20 per cent between 1989 and 1992. In central Europe, the best performers were Hungary and Poland, where output fell by 'only' 13 1/2 per cent. The slump had its origins in the final years of the communist regime. Output growth came to an end in the middle 1980s. The pains of the subsequent restructuring included a sharp cutback in military expenditure, which was mostly in remote areas with little alternative employment. Just as important has been 'the enormous anxiety over the prospective returns to investment created by the uncertainties of the transition towards markets and property rights'. There have also been external forces. The decline in economic activity in the former Soviet Union, and the ensuing fall in its demand for imports, may have accounted for the entire output decline in Hungary and most of the output decline in the Czech Republic. In addition, German unification resulted in a massive decline of exports to the former German Democratic Republic. The Russian shift to charging world prices for oil and other resources has been likened in its incidence to a third oil price shock. On top of everything else there came recession in the west, which has made investors there cautious about placing funds anywhere - except perhaps in the dynamic Asian economies. The scale of the post-communist recession may be overstated, because of the under-recording of the output of new small-scale private enterprise. The EBRD expects positive growth everywhere outside the war zones within the next two or three years. Long-term forecasters suggest that it might take more than 35 years to catch up with per capita levels in the OECD. So much the worse for the forecasters. The EBRD mentions that none of them is using the successes achieved in a number of Asian countries 'to identify the paths the reforming countries of eastern Europe might be following'. There is also the throwaway remark: 'Provided that eastern Europe can avoid building a tax and transfer system providing employed and unemployed workers with incentives to risk prolonged joblessness, such as has developed in western Europe, the normal unemployment rate in eastern Europe might turn out to be less.' Comparisons across Europe should not all be one way. I hope that somebody will draw the attention of the UK chancellor to one apparently innocuous section, which estimates that the marginal tax rate on labour incomes in the UK is already around 65 per cent, taking into account national insurance contributions and VAT, 'slightly higher than is typical in eastern Europe'. The US is exceptional in being below 50 per cent - that is, unless Congress approves the Clinton budget package. On the other hand the post-communist countries stand alone in their rates of tax on income from capital, which are estimated at nearly 98 per cent for Russia and around 85 per cent even for Poland and the Czech Republic. These astronomical rates reflect the interaction of the tax system with high inflation. Until they are tackled, privatisation is bound to be at knockdown prices and domestic investors will continue to hold funds abroad or simply hoard US dollars. According to the EBRD: 'The fate of economic reforms in eastern Europe will depend on how successful the reforming countries will become in penetrating western markets.' Trade with the west is now as high or higher as a proportion of the total as it was in 1928. Import protection in the Czech and Slovak republics and Poland is now lower and more uniform than in most OECD countries. Central European trade with the European Community is regulated by Association Agreements, which came into force in March 1992 and aim to establish a free trade area within 10 years, with a phased timetable in which the EC will move faster. Unfortunately these commitments do not completely apply to sensitive sectors accounting for 30 to 40 per cent of the trade of Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic. The biggest restrictions are in agriculture, where, for instance, imports of meat into the EC were recently subject to a levy of over 100 per cent. Some relief is promised in textiles and clothing; but these are dependent on the successful conclusion of the Gatt round. In principle, steel quotas have come to an end; but there are fears of informal pressure by west European industries against price competition here and in chemicals. An example of EC behaviour was the recent ban on meat and dairy products because of the supposed danger of foot and mouth disease. The Czech foreign minister pointed out that there has been no known case of this disease in his country for almost 20 years. (A Hungarian colleague said it must have been 'foot in mouth disease' instead.) In view of some of the horrifying estimates of the cost of extending to central and eastern Europe farm supports and regional assistance, the EBRD authors suggest a new form of membership that would not automatically offer all the 'benefits' of EC cohesion policies, such as a social charter and the regional funds. Maybe other countries will eventually ask for such opt-outs as well, leaving Mr Delors to enforce his rules within 30 miles of Brussels  -which does not extend as far as Trier.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- % OF TRADE WITH E EUROPE AND WITH MARKET ECONOMIES (LATTER IN BRACKETS)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Bulgaria  Czechoslovakia   Hungary       Poland  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1928                16.4 (64.9)   19.8 (55.2)  37.3 (30.9)  14.2 (62.7) 1989                54.1 (27.5)   47.2 (37.6)  40.1 (46.2)  39.4 (44.9) 1992                33.1 (41.0)   25.4 (63.2)  21.3 (68.9)  15.9 (72.1) Normal pattern      17.8 (62.5)   21.5 (57.5)  30.2 (47.5)  19.1 (60.4)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Romania  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1928                24.0 (54.9) 1989                31.1 (32.5) 1992                19.7 (51.8) Normal pattern      23.4 (57.2)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: EBRD  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

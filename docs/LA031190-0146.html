			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NUCLEAR WEAPON DETONATED; 2 PROTESTERS HELD  </P> <P> A nuclear weapon was detonated 1,500 feet beneath the Nevada desert Saturday,  generating the force of a moderate earthquake that was felt by some observers  on high-rise gambling resorts 85 miles away in Las Vegas.  </P> <P> The test, code-named "Metropolis," was the first nuclear test announced by the  United States this year.  </P> <P> Eleven anti-nuclear protesters held a vigil near the gates of the Nevada Test  Site, 30 miles from where the weapon was triggered beneath Yucca Flat, an arid  desert flat on the Nevada Test Site.  </P> <P> Two men were arrested on charges of trespassing when they stepped over the  government property line at the top-secret Department of Energy facility.  Eighteen protesters briefly picketed the Department of Energy building in  downtown Las Vegas without incident.  </P> <P> A spokesman at the Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., said the  nuclear blast measured 5.1, a magnitude equivalent to a "moderate" earthquake.  The recent Upland earthquake in Southern California had a magnitude of 5.5.  </P> <P> Chris West, a spokesman for the Department of Energy, said government observers  on the high-rise Fitzgerald's hotel-casino in downtown Las Vegas reported  feeling "a slight earth motion" but were unable to determine the direction of  the earth movement.  </P> <P> Observers at the high-rise Regency Towers, a posh condominium on the Las Vegas  Country Club near the Strip, also felt slight motion.  </P> <P> There were no other reports of earth motion and no damage, West said.  </P> <P> The detonation at 8 a.m. PST had a yield of 20 to 150 kilotons, or a maximum  equivalent of 150,000 tons of TNT. The atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during  World War II was a 13-kiloton weapon.  </P> <P> U.S. officials announced 12 underground nuclear weapons tests last year at the  Nevada Test Site, six of which were in the 20 to 150 kiloton range.  </P> <P> "No radiation escaped into the atmosphere and initial data indicates the test  was a success," West said.  </P> <P> He described the earth motion from a control point 11 miles from ground zero as  similar to "sitting in a rowboat and gently rocking back and forth."  </P> <P> "There were no problems. Everything went fine," he said.  </P> <P> The detonation sent a funnel of dust into the clear desert sky above ground  zero, as the earth bulged skyward about a foot from the force of the  underground detonation.  </P> <P> Helicopters and fixed-wing government planes circled above ground zero with  radiation monitoring equipment, prepared to track any radiation that might leak  into the atmosphere by accident.  </P> <P> The nuclear weapons test, conducted by the Livermore National Laboratory, was  the 700th at the Nevada Test Site since the Rhode Island-sized facility became  operational in 1951.  </P></p>

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Paris defiant in eye of Gatt storm: Why the country's farmers are holding up a deal IN the eye of the storm over the latest breakdown in the Gatt negotiations, France yesterday seemed calmly defiant. Under fire from Washington, and cross-fire from some of its EC partners, the French government stressed its desire for an eventual Gatt accord, but not one which 'unfairly sacrificed' the interests of its farmers to those of their US competitors. Both the government and the main farmers' union, FNSEA, claimed the US interruption of talks was electoral machismo, aimed at trying to keep President Bush in the White House. Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, yesterday echoed the view which Mr Roland Dumas, the foreign minister, expressed earlier this week that serious bargaining could only resume after the November 3 presidential poll in the US. A senior French official said the cause of the breakdown in Brussels this week had been oilseeds, an issue over which Germany, as the EC's largest producer of rapeseed, had more at stake than France. 'This is not really a question of German solidarity with France, beause the Germans have their own problems in this sector', he said. 'We have shown that we are ready to take difficult decisions in circumstances where an agreement is balanced', the official said in reference to France's acquiescence in the reform of the common agricultural policy. 'But in the case of Gatt, we are not there yet.' It seems most unlikely the ruling socialists, far behind the main opposition parties in the opinion polls, will want to take any more 'difficult decisions' in the run-up to next March's elections. It may seem odd that a socialist government should appear so beholden to the country's farmers who generally cast their votes to the right of the political spectrum. In one recent opinion poll, for instance, 79 per cent of farmers said they would vote for Mr Jacques Chirac, the neo-Gaullist leader, in a presidential race, compared to only 21 per cent for Mr Michel Rocard, the likely socialist standard-bearer. But French farmers' political clout is partly due to their sheer number. There are still at least 1m working farmers - 6 per cent of the electorate - and the 'farm vote' is swelled further by many retired farmers. According to FNSEA, the 'monde rurale', encompassing all those in France's small villages and towns whose livelihoods are linked to farmers' prosperity, amounts to 17 per cent of the 37m electorate. On top of this is the political quirk that the rural (as distinct from the urban) population remains over-represented in the indirectly-elected French Senate, though, due to electoral boundary changes in 1986, this is no longer so in the directly-elected National Assembly. The ruling socialists got a nasty reminder of the power of the farm lobby in the Maastricht referendum, in which farmers nearly tipped the balance by voting 63 to 37 per cent against the treaty. It is significant that the lynch-pin of President Mitterrand's new strategy to attract middle-of-the road voters was the appointment in September of Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, a centrist, as his new agriculture minister. Any serious French concessions in Gatt on agriculture would blow this strategy. Few in France are willing to take on the farm lobby. France's big service companies would like a rapid Gatt deal to expand financial and telecommunications exports. But they only get a weak hearing inside the government. Their natural channel of influence would be the minister of industry, Mr Dominique Strass-Kahn. But he is also responsible for foreign trade, and agricultural goods account for 16 per cent of total exports. It is precisely because of this that France is most exercised, not to say angry, about US demands that the EC should cut not only the money it spends on subsidising exports, but the actual volume of these shipments by 24 per cent over six years. The particular gripe is that the reference period chosen by the US is 1986-88, when EC cereal exports averaged 23.3m tonnes a year. Since then EC cereal exports have risen, by 1991-2, to nearly 28m tonnes, of which France accounted for 10.4m tonnes. Thus, the French complaint is the US is asking the EC in general, and France in particular, to take a far bigger cut than Washington pretends to realise. MR Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director general, yesterday called for negotiators to keep cool, reports David Dodwell. 'We have to wait a bit, let the dust settle, and remind ourselves that this is another moment of tension, not the first one.' He said he was considering calling the trade negotiating committee, the main Gatt body dealing with the six-year-long Uruguay Round talks next week to assess the situation. 'I would not like to be in the shoes of either the Community or the US coming back to say to other contracting parties that they have failed to settle their differences. There will be a great deal of anger, for the sake of what is at stake.' He believed common sense would eventually produce a breakthrough: 'I can't imagine that the US or the EC would take the responsibility of breaking down the round at a time when we need so much a success as a signalfor the very sluggish world economy.' He said the breakdown coming after hopes of a breakthrough had over-dramatised the situation. 'The round is a multilaterial round and is being negotiated here in Geneva. We have the institutions in place to push the negotiations forward. The EC and the US have to come back to Geneva, and it is then that we will know what the real situation is. In the meanwhile, we have to let the dust settle, and them we can act on that.'</p>

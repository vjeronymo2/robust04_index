Cavallo pointed out: "For example, this will help transform  fruit and vegetable production in the Rio Negro valley, northern  Santa Fe Province, entire sectors of northwest Argentina, and  irrigated areas where it is necessary to produce goods more in  keeping with what the world demands today."    -- Cavallo noted: "We will encourage a mechanism linking the  foreign trade chain selling the products with industrialization  and production in Argentina. Therefore, when planting,  harvesting, and industrialization is complete in Argentina,  there will be an awareness that these products will actually be  sold abroad, that a good price will be collected, and not that  we have a product that we do not know to whom it will be sold  and must then be raffled off."    -- There will be measures in the automotive industry system  "that do not represent any change, but will actually clarify  what will happen if there is no compensation between exports and  imports as established by the system for 31 December 1993."    -- Certain "improvements in the system of capital goods and  local production of capital goods" will be announced. The  information on the current mechanisms for the manufacturing  industry, agriculture, livestock, and fishing will be expanded  so as "to facilitate the implementation of more appropriate  technologies and better product design by small and medium-size  companies in order to enhance quality controls."    -- A number of deregulation measures that "will allow a 20-  to 25-percent cost reduction in construction" will be announced  along with a "drastic reduction in employers' contributions"  that will probably reach the construction industry as of 1 April  and "after the large provinces issue their laws indicating the  dates for reducing gross incomes." Cavallo noted: "It  especially represents a reduction in construction costs for  low-cost housing that will benefit the entire industry." He  hopes for "a strong expansion of construction activities that  will contribute to reducing unemployment and maintaining a  dynamic economic growth rate within the next few years."</p>

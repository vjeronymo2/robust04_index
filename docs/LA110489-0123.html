			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HEED ADVISORIES, SCIENTIST WARNS  </P> <P> Boaters and coastal residents should pay special attention to weather  advisories during November and December, when higher than usual tides will  occur, a Scripps scientist advises.  </P> <P> The highest tides of the 1989-90 winter season -- some up to 7.7 feet -- will  occur Nov. 10-16 and Dec. 9-15, according to Dr. Reinhard E. Flick, a Scripps  Institution of Oceanography oceanographer who also works with the California  Department of Boating and Waterways.  </P> <P> Although not considered dangerous by themselves, the high tides combined with a  storm or high winds could create hazardous coastal conditions, Flick said.  </P> <P> "Tides are predictable, but storm conditions cannot be predicted with accuracy  until at most a few days before the event," he said. "Beachfront residents and  communities should be especially aware of local weather reports during these  periods."  </P> <P> Flick said morning tides in San Diego will peak at 7.7 feet Nov. 13 and Dec.  12.  </P> <P> During recent winters, when higher than average sea levels coincided with  coastal storms, some Southern California cities have suffered severe damage.  </P> <P> The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has issued a warning that  the higher than usual tides may add to the threat of coastal flooding and  navigation hazards along the Pacific, Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The first day of the Sixth National Conference of  the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] was devoted to statements  by the chairmen of the parties, members of the SDS coalition,  and delegates to the conference. Two main issues were brought  up: tactics related to prompting early elections and the  centers of power within the SDS.    Filip Dimitrov, chairman of the SDS National Coordinating  Council, said elections are the only prudent alternative for  Bulgaria's fate. However, he himself sees no real evidence that  elections could take place by the end of the year. He appealed  for unity within the SDS.    Stefan Savov, chairman of the SDS parliamentary faction,  said  that the parliament is the heart of democracy. According to  him, the blue [SDS] deputies blocked many recommunization bills,  and they should continue to do so.    According to Radical Democratic Party Chairman Aleksandur  Yordanov, the SDS faces both elections and a choice: whether to  proceed toward a split or to head along the road of unity.  Yordanov said that the presidency was seen for a long time as  the basic enemy of the SDS, but this position has changed.    The Radical Democrats, the Nikola Petkov Bulgarian Agrarian  National Union [BZNS], the Democratic Party, and the Christian  Democratic Center Union expressed the joint stance that the  parliamentary boycott is a means and not an end in itself, and  that it should be effected at an appropriate moment along with  extraparliamentary pressure.    The opposition of Ecoglasnost, the Conservative-Ecological  Party, and certain local structures of the SDS did not surprise  anyone. They demanded an immediate walkout from the parliament.  Edvin Sugarev insisted that the conference should impose a  decision on the parliamentary faction to boycott the parliament  if the cabinet is successfully reshuffled. In this context, the  old problem of the SDS coalition related to the centers of power  emerged again. The Social Democrats of Ivan Kurtev proposed a  single center of power -- the coalition's political organ and  the national conference. They should be the only organs  entitled to adopt political decisions.    All those proposals will be incorporated in the program  document, which the conference will adopt tomorrow. However,  there are clear indications that the boycott of the parliament  will be postponed, while the centralization of power within the  coalition will be carried out.    The BZNS of Anastasiya Mozer, the Monarchists, and the  Christian Democratic Party were mentioned favorably as possible  partners in a future coalition.</p>

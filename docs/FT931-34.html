			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (13): Importance is likely to grow - Despite some painful rows with banks and other businesses, the head of the Financial Services Commission has earned a grudging respect from most of the institutions / Profile: John Roper GUERNSEY may only be a few miles from the French coastline, but its regulatory system leans very heavily towards Britain. The man most responsible for that tilt is Mr John Roper, head of the Financial Services Commission. In the past eight years, Roper has built the FSC from its first days as a body independent of government. He inherited from his predecessor an organisation with a single assistant, a secretary and limited activities. He has shaped it into an agency with 20 staff, busy on new legislation and with tentacles stretching across the island's most important business sector. He has unusual views for someone in charge of supervision, however. 'The ideal regulation is no regulation at all,' he says. 'We've gone way past that. But we live in a world where regulation is flavour of the month. It would look bad if we didn't have good laws and regulations, even if people were well-behaved. 'We should not undermine individuals' own independent judgment, so they believe what was a jungle has been turned into a park and it doesn't matter what bench they sit on,' he says. 'All benches should always be looked at.' Roper is an imposing man with blunt views, who is given to wry turns of phrase. His importance is only likely to grow as Guernsey continues to shed what he calls 'the emotional attachment to the tomato', and turns more than ever to financial services as the mainstay of the economy. In spite of some painful rows with banks and other businesses behind the scenes, he seems to have earned at the very least a grudging respect from most of the institutions under his eye. The key, he believes, is to 'talk the hind legs off the banks' with his views then wait for them to make these same proposals for change to the FSC and politicians in the belief that they are their own ideas. He stresses that Guernsey never set out to become an offshore centre, purposely setting low tax rates and devising favourable business structures to attract investment. But he concedes that things have changed. 'We were not an artificial offshore centre,' he says. 'But we have become a little artificial with competition.' What he says he is keen to avoid is the prospect of a US judge hearing a court case and frowning when Guernsey is mentioned as 'one of those places'  -some form of shady tax haven. He has sent a clear message recently that asset protection trusts should not be encouraged on the island, for example. Aside from the new insurance and banking laws, he is also looking at future legislation on fiduciaries - something which Britain appears to have abandoned as too complex, but which is being discussed in Jersey. Mr Roper was born in Spain and in 1936 his family fled to England where they moved between a succession of boarding houses. 'We were a typical middle class family without the money,' he says. Despite the unfamiliar culture and the restlessness, he managed to gain a place at Oxford University in the mid 1950s, where he studied politics, philosophy and economics. But he says he still harboured a sense of insecurity. That, he believes, helped put him and keep him at the Bank of England for most of his working career. The Bank acted 'like a womb' for him as he rose to eventually become senior manager for banking supervision. On arrival in Guernsey, he rapidly hired two other senior regulators to join him at the FSC. His attachment to the Bank shows in the approach he believes has been adopted by his agency. 'What I offer is reasonable regulation, very much in the British style, that concentrates on understanding business and adapting to its circumstances, rather than knowing our own rules and reciting them like a parrot,' he says. It's a tremendous tightrope; we want to be flexible and even-handed. Mr Roper's first significant contact with Guernsey came in the 1970s when he was involved at the Bank in dealing with Barnett Christie, the local institution involved in imprudent loans, which remains one of the island's few public financial embarrassments. When the newly-created FSC went to the Bank looking for a candidate to take one of the two top jobs in 1986, he applied, in part because he was so frustrated with commuting. Initially he went on secondment, careful to sample the waters before making too big a commitment. Now he is longing to sell his London house and sever the final ties with the mainland. Like many of his transplanted colleagues, he talks constantly about 'us' and 'we' when referring to Guernsey. Looking forward, Mr Roper says he plans to stay in office until March 1997. But any of his enemies hoping he might then seek a quiet retirement will be disappointed. He hopes to stand for election, not focused on purely local issues, but as what he calls a 'national politician'.</p>

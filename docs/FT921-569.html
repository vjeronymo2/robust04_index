			<p>920328 FT  28 MAR 92 / International Company News: Sabena clears hurdle in Air France deal BELGIAN legislators yesterday propelled Sabena, the ailing state airline, further towards its long-awaited partnership with Air France, the French national carrier, when they approved a law transforming the airline into an ordinary company, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. Officially, the airline is open to any partnership, but Air France is thought to be the only serious suitor. The link-up will probably involve Air France injecting some BFr6bn (Dollars 175.4m) into Sabena and taking a 37.5 per cent stake, but a formal decision has been delayed since last October.</p>

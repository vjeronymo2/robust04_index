			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONGRESS AND ADMINISTRATION SIDESTEP LONG-TERM PROBLEMS  </P> <P> I am pleased (but saddened) to have validated by this article the many thoughts  I hold regarding the future of this country and Washington's ease at ignoring  them.  </P> <P> What can the ordinary citizen do? I volunteer my time trying to help solve  local issues, but these do not reflect the serious lack of leadership (in both  parties) on the national level.  </P> <P> It seems apparent that our chosen leaders are so weakened by the desire to  remain in office that they are powerless to act on critical issues facing this  country and the world.  </P> <P> JANIS H.

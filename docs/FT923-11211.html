			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Iraq may yield to UN probe: Military strike threatened unless Baghdad allows weapons inspection IRAQ made a conciliatory gesture in its tussle with the United Nations over weapons inspections last night, as the US, Britain and France were on the verge of giving Baghdad an ultimatum threatening military action. Iraq's UN ambassador said he 'got the impression' Baghdad would give a 'very positive' response today to compromise proposals from the UN on how to carry out the inspections. The apparent climb-down came as the western powers prepared a formal ultimatum, warning that Iraq faces a military strike unless it allows UN inspectors access to its weapons of mass destruction programme. Baghdad has been refusing to let an inspection team into an agriculture ministry building which the UN believes has documents about Iraq's nuclear programme and possibly about chemical weapons. As the crisis neared a climax, President George Bush yesterday cancelled plans to be away from Washington at the weekend. He had planned to stay at his holiday home in Kennebunkport, Maine. But instead he will meet top national security advisers today at the presidential retreat of Camp David, near Washington. US officials earlier confirmed that the ultimatum - possibly issued in the name of the UN secretary-general or Security Council but open to others to join - might come this weekend and could require Iraqi compliance within a matter of days. Though confirming moves to draw up an ultimatum, British officials in London warned against assuming that military action was a foregone conclusion. They felt there was a reasonable chance President Saddam Hussein would 'blink' once he understood the western powers were serious in threatening force. Mr Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN inspection commission, appeared hopeful last night the crisis might be resolved without military measures, following two rounds of talks in New York with Dr Abdul Amir al-Anbari, the Iraqi delegate to the UN. Apparently signalling a shift in attitudes, Mr al-Anbari said: 'My feeling is that the crisis will be solved in a satisfactory way - to the satisfaction of the UN and the Iraqi government.' After speaking by telephone to an unnamed minister in Baghdad, he said he would have Iraq's response by today to proposals put by Mr Ekeus. 'I got the impression that will be very positive,' he said. Military contingency plans are a close secret, but it is assumed US, British and French aircraft would lead any renewed bombing of Iraqi targets. The Pentagon said there were 21,000 US servicemen in the Gulf area, mostly aboard 17 warships. Military sites poor target, Page 2</p>

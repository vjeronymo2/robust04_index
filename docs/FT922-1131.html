			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Ukraine and Russia break fleet deadlock UKRAINE and Russia yesterday ended months of tension with a decision to draw up a treaty normalising their relations and an agreement, in principle, on the division of the contested Black Sea fleet. The summit meeting of Mr Boris Yeltsin and Mr Leonid Kravchuk, held yesterday in the Black Sea resort of Dagomys, was the first to be held by the Russian and Ukrainian presidents since the collapse of the Soviet Union. It follows a long-running dispute over the fleet and Ukrainian fears of Russian domination. However, in a notably friendly atmosphere, the presidents vowed to work towards a broad political treaty that would entrench a new bilateral relationship. This was in sharp contrast to the CIS meetings, which have been characterised by friction and disagreement between the two states. The presidents agreed, in principle, that the Black Sea fleet should be divided between the two states, in shares to be agreed, and that ports would be jointly used and maintained. As Mr Kravchuk pointed out, this decision, which still leaves the prickliest problem of the actual division unresolved, marks a change in that it cuts the Commonwealth of Independent States' military structure out of the negotiations. Despite the two presidents' assertions that the CIS will not perish, bilateral Russian-Ukrainian meetings, which are to become regular events, seem likely to replace the CIS as the arena in which disputes between the two largest former Soviet republics are resolved. Headway was also made on the economic front, with agreement reached on a mechanism for the introduction of a separate Ukrainian currency and a quid pro quo shift to world trade prices. However, the two Slavic giants skirted around other more contentious political disputes, such as the Crimea.</p>

			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> NOT EVERYONE LIKES THE NAME, BUT THESE GUYS REALLY ARE NASTY  </P> <P> Randy Myers was the originator of the nickname. He thought it was appropriate  that the Cincinnati Reds' bullpen be called "the Nasty Boys."  </P> <P> Because of the volatile behavior of Rob Dibble and Norm Charlton, and his own  loony act, they should be grouped together, particularly considering he was  going to be the bullpen stopper.  </P> <P> "I really wish everyone would forget about that label," Dibble said. "I got  enough trouble living down my reputation. I think hitters hate us as it is. We  don't need anything else to psych them up."  </P> <P> But there it was Friday, for all the world to see. The Reds, clinging to a 2-1  lead, put Dibble into the game for 1 1/3 innings, and Myers into the game for  the final 1 2/3 innings.  </P> <P> The Pirates didn't have a chance. They failed to get a hit in the final three  innings, their only offense consisting of two walks.  </P> <P> "There's no question as to why they call those guys the nasty boys," Pirate  Manager Jim Leyland said. "They're aggressive pitchers. They're outstanding.  They're, well, nasty."  </P> <P> Said Pirate outfielder Barry Bonds: "They say Dibble is one of the best control  pitchers in the game, but when I'm up to bat against him, it looks like he  doesn't know where the ball's going.  </P> <P> "I didn't bat against him today, and I'm glad."  </P> <P> The Reds' bullpen is the reason they are given a chance to win this series. The  Pirates may be the more dominant team, particularly with their all-star  outfield, but the Cincinnati bullpen is its mainstay.  </P> <P> "That gives us a big advantage," Red catcher Joe Oliver said. "With our  bullpen, we tell our starters just to go six innings. We don't want them to go  any more. Just give us a hard six."  </P> <P> There will be one more National League playoff game and two American League  playoff games beginning in mid-afternoon this fall.  </P> <P> The Pirates and Reds warned that, as in Friday's game, the sun problems could  make those games ugly.  </P> <P> "During this time of the year, it's ridiculous everywhere to play at that  time," Pittsburgh's Gary Redus said. "Ask any player who takes batting practice  late in the season. It's almost impossible to see because of the low afternoon  sun. And they are playing these games at the same time we usually take batting  practice?"  </P> <P> Said teammate Andy Van Slyke: "Let me tell how bad it was (Friday). There is a  fly ball hit to me in center field, and I don't even know that it is hit to me  until I look at the infielders and they are all staring at me. I figure, then,  the ball is in my vicinity and I should catch it."  </P> <P> Added Cincinnati's Barry Larkin: "I just don't know why they are starting at  this time."  </P> <P> The answer, of course, is television -- and CBS' reluctance to interfere with  certain prime-time scheduling.  </P> <P> When asked whether television was controlling baseball, Commissioner Fay  Vincent said: "Let me ask you -- is advertising controlling newspapers? I will  just say that television is very important to baseball."  </P> <P> Vincent added: "The dates for these playoff games were determined by the  lockout (last spring). Under those circumstances, we are actually very  fortunate that television was able to accommodate us."  </P> <P> Pirate third baseman Jeff King was forced to leave the game in the second  inning with a bruised lower back. He suffered the injury sliding into second  base when he was picked off.  </P> <P> "It's nothing serious," he said. "I dived back into second base a million times  during the course of the year, and this time, I just felt a little pain. I  think a few days' rest and I'll be fine."  </P> <P> Danny Jackson, the Reds' Game 3 starter against Pittsburgh's Zane Smith Monday,  snapped when asked about shoulder problems that have periodically sidelined him  this season.  </P> <P> "This is the last time I am going to answer this question," he said. "I am  fine. There is nothing wrong with me. I want no more questions about this."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Bill Plaschke contributed to this story.  </P></p>

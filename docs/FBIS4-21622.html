			<p>BFN     [Text] Tsuruga, Fukui Pref., April 5 KYODO -- Japan's new  plutonium-fueled fast breeder reactor "Monju" reached  criticality Tuesday morning [5 April] in Tsuruga, Fukui  Prefecture, on the Sea of Japan coast.    Criticality is the point at which the reaction in the  reactor's fissionable material is sufficient to sustain a chain  reaction.    It was attained at 10:01 A.M. when workers at the  governmental Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp.  (Donen) in Monju pulled the last of 19 control rods to a point  just short of its total removal from the reactor.    Gradual removal of the last rod, at the center of the  reactor, began in four stages from shortly before 9 A.M.,  allowing the reactor to reach criticality with it 70 percent  removed.    The goal was achieved eight years and six months after  construction of the plant got under way in October 1985 and  after three postponements.    Start-up of the 600 billion yen plant was delayed for a  third  time last October because of a technical malfunction in fuel  production facilities last July.    The reactor is fueled by a mixture of plutonium oxide and  uranium oxide.    Japan has made fast breeder reactors, which produce more  fissionable material than they consume, a cornerstone of its  nuclear power policy.    The power industry intends to have two fully operational  fast  breeder reactors built by 2003.    The Monju reactor has the capacity to produce 280,000  kilowatts of electricity.    The Monju core contains a total of 1.4 tons of reactor-grade  plutonium and 4.5 tons of depleted uranium.    Monju represents the third stage in the government's plan to  develop a fast breeder reactor, beginning with an earlier  experimental reactor "Joyo" which reached criticality in 1977 in  Oarai, Ibaraki Prefecture.    Scientists say Monju-style reactors use fuel 60 times more  efficiently than conventional uranium reactors.    One of the features of Monju is its use of liquid sodium  coolant which has a high heat conducting capacity.    The reactor is scheduled to go on line supplying electricity  from April 1995 and become a commercially operating supplier by  December the same year.    Several industrialized countries which were developing fast  breeder reactors have shut down their projects, citing high  costs and safety factors.    Some international critics say that since the Cold War is  over, Japan should not rely on fast breeder reactors for energy  self-sufficiency because they produce fuel that can be diverted  to nuclear weapons.    Residents near the reactor are still fighting suits in the  courts against Donen and the government urging a halt to the  construction and running of the reactor.    But the power industry has welcomed the criticality of Monju  as a step toward the commercialization of fast breeder reactors.    A meeting of the heads of nine of the nation's major power  suppliers in January outlined plans for producing 6.6 million  kilowatts of power from fast breeder reactors, the first of  which would begin construction soon after 2000 in time for  commercial operation by 2003.    A fully operational fast breeder reactor costs an estimated  400 billion yen, about 1.5 times the cost of a light water  reactor.    At present, some 30 percent of Japan's electricity is  generated by 42 nuclear reactors throughout the country.    Japan by 2010 will be annually using some 50 tons of  plutonium mixed with uranium for light-water reactors and about  35 tons more for fast breeder reactors, according to the  country's energy plan.</p>

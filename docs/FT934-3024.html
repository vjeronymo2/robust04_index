			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Standard Chartered in Pounds 100m preference issue Standard Chartered, the UK-based international banking group, yesterday strengthened its capital base with a Pounds 100m issue of non-cumulative preference shares, writes John Gapper. The issue raises its core tier 1 ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets. Standard's share price has risen sharply recently, driven by its exposure to emerging markets in the Asia Pacific region. But there has been speculation over whether it would be forced into a rights issue to strengthen capital. The bank is also exposed to the appreciation of the dollar against sterling because its capital is sterling-denominated, while most of its assets are in currencies which are more closely linked to the dollar. It has had a lower ratio of tier 1 capital - comprising equity, risk capital including non-cumulative preference shares, and retained earnings - to its risk-weighted assets than many US and European banks. The issue, which was jointly placed by J Henry Schroder Wagg, Cazenove and Salamon Brothers, will raise its tier 1 ratio of 5.4 per cent by 50 basis points, and its total capital ratio of 10.7 per cent by a percentage point. A sterling rather than a dollar issue is thought to have been chosen because of regulatory requirements in the US, and because dollar preference shares would only provide a limited hedge against currency movements. Non-cumulative preference shares are counted by the Bank of England towards regulatory tier 1 capital because they are considered to carry investor risk. The issue was placed at a net yield of 7.375 per cent. The shares lost 8p to 1229p.</p>

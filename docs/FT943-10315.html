			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney shares lifted by result of rights issue Shares in Euro Disney, the theme park operator, jumped by 7.5 per cent to FFr10.75 yesterday, following the announcement that its FFr5.95bn (Dollars 1.1bn) rights issue had been 80 per cent subscribed. The smooth completion of the rights issue will come as welcome news to Euro Disney, which was forced to implement a rescue package after losses of FFr5.3bn last year. The rights issue, which will be used to reduce debts of about FFr16bn, excluding convertible bonds, is a central element of the FFr13bn recovery package. The result prompted a satisfied reaction from Euro Disney. 'Given the current market conditions and the timing of the rights issue, we are pleased with the level of subscription and the confidence expressed by its shareholders,' the company said. An analyst described the result as 'respectable, rather than spectacular'. After accounting for the 49 per cent of the issue which was taken up by Walt Disney, the US entertainment group and parent company, the result meant that about 40 per cent of individual investors did not subscribe to the issue. The consortium of about 60 banks which underwrote the balance of the issue have been left with about FFr1.2bn of Euro Disney shares. They can sell their share of the issue to Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal, the Saudi investor, who will buy shares that are left over at the FFr10 issue price. According to Banque Nationale de Paris, which lead the issue with Banque Indosuez, the underwriting banks will have until the end of next week to decide what to do with their shares. 'Most are likely to seek a clean exit and to sell their holdings to the prince,' said one analyst. The relatively high subscription rate suggests Prince Al-Waleed will not reach the limit of 24 per cent of Euro Disney's capital - set as his maximum holding.</p>

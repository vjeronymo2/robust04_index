			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Batygin: "I Want to Talk to People. </F> The President Spent Yesterday at Work in the Moscow Region"]    [Text] B. Yeltsin's schedule began in the morning with a  visit to Lyuberetskiy Rayon.    "It isn't working out right," he joked during a conversation  with the journalists accompanying him. "I have been to Tula, to  Amur Oblast, I have been to the south and the north as well, but  I rarely get to visit the Moscow region..."    As Boris Nikolayevich explained, he has several aims during  his tour of Moscow Oblast. The first is to visit the Soyuz  Science-and-Production Association in Lyuberetskiy Rayon, which  is one of the flagships of the country's defense industry. In  the afternoon the president was due to have meetings with rural  workers in Ramenskiy Rayon.    "I want to talk to people and find out what their thoughts  and concerns are," B. Yeltsin said.    In the morning the president's helicopter touched down at  the  city of Dzerzhinskiy. The science-and-production association  there, which was created in 1947 to develop compound solid fuels  for strategic missiles, operational-tactical missiles, and  anti-air missiles, ballistite propellant for the artillery, and  so forth (it would take a full page to carry on listing the  association's "merits"), has a mighty scientific and technical  potential. Under the conversion program the association is  presently developing and producing synthetic diamonds and tools  based on them, industrial explosives, aerosol fire  extinguishers, medicinal preparations, and much other "peacetime  output."    Civilian output now represents 70 percent of the  association's total volume. Unfortunately, even a "firm" as  powerful as this cannot boast of stability because in the tough  conditions of the reforms its process of becoming established is  fraught with considerable difficulties. The scientific nucleus  at Soyuz consists of dozens of doctors and candidates of  sciences but its "think tank" also requires renewal and support  today. For example, half a billion rubles are needed for the  training of scientific staff while the upkeep of the test and  experiment base will cost the budget 5.4 billion.    It emerged that Boris Nikolayevich's interest extends not  just to the specific concerns worrying the Soyuz collective.  The leaders of defense enterprises in the Moscow Oblast also  came here, to Dzerzhinskiy, yesterday.    "I hope that from their example I will gain a better feel  for  the defense sector's problems and understand what has to be  done," the President stressed.    Boris Nikolayevich was asked the following question: In his  opinion, how is the process of stabilization in the country  progressing?    "All the signs are there that the economy is recovering,"  was  his answer. "The first is that for five months now the  inflation rate has been running at 8-9 percent, and yet it had  been as high as 26 percent! Secondly, in June the rise in  prices did not exceed 5.5 percent whereas in the past two years  that indicator was never less than 10 percent. Finally, the  slump in industrial production stopped in June. All these  preconditions inspire the hope that the economy is getting back  to an even keel. We believe that by the end of the year we will  reach a civilized level of inflation -- 5-6 percent.    "The political situation in society is stabilizing," the  president added. "The Treaty on [Social] Accord is working and  life has become more peaceful. Support the Edict on the fight  against crime!"    After a conference with the defense workers (held behind  closed doors) B. Yeltsin paid a lightning visit to the  Nikolo-Ugreshskiy monastery, which is next door to the Soyuz  Science-and-Production Association.</p>

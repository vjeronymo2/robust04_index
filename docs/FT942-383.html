			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Expanding Lowndes Lambert advances 28% to Pounds 13.2m Lowndes Lambert, the insurance broker, yesterday announced the acquisition for Pounds 4.65m of WHH, a rival company based in Preston, Lancashire. The announcement accompanied the group's results for the 12 months to March 31, showing a 28 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 13.2m. Earnings per share increased by 13 per cent to 31.7p (28p). A proposed final dividend of 10p makes 15p (13.5p) for the year - an increase of 11 per cent. The acquisition strengthens the group's position in the provincial UK market, where it believes many medium-sized commercial companies are becoming increasingly interested in the kind of risk management and assessment services offered by Lowndes. Lowndes said it had first made contact with WHH four months ago. The company, which has offices in Leeds, Preston, Birmingham and Maidstone and also owns Watts Watts, a Lloyd's broker, generated some Pounds 4m of income in 1993. The deal was financed through a vendor placing of 1.09m new ordinary shares at 381 1/2 p, raising Pounds 4.15m, plus 132,370 shares to be retained by vendors. Lowndes reported that its brokerage income increased from Pounds 53.7m to Pounds 64.9m, including the income earned by Norex, a broking operation acquired in May last year. Expenses rose by 8 per cent to Pounds 57.9m (Pounds 49.6m), leaving broking profits of Pounds 7m (Pounds 4.1m). Interest receivable was unchanged at Pounds 3.8m.</p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Galliford halved as margins decline A SHARP decline in margins in a depressed construction market and reduced interest income halved pre-tax profit at Galliford in the year to June 30. Pre-tax profit at the Leicestershire-based group, which is involved in construction, specialist contracting and housing, fell to Pounds 3.03m (Pounds 6.39m) on reduced turnover of Pounds 213m (Pounds 225m). Interest income fell to Pounds 500,000 (Pounds 1.5m) after Pounds 6m cash was used to finance the debt of its joint-venture partner that went into liquidation in March 1991. The directors decided last year to acquire the outstanding 50 per cent shareholding and a Pounds 2.18m exceptional charge had been provided for. A reduced exceptional charge of Pounds 703,000 this time resulted mainly from redundancies. Mr Peter Galliford, the chairman, said that with tender margins in the construction sector under severe pressure on reduced volume of work available, the group had concentrated activity in the less depressed sectors of social housing and water. Profit in the construction division plunged to Pounds 1.62m (Pounds 4.73m) on turnover of Pounds 129m (Pounds 135m), reflecting the sharp competition in the open tender market. Private housebuilding remained static at Pounds 1.87m (Pounds 1.9m) on increased turnover of Pounds 8.78m (Pounds 7.89m). Completions were up 11 per cent on the previous year, Losses deepened in the material supplies and distribution division to Pounds 931,000 (Pounds 229,000) in difficult trading conditions. Improved profits from the specialist contracting division to Pounds 393,000 (Pounds 55,000) resulted from pipeline services and tiling although reduced piling demand caused losses at rock and alluvium. Earnings per share fell 48 per cent to 2.37p (4.57p). The dividend for the year is maintained at 4.3p with an unchanged final of 3.35p.</p>

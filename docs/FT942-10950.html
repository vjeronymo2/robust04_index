			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Offshore worries I am South-African born and have been UK-resident for 15 consecutive years although I do not have UK domicile. I have investments, accrued income and gains held offshore. All originated offshore with no funds from the UK. 1. If, after 17 consecutive years' residence, the Inland Revenue declares me to be UK-domiciled, what would be the tax position of my offshore holdings? 2. If I die before my domicile changes, what would be the tax position of the holdings? Your being born outside the UK is of no relevance to your domicile or origin (although, presumably, you have established that you are, in fact, domiciled overseas). As you have been resident in the UK (for income tax purposes) since some time in 1979-80, you will be treated (for inheritance tax purposes only) as domiciled within the UK with effect from April 6 1995, by virtue of section 267(1)(b) of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984. It is possible that the IHT consequences of that deemed domicile may be modified by the terms of a double taxation agreement with your country of actual domicile (but, as you do not wish to disclose the name of that country, we cannot comment further). Your UK income and capital gains tax liabilities will continue to be based upon your actual domicile (under English law, so long as you remain in England). If you die before April 6 1995, your assets located outside the UK should escape inheritance tax. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

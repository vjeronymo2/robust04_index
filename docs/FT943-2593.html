			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Price curb campaign launched China is redoubling its efforts to contain inflation with a new campaign to curb rises in the prices of grain, cotton and chemical fertiliser. Beijing also promised at the weekend a drive to recoup unpaid taxes, to overcome an expected revenue shortfall this year. Tax receipts have fallen well short of expectations. The government also said it was strengthening its prices surveillance to 'stop unauthorised rises in grain, edible oil, meat, eggs and vegetables'. The latest anti-inflation drive reflects official concern over signs of a renewed acceleration of prices following some slowing this year. Figures published last week by the State Statistical Bureau showed that consumer prices in China's 35 main cities rose 27.1 per cent during the year to August, compared with 24.2 during the year to July. The surge prompted an announcement by a worried leadership that fighting inflation would be the government's main priority for the rest of this year. In his work report to the annual session of China's parliament this year, Premier Li Peng said the government would strive to contain price rises nationally to 9 per cent; but that figure has since been revised to 15 per cent. This compares with the national retail price index of 13 per cent last year. Western economists say the government will have its work cut out to bring inflation below 20 per cent by the end of the year. Meanwhile, one of China's top tax officials has sounded the alarm about difficulties collecting taxes under a new tax regime introduced at the beginning of this year. Mr Xiang Huaichen, deputy director of the State Administration of Taxation, said tax inspectors were being urged to step up efforts to retrieve unpaid taxes. According to Mr Xiang, taxes collected from industrial and commercial sectors, which account for the bulk of taxes, were just 64 per cent of the total due in the first eight months of the year. 'We face a hard task getting the remaining 36 per cent in the next four months,' he told the official Xinhua newsagency. China budgeted for a deficit of Yn66.9bn (Pounds 5bn) this year, but total obligations, including debt service, will exceed Yn100bn. Unexpectedly low tax receipts are putting pressure on the budget. A senior Chinese economist has warned of the risks to agricultural production of the loss of arable land. Mr Li Jiange, deputy director of the State Securities Regulatory Commission, blamed 'inadequate agricultural production' for pressure on prices. China was losing 270,000 hectares of arable land each year while adding 14m citizens, he said.</p>

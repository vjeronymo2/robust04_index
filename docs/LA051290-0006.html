			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DEFENSE'S WITNESSES SHAKY IN TRAFFIC-ARGUMENT KILLING  </P> <P> The testimony of two defense witnesses in the preliminary hearing of Howard F.  Barton Jr. backfired Friday when they ended up giving testimony favorable to  the prosecution while questioned by defense attorney Clyde Munsell.  </P> <P> Munsell subpoenaed William Collins and Patrick Leal, hoping they would testify  about what he alleged was a pattern of violent behavior by Marco Sanchez on the  morning of Feb. 22.  </P> <P> Sanchez, 24, a National City resident, was shot to death by Barton that day in  the 1000 block of Garnet Avenue in Pacific Beach after a traffic altercation  with Barton's daughter.  </P> <P> Despite testimony from several witnesses who said Barton was the aggressor,  Munsell is claiming that Barton acted in self-defense. Barton, who is charged  with murder, was armed with a 9-millimeter handgun. A number of witnesses  testified that they did not see a weapon in Sanchez's hands.  </P> <P> On Friday, Collins took the stand, and his testimony was immediately challenged  by Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Chappell. Munsell countered that Collins' testimony  was relevant because it would show Sanchez was driving recklessly 30 minutes  before he was killed by Barton.  </P> <P> Municipal Judge Rafael A. Arreola ruled that whatever Collins saw 30 minutes  before the shooting was irrelevant to the crime Barton is charged with.  </P> <P> However, Arreola said Munsell could ask Collins if he saw a traffic altercation  between Barton's daughter, Andrea, and Sanchez at Ingraham Street and Grand  Avenue, which occurred about 15 minutes before the shooting.  </P> <P> Collins answered that he did not see the beginning of the altercation, but saw  Andrea Barton speed up in her Trans Am and cut in front of the red Ford that  Sanchez was driving.  </P> <P> His testimony supported the testimony of Delicia Goodwin, Sanchez's 13-year-old  sister-in-law, who testified Thursday. Delicia said that Andrea Barton provoked  the traffic incident, which led to the shooting. A police report said Andrea  Barton's car stalled at the intersection, backing up traffic. Sanchez's red  Ford was behind the woman's car.  </P> <P> Delicia was a passenger in Sanchez's car. The teen-ager testified that Andrea  Barton started her stalled car and sped up after Sanchez went around her and  pulled suddenly in front of Sanchez, forcing him to swerve to another lane.  </P> <P> Before Collins testified, Munsell told the judge that Collins had seen Sanchez  force Andrea Barton off the road. Munsell told the judge that Collins was "very  concerned" about the woman's safety after the near-collision with Sanchez and  stopped to see if she was all right.  </P> <P> While Munsell was explaining Collins' alleged actions on behalf of Andrea  Barton, Collins blurted out from the witness stand:  </P> <P> "First of all, you've got two things wrong."  </P> <P> Collins said he did not stop to assist Andrea Barton. Instead, Collins said, he  stopped at a convenience store across the street from Howard Barton's real  estate office on Cass Street, where Andrea Barton went after the confrontation  with Sanchez.  </P> <P> "I yelled across the street, 'Are you all OK?' She said, 'Did you see what that  . . . did?' " Collins testified.  </P> <P> Howard and Andrea Barton left the real estate office and went looking for  Sanchez. The Bartons found him shopping for shoes inside the Cal Stores on  Garnet Avenue, where an angry Howard Barton confronted Sanchez.  </P> <P> Leal, who was Munsell's other witness, manages the shoe department at the Cal  Stores. He testified that he saw a heated argument involving the Bartons and  Sanchez inside the store. Leal said Howard Barton appeared angry and  aggressive.  </P> <P> "It was my opinion that Barton was the aggressor. . . . He seemed to be the  loudest and seemed to make aggressive physical gestures at Sanchez," Leal  testified.  </P> <P> Munsell attempted to minimize the damage done by Leal's testimony. He asked the  witness if he saw Barton hit Sanchez. Leal said Barton never hit Sanchez.  Sanchez did not argue back and instead looked at Barton and shook his head,  Leal testified.  </P> <P> Friday proved not to be a good day for Munsell, who is trying to convince the  judge that Barton was justified in fatally shooting Sanchez.  </P> <P> The defense attorney tried Thursday and Friday, without much success, to elicit  witness testimony to support his theory that Sanchez's state of mind on the day  of the shooting led to a potential for violence, which put Barton and his  daughter in imminent danger.  </P> <P> Arreola has expressed doubt that Barton will be able to prove his theory. The  judge has repeatedly noted the lapse of time between the traffic altercation  and Sanchez's death.  </P> <P> However, Munsell remains undeterred.  </P> <P> On Friday, he announced plans to put Gloria Sanchez, Sanchez's widow, on the  stand as a defense witness. The irony of trying to put the victim's widow on  the stand to give favorable testimony for her husband's killer was not lost on  some attorneys in the audience.  </P> <P> "Good luck, Clyde," said one lawyer.  </P> <P> The judge asked Munsell what testimony he hoped to elicit from Gloria Sanchez,  who was not at the shooting scene.  </P> <P> "I will ask her questions which will aid me in assessing Sanchez's driving  abilities and propensity for erratic driving and potential for violence,"  Munsell said. " . . . I will ask about habits Sanchez had to help me understand  his bizarre behavior."  </P> <P> Munsell said he also wants to ask Gloria Sanchez about Marco Sanchez's alleged  use of drugs and alcohol.  </P> <P> That prompted an angry retort from prosecutor Chappell. She told Arreola that  Munsell has a copy of Sanchez's toxicology tests, showing that there were no  drugs or alcohol in his system when he was killed.  </P> <P> Patricia Sifka, an attorney representing Gloria Sanchez in a $19-million civil  lawsuit against Howard Barton, told Arreola that she will object to using the  widow's testimony on grounds of marital privilege and relevance.  </P> <P> Arreola said he will decide Monday if Gloria Sanchez can be forced to testify.  </P></p>

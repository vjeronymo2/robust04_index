			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Firefighters split on strike ballot THE WATCH at Southwark fire station in central London is divided about how to vote in the strike ballot that starts next Monday. 'I can't afford to go on strike,' said Mr Bill Horlock, coming off his Saturday all-night duty. 'But there is a good cause for one.' The majority of firefighters at Southwark, as elsewhere in the capital, are not in a militant mood. 'We don't want to go out of the door,' explained one of them. 'There is a feeling of despondency here.' A recent straw poll taken among all the London brigades found a majority against strike action, though this was less overwhelming a verdict than earlier in the summer when as many as 70 per cent said they opposed possible industrial action. 'The real doubt is what will happen to our pay formula next year,' says Mr Ted Ciplinksi. 'Our employers say we will have it in full but many firefighters don't trust the government to allow this to happen. 'I've no doubt we would have voted against a strike call before Kenneth Clarke (the chancellor) announced a second year of public sector wage restraint. Now we are not so sure.' Mr Horlock agrees. 'We would have swallowed the pay formula's suspension for a year but we wonder whether the local authorities will be able to afford to meet the award in 1994 without borrowing from the government.' Another Southwark firefighter says: 'Our motto is we will never be rich but we will also never be poor.' With pay linked to the upper quartile of male manual earnings since 1978, the fire service is not a pace-setter in pay. Awards are a catch-up with the private sector. Pay averages just over Pounds 300 a week and firefighters' labour costs make up 2 per cent of local government's. But firefighters fear that if they do go on strike, even just for 24 hours, they will be locked out by their employers.</p>

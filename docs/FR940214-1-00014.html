Charter parties and liner booking contracts may not contain a specified detention rate. The ocean carrier shall be entitled to reimbursement, as damages for detention, all time so lost, for each calendar day or any part of the calendar day, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.

Time calculated as detention shall not count as laytime. Reimbursement for such detention shall be payable no later than upon the vessel's arrival at the first port of discharge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

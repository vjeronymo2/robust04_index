			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> QUAKE PREDICTION DOWNPLAYED  </P> <P> A projection of a major earthquake in the Midwest in early December is about as  reliable as a random guess, a group of scientists said today.  </P> <P> "Such a projection, especially at the predicted 50-50 chance level, implies a  level of detailed knowledge . . . that simply does not exist for the New Madrid  or any other fault zone in the world," the group said in its report.  </P> <P> The 11 scientists were brought together from universities and governmental  agencies to evaluate the scientific validity of Iben Browning's projection of a  50% chance of a big quake hitting the New Madrid Fault about Dec. 3.  </P></p>

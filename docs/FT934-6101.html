			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Technology: Less heat in the kitchen - Worth Watching Few top-class restaurant kitchens would be complete without heat and bustle. But the demands of the environment, as well as rising fuel bills, could mean the heat will soon be decreased. David Burnett Associates, of London, has devised a gadget to cut the gas without reducing a chef's creativity. Many chefs leave the gas ring burning after removing the saucepan. The AFR (automatic flame regulator) is a valve which complements the manual gas control. A rod attached to the valve opens and closes it; when the pan is removed the lever rises and the valve closes, when the pan is replaced the valve opens and the gas flames burn again.

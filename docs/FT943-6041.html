			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Banks' financial secrets to be revealed Much of the secrecy surrounding banks' financial statements in Hong Kong is to be abolished, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) said yesterday, writes Simon Holberton. The changes, which were welcomed by Hong Kong's investment community, mean that for the first time investors will know the true profits made by banks in the colony. In the past banks have been able to disguise their true position by transfers to or from secret balance sheet reserves. The authority said banks with accounting periods ending on or after December 31 this year will be required to disclose all transfers to and from these reserves. In addition, banks will be required to provide much more detail about the structure of their loans and deposits than they have been required to do. This will make it easier to understand the structure of bank balance sheets. The HKMA said the colony's banks will be able to keep secret the amount they have already salted away in inner reserves, but by disclosing the amount of the transfer to or from reserves, analysts will be able to infer the true profit position of banks. The authority said it would review its policy on disclosure of inner reserves in mid-1995. The Hong Kong stock exchange's listing rules will be amended to make compliance with the disclosure provisions mandatory for listed banks. To date, only HSBC Holdings and its listed subsidiary Hang Seng Bank, fully disclose their financial position. Mr Herbert Hui, a stock exchange executive director, said the changes to banks' reporting would enhance considerably the transparency of local bank reporting. Mrs Laura Cha, an executive director of the Securities and Futures Commission, Hong Kong's corporate watchdog, said the level of disclosure to be required exceeded that originally proposed by the stock exchange and SFC.</p>

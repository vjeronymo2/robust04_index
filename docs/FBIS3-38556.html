The Social Democratic Party  [SPD]-dominated laender chamber thus unanimously accepted Nehm,  who had been proposed by Federal Justice Minister Sabine  Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, of the Free Democratic Party [FDP].  The 52-year-old judge can now succeed Alexander von Stahl, who  had been assigned nonactive status by the minister in the wake  of the controversial antiterror operation of Bad Kleinen late  last June.

			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHIROPRACTIC CARE  </P> <P> Re: Article (Oct. 3) on chiropractors and hospitals:  </P> <P> The basic issue with chiropractors is: "Does chiropractic care, such as spinal  manipulation, really result in cost-effective treatment of musculoskeletal  problems?"  </P> <P> Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Arizona were mandated by the state to allow  chiropractic care for state-mandated insurance programs several years ago. When  they went back and looked at the cost of chiropractic care they found that for  the same conditions treated by general practitioners or orthopaedic surgeons  versus chiropractors, the cost of chiropractic care was two to three times  greater than the medical doctors' care.  </P> <P> Because of this evidence, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Arizona have  arbitrarily limited chiropractic care in their medical programs because of the  fear of runaway costs.  </P> <P> SANFORD H. ANZEL, M.D.  </P> <P> Clinical Professor of orthopedic surgery  </P> <P> UC Irvine  </P></p>

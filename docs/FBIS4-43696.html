In the first five months of the year, ENEL added,  the demand for electricity had risen by an overall 1.6 percent  over the same period in 1993.    In the industrial sector alone, ENEL said, the increase in  demand for May was 3 percent and was evident in all sectors  except construction.    According to ISTAT, the industrial sectors which showed the  greatest increases in production were: business machines, up 7.6  percent; clothing, 5 percent; automobiles, 4.5 percent;  petroleum production, 3.7 percent; and rubber and plastic, up 3  percent.    Running against this trend were the sectors of transport  means other than automobiles, down 14.1 percent; precision  instruments, off 9.2 percent; radio-television and  telecommunications devices, 8.7 percent; metal products, 8.1  percent; and the working of non- ferrous minerals, down 5  percent.    For the first four months of the year, ISTAT added, an  increase of 1.9 percent was recorded for the intermediate goods  sector and 0.8 percent for consumer goods, while investment good  dropped by 5.8 percent.

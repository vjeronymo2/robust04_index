			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, January 10 (KNS-KCNA) -- A central meeting of  activists of the General Association of Korean Residents in  Japan (Chongnyon) was held here Monday to thoroughly implement  the tasks facing Chongnyon in 1994 in hearty response to the New  Year teachings of the great leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song.    A message of greetings sent by the great leader  Generalissimo  Kim Il-song to Han Tok-su, chairman of the Central Standing  Committee of Chongnyon, on the new year was read out at the  meeting.    Yi Chin-kyu, first vice-chairman of the Chongnyon Central  Standing Committee, addressing the meeting, said one of the most  valuable achievements made by Chongnyon in its work in 1993 was  that officials of Chongnyon and compatriots in Japan came to  cherish deep in mind as never before the pride and honor of  having and following dear Comrade Kim Chong-il as their  illustrious leader.    Noting that 1994 is indeed a meaningful year preceding the  50th anniversary of August 15 national liberation, the 40th  founding anniversary of Chongnyon and the 17th meeting of  Chongnyon, he elaborated on the main tasks of the year.    He stressed that Chongnyon founded and built by the great  leader should develop into an overseas Koreans organisation of  chuche type unfailingly loyal to the dear leader, a more  powerful and viable organisation which struck its roots deep  among the Koreans in Japan, generation after generation.    He underscored the need to arouse all the compatriots in  Japan in the work to defend their national rights and upgrade  democratic national education and vigorously conduct a drive to  implement the "10-point programme of the great unity of the  whole nation for the Reunification of the country" as an  all-compatriots one and decisively step up external activities  to increase the ranks of supporters and sympathizers among the  Japanese people.    Officials of Chongnyon expressed their determination on the  new year at the meeting.    The meeting adopted a letter to Generalissimo Kim Il-song.</p>

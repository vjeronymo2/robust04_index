			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Amnesty urges SA security forces curb PROSPECTS for a peaceful transition to democracy in South Africa will be seriously threatened if the government fails to intervene effectively and impartially to stop violence and curb security force excesses, says a study today by human rights group Amnesty International. The 100 page report, 'South Africa - State of Fear,' provides a catalogue of security force involvement and complicity in political killings over the past two years, noting that more than 7,000 people were victims of political violence between January 1990 and March 1992. 'There seems to be little relation between the politics of negotiations about the 'new South Africa' taking place at the national level and the cynicism, distrust and fear evident at the grassroots,' the report says. It calls on the government 'at the highest level to acknowledge publicly that extrajudicial executions, torture and other grave human rights violations continue to be committed by members of the security forces and others acting apparently on their behalf or with their acquiescence.' Amnesty says the government should make it clear that all people responsible for such conduct will be brought to justice. Although it acknowledges abuses on all sides, Amnesty focuses on human rights violations committed by the government or its surrogates.</p>

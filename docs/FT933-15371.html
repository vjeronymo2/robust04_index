			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / World Trade News: A general agreement to put an end to the talk - There is a feeling that the new Uruguay Round deadline is for real THE long-dormant Uruguay Round of global trade talks will get under way again in Geneva on Monday when negotiators from the so-called Quad countries  -the US, the European Community, Japan and Canada - brief trading partners on their tariff-cutting deal reached in Tokyo this week. It is the signal the 100-plus nations taking part in the round have been waiting for since January, when US and EC negotiators failed in a last-ditch effort to come up with a market access package before President George Bush left office. Now trade officials have just five months to conclude the complex Uruguay Round package before US negotiating authority expires on December 15. This is the fourth successive end-of-year deadline for the round, launched in Uruguay in 1986 - but officials are adamant it is the last. 'Every indication suggests that this time the deadline is the deadline,' Mr Peter Sutherland, new director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, says warning of the many difficulties still ahead. The key problem areas are: Tariffs: The four-way accord between the world's biggest traders has to be accepted by all 111 Gatt members. This is because, under Gatt's non-discriminatory most-favoured-nation rule, they are entitled to benefit from the same trading terms. Developing nations may well feel the US has not done enough to cut its very high tariffs on textiles. Elimination of steel tariffs is conditional on concluding a Multilateral Steel Agreement which would outlaw most subsidies to the hard-pressed industry. But the 30-nation negotiations on an MSA, which resumed for two days in Geneva this week, are making little headway. Agriculture: The Quad agreement did not include a market access deal for agricultural products. These negotiations promise to be stormy. Japan and South Korea are refusing to relax their bans on imported rice, while the US and the 13-strong Cairns Group of farm-product exporting countries are pressing for better access to EC markets. Latin American banana producers have threatened to veto any Uruguay Round accord if the EC does not change its discriminatory banana import regime. Meanwhile, France has maintained its strong opposition to a deal between US and EC negotiators on overall cuts in farm subsidies. Services: The Quad countries did not reach any firm agreement on opening markets for foreign services, though trade officials in Geneva say enough progress was made for the broader negotiations to resume in earnest. In financial services, the US and EC will be pursuing further concessions from Japan and other Asian nations in bilateral talks. However, the US shows little sign of giving way on exempting shipping from multilateral disciplines, while the EC wants to continue restrictions on (mainly American) television programmes, films and videos. Rules package: Negotiators must finalise the draft package of rules known as the 'Final Act' drawn up by Mr Arthur Dunkel, Mr Sutherland's predecessor, in December 1991. Mr Sutherland said this week he was 'absolutely committed' to the Dunkel text as a basis for negotiation. The bulk of the draft, which runs to more than 400 pages, covers 15 subject areas and contains 26 separate agreements, was negotiated between trading partners. But, despite warnings that too many changes could lead to a general unstitching of the carefully balanced package, the US in particular is pushing for controversial amendments. In the minds of many trade diplomats, from both rich and poor countries, the biggest obstacle to a Uruguay Round accord may prove to be US insistence on the primacy of its national trade laws over multilateral agreements, especially in using or threatening unilateral sanctions against 'unfair' traders.</p>

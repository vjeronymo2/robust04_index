Their ages and differentiation are based  on micropaleontological and palinologic factors. Detailed  descriptions of the various formations are given along with site  locations and breakdowns of the oils, condensates and gases  noted. Seismic surveying and core sampling are used. The subsalt  system contains hydrocarbon accumulations and pools and has  mantles of argillaceous deposits and dense aphanitic carbonates.  The Lower Permian sand-and-clay deposit systems forms an  enormous clinoform containing claystones with small interlayers  of brownish-gray limestones, siltstones, sandstones and  gritstones. The sandstone-siltstone deposits decrease in  thickness from east to west and the gritstones, in the same  direction, are being replaced by sandy varieties. The system's  upper boundary runs along the bottom of a Lower Kungurian  Substage anhydrite seam, a logging marker for the depression's  eastern margin, and the lower runs along the roof of carbonates  in the Zhanazholian tectonic stage and a gamma-emitting band of  black terrigenous-siliceous-carbonaceous rocks in the rest of  the eastern margin. Part of the Lower Permian deposit system  overlies Gzhelian CL-I [Carbonate Layer I] rocks, some of which  show facies replacement by same-age deep-sea sediments of the  gamma-emitting band. The Lower Permian system covers the first  gamma-emitting band, which is spread above the CL-II carbonates,  which show facies replacement by deep-sea sediments further  west, toward the depression's central part. A second  gamma-emitting band below the first joins with it and covers  Lower Carboniferous Tula Horizon terrigenous deposits. Lower  Permian Sakmarian and Asselian deposits in the northern  extension of the North Embian uplift are carbonates overlying  the CL-I layer and covered by Middle Jurassic terrigenous  deposits. The Lower Permian deposits, located between reflecting  marker horizons, decrease in thickness from east to west and  from south to north, with complete or partial erosion noted at a  number of sites of the nearside zone of the Ostansuk depression,  the result of uplifting of the eastern margin area which forms  the Ural Folding System. The Lower Permian system gradually  sinks from east to west, from 2.3 km at the Ashchisay Fracture  confining the eastern part of the Pre-Caspian Depression to 5.6  km at the Shubarkuduk tectonic stage. A diagram is given of  various structural elements of the eastern margin, showing  various eastern margin boundary factures, sites, deposits and  uplifts with signs of oil and gas in subsalt deposits,  identified and assumed sections lacking Lower Carboniferous  terrigenous deposits and various tectonic stages. The isoclinal  Ostansuk platform depression is in the northeastern section of  the margin. The Lower Permian rock system is an oil source bed  with a high concentration of organic matter, basically  sapropelic with some humus, and the deposits also contain  various bitumens (some traces of epigenic type) and iron  components (ferrous, pyritic and ferric). Hydrocarbons in the  system have migrated to traps. Reference horizons (sandstones  and siltstones) 12-135 m thick contain oil-bearing horizons,  three Artinskian, four Sakmarian and one Asselian. The  oil-bearing layers have various filtration properties and flow  rates. Lower Permian deposit oil pools are dome types, but  erosion shearing may have resulted in stratigraphic oil pools  shielded by Kungurian deposits. The system's oils are brown and  dark brown, with traces of sulfur, paraffin, sulfate resins,  silica gel and asphalts. The methane-naphthene oils' hydrocarbon  composition consists mostly of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen with  traces of sulfur and nitrogen. The Gzhelian-Late Visean  carbonate rock system, widespread in the depression's eastern  section, consists of two layers, separated by Lower Podolskian  Horizon sand-and-clay deposits and located between reflecting  layers, and they were formed under shallow sea-basin shelf  conditions and subjected to erosion when they were above sea  level. Various limestones (organogenic-clastic, polydetrital,  clustered-lumpy and pelitomorphic) are present, with a few  dolomites. Various permeable seam traps exist. The lower layer's  carbonates show sulfate formation and tufagenous material is  present (feldspar crystals and some quartz). The system's upper  boundary runs along a roof of Gzhelian limestones and anhydrites  and the lower along a floor of Upper Visean limestones which lie  on top of Middle Visean Tula Horizon terrigenous rocks. The  Gzhelian-Late Podolskian upper carbonate layer (CL-I), located  between seismically reflecting layers, containing mostly  carbonates, with anhydrites in the northeast and terrigenous  deposits in the north, has four productive gas and oil pools  20-50 m thick. Upper Carboniferous upper gas and oil pools have  the best trap properties. Oils are mostly methane-naphthene  types, with sulfur, paraffin, resins and some asphalt, basically  composed of carbon and hydrogen with slight amounts of oxygen  and nitrogen. Condensates are bright-yellow methane-naphthene  types, sulfurous, low-paraffin and resinous. Gases are primarily  methane, ethane and propane with lesser amounts of butane,  pentane, hexane, nitorgen, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide.  Kashirian-Late Visean lower carbonate layer CL-II lies at depths  ranging from 1,930 m to 5,280 m between reflecting layers and is  divided by nine lithologic-stratigraphic horizons, with trap  seams up to 70 m thick containing productive oil and gas pools  and the seams separated by impermeable carbonates. Oils are  greenish-brown methane-naphthene types, basically sulfurous,  low-paraffin and slightly resinous with asphalts and composed of  mostly carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, with a small amount of  nitrogen. Condensates are bright-yellow and yellow  methane-naphthene types, with small amounts of sulfur, paraffin  and resins (up to 20 parts per 1000). Hydrocarbon gases are  mostly methane and ethane with lesser amounts of propane,  butane, pentane, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide.  CL-I and -II carbonate system oils are basically the same type  with differences in physical and chemical properties and an  increased sulfur content associated with secondary changes  during vertical migration of the oil and the influence of  carbonate rocks on the migration paths and in the pools.  Sedimentation of CL-I and -II occurred under unfavorable  conditions of a shallow coastal sea basin shelf under oxydizing  and dynamic circumstances. The carbonate rock system is not an  oil source and could not produce hydrocarbons, the pools of  which formed by migration from a Lower Permian oil-source system  and possibly partially from deeper Lower Carboniferous  terrigenous rocks. CL-I and -II carbonates contain epigenetic  asphalt from two production periods, the second an oil-type,  bright yellow with a bluish tint, found in porous layers,  fractures and caverns. Gas pools formed apparently due to a  sharp pressure drop during the oil's migration from lower  terrigenous deposits to the higher-situated carbonates.  Gamma-emitting bands of terrigenous-siliceous-carbonate rocks,  widely dispersed in the eastern part of the Pre-Caspian  Depression, are deep-sea or relatively deep-sea age analogs of  Carboniferous carbonate deposits, are located under Asselian  deposits and are reference horizons with bituminous organic  matter, a significant amount of which is sapropelic in nature  and gives them a chestnut-brown color. Rocks of the first  gamma-emitting band, 18-83 m thick, are analogs of the deep-sea  facies replacement of CL-I carbonates and are above the CL-II  carbonates. Deposits of the second gamma-emitting band, 78-102 m  thick, are analogs of CL-II carbonates, are on top of Middle  Visean Tula Horizon sand-and-clay deposits and include  claystones, limestones, radiolarites, silicites and siltstones  with tuff and volcanic ash. The first band (at the 5050-5102 m  level) has redeposited Upper Carboniferous and Moscovian  foraminifera and the second (at the 5102-5177 m level) has  redeposited Middle and Lower Carboniferous foraminifera. The  claystones are silicified and pyritized, black, strongly  bituminous, oily to the touch, with siltstone interlayers and  occasionally turn into radiolarites and silicites. The  limestones are silicified, black, aphanitic, dense, oily to the  touch, with calcite-filled fractures and interlayers of  silicites. The radiolarites are silicified, occasionally  pyritized, slightly argillaceous, dark chestnut-brown and gray,  platy, thin-layered, dense and bituminous, with some replacement  by chalcedony and opal. The gamma-emitting bands are highly  bituminous, with sapropelic organic material at the  mesocatagenesis substage, and can be listed among the  oil-producing deposits. Oils are brownish-green, low-sulfur,  slightly resinous, with paraffin and some asphalt, and basically  methane-naphthene types. The Lower Carboniferous sand-and-clay  rock system of the Tula Horizon-Tournaisian graywacke formation  extends in the eastern margin to the south of the  Shengelshiyskiy sublatitudinal fracture. Present are claystones,  siltstones and sandstones with interlayers of conglomerates  similar in color and composition to the silico-igneous formation  of the Sakmarian zone of the Mugodzhary mountains. Deposit  thickness is 448 m at Vostochnyy Akzhar, increases to the east,  reaching 1,510 m at Zhanaton, and also increases to the west  according to seismic surveying. Greatest deposit thickness of up  to 4.5 km occurs in the Embian pericraton deflection. The Middle  Visean-Tournaisian rock system surface is a reflecting layer  with the lower boundary running along a base of terrigenous  rocks on top of Upper Devonian carbonates. Middle  Visean-Tournaisian argillaceous deposits have a high  organic-matter concentration, sapropelic-humus type, accumulated  under favorable coastal-sea geochemical conditions, are  oil-producing types and liquid hydrocarbon production is evident  in the eastern margin, especially intensively in the Embian  deflection. Structures formed in this region by the time  hydrocarbon production began should be viewed as zones of oil  and gas accumulation of sygenetic pools and primary sites for  oil and gas prospecting operations. Lower Carboniferous  deposits, from which oil has been obtained, need more study. The  oil and condensates are predicted to be low-sulfur types based  on genetic features of scattered organic material in Lower  Carboniferous sand-and-clay deposits. The Middle  Visean-Tournaisian deposits' oils are syngenetic to the  surrounding rock, brownish-green, low-sulfur, with paraffin and  some asphalt, and basically methane-naphthene types. A table is  presented, showing the depths of the occurrences, in meters, of  oil- and gas-bearing systems of subsalt sedimentary mantle  deposits at various sites, ranging from Lower Permian down to  Prelower Devonian and including the gamma-emitting bands, the  CL-I and -II carbonate layers, the Lower Carboniferous  gamma-emitting claystones and the Devonian carbonates. Upper  Devonian carbonate system is between one set of reflecting  horizons and Middle and Lower Devonian systems are between  another set and are basically limestones with interlayers of  claystones and organic matter and oil ooze in the fractures.  Prelower Devonian deposits are dark-green-to-black dioritic  porphyrites with calcite-filled fractures. Most of the rocks are  plagioclase (andesites) with some hornblende, quartz and  biotite, secondary minerals such as actinolite, apatite,  chlorite and epidote, and accessory minerals such as magnetite,  titanomagnetite and pyrite. The dioritic porphyrites have been  subjected to dynamic metamorphism. The subsalt sedimentary  mantle has three rock systems with high generating potential, in  which hydrocarbon-generating processes have occurred and  hydrocarbon traps are present. Lower Carboniferous terrigenous  deposits have a greater production potential than Lower Permian.  The gamma-emitting layers need more study. The depression's  eastern section has four regional oil- and gas-bearing subsalt  rock systems and shows some promise for discoveries of new  hydrocarbon accumulations in the eastern margin. Structural  formations arose much earlier than hydrocarbon production and  endured some reorganization and disruption of the hydrodynamic  conditions as shown by heavy oxydized residual oil in Lower  Permian deposits. Deep-seated fractures are believed to be  indicative of possible oil and gas fields, should help in future  prospecting for oil pools and may also be helpful in locating  new pools in CL-I and -II layers. Slopes of bulges and uplift  areas which formed covering structures on Lower Carboniferous,  Devonian and much older deposits may be promising for  prospecting for stratigraphic oil pools.

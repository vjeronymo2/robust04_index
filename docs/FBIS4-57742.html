			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Edgard Barberena S.: "Aspects of New Military </F> Law" -- part one]    [Text] The new military law establishes that military  members who commit common crimes will be tried by common courts  and will only fall under military jurisdiction for crimes that  are strictly military.

With  the approval of the military law, no civilian can be brought  before a military court.  <H5>  Succession to Civil Power </H5>   The new military law, which will be discussed by the  National  Assembly, establishes clearly in article 7 that the Army is  subordinate to civilian authority, which falls under the powers  of the president of the republic in the exercise of his supreme  post.

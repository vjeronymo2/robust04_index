			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Tops pays Pounds 14m for two shopping centres Tops Estates has paid Pounds 14m for two Lancashire shopping centres. Consideration for the shopping centres - 3 1/2 acres at Ashton-Under-Lyne and 2 acres at Bamber Bridge, Preston - was settled in cash out of resources and available bank facilities. The company said that the two additions to the investment portfolio, which have a combined rent roll of more than Pounds 1.4m (with 10 rent reviews presently outstanding), offered an 'outstanding opportunity for substantial growth'.</p>

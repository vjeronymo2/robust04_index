			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow January 24 TASS -- Russian Atomic Energy  Minister Viktor Mikhaylov sent a letter to Interior Minister  Viktor Yerin, requesting to take adequate measures to prevent  Interior Ministry staff members from making reports on the  situation at the Atomic Energy Ministry, ``which are based on  fabrications and fantasies without appropriate scientific  examination and documented confirmation.''    The letter was prompted by the fact that Interior Ministry  officials made statements for some mass media, alleging that  thefts of arms uranium, plutonium and even nuclear warheads from  facilities of the military-industrial complex and the Atomic  Energy ministry have become an ordinary thing.    Mikhaylov claimed that there are no facts corroborating  thefts of arms ploutonium and nuclear warheads from the  ministry's facilities. If the Interior Ministry has such facts,  they should be documented.</p>

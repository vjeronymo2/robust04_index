			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Budget '92: Complicated courtship rituals for a mythical creature - The options open to a government set on wooing the 'female vote' THE 'female vote', that arguably mythical creature, could well find herself courted in the Budget. Of the possible tokens of esteem available to Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, a measure to ease childcare costs is the most likely to be deployed. The Labour party earlier this month launched a glossy magazine aimed at women. It also pledged to ensure local councils did not underspend on provision for under-fives in order to keep poll tax bills down. This would create, they said, an additional 23,000 nursery places at no cost to the government. Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has said he believes the votes of women may determine the outcome of the general election and his party has backed the idea of childcare vouchers for use in private, state or workplace nurseries. The Conservatives will not want to be left behind. The female vote as a distinct group may not actually exist - a position argued by Dr Anthony Heath, fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford, and an expert in voting patterns  -but what matters is that it continues to exist in politicians' minds. Mr John Major, the prime minister, set a women-friendly tone in October at the launch of Opportunity 2000, the business initiative to improve the position of women in the workforce. It would be entirely consistent for Mr Lamont to translate those words into actions. Mrs Angela Rumbold, the Home Office minister who chairs the ministerial group on women's issues, says she has 'put in quite a lot of ideas to the Treasury' on childcare. A particular interest is the stimulation of after-school and holiday provision. 'There's no doubt about it, there is a requirement on the part of the woman who goes to work for help with childcare,' she says. The government is aware of criticism that public support for childcare in Britain is among the lowest in the European Community. It has made clear that it does not favour a monolithic approach to state provision but wishes to stimulate private - and in particular employer-led - efforts. There are a number of Budget measures that could be taken to fit this approach, the most sweeping of which would be tax relief for parents on childcare costs. This approach is favoured by, for example, National Westminster Bank, which has called for an extended tax framework so working parents can claim the costs of registered childcare as a legitimate business expense. Ms Ann Rennie, NatWest's head of equal opportunities, acknowledges that the deadweight costs of tax relief on childcare could be about Pounds 200m a year, but considers that 'much of this could be offset by additional revenue generated from more women returning to work'. Some estimates put the costs in forgone tax revenue at up to Pounds 500m. Opponents of tax relief for childcare argue that it is potentially expensive for the public purse and would disproportionately favour the higher-earning nanny-employing classes. Top-rate taxpayers would receive the largest handouts - an unappealing proposition financially and politically at a time when the Conservatives will not want to be open to accusations of favouring their friends. Far more likely as a Budget measure is the widening of existing tax exemptions on childcare subsidies provided by employers. This would be modest in its costs and, for the government, the positive publicity could equal that which would be generated by more expensive schemes. The principle of childcare tax exemptions has already been conceded. In the 1990 Budget Mr Major, then chancellor, changed the rules so that subsidies provided by employers on workplace nurseries and play schemes no longer counted as a taxable benefit in kind. However, the definition of 'workplace' was narrow, with exemptions restricted to registered premises provided by the employer or those which the employer had a direct hand in running. This definition has given rise to many anomalies, says Working for Childcare, a campaign group. Most important, the current rules specifically exclude childcare in a domestic setting and do not take in childminding schemes or the vouchers for childcare provided by some employers. These exclusions are unfair, it is argued: not every parent wants to drag a baby into, for example, a city-centre workplace nursery; nor may it be practical for small businesses or organisations with widely dispersed workforces to set up nurseries. The campaign for Tax Relief and Childcare (Trac), set up after the 1990 Budget to press for exemptions for all forms of registered childcare, argues the costs of further reforms would be small. Based on the tax currently paid by parents who are receiving childcare subsidies from their employers, Trac claims the cost would be just Pounds 1.7m a year. Current tax exemptions on workplace nurseries cost Pounds 3.3m a year, says the group. Working for Childcare estimates that extending tax exemptions to all forms of employer-sponsored childcare would cost around Pounds 10m this year. Mrs Rumbold is less optimistic: 'There's probably another nought somewhere round there.' Trac sets great store by the female vote, quoting a Gallup opinion poll: in July 62 per cent of women either agreed or strongly agreed they would 'vote for a different party if they did more to assist with the provision of childcare for women at work'. Even if Dr Heath is right and the female vote is a chimera, childcare could still be a vote-winner. Men may be parents, too, Dr Heath points out - Budget childcare measures could have a general appeal and may, he agrees, serve to soften the government's image.</p>

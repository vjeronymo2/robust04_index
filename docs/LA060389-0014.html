			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON THE FACE OF IT, FAN HAS A SOUND ARGUMENT  </P> <P> As a longtime Dodger fan, I've seen some changes in the game that have been  hard to swallow -- AstroTurf, the DH, Steve Sax in pinstripes. . . . And now,  the Padres printed in boldface in The Los Angeles Times baseball standings.  </P> <P> What a sellout.  </P> <P> ANTHONY MORETTI  </P> <P> Lomita  </P> <P> Editor's note: Not anymore. The use of boldface type for team names in the  standings has been discontinued.  </P></p>

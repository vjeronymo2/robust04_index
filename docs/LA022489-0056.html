			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NORTHRIDGE BID FOR POSTSEASON PLAY DASHED DESPITE VICTORY  </P> <P> The elation of a second consecutive impressive outing wore off quickly for the  Cal State Northridge men's basketball team Thursday night.  </P> <P> After taking care of business by defeating Cal Poly Pomona, 96-78, at Kellogg  Gym, the Matadors learned that their postseason hopes had been extinguished.  </P> <P> Chapman defeated Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, 71-64, at the Hutton Sports Center  in Orange, clinching the fourth and final berth in next week's California  Collegiate Athletic Assn. postseason tournament.  </P> <P> The field: UC Riverside, Cal State Dominguez Hills, Cal State Bakersfield and  Chapman.  </P> <P> "It's a shame," Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy said, "because I think we're one  of the best teams in the conference."  </P> <P> Perhaps so. But the Matadors, after a promising start, took too long to hit  stride during the conference season.  </P> <P> The reasons: Injuries didn't help matters, Cassidy said. At one time or  another, all but one of CSUN's front-line players sustained injuries.  </P> <P> Lack of continuity also played a role, Cassidy said. To that end, only three of  the 11 players the Matadors suited Thursday played together on last year's  team.  </P> <P> Northridge is 16-10 overall, 7-6 in the CCAA. If the Matadors defeat Riverside  on Saturday and Chapman loses to Bakersfield, both teams would finish 8-6 in  conference play. But the Panthers would advance by virtue of their two wins  over Northridge this season.  </P> <P> Pomona, 6-19 overall, is one loss away from finishing 0-for-the-CCAA season.  </P> <P> It was Derrick Gathers who rode roughshod over the Broncos on Thursday.  </P> <P> Gathers scored 24 points, made eight of 13 from the field -- including four of  six three-point attempts -- and added 11 rebounds.  </P> <P> So what did Cassidy want to talk about afterward? Gathers' passing.  </P> <P> "I thought he played very much under control," Cassidy said. "Several times he  made nice, easy passes for easy baskets.  </P> <P> Gathers finished with five assists.  </P> <P> Four other Matadors reached double figures in scoring. Alan Fraser had 15  points, Kendell McDaniels 14, Jemarl Baker 13 and Kris Brodowski 10.  </P> <P> Nate Macon led Pomona with 24 points and Forrest Barnes added 17.  </P> <P> Northridge led, 45-37, at the half, largely because of reserve forward  McDaniels, who scored 10 points and had seven rebounds in eight minutes.  </P> <P> Gathers had 13 points as the Matadors broke open a close game with a string of  four three-point shots -- two by Gathers -- in the closing minutes of the half.  </P></p>

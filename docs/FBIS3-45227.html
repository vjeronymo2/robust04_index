			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, January 14 (XINHUA) -- Russian President  Boris Yeltsin applauded the evolutionary approach the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) takes in expanding the  trans-Atlantic security alliance.    At a joint press conference with visiting U.S. President  Bill  Clinton, Yeltsin said the "Partnership for Peace" plan proposed  by Washington and endorsed at the NATO summit was "a good  formula."    The practice of accepting one member at a time was "not  going  to do anyone good," he added.    Clinton, arrived here Thursday on a three-day visit, had  several meetings with Yeltsin and discussed a wide range of  issues.    They signed a trilateral agreement with Ukrainian President  Leonid Kravchuk on dismantling the 176 nuclear missiles and more  than 1,500 nuclear warheads Kiev inherited from the former  Soviet Union.    Washington and Moscow also signed an agreement to stop  targeting their long-range nuclear missiles at each other and  other nations.    On Bosnian issue, Clinton and Yeltsin acknowledged they  reached "no conclusive results" but said they had had "honest  and good conversations" on the topic.    Trying to lower the expectations of a possible NATO air  attack on the Bosnian Serbs, Clinton emphasized that the new  NATO initiative was mainly designed to "further the U.N.  mission" rather than "pretending" to settle the conflict.    With Moscow facing an ailing economy, Clinton urged Russia  to  care more about its ordinary citizens and create security net to  cushion the hardship brought by the economic reform.    Stressing that he would press forward with radical economic  reform, Yeltsin said he had been upset by the slowness in acting  upon the assistance package agreed upon last July in Tokyo,  Japan, by the seven major industrialized nations.    However, Yeltsin singled out the United States for his words  of praise, saying most of the 1.6 billion U.S. dollars of aid  Clinton promised in Vancouver, Canada, in March of last year,  have been delivered.    Clinton was quick to add that the G-7 will speed up the pace  in helping Russia, saying Moscow's willingness to continue the  reform "will be met positively" by the West.    "Billions of dollars" of Western aid will flow to Russia in  years ahead, he promised.    This is Clinton's first trip to Europe since he took office  a  year ago. His later stops will be Minsk, Belarus, and Geneva,  Switzerland, where he is to meet with Syrian President Hafiz  al-Asad on the Middle East peace talks.    He is expected to make two more trips to Europe later this  year, including participating in this year's G-7 meeting in  Naples, Italy, in July.    Clinton has invited Yeltsin to join him in Naples and to  visit Washington this fall.</p>

			<p>Plutonium   Annihilation Reactor   <F P=102> 94P60229B Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 14 Apr 94 p  7--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94P60229B </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] Nuclear Power Reactor Bureau Director Ermakov of  Russia' s Ministry of Atomic Energy attended the annual meeting  of the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum Inc. held 13-15 April 1994  in Hiroshima. During a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN press interview on  the 13th, he disclosed that Russia is planning to request  Japanese cooperation in the development of an advanced reactor.  Russia wants to use the plutonium obtained through dismantling  nuclear weapons for fuel. Russia soon will propose a  cooperative arrangement through formal channels of the  Japan-Russia Atomic Energy Agreement.    The cooperation request includes development of the  800,000kW  output ``BN-800'' fast breeder reactor. At present, its  construction is temporarily on hold. They want to modify the  existing core originally designed for fuel breeding to that for  burning plutonium and long-life transuranium. They intend to  process the plutonium produced through dismantling nuclear  weapons in a way that will destroy it as it is burned as fuel.    Bureau Director Ermakov said, `They would like to promote  development of the reactor as an international project along the  lines of the International Tokamak Experimental Research.'</p>

The first two airliners  will arrive this May. The possibility of leasing several more  Boeings and an Airbus AZ 10-300 is also being considered.  International Aeroflot, operating under the conditions of a real  market and tough competition, has been forced to concern itself  with the effectiveness of its flights, and therefore is choosing  foreign planes.    At a meeting that Dmitriy Barilov, director of  Aeroflot-Russian International Airlines, and Sergey Frantsev,  deputy acting director of the airline's production and  commercial department, had yesterday with Carry Pawluk, Boeing's  regional director for sales in Northern and Eastern Europe, the  procedures for leasing four Boeing 767-300 ER airliners were  discussed. Thus, except for a few details, the talks between  Aeroflot and Boeing on acquiring airliners of that type (see  KOMMERSANT for 27 January) have been virtually completed. The  new Boeings will be purchased by the Irish JPA company and then  leased to Aeroflot for five years. Details of the agreement with  JPA have not yet been made public, but according to KOMMERSANT's  information, the cost of leasing will be approximately $300  million (not counting interest). The Russian side will receive  first two aircraft this May.    As Mr. Frantsev stated, in terms of flight range, economy  and  number of passengers, Aeroflot's basic intercontinental plane,  the Il-62M, is inferior to the Boeing 767-300 ER (see table). At  the same time, operation of the new Russian Il-96-300 airliner  is too costly. The five Airbus A310-300s in Aeroflot's  possession are best suited to transcontinental flights. That is  what led to the decision to lease the Boeing 767-300 ERs, which  have been flown by the leading foreign airlines since 1989.    As KOMMERSANT has learned, Kazakhstan's international  airlines will soon follow International Aeroflot's example. And  Aeroflot is presently considering the possibility of leasing  another group of Boeings (most likely it will be Boeing  747-400s, the process of whose certification in Russia, as  KOMMERSANT reported on 1 February, is already under way) and  AZ10-300s. Aeroflot's decision is distressing news for the  Russian aviation industry--for all practical purposes, it means  the beginning of direct competition with the leading foreign  aircraft manufacturers in our own domestic market. The new  Il-96-300, Il-114 and Tu-204 airliners have not yet been brought  up to the required level of economy and flight readiness.  Moreover, Russian and CIS airlines flying domestic routes do not  presently have the money to purchase new Russian aircraft. On  the other hand, the airlines flying international routes are  operating under the real conditions of stiff competition in the  world air transportation market, which is what led to the choice  of the most economical foreign-made airliners.

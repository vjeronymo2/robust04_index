			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Lords challenge claims against driftnet fishing Claims by the European Commission that driftnet fishing is harmful to the environment have been challenged by a House of Lords committee. The Lords committee on the European communities said a commission report on driftnetting - which is at the centre of the dispute between Spanish and British fishermen - failed to provide adequate evidence to justify its proposal to ban the practice in four years. The commission's report also proposed allowing French vessels that have fished for albacore tuna in the north-east Atlantic for the past six years to continue using drift nets of up to 5km in length - twice the legal EU maximum - during this summer. Fisheries ministers have failed to reach an agreement on the proposals. Describing the commission report as 'deeply flawed', the committee said it was disturbed 'by the lack of objectivity apparent in the commission's report and indeed by accusations of a lack of intellectual integrity in the document'. French and British vessels in the Bay of Biscay have been confronted by Spanish fishermen angry at their use of driftnets. The Spaniards use poles and lines and suspect their rivals of using driftnets longer than 2.5km. Vessels using driftnets can land about 105 tonnes of tuna in the Bay of Biscay compared with an average 35 tonnes landed by Spanish vessels using lines. The Lords backed some proposals by the commission, but said the commission's report and the evidence received during its own inquiry 'give rise to doubt'. An assessment of the impact on the environment was urgently needed from the commission, it added. Regulation of Driftnet Fishing. HMSO. Pounds 15.25.

			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> COLORADO;  </P> <P> ENGINEER LOSES SUIT AGAINST ROCKWELL  </P> <P> A whistle-blowing engineer has lost his lawsuit against Rockwell International  stemming from his firing from the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant near  Boulder, Colo. Jefferson County District Judge Kenneth Barnhill dismissed the  suit without submitting it to the jury, although the jury had listened to a  week of testimony. Barnhill had ruled that engineer Jim Stone had not  established that Rockwell violated Stone's employment contract when he was  terminated in 1986. Stone is credited with supplying some of the information  that led to an FBI raid on Rocky Flats in June and a subsequent grand jury  investigation into alleged waste storage and disposal violations. He said he  would appeal the judge's decision.  </P></p>

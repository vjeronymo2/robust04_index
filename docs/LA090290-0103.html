			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEGOTIATIONS TO SETTLE MIDEAST CRISIS  </P> <P> After the Vietnam War, our government decided that it was not politically  expedient to have American soldiers fight wars on foreign soil.  </P> <P> So for the next 20 years when we wanted to "protect our interest abroad," we  just armed "freedom fighters." We would pay the tab, sell them the military  hardware, but let some poor Third World country provide the bodies.  </P> <P> Now, as we move into the '90s, we are supplying the bodies and other countries  are paying the tab. What does this mean in the "new world order"? The same old  story, different perspective. Money talks, debtor nations' foot soldiers walk.  </P> <P> DOUGLAS INGOLDSBY  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

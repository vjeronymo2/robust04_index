			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIRING CENTER IS LURING WORKERS BUT ONLY A HANDFUL OF EMPLOYERS  </P> <P> Men seeking work continue to crowd the city's first hiring center for day  laborers in the San Fernando Valley, but employers apparently have yet to  discover the dusty North Hollywood lot on Sherman Way between Radford and Hinds  avenues.  </P> <P> About 100 men have been gathering each morning at the center, opened last week  on a Department of Water and Power lot a few blocks west of Lankershim  Boulevard. But only about five prospective employers show up on an average day,  said Bill Molina, management analyst for the Community Development Department,  which runs the center.  </P> <P> At a dedication ceremony Tuesday, city officials and others who helped organize  the center encouraged employers to hire workers from the site rather than the  street corners and parking lots where many day laborers still congregate.  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi, whose district includes the  center, said the facility provides a "responsible place" for men to wait for  work.  </P> <P> "This benefits the entire community, not just the people who come here looking  for work," Bernardi said. "We want to make this an overwhelming success so we  can expand it into other areas of the Valley."  </P> <P> Bert Corona, executive director of Hermandad Mexicana Nacional, an immigrant  rights group that helped organize the center, said the site is "humanizing the  effort for those who hunger for work."  </P> <P> While they wait for work, men at the center are offered free coffee, pastries  and English lessons. Picnic tables and portable toilets have been set up at the  site.  </P> <P> The center is intended to serve the 150 to 200 laborers who congregate on  Lankershim between Strathern and Saticoy streets and reduce problems caused by  loitering workers. Funded by the city, the facility costs about $3,500 a month  to operate.  </P> <P> It is the second such gathering place for workers in the city of Los Angeles. A  similar facility was opened in Harbor City last fall.  </P></p>

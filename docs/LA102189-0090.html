			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TALK WITH RAIDERS, PANEL TOLD;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: THE LOS ANGELES COLISEUM COMMISSION IS BEING EXHORTED BY SUPERVISOR  KENNETH HAHN TO RESTART NEGOTIATIONS TO KEEP THE TEAM FROM LEAVING.  </P> <P> Supervisor Kenneth Hahn called Friday for a restart of stalled negotiations  between the Los Angeles Coliseum Commission and the Raiders, saying the city  loves its football team and doesn't want to lose it.  </P> <P> Hahn appeared at a press conference with a cross section of community leaders  who voiced their wish that the Raiders stay in Los Angeles. "We worked very  hard to get them here," Hahn said. "We would be very foolish to lose them to  some city up north."  </P> <P> Al Davis, the managing general partner for the National Football League team,  has expressed a desire to move the team to another city. The Raiders' contract  to play at the Coliseum runs through 1991.  </P> <P> The team is being wooed by both Sacramento and Oakland.  </P> <P> Talks between the Raiders and the Coliseum Commission broke down in June and  snagged on a legal point. The commission filed a $57-million breach of contract  suit against the Raiders in 1987 and have asked, as a requirement of further  discussion, that Davis sign an agreement that would prohibit the Raiders from  using any discussions in the negotiations as fodder in a lawsuit. Davis has  refused to sign such an agreement.  </P> <P> In an apparent attempt to placate Davis and resume negotiations, Coliseum  Commission President Richard Riordan said he would be willing to drop that  requirement. It was unclear, though, if he meant the requirement might  resurface in another form.  </P> <P> "Yes, we will drop that agreement and try to get something that will satisfy  Davis," Riordan said. "Simply, what we would like to do is to have some sort of  an agreement that would satisfy Mr. Davis and his lawyers to the effect that  any discussions in negotiations would not be used in any lawsuit between the  two of us. It's that simple.  </P> <P> "My argument is that it doesn't hurt Mr. Davis and it doesn't hurt us. My  dealings with Al Davis (is) that he's tough but he's reasonable. I think we can  come to some meeting of the minds on that."  </P> <P> Davis could not be reached for comment.  </P></p>

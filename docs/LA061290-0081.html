			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHANNEL 13 HIRES HERNANDEZ; JACOBS OUT  </P> <P> Channel 13 has hired Channel 2 sportscaster Tony Hernandez, news director Jeff  Wald said Monday.  </P> <P> Vic (the Brick) Jacobs' Channel 13 contract, which expires at the end of the  month, will not be renewed.  </P> <P> Jacobs has been at the station since the summer of 1988.  </P> <P> Hernandez will remain at Channel 2 until June 30, and begin at Channel 13 July  2. Jacobs, who came to Channel 13 from Fresno, is expected to remain at the  station until Hernandez takes over.  </P> <P> Hernandez, reached in Portland, Ore., where he is covering the NBA finals, said  he was notified through his agent, Burt Shapiro, a month ago that Channel 2 was  terminating his contract.  </P> <P> "My contract actually runs through 1991, but my cycle was up," he said. "What  they offered was a new one-year contract at a 25% salary cut.  </P> <P> "What I regret is that all this was done through my agent. Neither Mr. Hyland  (general manager Bob) nor (news director) Michael Singer ever spoke to me  personally. I wish someone had been conscientious enough to have called me in."  </P> <P> Hernandez said sports director Keith Olbermann knew that his contract had been  terminated. "I got the impression Keith wanted me to stay," Hernandez said.  </P> <P> Hernandez was at Channel 7 for 5 1/2 years and was at Channel 2 for nearly 6  1/2.  </P> <P> Hernandez said what appealed to him about the Channel 13 offer was a  Monday-through-Friday schedule, the fact that he would be No. 1 at Channel 13,  and that Channel 13 gave him a three-year contract.  </P> <P> "I will be the sports director," Hernandez said. "In my 12 years here, I have  never been the No. 1 person at a Los Angeles station, and I'm excited about  that."  </P></p>

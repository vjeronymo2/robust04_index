			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Algerian General Workers Union [UGTA] rejected  any agreement, in whatever form, that seeks to reschedule  Algerian debts. This is what UGTA Secretary General Abdelhak  Benhamouda was saying.    In a statement published in yesterday's issue of the  newspaper EL-MASSA, Benhamouda said that an agreement in the  aforementioned field will turn the IMF into a gendarme in  Algeria.    The UGTA secretary general explained that talks on the  question of the debts should be assigned to an Algerian  negotiator who has the backing of the people.    Benhamouda also pointed out that workers are not the only  ones to be blamed for the state of complacency that one sees in  the national enterprises. He called for work to be valued by  practical and material encouragement and that the law must be  respected by everyone.</p>

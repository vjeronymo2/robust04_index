			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Arts: Frank Andersen's Jubilee They do these things wonderfully well in Copenhagen. The ballet matters a great deal; dancers and choreographers are public figures - a postage stamp bore the portrait of the great Danish ballerina Margrethe Schanne - and the fortunes of the Royal Danish Ballet are of national concern. Frank Andersen has directed the company for the past nine years - he will retire this summer - and this year celebrates his silver jubilee as a member of the Ballet. So, on Saturday night, there was a gala to mark his 25 years of service, and an occasion to thank him for his achievement as director. It was a splendid occasion, with that mixture of formality and happy ease which is one of the joys of the Royal Theatre. Queen Margrethe was in the Royal Box, a reminder of vital patronage - she has provided admirable design for that most national of Bournonville's works, A Folk Tale - and the audience knew it was there for a family celebration. There was nothing too serious, some nice jokes, wonderful dancing, and a merry determination to get everyone possible on stage somehow or other. Thus the last act of the company's new Sleeping Beauty showed us roles being shared, sometimes in mid-variation. There were two pairs of Bluebirds - with Alexander Kolpin and Thomas Lund very buoyant - three Auroras and three Princes, so that Yury Posokhov and Lloyd Riggins played catch-as-catch-can in the Prince's solo and were tremendous. It is one of the strengths of the Royal Danes that a career will start in childhood - peering and cheering from the bridge in the last act of Napoli - and continue well into autumnal years with rewarding character roles that include Napoli's lemonade and macaroni sellers. So the children of the ballet school came to salute Andersen (who is, officially, Royal Ballet Master) and danced featly to the adorable rattle of the Polka Militaire, which was composed for Bournonville in 1842. Then we moved into the gala sweetmeats. There was new Danish choreography with part of Anna Laerkesen's Whispers and Floating; John Neumeier's Adagietto from Mahler 5 for Mette Ida Kirk and Yury Posokhov; Nina Ananiashvili and Julio Bocca flashing through Don Quixote's flaming paper hoops; Elisabeth Platel and Manuel Legris in Balanchine's delicate, allusive response to Ravel's Sonatine - exquisite, subtle, both in ideas and performance. And of course, to finish with, came the crack of muskets, tambourines, and the flash of Bournonville steps in the last act of Napoli. This is, because of Bournonville's love of the theatre, his moral dignity, his belief in the joyous nature of dancing, his power to capture the life of his time, quintessentially Danish - not least in its response to southern light. There were the ballet children on the bridge, and such eminent artists as Niels Kehlet sitting at the cafe tables. There were the buoyant lines of male dancers - young Johan Kobborg bounding through a solo like the spirit of Bournonville - and the bewitching legion of the girls. And there, as the hero, Gennaro, was Frank Andersen, still nifty as to step (he is, after all, only 41 years old) and leading his entire company in these ever-fresh, eternally sparkling ensembles. We clapped and cheered. The children on the bridge waved and shouted. The dancers cheered. Andersen, with the sincerity and charm that has marked his dancing and his direction of the troupe, took his bows and the presents brought on for him, and his laurels, saluted his monarch, and was rightly moved near to tears. The applause went on for ever.</p>

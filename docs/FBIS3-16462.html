The meeting was held behind closed doors.    The press service of Zhirinovskiy's party told ITAR-TASS  that  the two politicians focused on Russian-American relations  "taking into consideration the geopolitical interests of the two  countries", and on inter-parliamentary contacts.    Zhirinovskiy handed to Nixon a personal message addressed to  President Bill Clinton, the press service said.    According to press reports, Nixon wanted to meet  Zhirinovskiy  during his week-long visit to Moscow to get a clearer idea of  the broad spectrum of Russian political leaders capable of  influencing developments in the country.    Zhirinovskiy, however, denied last week that he wanted to  meet the American ex-president.</p>

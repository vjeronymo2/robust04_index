			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Serb leader gatecrashes summit: CSCE summit declaration blames Belgrade for violence in Bosnia MR Milan Panic, prime minister designate of the rump Yugoslavia, yesterday made an unexpected visit to Helsinki to tell the world why Serbia deserved a hearing. His loquacious press conference was punctuated by slogans insisting that he harboured no nationalist feelings, that Croats and Serbs really did like each other, and that he would 'eliminate politicians' who stood in the way of peace. It coincided with a unanimous declaration of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe which placed the 'prime responsibility' on Belgrade for the violence and ethnic cleansing in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Mr Panic, whose US citizenship will not be withdrawn when he takes up his new job, had earlier met US secretary of State James Baker. Mr Baker told Mr Panic that 'acts and not words' were needed to resolve the crisis. 'The message I gave to him was clear ..the human nightmare in the former Yugoslavia must cease ..and that Serbia and Montenegro must abide by the UN resolutions,' Mr Baker said. Mr Panic, a businessman specialising in pharmaceuticals, said he would stop the killing by withdrawing all heavy weapons from Bosnia, place them under UN control, and then sell other weapons to revive the Serbian economy. But Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic, who helped draw up the declaration on the Yugoslav crisis, said Belgrade continued to support Serb irregulars and Serbia's proxy army in their efforts to carve up Bosnia. The destruction and killing in Bosnia-Hercegovina was finally, and publicly acknowledged in a Bosnian-inspired text simply called a Declaration on the Yugoslav crisis. Russia had opposed the draft document, on the grounds that it was too one-sided, and that it wanted some of the text agreed by the G7 summit in Munich to be incorporated. Some other republics of the former Soviet Union wanted a CSCE declaration on Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>

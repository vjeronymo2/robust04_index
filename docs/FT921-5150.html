			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / US seeks peace talks review MR James Baker, the US secretary of state, yesterday intervened in the Middle East peace process by asking each of the five delegation leaders to review with him what had been achieved at the conclusion of the fourth round of bilateral negotiations. The Palestinians, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon will hold their own co-ordinating session in Washington before returning home. One of the proposals they may put to their governments is for an Arab League meeting to be called this month to seek endorsement for continued participation in the peace process. Members of the Palestinian and Syrian delegations say they are increasingly convinced Israel has no intention of negotiating on the basis of UN resolutions 242 and 338 which call for an exchange of occupied territory in return for peace. With Israel continuing to expropriate more land in the West Bank and Gaza and pressing ahead with settlement building, they say it is difficult to justify participation in the peace process. However they accept that withdrawing would hand a propaganda victory to Israel and would alienate the US. With Israel's hopes of securing Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.7bn) in loan guarantees from the US having all but evaporated, the choices to be posed in the June 23 general election there have become more apparent. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, leader of the opposition Labour Party, has pledged to stop building new settlements in the occupied territories, which would release the US loan guarantees, and has said he would give Palestinians the choice of being federated with Jordan or with Israel. The delegations have not set a time or venue for the next round of negotiations. Israel is demanding that they should move closer to the Middle East while the Arabs want to return to Washington.</p>

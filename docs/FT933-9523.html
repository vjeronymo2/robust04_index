			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / US envoy shot in Georgia turmoil A US DIPLOMAT has been shot dead in the strife-torn republic of Georgia, the first western official to die in the political turmoil in the former Soviet Union, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow. Mr Fred Woodruff, a regional affairs officer, was hit in the forehead by a bullet as he was being driven by the security chief of the Georgian leader, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze. The attack took place 7km outside Tbilisi as they were returning from what Itar-Tass news agency described as a sight-seeing trip. 'It must have been the work of professionals,' one western diplomat said. Mr Shevardnadze, who has himself escaped unhurt from similar attacks, cited the killing as yet another argument for the emergency powers he has been seeking since parliament, which he heads, forced out the government last week.</p>

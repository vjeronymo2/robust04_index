			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: TSB Scotland tops Pounds 82m despite rising bad debts TSB Bank Scotland, the Scottish offshoot of the TSB Group, increased its pre-tax profit in the year to October 31 by 3.8 per cent from Pounds 79.4m to Pounds 82.4m. Operating profit was up 11 per cent at Pounds 98.1m while the cost income ratio fell from 54.5 per cent in 1992 to 52.1 per cent. Mr Alastair Dempster, the chief executive, acknowledged that the rise in the pre-tax figures was dwarfed by the jump from Pounds 5m to Pounds 301m in TSB Group's pre-tax profits, announced last week. He pointed out that TSB Bank Scotland had been consistently profitable during its parent company's difficult years, with pre-tax profits rising steadily from Pounds 40m in 1989. The bank, which focuses on lending to individuals, suffered a higher level of bad debts in 1993 than in 1992.</p>

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Lottery charities board raises worries The Department of National Heritage is concerned about the slow progress of the work of the National Lottery Charities Board, the body set up to distribute hundreds of millions of pounds of proceeds to charity from the National Lottery over the next seven years. In the week when Mr John Major, the prime minister, will launch ticket sales for the lottery, the heritage department is making known its concerns about the charities board to Downing Street. According to officials with a close knowledge of the lottery, however, the heritage department, which is responsible for the National Lottery but not for the charities board, is sympathetic to the difficulties now being faced by Mr David Sieff, the board's chairman. It has expressed criticism to Downing Street about the slowness of the Home Office in setting up the board. Mr Sieff was not appointed until May 10 this year, two weeks before Camelot was chosen as the lottery's operator of the National Lottery. However, as early as February 1993 - during the committee stage of the lottery bill - there was a widespread expectation that charities would benefit from the lottery. The Home Office said: 'We couldn't rush it. We wanted to get it right.' It is believed that Mr Sieff, a member of one of the founding families of Marks and Spencer and the director responsible for the retail group's corporate affairs and external relations, was not the first person the Home Office approached to do the part-time job. Last week Mr Sieff told a charities conference that if the board was to succeed 'we need time to prepare - certainly many months - before we can begin the process of actual distribution'. The first of the weekly National Lottery draws takes place on Saturday and the first cheque will go to the National Lottery Distribution Fund at the National Heritage Department the following Wednesday. The money for the distribution fund will be made up of about 28p from every Pounds 1 lottery ticket bought and five good causes will get an equal split. Apart from charities, the causes are the arts, national heritage, a millennium fund and sport. The National Lottery Charities Board, which is likely to be inundated with applications for funds, admitted to a Sunday newspaper that it did not have a bank account for grant purposes and did not know when it would get money through to pay grants. The 071 839 5371 telephone number for its temporary premises in Orange Street, off the Haymarket in London, was still not available through directory inquiries last night. Before any of the distribution bodies can give out any money the National Audit Office must be satisfied about their procedures. At last week's charities conference Mr Sieff warned that because hundreds of thousands of applications were expected from different organisations, highly efficient business and financial systems would be needed. The 17-strong board representing all parts of the UK will also probably have to appoint sub-committees with specialist knowledge to help assess applications for money. Letters, Page 16</p>

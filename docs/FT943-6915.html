			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Milk sale delayed as row deepens The row over milk trade deregulation deepened last night after the Scottish Milk Marketing Board agreed to postpone only the second auction of milk under a new system when bid prices rose to unexpectedly high levels, Michael Smith writes. The Scottish Dairy Trade Federation, which like its English counterpart is protesting about the changes, said the move demonstrated the inability of the deregulated system to produce realistic prices. However, the SMMB said there was no compulsion on bidders to offer as much as they had and said there was no plan to reform the system. The 2.2m litres of milk unsold yesterday, representing about half the planned total, would be auctioned later. The postponement of the auction coincided with a meeting over the row between Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, and the Milk Marketing Board for England and Wales and the Dairy Trade Federation. The ministry said last night that Mr Waldegrave had agreed to discuss the matter with cabinet colleagues. This week the DTF said it would challenge the government in court over its handling of milk deregulation. Before the meeting yesterday Mr Waldegrave said he did not rule out a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. In yesterday's auction for milk in December, prices varied from 27.1p to 30.7p. Dr Donald McQueen, SDTF chief executive, said they were artificially high because of pressure on dairies to obtain the supplies they needed. 'The whole system has been designed to push up prices.'

			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Carsberg signals competition for local telecoms A SWITCH towards promoting competition in local telecommunications was signalled yesterday by Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of Oftel, the industry watchdog. Previous government policy favoured competition in the long-distance market. The change in policy was announced as Sir Bryan defended his controversial proposals to introduce access charges for competitors using BT lines. The strength of opposition to the introduction of access charges has forced him to delay completing the details until next month. 'Changes can still be made if the need is established,' said Sir Bryan. Sir Bryan denied allegations that the introduction of access charges was linked to political pressure from the government in the run-up to its planned sale of more shares in BT. 'Not once has the secretary of state raised the issue of flotation with me,' he said. 'The decisions made have resulted from the financial analysis I have made. Selling shares has had nothing to do with it.' The controversy comes only two months after the publication of the white paper on telecommunications policy. This proposed the abolition of the duopoly of BT and Mercury Communications. BT's rivals have criticised the access charge proposals, saying they would pay so much to BT that they would not be able to compete. But Sir Bryan argued that access charges - which compensate BT for its obligation to operate uneconomical telephone lines - would encourage Mercury, cable television companies and other groups to build local networks. He said they would only pay BT if they used BT's lines. 'At present, most competition is in the high-volume, long-distance market, rather than in the local arena,' said Sir Bryan. 'Over the last few years, we have been assisting a particular type of entry - the long distance business of Mercury's. This will help even up the balance in the local loop.' Sir Bryan said if new competitors did not pay a fair share of BT's costs, this would encourage inefficient competition and costs might rise. He emphasised that the access charge arrangements would be reviewed next year when BT's main pricing regime is due to be re-examined. Lex, Page 24</p>

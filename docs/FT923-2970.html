			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Letter: Right route for industry Sir, Your leader ('CBI economics', September 9) argues that I should have told the Trades Union Congress that British industry has a productivity and profitability problem driven by high wage costs. I rather thought I had; and so did my hosts. You also take issue with the notion that we do not have a fundamental exchange rate problem; quoting, in support, my own argument that while manufacturing industry is leaner and fitter, there is not enough of it. My point is that the route out of the problem is not devaluation; rather it is holding down pay rises while investing in the supply side, notably the transport infrastructure and training. My impression is the TUC buys the second part of the prescription. In my speech I was hoping to sell it the first. Howard Davies, director-general, Confederation of British Industry, Centre Point, 103 New Oxford Street, London WC1A 1DU</p>

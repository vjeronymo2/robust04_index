			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Technology: CFCs get the cold shoulder Italy's Candy white goods group this week unveiled what it says are the world's first mass-produced refrigerators which work without environment-damaging chlorofluorocarbons. The new fridges use HFC 134a, an alternative chemical which is now the front-runner to replace CFCs in refrigerator applications. Unlike CFCs, HFC 134a does not harm the earth's ozone layer. It is in commercial production by ICI and Du Pont. The Candy range, which is being introduced two years ahead of a European Community accord to phase out CFCs by 1995, may soon be followed by other leading manufacturers. A number of European companies are believed to be working on CFC-free fridges, some of which may be unveiled at next week's big Domotechnica consumer durables trade fair in Cologne. Although the new range does not include CFC refrigerant, it is still only a half-way house as far as the use of chemicals for insulation is concerned. For their insulating material the Candy fridges use HCFC 141b gas, a hydrochlorofluorocarbon which Candy admits is 'a transitory solution'. Although the chemical dissipates in the atmosphere 10 times faster than CFCs, researchers are still working on an environmentally harmless solution for insulation use. Silvano Fumagalli, chairman of Candy's main operating company, said the group, like other big white goods makers, was looking into the use of cyclopentane as an alternative. Experimental fridges using cyclopentane are already believed to have been tested. However, the gas is dangerous to handle and foam produced from it is a less effective insulator than that from HCFC 141b. Fumagalli said Candy was working closely with chemical companies in the search for suitable alternatives. The new Candy fridges already marked a step forward in eliminating CFCs without compromising operating standards, he said.</p>

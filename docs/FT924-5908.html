			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: NYSE firms slightly lower at Dollars 802m THE 312 securities broking and marketmaking member-firms of the New York Stock Exchange that do business with the public yesterday reported profits of Dollars 802m for the third quarter. In the comparable nine months last year, NYSE member-firms earned Dollars 2.66bn. Although earnings were slightly lower than the Dollars 842m made in the same quarter of 1991, and well below the Dollars 1.14bn recorded in the second quarter of this year, the record Dollars 3.31bn in profits the firms have racked up since the beginning of this year indicate that the explosive growth in business enjoyed by Wall Street since 1991 shows little sign of fizzling out. In spite of the strength of year-to-date earnings, a slowdown in stock underwriting business, especially of initial public offerings (IPOs), and turmoil in the European currency and bond markets, which left some firms with gains but others nursing losses, contributed to the overall decline in profits during the quarter. The NYSE's specialists - the firms that make markets in stocks on the exchange's trading floor - reported a 22 per cent increase in third-quarter profits to Dollars 18m, thanks primarily to an increase in trading activity.</p>

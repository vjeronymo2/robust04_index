			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "News Bulletin" No. 470] </F>   [Text] Vilnius, April 1, ELTA -- Lithuanian Deputy Defence  Minister Sarunas Vasiliauskas was dismissed from his post at his  own will. He had occupied this post since the establishment of  the ministry and had been responsible for the ministry budget  and provisions.    According to Vasiliauskas, no disagreements had been between  him and the former and present ministers. "I could not do my job  very good with such small sums of money the ministry had,"  Vasiliauskas told ELTA.    Last year, for example, the ministry was allotted 131  million  litas to maintain the people. The only way out, according to  Vasiliauskas, was to diminish the defence system.    Vasiliauskas admitted that he did not envy the one who would  occupy his former post. Vasiliauskas is going to have a private  job.</p>

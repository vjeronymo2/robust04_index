			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: BCH to cancel capital after Pta26bn buy-back Banco Central Hispano (BCH) plans to cancel some 5 per cent of its share capital after being forced to buy back its own stock from the markets to support the price. BCH shares came under pressure after the collapse of rival bank Banesto at the end of last year. Officials at BCH, which owns the biggest branch network in Spain, acknowledged yesterday the bank had spent some Pta26bn (Dollars 187m) supporting its share price. BCH equity owned by the bank has risen since December from 0.2 per cent of the total number of shares on the market to close to the 5 per cent limit set by the authorities. The board will seek authorisation from the annual meeting next month to write off the equity it now owns. The amortisation would reduce the number of BCH shares to 551,619 from 578,959 and the bank estimates the cancellation will raise income per share from to Pta296 from Pta281. BCH shares, which traded at Pta3,380 at the beginning of this year, fell earlier this month to Pta2,755 and have steadied to Pta2,850, representing a 15 per cent discount on the estimated book value. Investor confidence in BCH waned in the second half of last year and fell further following the troubles at Banesto. BCH's net interest income shrunk by 4.8 per cent last year although its operating profit was up by 11.8 per cent due, in part, to non-recurring foreign exchange and public debt trading. The bank's profile was further dented recently by credit rating agencies. Moody's has placed BCH under review for a possible downgrade and IBCA, the London-based agency, last week adjusted the bank's short-term commercial paper from A1+ to A1 and its long-term debt from AA- to A+. Both agencies cited flat core earnings at the bank, concern over asset quality and the slow progress of cost reductions as reasons for the revision. The bank's move was welcomed yesterday by market analysts. 'In the circumstances it is a well thought-out move, and there could be further cancellations of stock over the year,' said Mr Robert Maxwell of Madrid brokers Maxwell and Espinosa. BCH officials insist any link between Banesto's troubles and possible difficulties at BCH is wholly out of place. Nevertheless, the buy-back and write-off moves are part of several initiatives to restore investor confidence. BCH is streamlining its decision-taking process. Mr Jose Mara Amusategui, chairman, is pruning his board to 28 members from 39 and his executive committee to 14 from 19. The bank plans to raise income by disposing of part of its industrial assets, although it intends to keep control of the prime companies in its portfolio. This week it will realise about Dollars 104m through the placement of 13.5 per cent of Aumar, a toll-motorway operator, in which it holds a 67 per cent stake. In the second half of this year the bank will tap the markets for some Pta70bn in three issues of subordinated debt. 'We are very capitalised in tier one, core capital, so we can afford to cancel and what we want is a better mix, with more subordinated debt,' said a senior BCH executive.</p>

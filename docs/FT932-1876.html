			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Survey of Power for Europe (5): Chernobyl's lingering shadow  -David Lascelles assesses nuclear power's mixed fortunes THE CHERNOBYL effect continues to overshadow Europe's nuclear power industry, not just by stifling new developments in western Europe, but by making people nervous about the industry in eastern Europe. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, only two west European countries - the UK and France - are currently building new nuclear power plants. In the remainder, nuclear power is either in a state of limbo or subject to constraints, as in Italy where plants have been mothballed, or Sweden which plans to phase out nuclear power by the year 2010. France's commitment to nuclear power has long been the mainstay of the west European nuclear industry. It already produces nearly three quarters of its electricity from nuclear and has five more units under construction, which will bring the total to 61. Electricite de France, the state-owned utility, maintains that French public opinion is supportive, despite recent press coverage of alleged rising costs of nuclear power and environmental and safety worries. 'Chernobyl has not made a significant difference because people believe western technology is safe,' says Mr Jean Bergougnoux, chief executive of EdF. 'Where nuclear power exists people want to build more plants because they have felt the economic benefit.' The UK's attitude to the industry is much less positive. Sizewell B, on the Suffolk coast, is the only plant under construction and is due for completion in 1994. At the end of the year the government is due to launch an inquiry into whether more power stations should be built in Britain. The outcome is difficult to predict, but Mr John Collier, the chairman of Nuclear Electric says nuclear power should be able to make a strong case that it can operate safely and commercially. What does this mean for the nuclear power industry in western Europe? Short-term prospects for nuclear power seem doubtful, despite the fact that nuclear power accounts for about a third of all electricity produced in western Europe. Fears about safety are strong, and environmental opposition is well organised. The nuclear power industry has also made little headway with the one environmental argument in its favour: that it does not pollute the atmosphere with gases which are said to cause acid rain and global warming. Some research has even shown that people think nuclear power contributes to the greenhouse effect. Instead, the environmental argument has centred on the problem of nuclear waste. The UK government finds itself at the centre of a controversy since it must decide whether to give the go-ahead to the new thermal oxide reprocessing plant (Thorp) built by British Nuclear Fuels in Cumbria. Thorp, one of only two such facilities in the world (the other is in France), would separate dangerous products like uranium and plutonium from the waste, and send them back to their owners. But there is a growing view that it would be simpler and safer to hold the waste in dry storage. The waste problem is most acute in Germany where no further development of the nuclear power industry can take place until it has been sorted out. The issue has proved so divisive that an early resolution seems unlikely, much to the frustration of the local nuclear utilities and power equipment makers. Nuclear power is also facing an increasing challenge from natural gas, whose abundance and suitability for power generation has weakened the nuclear lobby's argument that traditional power sources would dwindle. Natural gas power stations are much quicker and cheaper to build than nuclear, and are relatively friendly from an environmental point of view. Little surprise, therefore, that the World Energy Council's report on West Europe last year foresaw only a small increase in nuclear's net contribution up to the year 2005, and, barring a major shift in public opinion, a steady decline thereafter. What little new plant comes on stream will be offset by closures of ageing stations. But the same WEC report said that if public acceptance did turn more positive, nuclear capacity in the region could grow by over 50 per cent by the year 2020 provided there were no major accidents, and control technology improved. The nuclear industry is trying hard to bring about this more positive trend. An indicator may come in September when Finland is to vote on whether to build a new nuclear station. One of the factors shaping public opinion will be what happens in east Europe where the safety of communist-built reactors is a top concern. The West has allocated large sums of money to help the east Europeans and the Russians improve their nuclear stations, but actual work has been held up by procedural and legal wrangles, though there are now signs of movement. For example Kozloduy, the large Bulgarian station once described as the most dangerous in the world, is reported to be in a much safer state. A number of east European countries are pressing on with plans to build nuclear stations. The Czech and Slovak republics have half a dozen units under construction between them, and Romania is going ahead with five Canadian-designed plants. Russia has plans for some two dozen new stations, though only 12 could be described as firm. There is less certainty in other former communist states. The Ukraine has decided to shut down the only two of Chernobyl's four units which are still operating, and is debating whether to proceed with others under construction. Poland has frozen its only plant. Although East European public opinion is not as hostile towards nuclear power as in the West, the real test there is whether the region can afford to do without it.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  NUCLEAR POWER IN EUROPE AT END OF 1992  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    Working    Incomplete     Nuclear %                    reactors   reactors       of market  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium            7          0              59.9 Bulgaria           6          0              32.5 Czech Rep.         4          2              20.7 Finland            4          4              33.2 France             56         5              72.9 Germany            21         0              30.1 Hungary            4          0              46.4 Lithuania          2          1              60 (est) Netherlands        2          0              4.9 Romania            0          5              - Russia             28         18             11.8 Slovak Rep.        4          4              49.5 Slovenia           1          0              34.6 Spain              9          0              36.4 Sweden             12         0              43.2 Switzerland        5          0              39.6 UK                 37         1              23.2 Ukraine            15         6              25 (est)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: International Atomic Energy Agency  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

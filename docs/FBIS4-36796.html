			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, June 13, INA--Some 4,574 Iraqi people have  reported dead over the past month of April because of the  negative consequences of the ongoing economic sanctions.  [sentence as received]    A recent report by the Ministry of Health has showed an  alarming rise in mortality rate among Iraqi people, and in  particular among children over the past month of April (three  and a half years after the imposition of the embargo) in  camparison with mortality rate recorded during the same period  in 1989 (a year before the imposition of the embargo).    The report blamed the rise in mortality rate to the dearth  of  food and medicine because of the UN-imposed trade sanctions on  Iraq.    As usual, children are hit hardest by the sanctions.  According to the report some 3,119 children under the age of  five perished because of diarrhea, pneumonia and malnutrition  related diseases in comparison with some 347 children died over  the same period in 1989.    The Ministry's report attributed the rise in fatalities  among  children to acute shortages of food and medicine because of the  trade sanctions and shortages of clean potable water and  breakdown of a number of water-treatment plants in some parts of  the country due to the bombing by U.S.-allies aircraft during  the war and lack of spare parts for maintenance and repair work.    The Ministry's report noted that during April, 1989, a year  before the imposition of the sanctions, the number of children  struck by malnutrition related diseases was 71, whereas the  number of children fatalities over the same period 1994 reached  some 1,146 scoring an almost a 1,514 per cent increase.    Moreover, the report showed that diarrhea has claimed the  lives of 122 children under the age of five over the month of  April 1989 in comparison with some 940 deaths recorded during  the same period in 1994, that is some 670.5 per cent increase.    Likewise, the number of children fatalities because of  penumonia during April 1994 recorded a sharp increase of 570.8  per cent, the report pointed out, indicating that the number of  deaths registered during April 1989 was 154 in comparison with  some 1,033 deaths for the same period in 1994.    As for patients who suffer from chronic disease, the report  noted that hypertension, diabetes and malignant neoplasms were  the main causes of the death of 1,455 compared with some 454  deaths registered over the same period in 1989.    According to the Ministry's report, some 105 people died  because of hypertension over the month of April, 1989 in  comparison with 401 who died over the same period in 1994,  recording an increase of 281.9 per cent over 1989's figure.    In the meantime, fatalities caused by diabetes have  registered a sharp rise in April 1994, said the report, noting  that some 272 people have died over the month of April 1994  compared with some 92 ones for the same period in 1989, scoring  an increase of 195.65 per cent over 1989's figure.    According to the report, some 783 people who suffer from  malignant neoplames have died during April 1994 compared with  some 257 ones died over the same period in 1989.    The cause of the sharp rise in deaths among patients who  suffer from cancer is blamed on the inadequate radio therapy  received by the patients as a result of dearth of medicine  caused by the embargo.    According to an earlier report by the nuclear and  radioactive  therapy hospital, the hospital's departments face sharp  shortages of chemical and hormone medicines.    The absence of cobalt radioactive element needed for the  treatment of malignant tumours has hit plans to care for people  in bad need for radio therapy.</p>

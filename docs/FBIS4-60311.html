			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source at the Transportation Ministry  has stated that the Transportation Ministry wishes to draw the  attention of all airlines and maritime shipping companies to the  fact that the airspace over and the waters around the airports  and seaports in the following areas: Aden, Hadhramaut, and  al-Mahrah, are military zones. Consequently, flying, sailing,  landing at airports, or docking at seaports in these areas may  expose their aircraft and vessels to danger. The Government of  the Republic of Yemen will not be responsible in any way for any  damage or losses any company may incur as a result of violating  these regulations.    Issued by the Transportation Ministry.</p>

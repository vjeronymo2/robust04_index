			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Argentine IMF credit THE board of the Inter- national Monetary Fund last night approved a Dollars 3.15bn (Pounds 1.8bn) extended fund facility for Argentina, report Stephen Fidler and Agencies. The funds will be disbursed over the three-year life of the programme. Approval of the programme is an important part of the government's attempt to secure a comprehensive restructuring of its debt with commercial banks. Some Dollars 900m of the funds can be set aside for use as 'enhancements', funds used to guarantee the concessional bonds exchanged for bank debt under the Brady Plan restructuring. The EFF follows an 11-month, Dollars 1.1bn stand-by loan facility agreed in July last year by the Fund.</p>

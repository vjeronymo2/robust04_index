			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1992 (26): What users said about their CAD systems - Computer aided design INSIDE this issue of of Software at Work we survey the market for computer aided design software. This has expanded rapidly as computers become cheaper, and a larger number of small companies are able to afford CAD systems, writes Claire Gooding. Our research has followed the usual Software At Work pattern, asking users to tell us their stories and identify the pitfalls and business benefits of acquiring CAD software. One of the common grumbles of participants in Software At Work's CAD research was 'performance.' PC users particularly resent waiting even a few seconds, yet are probably unaware that, in terms of the power for the price, they are more fortunate than minicomputer users of a few years ago. Another complaint that occurred in all levels of user on all sorts of hardware was a lack of 'user friendliness.' The impenetrability of some CAD packages is probably explained by their gradual evolution. As the need for specific features arises, the developers add extra extensions. One user described this as 'sprawling.' It makes finding specific features a challenge, rather like finding the right department in a once-elegant building extended with Portakabins. No-one admitted to knowing all the features of the package they were using. Another feature of many interviews was the trust buyers put in a particular value-added reseller (VAR), as a middle man between the end-user and hardware and software vendors. VARS are often the first stop for advice and support, and particularly tailoring, to provide menus of specific features. The question of 'culture' loomed large in nearly all the interviews with users. CAD technology, it seems, has to be introduced gently, and with great tact, in order not to frighten and alienate people. Inevitably, some users are more comfortable with the computer than others. David Taffs of Ove Arup has identified a tendency for working groups to develop their own, informal 'centres of expertise.' One or two enthusiastic users become 'experts,' and all enquiries, (and inevitably the actual work), gets channelled through them. The danger of this pattern, especially in companies that do not invest in training, is that the technophobes never acquire new computer skills: the culture cannot spread beyond its small corner. This matters, for the point on which nearly all respondents in our survey agreed was that CAD truly becomes valuable to the entire organisation when it ceases to be standalone. Linked with other disciplines - engineering, quality control, documentation  -via multimedia and electronic data exchange, the CAD system comes out of its corner and begins to pay back the expenditure. All agreed was that the skill of the user was what really mattered. Architects and engineers at Ove Arup (see report, page 11) and anywhere else, need the skills of imagination, aggression, analysis and communication first and foremost, before computer expertise. The job of running the drawings off on the computer cannot be left to the office whizz-kid 'who really understands computers,' because this keyboard supremo probably lacks the experience to make the beautiful drawings workable. Whether dealing with rock stars (see report on Fisher Park, page 12) or crane-operators on a site with awkward access, it is the vision and experience of what can and can't work that matters. In CAD, as in any other software application, the system is only a tool, or, as Jonathon Park of Fisher Park, puts it: 'An electronic pencil.'</p>

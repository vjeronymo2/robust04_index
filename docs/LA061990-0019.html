			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> FOR ARABS IN ISRAEL, ALIENATION;  </P> <P> THEY ARE ASKING IF ARAB CITIZENS CAN BE MORE THAN REFUGEES IN THEIR OWN LAND.  THEIR ANGER IS MATCHED BY HARDENING ATTITUDES AND SUSPICION FROM JEWS.  </P> <P> Actually, there are two En Hods, but one is almost invisible.  </P> <P> The older En Hod, now an Israeli artists' colony, is a village of picturesque  stone houses set on a wooded hill. It is just off the old Haifa road and is  clearly marked with a sign to attract tourists.  </P> <P> The other En Hod, an Arab village, is also set among trees, but there the  similarity ends. There are no signs along the road that leads to it, and it  does not appear on maps. There is no electricity. Sewage flows into the open  and down a ravine from a makeshift system of pipes. The streets are unpaved  and, in the summer, dusty: Appalachia on the Mediterranean.  </P> <P> The founders of this En Hod were once residents of what is now the artists'  colony, and their story has become a symbol of frustration for Arabs all over  Israel.  </P> <P> They fled their homes 42 years ago, during the Israeli War of Independence,  expecting to return when the war ended. But the new Israeli state has not  permitted them to return. Israeli painters took over the picturesque houses and  turned them into studios.  </P> <P> Not only have they been prevented from going home, they have been denied  municipal status for their new village, and this means no electricity, no  sewers, no proper schools.  </P> <P> They are refugees in their own country, experiencing in the extreme what many  Israeli Arabs have come to know: that they do not belong and never will, that  although they can vote they will never really be part of a Jewish state that is  in conflict with the Arab world outside -- and within.  </P> <P> Mohammed abu Elhijeh, who was born in the older En Hod and is the son of a  village leader, recently told a reporter: "We want to know, finally, are we  citizens of this state or not? We want to know, what is the difference between  us and our neighbors?"  </P> <P> Such questions are being asked more and more by Arabs and Jews in Israel. For  years, they could be dismissed. But the Palestinian uprising in the West Bank  and Gaza Strip has begun to spill over into Israel proper, not just into the  streets but into the minds of the 650,000 Arab citizens of Israel. There is  concern that Israel's Arabs may be drifting into permanent alienation.  </P> <P> The Arab awakening is matched on the Jewish side by hardened attitudes and  growing suspicion. A poll published at Haifa University recently showed that a  majority of Israeli Jews favor a ban on Arab representation in the Knesset, the  Parliament. Three out of four Israeli Jews said they would not work for an  Arab.  </P> <P> On both sides, the ill feeling has been manifested in hostile words, and in  some cases, acts.  </P> <P> Last month, Arab Israel erupted in unusual violence after an Israeli gunman  shot and killed seven Palestinian workers at the town of Rishon Le Zion. Masked  youths hurled stones and gasoline bombs at cars, smashed windows and displayed  the outlawed flag of Palestine.  </P> <P> In Nazareth, the largest Arab city outside Jerusalem, arsonists burned down a  bank. In Lod, Ramle and Haifa, Arabs took to the streets for the first time in  memory.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir warned: "I think it ought to be said to the Arabs  considered citizens of Israel that yesterday and the day before they passed the  limit of what is allowed. . . . I really hope this won't repeat itself."  </P> <P> The violence came on the heels of a series of nationalistic signals: incidents  of arson, discovery of an Arab summer camp where Palestinian political songs  and lore were taught, the appearance of anti-Israeli graffiti on walls, polls  showing that most Israeli Arabs want a Palestinian state alongside Israel.  </P> <P> For their part, some Israeli politicians have made explicit their feelings that  their Arab fellow citizens are nothing of the sort.  </P> <P> Not long ago, the mayor of the Galilee town of Carmiel complained that Arabs  were moving in at an alarming rate, threatening the Jewish majority. A Likud  Party candidate for mayor of Acre campaigned on a promise to expel Arabs from  the city's historic Crusader-era core. (He lost; Arabs voted overwhelmingly for  his opponent.)  </P> <P> Colliding attitudes reached a political peak in April when Shimon Peres, leader  of the Labor Party, came close to unseating Prime Minister Shamir, head of  Likud. Peres, a leading dove, appeared to have lined up just enough votes in  the Knesset to take power, among them seven seats held by Arabs.  </P> <P> Likud leaders tried to put pressure on supporters of Peres by charging that his  majority was "non-Jewish," meaning dependent on Arabs. The anti-Arab charge was  led by Likud's Ehud Olmert, who, ironically, was then the minister in charge of  Arab welfare.  </P> <P> Peres' majority disappeared for other reasons. He was abandoned by members of  religious parties who disagreed with his dovish line on settling the  Palestinian conflict. But the message to Israeli Arabs was clear: Although they  hold full voting rights, they may not decide the makeup of Israel's government.  </P> <P> "This was a costly event for Israel," said Yaron Ezrahi, a political theorist  at Hebrew University. "The Arabs were told they are not legitimate. It  confirmed their feelings of inferiority."  </P> <P> Statistics tell a depressing tale of Arab life in Israel. The rate of Arab  unemployment is estimated at more than 20%, more than twice the national rate.  Half of the 600,000 Israelis who live below the poverty line are Arab. Five  percent of university students are Arab, although the percentage of Arabs in  the population at large is 18%.  </P> <P> Since the Rishon Le Zion incident, Israeli authorities have gone to great  lengths to counter the argument that Arabs are second-class citizens. Officials  take pains to point out that Arabs in Israel are better off than many Arab  citizens of neighboring states. If Arab income is only two-thirds the income of  Jews, they say, it is because they started at a lower level. The reduced  municipal budgets for Arab towns are explained by the lower taxes collected  from the Arabs.  </P> <P> Israeli Jews and Arabs agree that one obstacle to Arab progress in everything  from social welfare to education to acceptance in high-security jobs is their  exemption from military conscription.  </P> <P> The army in Israel is not just a military force; military service represents a  kind of passage to citizenship, a communal rite that conveys full identity with  the state. A Jewish Israeli who refuses to serve faces ostracism. Arabs,  already looked on with suspicion, are excluded from this most respected of  national institutions.  </P> <P> Arabs are not drafted, although some Bedouins and Druze, the latter an offshoot  sect of Islam, volunteer and serve in special units. No specific numbers are  available, but the few other Arabs who volunteer for the army are almost all  rejected.  </P> <P> Several right-wing politicians have suggested that Arabs not be allowed to vote  because they do not perform military service. Arab politicians are more  ambivalent, especially so because the army is used to suppress the Palestinian  revolt against Israeli rule.  </P> <P> Beneath the surface give-and-take over the rights and responsibilities of Arab  citizens, there are other contradictions. A few years ago, a survey of Israelis  showed that while 60% wanted to burden Arabs with the same national obligations  as Jews, fewer than half supported equal rights for them.  </P> <P> Many Arabs have come to believe that they will always be pushed to the back of  the line, be it for jobs or, as in the case of En Hod, common services.  </P> <P> "We all work in Israel," said Abu Elhijeh, the village leader's son. "We travel  around and see what is going on. We want to live like other people, like the  rest of the Israelis."  </P> <P> En Hod was a Crusader outpost that was settled by Arabs in the distant past. In  1948, when Britain abandoned its hold on Palestine and Israelis and Arabs went  to war, the families of En Hod conducted raids on the nearby highway to Haifa.  Armed Israelis took over the village, and most of the residents took refuge  abroad or with families elsewhere in Israel.  </P> <P> But one clan stayed on, on nearby land used for grazing, and formed the nucleus  of the new En Hod.  </P> <P> These people raised goats and grew olives and were generally ignored by the  government. Then, in the 1970s, the state put up a fence to keep the village  from expanding. Trees were planted for a new national park, and the shade of  these trees killed the olive trees. Goats were forbidden on grounds that they  damaged the environment.  </P> <P> But the Arabs persisted, and they found a loophole in the building  restrictions: The fence meant to hem them in obstructed only the march of the  village up the mountain. The ravine was left unfenced, and the residents began  to build down, often at impossible angles.  </P> <P> "It took three years to lay the foundation of a house because we had to scrape  away at the mountainside," Abu Elhijeh said.  </P> <P> In 1986, the village began to lobby for municipal status for its 130 residents.  This seemed to awaken the government to the existence of Arab En Hod, and it  was to the village's disadvantage. Instead of helping out, officials sent word  that three new houses would be demolished.  </P> <P> A sit-in and a sympathetic campaign on television and in newspapers saved the  houses. But the publicity awakened other Arab communities with similar  problems.  </P> <P> It turned out that restrictions on the growth of Arab communities had led to a  spate of illegal building nationwide. About 40 communities banded together with  En Hod to solve a problem common to them all, the lack of services. The  campaign was backed by the New Israel Fund, a North American and Israeli group  that supports community work and promotes democracy in Israel.  </P> <P> The Arabs complained that smaller Israeli villages get full services. Also,  remote Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip are provided  with roads, water and electricity.  </P> <P> The government says it is studying the requests for recognition, but it points  out that many of the Arab settlements are scattered and that jurisdictional  problems abound. Six thousand Arab houses were built illegally, officials  estimate.  </P> <P> "In the end, there will be no choice; the settlements will be recognized and  included in some municipality," said Ilan Cohen, an official in the Arab  Affairs Ministry. He did not venture to guess when that might be.  </P> <P> The common effort of En Hod and the other Arab communities has had a chilling  effect on the Jews of old En Hod. After years of paying lip service to the  Arabs' complaints, they have grown hostile now that the Arabs are flexing their  political muscle.  </P> <P> "They are being exploited by leftists and don't know how to stop it," said Mara  Ben-Dov, a painter, sculptor and 16-year resident of En Hod.  </P> <P> Like others, Ben-Dov fears that recognition of the Arab village will somehow  mushroom into mass urbanization and clutter the landscape with chicken coops  and auto repair shops. As it is, En Hod is in dispute with a neighboring Jewish  kibbutz over the farmers' plans to build a food processing plant.  </P> <P> "I don't feel bad at living in a home that used to be Arab," Ben-Dov said. "All  Israel was once Arab, so it's impossible to think like that. These things  happen in war. Look, my parents were refugees, my mother from Austria, my  father from Yugoslavia. My grandparents were killed by the Nazis. We never got  anything from it all."  </P> <P> It was a Saturday, and old En Hod was filling up with day trippers pouring out  of buses. At the Bonanza Restaurant, which used to be the village mosque, the  pianist, a recent immigrant from the Soviet Union, was playing "Strangers in  the Night."  </P> <P> The call of the muezzin from less than two miles away, in the other En Hod,  could be heard, summoning the faithful to mid-day prayers at the mosque the  villagers have built to replace the old one.  </P></p>

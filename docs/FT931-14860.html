			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: Bangkok Bank beats forecast with Bt10.5bn BANGKOK Bank, Thailand's largest bank, posted better-than-expected net profits of Bt10.5bn (Dollars 411m), or Bt10.54 a share, for 1992, against Bt7.3bn, or Bt8.23, a year ago, Reuter reports from Bangkok. The bank said the earnings growth could be attributed to a 14.9 per cent rise in lending during the year, despite sluggish investment by the Thai private sector. Mr Mike Stead, an analyst at Union Securities, a local brokerage, said Bangkok Bank had been expected to net Bt9.9bn profits, or Bt9.90 a share, in 1992. Mr Damrong Krisnamara, deputy chairman, said the bank was raising its 1992 provision for loan loss reserves to Bt15bn from Bt12bn a year earlier. The bank would continue to focus on improving the quality of its loans in 1993 with its market share receiving a lower priority. Mr Chatri Sophonpanich, executive chairman, said the bank was seeking to expand its foreign business especially in Indochina and China, to boost its position as a big regional bank.</p>

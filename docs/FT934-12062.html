			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Revolt over defence cuts could threaten government majority THE ROW in Tory ranks over further defence cuts erupted with renewed vigour yesterday on the eve of the first full cabinet discussion of departmental spending targets for the next three years. A group of 14 Tory MPs signed a letter threatening to vote against any move to impose more 'substantial' defence cuts. Any such cuts would 'seriously jeopardise the capability of this country's military forces to defend it', the letter warned. A rebellion on this scale would overturn the government's precarious 17-strong majority. Its possibility will strengthen the hand of Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, ahead of what is certain to be a lively cabinet meeting. After two months of discussions with ministers, the so-called EDX spending committee has now finalised its recommendations for departmental budgets until 1996-97. But it has not achieved a firm settlement, leaving the final deal to be hammered out in cabinet. Downing Street acknowledged yesterday that more than one cabinet meeting might be needed to secure an agreement. Yesterday's letter - delivered personally to the prime minister, Mr John Major, by Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Tory chairman of the Commons defence committee - follows reports that the Treasury was targeting the Ministry of Defence for up to Pounds 1bn of new cuts. Although a partial retreat by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is thought to have defused Mr Rifkind's threat to demand a full defence review, the defence secretary is expected to use today's meeting to oppose those cuts still demanded. The letter, which the signatories did not intend to be made public, argued that Britain's defence forces were 'at best already fully stretched'. Signatories included Sir Jerry Wiggin, the former defence minister, Mr Patrick Cormack (Staffordshire South), Mr Christopher Gill, the Eurosceptic MP for Ludlow, and Mr Cyril Townsend (Bexleyheath). It later emerged that the number of signatures might understate the scale of the threatened rebellion, as some Tories complained they were not asked to sign it. Political notebook, Page 8</p>

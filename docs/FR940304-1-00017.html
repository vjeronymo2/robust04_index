The waiver request must include a plan setting forth the intended sources and uses of the funds. The proposed amendments would change the amount of nonmember and public unit accounts that a credit union may maintain, without a waiver, to 20 percent of total shares or $1.5 million, whichever is greater. Credit unions accepting nonmember accounts in excess of 20 percent of total shares but not greater than $1.5 million would, as under the current rule, be required to develop a written plan and send it to the Regional Director. Prior NCUA approval, however, would no longer be required. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be postmarked by April 4, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Send comments to Becky Baker, Secretary of the Board, 1775 Duke Street, Alexandria, Virginia 22314&hyph;3428. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Michael J.

Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NCUA Board, as part of its ongoing program of regulatory review, proposes to revise the regulation under which federally insured credit unions maintain nonmember and public unit accounts. Federal credit unions (FCUs) are authorized by section 107(6) of the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1757(6)) to receive nonmember shares from other credit unions, from certain governmental entities (``public units'') and, if the credit union has a ``low-income'' designation from NCUA, from other outside sources. These nonmember shares, and equivalent accounts authorized for federally insured state credit unions under the state law are defined by section 101(5) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1752(5)) as ``accounts'' and ``member accounts'' for purposes of the various provisions of the FCU Act, including those establishing insurance coverage by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NCUA's current regulation on nonmember accounts requires any federally-insured credit union that wishes to accept nonmember accounts in excess of 20 percent of total shares to submit to NCUA a plan setting forth the intended use of the funds and obtain NCUA approval. This rule was imposed in December 1988 (53 FR 50918, 12/19/88) in response to mismanagement and misuse of nonmember accounts by some credit unions. Pursuant to &sect;741.6 of NCUA's Regulations, federally-insured state chartered credit unions must adhere to NCUA's requirements regarding nonmember accounts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> B. Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In most credit unions, the only forms of nonmember accounts are public unit and credit union accounts. However, as described above, credit unions with a low-income designation from NCUA are authorized to accept nonmember accounts from any source. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When the current nonmember account rule was instituted, NCUA's concern with these accounts stemmed from abuses involving large sums of money, often in excess of the $100,000 limit. In order to attract and retain these accounts, some credit unions paid higher than market dividend rates. Large influxes of funds into credit unions caused asset/liability management problems that were often not within management's expertise to control. In some cases, the total amount of such account was far in excess of the amount necessary to meet the legitimate needs of the members and was used to fund high risk loans and questionable investments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The imposition of the 20 percent limitation has virtually eliminated problems involving nonmember funds. As discussed more fully below, however, the process of requesting waivers, which has fallen almost entirely on low-income credit unions, has proven burdensome for some credit unions. The purpose of this proposal is to reduce that burden without significantly increasingly the risk to the credit union system and the NCUSIF. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

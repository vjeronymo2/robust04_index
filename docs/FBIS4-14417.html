			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Russian Prime Minister Viktor </F> Chernomyrdin by correspondent Gabor Izbeki, on the eve of his  visit to Budapest, in Moscow on 30 March; Chernomyrdin speaks in  Russian with superimposed Hungarian translation -- recorded]    [Text] [Izbeki] The Russian prime minister is basically  satisfied with the development of Hungarian-Russian economic  ties and trusts that his visit will further boost them. [passage  omitted] Viktor Chernomyrdin sees no serious problem in the  significant difference in value between the Russian and  Hungarian deliveries.    [Chernomyrdin] It has various reasons. I would not hold  either side responsible for that, and I would certainly not  blame either of them. The transitional, semi-market nature of  the Russian economy has of course a considerable influence on  this. [passage omitted] The creation of the legal basis of a  market economy is now taking place in Russia. The bilateral  agreements to be signed in Budapest, for instance, will  partially serve this purpose. Economic processes cannot be  changed all at once. However, I am certain that the imbalance  in Hungarian-Russian exports and imports will gradually decrease.    [Izbeki] The issue of debts inherited from the Soviet era is  also a subject matter in which our countries are ahead of  everyone else. The Russian Government is determined to settle  this debate once and for all and as soon as possible. Viktor  Chernomyrdin answered my question regarding this. He welcomes  the Hungarian proposal that part of the still outstanding debt  of about $800 million would be invested here in Russia. The  details, of course, are yet to be discussed, but in theory, it  is supported. Thus, I see no problem regarding this. The debt  issue can be resolved, he added. Russia is a reliable partner  in energy deliveries as well, he said.    [Chernomyrdin] We undertake responsibility for what we have  promised and agreed on. [passage omitted] As far as our  neighbors are concerned, in my view, Ukraine has to handle this  matter in a civilized manner, as it is customary in the world.  The diversion or tapping of deliveries, or similar non-business  methods are unacceptable. Russia and the recipient European  countries expect nothing less from the transit countries than to  fulfill their business obligations.    [Izbeki] Viktor Chernomyrdin, who has been Russia's prime  minister since December 1992, is of the view that the Russian  reforms, the economy's transformation, could not have moved  forward any faster, more successfully and less painfully than  they did. [passage omitted]    Concerning the power struggle within the Russian top  leadership, Viktor Chernomyrdin denied the allegation that he  was striving for greater power than what he currently has.</p>

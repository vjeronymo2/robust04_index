			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Rates rebate helps John Lewis reverse recent decline with 31% rise to Pounds 93.3m John Lewis Partnership, the employee-owned department store and supermarket group, revealed a change in its fortunes yesterday with a 31 per cent increase from Pounds 71.4m to Pounds 93.3m in pre-tax profits for the year to January 29. The figure was boosted by a Pounds 10m business rates rebate, Pounds 7m of which related to earlier years, after revaluation of the group's properties for rating purposes. Adjusting for this gain, the pre-tax profit was up 16 per cent on a like-for-like basis. 'This is perhaps a truer reflection of last year's performance,' said Mr Stuart Hampson, chairman. The increase ended four successive years of declining profits, and came in spite of a warning last year from Mr Hampson that the partnership faced another year 'perhaps even of sharply falling profit'. He said yesterday: 'I am delighted to have been proved wrong by the sharp turnround in our performance,' adding that the the improvement resulted from beating sales estimates while keeping costs under control. Turnover increased 2.6 per cent to Pounds 2.42bn (Pounds 2.36bn) with sales at the 22 department stores up 5.5 per cent at Pounds 1.23bn, representing a 7 per cent increase on a 52-week basis (the year 1992-93 was 53 weeks). Sales at the 107 Waitrose supermarkets were static at Pounds 1.15bn. Mr Hampson described this as 'no mean achievement' given the increasing competition in the food market, and the refusal of Waitrose to break the law by trading on Sundays. John Lewis's central council has now approved the principle of Sunday trading and some Waitrose stores are likely to open on Sundays once the government's Sunday Trading Bill becomes law. However, trading profits at Waitrose, not disclosed until May, were hit by the cost of investment in new technology and distribution arrangements. Sales in the wholesale and manufacturing business slipped from Pounds 40.8m to Pounds 40.2m. John Lewis's 33,500 employee-partners will receive annual bonuses of 10 per cent of salary, worth a total of Pounds 34.6m. Mr Hampson said he was pleased the bonus percentage had returned to double figures after falling to 8 per cent last year, the lowest since 1958-59.</p>

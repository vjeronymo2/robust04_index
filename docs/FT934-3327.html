			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Observer: Die laaste woord Little wonder some Afrikaners show signs of deep paranoia. First their language, Afrikaans, loses pride of place as joint official language with English; under the new order there are now 11 official languages. Then some wine estates ceased using Afrikaans on their labels, much to the anguish of the Afrikaans newspaper Beeld, which actually ran an editorial on the matter. Now South African Breweries - which accounts for 98 per cent of malt beer sales - and the local bottler of Coca-Cola have decided to drop Afrikaans from their cans. This will allow a redesign which should lower production costs by 2 cents a can. Coke's view is that with 11 official languages it made sense to choose one. SAB's logic is that it's moving into exports, and who reads Afrikaans overseas?</p>

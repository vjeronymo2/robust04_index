			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Iranians bomb opposition base in Iraqi desert IRANIAN aircraft bombed an Iranian opposition base in the Iraqi desert yesterday, their first raid into Iraq since a ceasefire in 1988, Reuter reports from Ashraf Base, Iraq. Anti-aircraft batteries shot down one, and the exiled Iranian Mujahideen Khalq said it captured two crewmen. The Mujahideen showed foreign journalists bomb damage at Ashraf base, 60 miles from Baghdad, and the burning wreckage of a F-4 Phantom. Iran said it had responded to a Mujahideen raid on two border villages on Saturday. Officers of the Mujahideen's National Liberation Army (NLA) said a dozen Iranian F-4 and F-5 Phantoms attacked in six waves dropping cluster bombs, firing rockets and strafing roads and vehicles. Hundreds of Iranian dissidents stormed Tehran's embassies throughout Europe and North America yesterday in protest at the bombing. Damage was extensive, several buildings were set afire, and there were widespread injuries and arrests. Missions in Germany, the UK, France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway and Canada were attacked. In New York, Iran's mission to the UN was briefly occupied and an employee held hostage. In London, embassy windows were broken and a petrol bomb was thrown at Iran Air's offices.</p>

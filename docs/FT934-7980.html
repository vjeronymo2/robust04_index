			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: GenAcc setback The second worst performance among the FT-SE 100 list came from composite insurer General Accident, which retreated 4.8 per cent after the group revealed third-quarter profits well below the market's best estimates. Dealers pointed out, however, that some of the more optimistic insurance analysts had shifted their forecasts higher over the past week or so in the wake of perceived good results from companies such as BAT Industries and Royal Insurance. 'There were some very full forecasts in the market and, sadly, they have not come off, that is why the shares have fallen so sharply,' said one top insurance analyst. GenAcc's nine-month profits came out at Pounds 206m, compared with market estimates which had ranged from below Pounds 200m to as much as Pounds 230m. Mr Trevor May, insurance specialist at BZW, said the market had got carried away with the company's first-half numbers, which he said had been surprisingly good. He upgraded his current year forecast, however, from Pounds 260m to Pounds 270m and that for next year from Pounds 330m to Pounds 345m, although emphasising that the group's dividend growth scope remains 'limited'. Hoare Govett, GenAcc's house broker, said the market had overreacted on the downside against some rather unrealistic expectations. Hoare is looking for current year profits of Pounds 282m and profits of Pounds 367m for next year. Some of the big institutions were thought to have switched from GenAcc into Sun Alliance. The latter rose 6 to 370p on turnover of 3.2m, GenAcc settled 33 lower at 658p on much higher than usual turnover of 3m.</p>

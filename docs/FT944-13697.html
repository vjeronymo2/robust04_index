			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: BP firm against the trend BP was one of only a handful of FT-SE 100 constituents to make progress yesterday, the shares responding to excellent exploration news from its latest well in the Foinavon field, west of the Shetland Islands, but also to better than expected third-quarter figures from a number of US oil majors. BP is scheduled to announce third-quarter results next Tuesday. Analysts were sceptical of, but refused to rule out completely, the chances of an increase in the quarterly dividend. Another bull point for BP, sector specialists said, was the absence in recent sessions of any substantial selling from the US. A number of US funds, who bought into BP around 18 months ago at around the Dollars 50 mark for each ADR, the equivalent of 12 BP ordinaries, have been persistent sellers of the stock from Dollars 70 upwards. US holdings are now below the 20 per cent mark, compared with a peak of over 26 per cent. Analysts were enthusiastic about flow rates averaging 17,000 barrels a day from well 204/24a-4 in the Foinavon field; 'It suggests the area will be a major new oil province for both BP and Shell and it could be that the market has not fully taken on board the financial impact of this,' said one. BP has an 80 per cent stake in the Foinavon block and Shell 20 per cent. Elsewhere, west of the Shetlands BP and Shell are mostly 50/50 partners. BP were marginally higher at 411p. Shell fell 6 1/2 to 694p.</p>

The Iranian diplomat came to Baku after visiting Yerevan and  Nakhichevan on a peace-making mission in accordance with wishes  of the two Transcaucasian leaders.    Geydar Aliyev confirmed the Azeri stand favoring peaceful  settlement of the Armenian-Azeri conflict. At the same time, he  said "the Armenian side continues to stake on force and does not  hurry to free occupied Arab lands despite resolutions of the  United Nations Security Council."    "Bearing this in mind, the Azeri side had to take measures  to  free and protect its lands," stressed the president. He said  part of the occupied lands, including 40-kilometer section of  the Azeri-Iranian border, are under control of the Azeri Armed  Forces.    The interlocutors also discussed the protection of the  Azeri-  Iranian border and development of bilateral relations in joint  extraction and sales of oil and transit transportation.</p>

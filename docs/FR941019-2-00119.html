The Commission may also seek injunctive relief in federal court against any such conduct under Section 13(b) of the FTC Act. Although enforcement at the Commission relating to international deceptive practices has become increasingly important over time, these Guidelines are limited to the Commission's antitrust authority under the unfair methods of competition language of Section 5. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. &sect;45 (1988 &amp; Supp. 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.4&blank;Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Title II of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (``HSR Act''), 15 U.S.C. &sect;18a, provides the Department and the Commission with several procedural devices to facilitate enforcement of the antitrust laws with respect to anticompetitive mergers and acquisitions. <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  The HSR Act requires persons engaged in commerce or in any activity affecting commerce to notify the Agencies of proposed mergers or acquisitions that would exceed statutory size-of-party and size-of-transaction thresholds, <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  to provide certain information relating to reportable transactions, and to wait for a prescribed period_15 days for cash tender offers and 30 days for all other transactions_before consummating the transaction. <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  The Agency may, before the end of the waiting period, request additional information concerning a transaction (make a ``Second Request'') and thereby extend the waiting period beyond the initial one prescribed, to a specified number of days after the receipt of the material required by the Second Request_10 days for cash tender offers and 20 days for all other transactions. <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The scope of the Agencies' jurisdiction under Clayton &sect;7 exceeds the scope of those transactions subject to the premerger notification requirements of the HSR Act. Whether or not the HSR Act premerger notification thresholds are satisfied, either Agency may request the parties to a merger affecting U.S. commerce to provide information voluntarily concerning the transaction. In addition, the Department may issue Civil Investigative Demands (``CIDs'') pursuant to the Antitrust Process Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;1311&hyph;1314 (1988), and the Commission may issue administrative CIDs pursuant to the Act of Aug. 26, 1994, Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;312, &sect;7; 108 Stat. 1691 (1994). The Commission may also issue administrative subpoenas and orders to file special reports under Sections 9 and 6(b) of the FTC Act, respectively. 15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;49, 46(b) (1988). Authority in particular cases is allocated to either the Department or the Commission pursuant to a voluntary clearance protocol. See Antitrust &amp; Trade Reg.

This Section exempts asset acquisitions valued at $15 million or less. It also exempts voting securities acquisitions of $15 million or less unless, as a result of the acquisition, the acquiring person would hold 50 percent or more of the voting securities of an issuer that has annual net sales or total assets of $25 million or more.

Originally drafted to encourage research and development by providing a special antitrust regime for research and development (``R&amp;D'') joint ventures, the NCRPA requires U.S. courts to judge the competitive effects of a challenged joint R&amp;D or joint production venture, or a combination of the two, in properly defined relevant markets and under a rule-of-reason standard. The statute specifies that the conduct ``shall be judged on the basis of its reasonableness, taking into account all relevant factors affecting competition, including, but not limited to, effects on competition in properly defined, relevant research, development, product, process, and service markets.'' 15 U.S.C. &sect;4302. This approach is consistent with the Agencies' general analysis of joint ventures. <FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Guidelines for the Enforcement and Acquisition of Intellectual Property (Proposed), &sect;4; Statements of Antitrust Enforcement Policy and Analytical Principles Relating to Health Care and Antitrust, Issued by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, Sept. 27, 1994, Statement 2 (outlining a four-step approach for joint venture analysis).

The statute limits the monetary relief that may be obtained in private civil suits against the participants in a notified venture to actual rather than treble damages, if the challenged conduct is within the scope of the notification. With respect to joint production ventures, the National Cooperative Production Amendments of 1993, Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;42, 107 Stat. 117, 119, provide that the benefits of the limitation on recoverable damages for claims resulting from conduct within the scope of a notification are not available unless (1) the principal facilities for the production are located within the United States or its territories, and (2) ``each person who controls any party to such venture (including such party itself) is a United States person, or a foreign person from a country whose law accords antitrust treatment no less favorable to United States persons than to such country's domestic persons with respect to participation in joint ventures for production.'' 15 U.S.C. &sect;4306(2) (Supp. 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.6&blank;Webb-Pomerene Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Webb-Pomerene Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;61&hyph;65, provides a limited antitrust exemption for the formation and operation of associations of otherwise competing businesses to engage in collective export sales. The exemption applies only to the export of ``goods, wares, or merchandise.'' <FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>  It does not apply to conduct that has an anticompetitive effect in the United States or that injures domestic competitors of the members of an export association. Nor does it provide any immunity from prosecution under foreign antitrust laws. <FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>  Associations seeking an exemption under the Webb-Pomerene Act must file their articles of agreement and annual reports with the Commission, but pre-formation approval from the Commission is not required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. &sect;61 (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Cases 89/85, etc., Ahlstrom v.

L. No. 97&hyph;290, 96 Stat. 1234, is designed to increase U.S. exports of goods and services. It addresses that goal in several ways. First, in Title II, it encourages more efficient provision of export trade services to U.S. producers and suppliers by reducing restrictions on trade financing provided by financial institutions. <FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>  Second, in Title III, it reduces uncertainty concerning the application of the U.S. antitrust laws to export trade through the creation of a procedure by which persons engaged in U.S. export trade may obtain an export trade certificate of review (``ETCR''). <FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>  Third, in Title IV, it clarifies the jurisdictional rules applicable to non-import cases brought under the Sherman Act and the FTC Act. <FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>  The Title III certificates are discussed briefly here; the jurisdictional rules are treated below in Section 3.1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See 12 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;372, 635 a&hyph;4, 1841, 1843 (1988 &amp; Supp. 1993) (Because Title II does not implicate the antitrust laws, it is not discussed further in these Guidelines.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;4011&hyph;21 (1988 &amp; Supp. 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. &sect;6a (1988); 15 U.S.C. &sect;45(a)(3) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Export trade certificates of review are issued by the Secretary of Commerce with the concurrence of the Attorney General.

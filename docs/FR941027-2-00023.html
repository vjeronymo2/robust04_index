Metallic uranium fuel was irradiated in nuclear reactors at the Hanford Site to create plutonium, which was converted to plutonium nitrate and purified through chemical processing for use in nuclear weapons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Initial production of plutonium metal at the PFP complex began in July, 1949. The complex is located on Hanford's 200 West Area Plateau approximately 32 miles northwest of Richland, Washington. The complex includes production areas, reclamation processes, laboratories and plutonium storage vaults. Several defense missions were carried out within the PFP complex. As the need arose, processes were installed in the PFP to recover as much plutonium as possible and metal production capabilities were updated. Some of the process areas have been deactivated over the last 20 years; however, plutonium recovery activities continued until the production mission ended in 1989. Secure materials storage vaults have been in operation since the early 1960s.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today, operable areas of the complex include the Plutonium Reclamation Facility (PRF), the Remote Mechanical ``C'' (RMC) line plus process support and research laboratories, the secure storage vaults and support areas. About 240 employees work at the PFP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The DOE believes the continued presence of relatively large quantities of chemically reactive materials in their present form and location within the PFP poses an unacceptable long-term risk to the workers and the environment. Consequently, in 1993, DOE announced its proposal to operate certain processes in the PFP to stabilize those materials and to prepare an Environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assessment (EA) pursuant to NEPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As part of the NEPA process for the proposed EA, DOE conducted public meetings in the summer and fall of 1993 in Richland, WA; Seattle, WA; Portland, OR; Hood River, OR; and Spokane, WA to discuss the proposal to stabilize the chemically reactive materials. As a result of the public comments received, DOE decided that an EIS would be the appropriate level of NEPA review. DOE also decided to expand the scope of review to include cleanout of the PFP (except for storage vaults) to a state where the facility would be ready for D&amp;D and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> future uses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To alleviate immediate safety concerns, interim actions have been taken or are underway to minimize the amount of reactive residual materials left in process areas when the plutonium production mission ended in 1989. The range of interim actions includes transferring solutions into vented metal containers for safe storage, repackaging of certain solutions from plastic bottles to safer containers, cleanup of surface radioactive contamination to reduce worker exposure, and removal of portions of ventilation ductwork and piping which contain residual plutonium. The thermal stabilization of sludges is a proposed interim action being addressed by an EA currently in progress. Other interim actions could be proposed during the EIS preparation period to address other specific safety concerns. All interim actions are or will be covered by appropriate NEPA documentation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed action would place the PFP complex in a state ready for potential D&amp;D and/or a future mission while maintaining its current material storage capability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Purpose and Need for Agency Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The DOE needs to take action to minimize safety concerns, reduce the exposure of Hanford Site workers to radiation, and reduce the risk to the public. The proposed action would clean out inactive PFP complex facilities (except storage areas), stabilize reactive residual material for long-term storage, and store the stabilized material pending a DOE decision on ultimate storage or disposition of fissile materials. Upon completion of the proposed action, the PFP complex would be in a state ready for D&amp;D and/or future uses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Preliminary Description of Cleanout Alternatives <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following cleanout alternatives are currently being considered for detailed analysis in the EIS:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Wet Cleaning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Contaminated equipment or facility surfaces would be sprayed with or soaked or immersed in nitric acid and rinsed with dilute acid. The rinse solutions would be collected in tankage and stabilized in a manner similar to other acid solutions. Acid washing could be enhanced for greater cleaning by using additives such as cerium or silver persulfate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Mechanical Cleaning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Methods for mechanical cleaning include abrasive blasting, wiping, scraping and brushing. Blasting would produce a fine powder containing plutonium which would be collected and stabilized in a manner similar to other solids, then stored in PFP vaults. Wiping or scraping would produce a similar powder, plus waste in the form of wiping materials (rags, paper, etc.) These methods require workers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be close to contaminated surfaces.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Preliminary Description of Stabilization Alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PFP contains a variety of reactive plutonium-bearing materials that need to be stabilized for long-term storage pending DOE decisions on ultimate storage or disposition. Stabilized material has minimal chemical reactivity and generally would be in solid form with a low water or organic content to minimize radiolysis. Most of the reactive materials are in process areas and equipment. (A portion of the materials stored in PFP vaults must also continue to be repackaged and stabilized as necessary for long-term storage). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of analysis, the reactive materials have been divided into groups. The materials in each group are expected to be amenable to the same stabilization process. The groups are as follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: The Gap slides 8% to Dollars 41.5m THE GAP, the fashion store group which until last summer was one of the brightest retail 'stars' in the US, yesterday reported an 8 per cent fall in first-quarter profits, to Dollars 41.5m after tax. The profits slip came on sales of Dollars 643.6m for the three months to May 1, up from Dollars 588.9m in the same three months of 1992. However, The Gap said that on a same-store basis, turnover showed a 1 per cent decline. The apparent increase was generated by the addition of new stores: at the end of the period, the company had 1,319 outlets, comprising 880 Gap, 166 Banana Republic and 273 GapKids, against 1,236 a year earlier. In spite of the slide in profits, Mr Donald Fisher, chairman, said the company was pleased with the progress 'in the light of continued weak consumer demand'. He added that the group had been operating with lower stock levels, and had succeeded in being less promotional. As a result, it had seen 'improved merchandise margins'. On Wall Street, Gap shares closed down Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 35 1/2 . The retailer's stock has suffered over the past year because of investors' worries about competitive pressures for core items, such as jeans and T-shirts, but has regained some ground over the past two months.</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Arts: A singular vision - William Packer finds himself looking over Goya's shoulder into his dark, ironical world at the Royal Academy Goya is generally acknowledged as one of the supreme masters in the post-Renaissance western tradition, and for once we should not be shy of an accolade all too often given. Rather more to the point, he has a real claim to being the first great modern painter, providing the link between that older tradition and the modern movement that we so glibly read as a break with the past. All art has its history and context. The Goya link is more of a complex double-knot than a simple tie. The threads within it are the humane profundity of Velasquez and the rococo virtuosity of the 18th century on the one hand, the romantic realism of Courbet and Delacroix and the proto-impressionism of Manet and Degas on the other. And all the while there is Goya himself, with his singular vision of the world, at once natural and fantastical, delighted and appalled, mordantly ironical. There has been no finer painter of the male portrait than he, not in its grander pretensions but on the intimate scale of conversational scrutiny, head and shoulders, one to one. Yet that same sensibility, capable of such profound psychological insight, spent half a career producing decorative schemes, both religious and secular, the rival of anything out of France or Venice. And all the while his eyes were open to the incidental and the everyday, to the common sports and festivals, picnics and bull-fights, and to the darker spectacles of the prison and the asylum. The step across into fantasy, albeit the ironical fantasy of the rational man, with its travesty of true religion in the black arts, was not so great. We find the whole artist in the intimate, reflecting glass of his smaller paintings, that are now brought together as never before. The small painting, whether preliminary sketch, or cabinet picture complete in itself, is not unique to Goya, but what is peculiar to him in his time is its sense of immediacy and privacy. We discover an artist working more and more for himself as he grows older. So lively and direct are these things in the making, it is as though the paint were still wet and we looking on at the artist's shoulder. Goya lived through difficult times, born in 1746 in the repressive Spain of the failing Bourbons, to whom he was appointed Court Painter in 1786, a post that somehow he still held at his death in exile in Bordeaux in 1828. The French Revolutionary wars and Napoleon's subsequent invasion of Spain, inspired his bleakest work and darkest inventions. Illness in the early 1790s left him stone deaf, which could only have increased his alienation, spiritual quite as much as physical, that is so clear in the work. None of the etchings of the 'Horrors of War', nor any of the 'Black Paintings' of this period, from the Prado, are in this exhibition. Even so, the contrast of mood could hardly be better pointed than by the presence of the early tapestry sketches, the 'Four Seasons' of the mid 1780s for example and, next door, the grim prison interiors, the Witches Sabbaths, the gypsies' caves, the cannibals, shipwrecks, and the robbed coach - owned incidentally by a bank - of the 1790s. But there are more subtle contrasts to draw, consistencies even. There was ever a darker, more violent side to Goya's imagination, as perhaps to the Spanish temperament itself, with his tavern brawls, the cat up a tree and the strange straw mannikin thrown in the air to set against the real horrors to come. In more poignant contrast, The Meadow of San Isidro of 1788 gives us the image of the perfect Spring afternoon, and the company en fete for the communal picnic, across the river from Madrid. The fair is down on the water-meadow, and on the grassy slope the girls sit beneath their parasols, and the men lounge and flirt and have another drink. Some 30 years on and it is a 'Bullfight in a Village' that is the festival - not that there is any inference to draw from that. But the company is clearly rougher, the evening drawing on, and the eye is held not so much by the protagonists, bull and picador, as by the squat triangular back-view of hat and greatcoat beneath and between them. It is the formal fulcrum of the picture, and self-portrait besides. Would only a deaf man, as Sacheverell Sitwell has suggested, give only his back to the world? The self-portraits, indeed, are the key to the show, from the opening image of the early 1770s, the young man fresh-faced and confident, to the odd self-mockery at nearly 50, caught contre-jour in brocaded jerkin and funny hat. But it is the tiniest of them, painted only a year or two later, that hangs in the memory. A shock of hair, black coat and high stock, together frame a face half in deep shadow. The brow, catching the light, is tense and furrowed, and out of the shadows those two dark eyes fix us for ever. Truth &amp; Fantasy: Goya - the Small Paintings; Royal Academy of Arts, Piccadilly W1, until June 12.

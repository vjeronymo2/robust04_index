			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Users 'want gas monopoly ended' THREE out of four consumers want to see an end to British Gas's monopoly of the domestic market, according to opinion research published today, David Lascelles writes. The report was commissioned by 12 gas companies trying to persuade the government to remove barriers to the gas market following the inquiry by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The government is now considering the recommendations that British Gas should be broken up and its monopoly ended. The opinion poll, carried out by ICM, showed that 83 per cent of consumers believe gas prices would fall as a result of the introduction of competition. Nearly eight out of 10 respondents saw competition as the most effective way to improve service standards. Nine out of 10 agreed that enabling the supply of cheaper gas was the most important priority for the gas industry, but felt that there should be a strong regulator. The Department of Trade and Industry is holding a public consultation on the commission's report until the end of this month.</p>

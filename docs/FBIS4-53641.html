			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- The South Korean  Democratic Party repeatedly urged a thorough probe into the  truth behind the May 18 Kwangju movement for democracy, a  Seoul-based radio report said.    At the time of the Kwangju popular uprising in May, 1980,  the  U.S. imperialists transferred more than 70,000 puppet Army  troops, some 150 tanks and armored vehicles and other equipment  under their command to the military fascists to suppress the  participants in the uprising. And the South Korean military  fascist clique massacred over 5,000 people and wounded some  14,000 others in ten odd days.    Addressing a memorial service on the 14th anniversary of the  May 18 Kwangju democratic resistance held in Kwangju on May 18,  the chairman of the Democratic Party urged the puppet government  to probe the truth behind the Kwangju resistance, punish chief  culprits in the massacre and pay adequate compensations for it.</p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Collection of factors combine to lift Dow Wall Street Reassuring news on inflation, a modest rebound in the dollar and news of another bid for the QVC television shopping group lifted US share prices across the board for much of yesterday, though prices eventually ended little changed on the day, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 1.62 up at 3704.28, having shown double-digit gains through the morning. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was also slightly firmer, up 0.78 at 448.73, while the American Stock Exchange composite was up 2.23 at 427.73 and the Nasdaq composite up 9.76 at 719.35. Trading volume stood at 265,000 shares. Share prices firmed from the opening, helped by news that the consumer price index had risen by only 0.3 per cent last month. Although the CPI number was not as positive as the report on the producer prices index, which was flat last month, it was in line with expectations, and reassured investors who had been worried that strong second quarter economic growth might have fed through into higher prices. Also, taken together, the June inflation data was unlikely to prompt the Federal Reserve into raising interest rates again. Consequently, stocks posted solid gains in early trading, rising by more than 20 points at one stage. Equities received no help from bonds, which ignored the good inflation news. By late in the day, the 30-year bond was barely changed, yielding 7.67 per cent. A modest rally in the dollar, which rebounded a yen to Y98.35 and more than a pfennig to DM1.5422, did help stock market sentiment, however. Later in the day, blue chip prices gave up most of their gains on a lack of follow-through buying. Nasdaq stocks outperformed other sectors of the market thanks to strong technology stocks, and news of a rival bid for QVC. Last week the home shopping television group announced that it was merging with CBS, the broadcast television network. Late on Tuesday night, however, Comcast, the big telecommunications group which owns 15.4 per cent of QVC, launched a counter bid worth Dollars 2.2bn. The rival offer immediately persuaded CBS to abandon its merger plans, which did not deter investors from buying QVC in the hope that the stock's price would be driven higher by new bids for the company. By the close, QVC was up Dollars 6 at Dollars 42 in volume of 7.3m shares. Comcast, which is also traded on the Nasdaq market, was down Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 15 1/8 in volume of 7.4m shares. On the New York SE, CBS shares were also higher, up Dollars 8 at Dollars 308, although the rise in the stock had less to do with the news of its failed merger with QVC and more to do with the company's plans, announced yesterday, to buy in 3.5m of its own shares and split the stock five-for-one. Hilton Hotels rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 62 7/8 after reporting second quarter profits of Dollars 33.9m, up 26 per cent from a year ago. Among higher Nasdaq technology stocks, Intel was up Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 61 3/4 , Cisco Systems Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 24, Lotus Development Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 40 1/2 , and Oracle Dollars  5/8 higher at Dollars 39 5/8 . Canada Toronto posted a small gain in dull dealings. The TSE-300 composite index gained 8.83 points, or 0.21 per cent, to 4,140.55, as advances were led declines by 371 to 336. Volume rose to 56.15m shares compared with 43.91m on Tuesday. Despite the overall market gain, just five of the 14 sub-indices ended higher, including industrial products with a 1.71 per cent index gain. Energy was up slightly, consumer products and mining were flat. Financial services was a bit lower and golds fell 0.85 per cent. Newbridge Networks continued its sharp climb, rising 2 3/8 to 59 7/8 . The company late Monday announced a buy-back of up to 4m shares, and was up 2 7/8 yesterday. Mexico Mexican stocks closed lower after an apathetic session, affected by an increase in domestic interest rates. The IPC index of 37 leading shares closed 23.31 points lower at 2,264.97, a drop of 1.02 per cent. 'The market is still dead as far as volume is concerned,' one analyst said. 'The increase in domestic interest rates may well be the most influential factor, since a rise was expected but nothing so big or so across the board,' a trader added.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Survey of Spain (7): Suit may no longer fit - A look at changing attitudes to the European Community MR Felipe Gonzalez continues to wear his European Union convictions as if they were a close-fitting, tailor-made suit. But the prime minister is not looking nearly so comfortable as he used to. Spaniards in general rushed to dress up in Community clothes and for a while they sported their new garments with pride and delight. The European look is, however, no longer the sole rage and there are some who are begining to question whether there is anything positive to be gained by affecting it. Euroscepticism is obviously not a peculiarly Spanish condition and so far it is probably less fashionable in Spain then elsewhere in the Community. But the consequences of any second thoughts that emerge in Spain are arguably more far-reaching because few EC partners have set such a great store on the construction of a united Europe as has Spain. The change in mood is not a surprise. Spain, in particular, was shocked when Denmark voted against the Maastricht treaty last year. The Danish referendum was hard for Spaniards to swallow because they were being called upon to make clear sacrifices in order to converge their domestic economy with rich northern Europe whereas Denmark's task in meeting the convergence criteria for economic and monetary union was perceived as an effortless task. By casting a shadow over Maastricht, the Danes moreover holed the Spanish bond and equity markets below the waterline. Foreign investors to a great extent withdrew their confidence in a domestic economy that had set itself a series of goals that others apparently no longer believed in. Mr Gonzalez was outraged at the Lisbon summit last summer when the cohesion funds he had championed at Maastricht were far from being the flavour of the meeting. From then on, he became increasingly suspicious of his richer partners as well as obsessive about the need for the subsequent Edinburgh summit to deliver a comprehensive package that would narrow the North-South gap. Last autumn's currency turmoil, which forced the peseta to realign twice within the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS and caused the Bank of Spain to spend nearly a third of its reserves in its defence, fuelled the growing sense among Spaniards that a set of dark, impersonal forces had rearranged the goalposts on the European Union playing field. Though Mr Gonzalez's obduracy finally obtained an agreement on cohesion funds at Edinburgh, he received mixed reviews at home. He was alternatively, and somewhat illogically, criticised by the opposition parties for either gaining too little or for wounding Spanish pride by banging a begging bowl on the Community table. In the meantime, the cost of EC membership to broad swathes of the population was begining to bite. In the late 1980s, as the economy boomed and employment grew, Europe was broadly understood to mean prosperity. Recession radically altered such a perception and protest marchers, ranging from steel workers to farmers, descended on Madrid with the common theme that the EC was destroying livelihoods. Euroscepticism has, however, made far greater inroads among business. Employers are clamouring against the high interest rates that are required to keep the peseta within the ERM and against the restrictive budgetary policies that are necessary to maintain Spain on course for economic and monetary union. The UK's decision to leave the contraints of the EMS, and the resulting incipient growth of the British economy, is regarded as exemplary by sectors of domestic business who argue that the peseta should be allowed to float. Mr Gonzalez, in contrast, is increasingly hostile towards the UK's 'cut and run' tactics, for he rightly sees them as undermining the credibility of his own decision to cling to the convergence criteria. The prime minister's acute problem is that the unswerving political thrust of his long years in office, as well as his entire economic strategy, has been underpinned by what he likes to call the 'construction of Europe'. The finishing line that he has mapped out for Spain now seems further away than ever and enthusiasm over the seemingly endless race is flagging. Enlarging the EC, which is perceived in northern Europe as demonstrating the Community's vitality, is in Spain viewed with a certain amount of distrust. Rather than infusing new energy into the EC, it is seen as possibly sapping its strength and, certainly, as dispersing further what little common purpose might remain among the Twelve. Seen from Madrid, an enlarged Community will place Spain on the periphery of the Brussels decision-making processes and widen the North-South divide. Issues that are vitally important to Spain, such as the North African immigration problem, risk receiving even less of a hearing in a Community that is tilted towards north and central Europe than they do at present. Mr Gonzalez himself is one of the main advocates of 'deepening' the Community, of bonding it together through mechanisms such as the cohesion funds and an increasing EC budget, before allowing in new members. He knows, however, that he has few allies among the Twelve's leadership and that he is unlikely to get a better deal on narrowing the Community's imbalances than the one he obtained at the Edinburgh summit. With elections due later this year and as the polls begin to show a neck-and-neck struggle developing between Mr Gonzalez's socialist party and the centre-right opposition, the prime minister's despondency is likely to grow apace with hostility over the EC. Mr Gonzalez's obstinate adherence to convergence as Spain enters recession may be his undoing.</p>

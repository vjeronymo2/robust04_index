			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / International Company News: Hafnia moves to bolster solvency of insurance arm HAFNIA, the Danish insurance and banking group, which sought protection from its creditors earlier this month, yesterday moved to strengthen the solvency of its insurance operations. The newly-created holding company, Hafnia Holding 1992, is to transfer DKr1bn (Dollars 177m) of assets to its operating subsidiaries. The move follows a fall in the value of the group's equity investments in the past 10 days and a particularly sharp drop in the value of sizeable investments in two other large Scandinavian insurers, Sweden's Skandia and Denmark's Baltica. Uncertainty in the region's insurance industry was underlined yesterday by news of an operating loss at Skandia. Skandia's reported a SKr344m (Dollars 64.6m) operating loss for the first half of 1992, compared with a SKr7m profit for the same period last year. Its share price dropped back by SKr3 to SKr72. Hafnia suspended payments to creditors last week and transferred DKr5.9bn of assets to a new company Hafnia Holding 1992. Yesterday, however, the company said group assets had been depleted by DKr900m. The group said yesterday its subsidiaries now exceeded minimum capital requirements by a broad margin. The original holding company owes DKr6bn to more than 100 creditors. Three Danish banks - Den Danske Bank (with DKr1.2bn), Sparekassen Bikuben (DKr600m) and Unidanmark (DKr450m) - are the group's largest creditors. Barclays Bank was yesterday reported to be on a list of creditors, which also includes SE Banken of Sweden, Commerzbank of Germany and ABN Amro of the Netherlands. Copenhagen County authorities are also owed DKr280m by Hafnia. Hafnia owns 14.8 per cent of Skandia's share capital and about 34 per cent of Baltica, Denmark's biggest insurer. Uni Storebrand, Norway's largest insurer, which owns 28 per cent of Skandia, has also been severely hit by the fall in the region's equity markets and was placed into public administration earlier this week. The two companies combined to launch an unsuccessful takeover bid late last year. Skandia blamed its half-year loss on a decline in the value of its real estate holdings. The company, however, made an operating profit of SKr195m in its insurance activities, a marked improvement on the SKr175m deficit it sustained in the first half of last year. Skandia's premium income went up by 15 per cent to SKr17.33bn from SKr15.09bn. Its net asset value per share totalled SKr174, a fall of SKr15 from the same period last year, while the solvency margin was 69 per cent, a decrease of 9 per cent since December 31 last year.</p>

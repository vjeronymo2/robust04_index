			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Brussels Cup a three-horse race: Lionel Barber gives a form guide to runners in the contest to succeed Jacques Delors Sir Leon Brittan turned up in Brussels on Tuesday night for the latest leg of his twin-track mission for 1994: to make the best-seller list and become the next president of the European Commission. After suffering in (near) silence during the UK government's hapless performance in the European Union voting rights row, the senior British commissioner addressed more than 150 people at WH Smith who had gathered for the continental launch of his book 'The Europe We Need'. Sir Leon's publicity campaign is impressive but misleading. The real struggle over the succession to Mr Jacques Delors is taking place in secret, among the EU's 12 heads of government. They will decide who gets the top executive job in Brussels, most likely when they meet at the European summit in Corfu in June. Mr Ruud Lubbers, the long-serving Dutch prime minister, remains favourite. Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, his Belgian opposite number, is a dark horse making late strides. Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister often rumoured as a candidate, was probably never in the starting-gate. The secretive nature of the selection process is typical of the way the EU runs much of its business. It is a mixture of patronage, horse-trading, and arm-twisting which offers the European citizen few clues as to the importance of the job. The Commission president is responsible for an annual budget of Ecu70bn (Pounds 53bn). He is in charge of more than 10,000 international civil servants in Brussels, regularly attends international summits, and is the public face of the Union. He also heads an institution with a monopoly on proposing Euro-legislation, something which no national or international service can rival. Increasingly, Brussels is acquiring new responsibilities in social policy, the environment, and research, as well as dispensing aid to eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. These myriad tasks require someone with high-class administrative and management skills together with a grasp of economics and a presence on the international stage. A Commission president lacking them risks seeing his role as umpire and power-broker in the Union diluted by the 12 (soon likely to be 16) heads of government. For most of the past year, Mr Lubbers seemed the natural choice for the job. He could draw on 12 years' experience as Dutch premier and his small-state credentials. This last asset is important because the presidency usually alternates between large and smaller states. A Lubbers victory seemed even more likely after last October's special summit in Brussels, where EU leaders agreed a wide-ranging deal on the location of a host of new institutions. It was assumed that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's success in winning the European Monetary Institute for Frankfurt - against the rival Amsterdam - had come at the price of a promise to back Mr Lubbers. When Mr Gonzalez revealed he was committed to Mr Lubbers two months ago, the contest appeared over. Then, the dynamics of the race changed. A report in the Guardian newspaper stated that Chancellor Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand had grown cool toward Mr Lubbers and had urged Mr Dehaene to make himself available. The next day, Mr Dehaene's office declined to confirm or deny that he was a candidate, heightening speculation. Rumours in Brussels and Bonn persist that Mr Kohl is not as keen on Mr Lubbers as was first thought. Memories linger of the Dutch presidency's shaky performance in the run-up to the Maastricht treaty, notably its ill-judged attempt to force the pace on federalism in the autumn of 1991. Another worry is that Mr Lubbers, a prime minister, may turn out to be too big for his boots. Mr Delors, after all, acquired head of state status during his 10 years in Brussels. Yet Mr Dehaene would undoubtedly be a bit of a gamble. His international exposure is minimal, though he chaired effectively two European summits last year. He has won plaudits as the head of a fragile coalition government struggling to contain linguistic and political rivalries between the French and Flemish population; but his favourite tactic of promising something for everybody and then doing the unexpected could backfire on the the European stage. Mr Dehaene's biggest disadvantage is that his departure from the domestic scene would risk destabilising the government. The same applies to Mr Gonzalez who is struggling to keep his Socialist party together. The Spaniard looks a more likely contender in 1999, when the EU budget must be renegotiated and Spain risks losing out to the east Europeans hammering to join. So the race appears to come down to Mr Lubbers, Sir Leon, and possibly Mr Dehaene. Sir Leon's biggest weakness is his passport. He must convince others that he is a European first and British a distant second. His test will come when Mr Lubbers reveals his intentions, probably after the Dutch general elections on May 2. A close associate of Mr Lubbers says he is staying silent because he does not want to risk charges that he is putting personal ambition ahead of his duties as premier. That associate adds: 'Lubbers wants the job. Kohl and Mitterrand may not go down on their knees to ask him to take it. They may be irritated that he has not declared his candidacy. But they are well aware that he is running.' To which one of Sir Leon's aides says: 'The more the merrier.'</p>

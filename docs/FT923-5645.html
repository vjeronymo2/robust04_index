			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Scots Civil Service jobs set for tender 8 per cent of the total - are to be put out to tender in the next year as part of the government's plans to improve efficiency in the Civil Service. The proposals were announced yesterday by Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary. Tendering is expected to be completed by September next year, with the new contracts operating in 1994. The plans indicate the breadth of activities which will be put out to tender as part of the government's drive to expose government service to competition from the private sector. In addition to catering and cleaning work, which are already contracted out, the list includes recruitment, training, audit and legal services, and the administration of pay, leave and pensions. Specialised functions to be put out to tender include telecommunications maintenance, the collection and processing of statistical data for the Scottish Office's environment department and its industry department's materials-testing station. Staff will be encouraged to bid for the contracts, with help from Capita Management Consultancy. If an in-house team is successful, it will be required to agree standards of service, how the work will be charged for, how the service will be monitored and how the agreement will be enforced. Where the contract goes to outside bidders or to a combined management and staff team, staff who decide to work for the contractor will have to resign from the Civil Service. Those who remain will either be redeployed or offered the normal redundancy terms. Early leaks suggesting that as many as 3,000 jobs would be put out to tender led to a one-day strike in July by members of two Civil Service unions representing Scottish Office staff. Mr Lang yesterday attempted to assuage staff fears that all activities would be contracted out. 'I can assure staff that they will have substantial help and support available to them, and they will be able to compete for the work with the private sector in fair and open competition.'</p>

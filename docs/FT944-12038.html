			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Arts: A monster with flashes of brilliance - Cinema MARY SHELLEY'S FRANKENSTEIN (15) Kenneth Branagh DARK SUMMER (12) Charles Teton LOVE IN THE STRANGEST WAY (15)Christopher Frank Almost every time a famous literary classic is re-filmed, the director makes a production number out of claiming that he has 'gone back to the original.' This prompts several questions in the sceptical mind. How many originals are there to keep going back to? Do we want a film to go back to its original? And how many people, as well as myself, look forward to the day when a director has the nerve and freshness to say, 'We didn't give a monkey's about the original. We threw the book away unread. We did our own thing.' Kenneth Branagh, the star and director of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, claims that he has gone back to the book. But almost everything good about this film lies in its abjuration of the literary; almost everything bad in its cumbrous invocation of it. Mary Shelley created a great central idea and a two great central figures: Victor Frankenstein the crazed New Age scientist, and the creature he cobbles together from other people's spare parts. But the story that the novel sets spinning around this Promethean sun is weak and diffuse. Too many satellite characters are brought in merely to be burned up. And the geography tacks recklessly, pointlessly across terrestrial space from Geneva to the Orkneys to the Arctic. The film's second half mimics these miscreant components. Branagh's Frankenstein, if he lived today, would qualify for frequent flyer points. Now he is in cholera-ridden Germany. Now he is hunting murdered relatives in Switzerland. Now, at a come-and-get-me cue from Robert De Niro's creature, he is hacking his way around the North Pole. To compensate for topographical jump-cuts, the screenwriters Steph Lady and Frank Darabont anchor the drama at other points with leaden, spell-it-for-morons dialogue. Hero's mother (Cherie Lunghi): 'You know, Victor, life shouldn't be all study.' Hero's girlfriend (Helena Bonham-Carter): 'Victor, you're completely obsessed.' Victor: 'There's something at work in my soul which I do not understand.' We know that, Victor. We have intuited it. We do not need it written up on the blackboard. Then suddenly Branagh will throw away the book, and the script, and the ghosts of the Lake Geneva gang of four whose story-writing symposium produced this fable, and run amok with the camera. The laboratory scenes are magnificent. We bob, weave and soar through airspace - courtesy of director and cinematographer (Roger Pratt) - while Branagh's bare-torso'd super-boffin charges around the Heath Robinson bric-a-brac. Steam swirls. Pipes hiss. And the overhead trolley-rail, carrying the huge copper immersion tank containing the first man-made man, clatters like a rollercoaster. Out of this tank emerges Robert De Niro, scarred and naked and tumbling onto the wet floor for a funny-horrific eel dance between Frankenstein and his grisly, slithery catch. This scene, as semi-nude creator struggles to set wholly-nude creature on his feet, has the tone the whole film might profitably have had. A horror-comedy version of Genesis: where God is played by man, temptation by a monstrous man-fish, and the Garden of Eden by an overgrown attic with its metallic jungle of gewgaws. But as soon as the creature escapes, so does the film's compacted passion. There is no terror in De Niro's lumbering scarface in a greatcoat: just a husky-familiar De Niro slur delivered with that cocked-head abstractedness we know from a dozen De Niro roles. Watching the film is an exercise in frustration. There are flashes of brilliance as bright as lightning bolts: like the two horrific long-roped hanging scenes, in which Branagh has dreamt up a bungee style of execution for early 19th century Europe; or like the camera's queasy glidings over the Frankensteins' giant staircase (imported from Kane's Xanadu?) as people stumble up or down it carrying fresh disasters. As an actor's director Branagh may be the best in the business. He wrings the last drop of idiomatic life from players like Ian Holm, as father Frankenstein, and John Cleese, improbably but effectively cast as a grim sawbones. And Branagh's own performance is pure, barnstorming splendour. But there is a point in this story when panache no longer has a premium. We want alarm, foreboding, cold panic, timor mortis. The movie's poster carries a warning: 'Certain scenes may prove disturbing for some viewers.' What scenes? Did I miss them? Were they taken out? If so: back to the laboratory, please, for the 'Director's Version.' For most of its span Charles Teton's Dark Summer seems so inert that we keep poking it with our perceptions, as if it were a hedgehog at the side of the road. Is it dead or just playing dead? A gently chugging reggae score accompanies images of a picturesquely distressed Liverpool  - soot-black sunsets, grey rivers, drydocked ships - while two scarce-constructed characters meet, love and drift apart. He is Abe (Steve Ako), a coffee-coloured mechanic and would-be boxer. She is Jes (Joeline Garner Joel), a white girl temping at her father's scrapmetal yard. They meet and link destinies. Then they go through pregnancy, miscarriage and break-up. It is hard to convey the extent to which nothing happens. For 84 out of 85, the filmgoer fidgets while first-time director Teton sets up his Merseyside tableaux vivants, like a neighbour readying hapless friends for his holiday slides. Only in one magically pained scene does the film gel. The two lovers are in bed, she turned away from him. He braves a single, cramped, anxiously reaching word, 'Jes'; she does not answer. The camera, on his face, watches that moment of numbed, irradiated awareness when an entire relationship crumbles. A film whose 'economy' elsewhere seems that of artistic poverty stumbles, for a small second, on the true economy of tragedy. France's Love In The Strangest Way tells of a married man (Thierry Lhermitte) who falls for a bit on the side (Nadia Fares). The bit in question, a mystery redhead met at a cafe, is soon harrying him and his wife (Maruschka Detmers) right up to the murderous climax. She has clearly seen, as has writer-director Christopher Frank, Fatal Attraction. Early scenes involving marital paranoia and an accident-prone rocking horse are promising. But then the plot becomes progressively Hollywoodised. Sinister phone calls; a death-dealing shovel; a 'body' behind a wall; and a twist ending that succeeds only in knotting beyond repair our already tangled braincells. But the French film beats the two short German 'comedies' opening together this week. Did the UK distributors win these in a raffle? In Making Up two love-seeking women friends have fun and heartache dating two tiresome men. And in The Most Beautiful Breasts In The World a pneumatic girl surreally swaps mammaries with a man after bumping into him in a lift. Laugh? At the press show you could hear a handout drop. In the same programme there is a ghastly New Zealand short about a girl dating an extraterrestrial. What did we do to deserve this triple bill? Did we all say 'trick' instead of 'treat' last Monday? Never mind. There is always the London Film Festival. Worth sampling during the coming week: one each from Taiwan, Cambodia and India (Eat Drink Man Woman, Rice People, Bandit Queen) and a clutch of celebrity interviews including Hal Hartley, Christopher Lee and those nice Creature Comforts folk from Aardman Animation.</p>

			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> LONG BEACH SYMPHONY DISPLAYS VIRTUES  </P> <P> If virtuosity -- like virtue -- is its own reward, the Long Beach Symphony  seems to be striking it rich this season.  </P> <P> At the orchestra's fifth concert of 1989-90, Saturday night in Terrace Theater  at the Long Beach Convention Center, music director JoAnn Falletta led a  satisfying and unhackneyed program that clearly displayed the achievement of  the ensemble.  </P> <P> That program consisted of Beethoven's Violin Concerto, played by concertmaster  Kathleen Lenski, Ellen Taaffe Zwilich's Concerto Grosso (1985) and Respighi's  "Feste Romane."  </P> <P> Genuine brilliance -- the kind of weighty, full-out orchestral performance that  cannot be faked or approximated, only achieved -- marked the climactic and  resourceful performance Falletta &amp; Co. brought to the Respighi pieces.  Finding all the contrasting quiet places and utilizing to best advantage the  gifted first-desk players of the ensemble had a lot to do with this success  too.  </P> <P> There was also great show in the orchestra's account of Zwilich's colorful,  five-movement essay -- written as an homage to Handel on his 300th anniversary,  but an unconscious tribute to Bartok and Britten, as well. The Concerto Grosso  is a work of many resonances, and it sweeps the listener along breathlessly.  This performance -- which outlined reconciliation as the true emotional and  musical subject of the piece -- seemed to touch all bases.  </P> <P> To begin any program with a masterpiece is no sin, of course. Still, starting  this one with the Violin Concerto of Beethoven seemed arbitrary.  </P> <P> Lenski's solo performance proved positively immaculate and mechanically  unassailable but not always stylish or noble: Both she and conductor Falletta  failed to achieve the rhythmic steadiness that gives the opening movement its  strength and character, for instance. And a certain standoffishness marked the  entire performance, which nonetheless moved from beginning to end with  authority.DANIEL CARIAGA  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 3 May (MENA)--Hasan 'Usfur, member of the  Palestinian delegation to the Palestinian-Israeli Security  Affairs Committee, has disclosed that the new obstacles that  Israel suddenly raised to the agreement on self-rule in Gaza and  Jericho result from its putting forth 25 new points on all  issues--security, civilian, and legal.    He told a MENA correspondent today that these points had  been  agreed upon earlier.    He said: This is a known Israeli tactic aimed at preventing  us from making any new proposals.</p>

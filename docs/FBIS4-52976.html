			<p>BFN     [Text] On the occasion of the 14th anniversary of the 18  May Kwangju resistance struggle, about 50,000 people, including  members of opposition circles and college students, held rallies  and demonstration struggle throughout South Korea.    According to broadcasts from Seoul, today, on the eve of the  14th anniversary of the 18 May Kwangju resistance struggle,  about 50,000 people, including members of opposition  organizations and college students throughout South Korea, held  rallies and staged demonstrations demanding to know the truth  about the Kwangju resistance struggle and the punishment of  responsible figures.    The National Alliance for Democracy and National  Reunification held a national meeting with participation of  2,000 of its members and students in Chongmyo Park in Seoul at  1600 today.    The participants in the meeting strongly demanded that the  truth about the Kwangju incident, which is still concealed  behind the curtain, be revealed and those responsible for  oppression be punished.    The students of 13 universities in Seoul, including Yonsei  University and Chungang University, rose in the struggle. About  700 students from the Korea Federation of University Student  Councils held a rally in Yonsei University, and dashed toward  Yonhui-tong, where the houses of traitors No Tae-u and Chon  Tu-hwan are located, and staged demonstrations.    About 600 college students from the Seoul Area Federation of  University Student Councils gathered at Yonsei University and  demanded to know the truth about the Kwangju democratization  movement and the punishment of those responsible for repression.  They then staged street demonstrations advancing toward the  homes of traitors Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, the ringleaders of  the Kwangju massacre.    On the other hand, the puppet authorities deployed about  12,000 police forces around their homes and placed them under  the posture for repression.    The number of students who rose in the struggle throughout  South Korea, including Seoul, reached more than 10,000 from 44  universities. They held events marking the Kwangju resistance  struggle in their universities respectively.    Meanwhile, on the eve of the 14th anniversary of the 18 May  Kwangju democratization resistance struggle, events paying  tribute to Kwangju martyrs were held in Kwangju. About 10,000  Kwangju citizens and students gathered at the plaza in front of  the building in South Cholla Province, and recalled days of the  resistance struggle by singing the "Song of May."    At 1500 that afternoon, 300 students from Chonnam University  and Choson University staged an on-street drama, reproducing the  repression by the martial law troops in May 1980 and the  resistance struggle of citizens. An international seminar on  the Kwangju mass democratization resistance struggle viewed  overseas was held at 1400 with the participation of figures from  four foreign countries, including Japan and Thailand.    A rally for the resolution of Pusan citizens to probe the  truth about the Kwangju resistance struggle was held at 1430  that afternoon with the participation of about 200 students and  citizens.    Since a broad range of students and people rose in the  struggle throughout South Korea, the Kim Yong-sam group  mobilized enormous police forces and placed them under the  posture of alertness, thus creating a terrorism-ridden  atmosphere.</p>

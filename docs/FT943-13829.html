			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Working Life: Every little beat of your heart - Health If employees are exposed to asbestos, noise pollution or bad office conditions at work, companies are expected to take responsibility for resulting health problems. But even if a company removes all risks from the workplace that is no guarantee it will suddenly have a healthy staff. As far back as 1990, National Power, of the UK, decided to launch 'Get Healthy Stay Fit', a voluntary health screening programme for its employees. It is one of several companies, including Marks and Spencer, Zeneca and Cable &amp; Wireless, that provide voluntary testing for health risks. Such programmes are designed not only to identify specific health problems ,but to alert employees to future risks as a result of practices such as smoking, drinking alcohol and eating certain kinds of foods. At National Power, the management and the occupational health department decided a screening programme could provide potential financial benefits to the group. They hoped to reduce the incidence of premature retirement or long-term absence from work, and boost company morale by projecting a 'caring company' philosophy. The programme is open to all employees, who are seen by occupational health nurses based at each company site. Before a screening appointment, an employee is sent an extensive lifestyle questionnaire. At the appointment, nurses review the questionnaire and offer advice on how an individual might improve his or her health habits. During the check-up the nurses analyse 14 biochemical indices pinpointing the likes of cholesterol and glucose levels and bone disorders. They also test the patient's vision, lungs , hearing and blood pressure. If the employee agrees, the results are sent to the patient's GP. Nurses are advised to send any employees who test positive for diabetes, high blood pressure or visual defects to their GPs for immediate consultation. But not every abnormality detected will be referred to the GP. 'We are trying to make a judgment as to whether someone is sick or not,' says Dr John McCaul, chief medical officer at National Power. 'We do not want to pass people willy-nilly on to the GP if they are healthy.' Each year McCaul compiles the results of all screenings completed within the company and distributes the statistics to executives and site managers. No employee can be identified in the statistics. But the effectiveness of a screening programme - the actual improvement in the health of the employees - is difficult to measure, because employees who volunteer for screening may be health conscious and considering lifestyle changes anyway, while those who stay away may have the most severe problems. 'If you are going to try to get people to improve their lifestyle, you are probably going to have do something more than just send out a general invitation for people to come in and find out about their health,' says Dr Anne Cockcroft, director of occupational health at the Royal Free Hospital. 'In order to provide screening programmes in the best possible way we need to think about how we target them.'</p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Grounded at GPA Yesterday's spectacular GPA flop should not necessarily add to the London market's current woes. It is naturally unsettling when a much-hyped Dollars 1bn share offer - recently increased to accommodate supposed extra international demand - is unexpectedly pulled at the eleventh hour. Yet there is good reason to believe that the ultimate lack of investor interest was due to specific handicaps of the company, rather than to deeper disenchantment with flotations at this stage in the cycle. Wellcome for one will certainly hope so. GPA always faced an uphill struggle given the dire state of the airline industry, intense price competition in the US and persistent rumours of more airline bankruptcies. The combination of its indebtedness and huge aircraft purchase commitments led many to suspect they were being asked to contribute to a rescue issue, while even sophisticated institutions had trouble grasping the intricacies of the airline leasing business. With GPA lacking a clear home market, there were no compelling reasons to subscribe, given the risks. One inevitable question for GPA's galaxy of advisers is whether it was a mistake to use the book building system much favoured in the US, rather than to have the issue properly underwritten (in which case at least the company would have got its money). The reality is that there was probably no alternative - all indications are that the institutions would have been reluctant to sub-underwrite, and that the costs of using other intermediaries would have been unacceptably high. The real culprit seems to have been the inflexible structure of the global offering. Far from inspiring creative tension between the three main markets, it allowed lack of interest in one to spread to the others. No single financial centre was able to anchor the issue. Egg has been liberally splattered across City faces: Nomura's international ambitions have been dented; Schroders can hardly be proud of belatedly wooing the retail investor; and Goldmans will have some explaining to do about the disastrous response in the US, where expectations look to have been far too high. For GPA, however, the problem is more than just a tarnished reputation. The company has not only been denied the proceeds of the float, but perhaps another Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn of bank borrowings to which it would have had access with an enlarged capital base. With net debt likely on current cash flow forecasts to exceed committed facilities by the end of the year, fervent efforts will presumably be made to securitise more of its assets. Ultimately, though, GPA may hope to find a partner with deep pockets, as ILFC did when it was taken over in 1990 by the American insurer AIG. The question is whether there are any takers these days.</p>

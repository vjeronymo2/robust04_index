It intends to revive communism according to Marx,  Engels, and Lenin but with the assistance of the king's "strong  hand."    Tonyo Zhelev, the party's leader, declared himself in  support  of restoring the monarchy in Bulgaria. According to him, the  key cabinet seats, such as the Ministries of Internal Affairs,  Defense, and Finance, could be entrusted to the sons of Simeon  Coburg-Gotha. The BRSP is trying to rally all unemployed and  desperate people in the country and to struggle against greed  for money and for equal rights and fraternity, he declared. The  leader of the new party, which has 57 members from Stara Zagora  and the neighboring villages, hopes that his party will be  legally registered by May 1994.</p>

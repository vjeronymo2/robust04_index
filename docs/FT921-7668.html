			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Arts: 4 Marys - Riverside Studios 'I had a really good time,' said a young man after this to his two female companions. They agreed; and so do I. But, as he said it, we had to laugh, because 4 Marys is obscure, complex, confusing and concerned with the none-too-jolly tale of Mary Queen of Scots. It is also stimulating, poetic, frequently witty and cumulatively poignant. Mary Q. of Ss, you may recall, had four Marys-in-waiting. The story of one of them, Mary Hamilton, became immortal in a trad. folk song (Joan Baez used to sing it) and I was expecting an interweaving of four such Lives of the Unknown. But Second Stride, with its fascination with doppelgangers, has focused only on the main biographical facts, with the four Marys as afterimages of their comrade and queen. Part One is in France (Mary's youth), Part Two is in Scotland and England (Mary's adult years). But no story is properly told; and in several scenes more than one Mary is queen at a time. The ambiguity of multiplication is part of Second Stride's house style. The movement, almost all the words and most of the costumes are deliberately 20th-century. (The five Marys queue to use a public telephone. The first one: 'Hello, is that Westminster? . . . Is Elizabeth there? . . . It's Mary.') 4 Marys has more speech and less dance than most of Second Stride's other mixed-media productions of recent years. It is called a play, and Martin Duncan and Ian Spink devised and directed it. But what wells up through this collage of often mundane and half-nonsense talk is a gathering of feelings beyond words, of states that words may relieve but do not express. The movement in the piece - mostly lyrical extensions of mime - heighten this impression. Part One creates a world of privilege, leisure, hedonism, high education and finishing-school etiquette. Beneath the amusing veneer is a sense of absence from family and home, of distance from serious responsibility or engagement in life, of mysteries not comprehended. Part Two reverses all that. Mary (times five) discovers home, mother, adult society, marriage, and motherhood, all like double-edged swords - and then imprisonment and a new kind of exile from everything she has discovered. But I neither can nor should make sense of half of what occurs in 4 Marys. For all the usual Second Stride cleverness in evidence here, this work eventually achieves a surprisingly precognitive account of women's experience. And it is funny. To take one small example, the Marys' shock in rediscovering Scotland - they are woken, in one marvellous moment, by bagpipes - is as drily satirised as Edith Sitwell's 'Scotch Rhapsody' or Nancy Mitford's Highland Fling.</p>

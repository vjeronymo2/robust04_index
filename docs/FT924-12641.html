			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Limited edition of the Mini THE ITALIAN JOB, is yet another limited edition of the Mini, to be launched at the Birmingham Motor Show today, John Griffiths writes. The car, named after a 1969 film in which three Minis featured in a gold bullion robbery, is an attempt by Rover to capitalise on the recent resurgence in popularity of the 33-year-old vehicle. Film critics of the time suggested that the Minis, which performed antics that included jumping between rooftops, upstaged Michael Caine and Noel Coward. The versions about to go on sale look like the Mini Coopers used in the film but have standard 1.3 litre engines. Production of the Pounds 5,995 cars will be limited to 1,000 for the UK and 750 for Italy. Meanwhile, the Cabrio, an upmarket convertible version of the Mini, will go on sale early next year at the same time as a convertible Metro.</p>

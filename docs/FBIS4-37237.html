			<p>BFN     [Text] Douglas Hogg, British minister of state at the  Foreign Office, has reiterated that Britain only recognizes one  Yemen, the united Yemen established on constitutional bases. He  noted that Britain has its own definite bases and rules to  recognize independent states, adding that what is taking place  in Yemen is not in harmony with these bases.    In a statement to the London-based AL-HAYAH published  yesterday, Hogg said that Britain welcomed the UN initiative and  supported the UN secretary general in his move to dispatch  Lakhdar Ibrahimi to Yemen to end the fighting and resolve the  crisis. He said: We are waiting, with concern, for his final  report on this mediation.    Asked whether the UN envoy would fail in his mission and  about his view regarding the imposition of international  sanctions or military intervention, Douglas Hogg said there will  be no Western or Arab military interference. He said: Nobody  wants to compete with another on sending troops to Yemen,  because such initiatives would be unwelcomed by this country.  He said: The issue of military intervention or economic  sanctions is out of question. He stressed that such methods  would not stop the Yemeni war that has been raging among the  sons of one homeland.    The British minister of state noted that the Arabs and the  United Nations can only find a tool or method to end the war  through dialogue and mediation to restore peace to Yemen.    Asked by AL-HAYAH about the size and kind of danger  resulting  from the events in Yemen, Hogg said there is no particular  danger posed to the Gulf states, Saudi Arabia, or Oman from the  war in Yemen, but it is difficult in this case to be fully  certain of this. He said: However, I reiterate that the Yemeni  war will remain confined within the Yemeni territory.</p>

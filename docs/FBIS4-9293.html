			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 22 Apr (Tanjug) -- We are broadcasting the  integral text of the agreement reached this evening in Belgrade  between the delegations of the republic of Srpska and the UN,  headed by Bosnian Serb president Radovan Karadzic and Yasushi  Akashi, special envoy to the UN secretary general. The text of  the agreement in English was forwarded to TANJUG from the office  of Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic:    "In the spirit of UN Security Council Resolution 913 of 21  April 1994, the UN secretary general's special envoy for the  former Yugoslavia and civilian and military authorities of the  Bosnian Serbs agreed on the following:    1. Immediate and total cease-fire in the territory of  Gorazde and around it.    2. As the first step, the urgent deployment of one UNPROFOR  [UN Protection Forces] battalion in a 3-km radius around the  center of Gorazde and on both banks of the river Drina; that  battalion will monitor and supervise from close quarters whether  both sides are observing the cease-fire and will report on it.  Heavy artillery will be immediately handed over to UNPROFOR or  will be withdrawn to a distance from which it will not threaten  the Gorazde safety zone, and in a way that will not interfere  with a procedure, which will be agreed upon later in line with  paragraph three of Resolution 913 [as received].    3. Guarantees for safe conditions for an urgent medical  evacuation from Gorazde.    4. Complete freedom of movement for all UNPROFOR personnel  and humanitarian organizations.    5. Urgent opening of talks to discuss -- with good  intentions -- all military issues to diffuse tensions, separate  forces, create safe and peaceful conditions, and meet the  humanitarian needs of the civilian population.    6. The intention is that the implementation of the above  measures should contribute to reinforcing efforts directed  towards reaching an overall political solution all sides would  approve."</p>

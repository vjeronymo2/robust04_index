			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Patten ditches June deadline for HK talks MR Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, is preparing to ditch his June deadline for the completion of Anglo-Chinese talks about the colony's political future after advice that more time will be needed to assess China's willingness to strike a deal. The Hong Kong government is expected to abandon formally its hope that an agreement be reached before the summer after the fifth round of talks which are due to be held in Beijing from June 14 to June 16. The earliest a full agreement could be achieved is September or October. Hong Kong government officials said that the fourth round of talks, which ended in the Chinese capital on the weekend, produced no initiatives from the Chinese side. However they said it was clear that Beijing had moved from talking about the principles on which the talks would be based to the substance of the electoral arrangements for Hong Kong's 1994 and 1995 elections. One described the talks as 'hard pounding', but the prevailing view of the negotiating team was that China intended to make a deal. Mr Patten's preparedness to let the talks run longer than first planned is bound to be met with accusations from liberal politicians that he is backing away from his plans for political reform. These seek to broaden participation in Hong Kong's politics and have been hotly contested by China. The governor also runs the risk that Beijing will interpret the abandonment of the deadline as a sign of weakness. China is likely to try to split his reform bill and attempt to deal with issues relating to the colony's 1994 polls before considering the 1995 polls. Hong Kong officials insist this will not be done and that Mr Patten is prepared to abandon negotiations if it becomes apparent China has no interest in reaching an agreement.</p>

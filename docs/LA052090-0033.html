			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEDICATION DIES AT THE BLACKBOARD;  </P> <P> SMALL VICTORIES THE REAL WORLD OF A TEACHER, HER STUDENTS &amp; THEIR HIGH  SCHOOL BY SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN (HARPER &amp; ROW: $22.95; 416 PP.; 0-06-016254-6)  </P> <P> Turn a few pages of this remarkably vivid portrait of a New York City high  school and you can almost smell the fluid of an overworked mimeograph machine,  hear the dissonance of Asian and Latin American accents and feel the latest  headache gathering force in the curly head of the book's heroine, English and  journalism teacher Jessica Siegel, an educator who cared so much for her  students that she finally had to choose between them and herself.  </P> <P> There may be a few books that better address the broader issues of American  education, but none I have read provide such a multilayered, personal,  galvanizing account of what it is like to teach in a seriously troubled school.  Samuel G. Freedman, a former New York Times reporter with a masterful command  of detail, obtained enviable access to Seward Park High during the 1987-88  academic year and uses it to take us into an emotional labyrinth.  </P> <P> It being torture enough to have to teach in the New York city schools and care  about the result, will anyone want to read about it? I think so. It is  difficult to resist the story of Siegel's struggles in her last year of trying  to keep an award-winning student newspaper alive, while making F. Scott  Fitzgerald enlightening to farm kids from the Dominican Republic and Guangdong  Province. The dramatic possibilities are not lost on Hollywood; 20th  Century-Fox optioned the book long before its publication.  </P> <P> Like many of the best educators in today's public schools, Siegel, a doctor's  daughter from New Milford, N.J., wandered into teaching after dabbling in  another career -- journalism. She had worked for the student newspaper at the  University of Chicago and tried the frenetic, poverty-stricken life of a  Liberation News Service reporter before taking her energy and social  consciousness to Seward Park in the Lower East Side. Freedman discovered her  after she wrote him a letter complimenting him on one of his stories. With the  assent of Seward Park principal Noel N. Kriftcher the teacher and the  journalist hatched a plot to expose the darkest corners of a high school  teacher's world.  </P> <P> Freedman calls Siegel a "fiercely private" person, but she seems to have opened  herself very wide here. She betrays both her frustrations with the social and  emotional problems of her students and the school bureaucracy, and some more  delicate personal matters, such as her carefully monitored affection for a  married colleague and her need to take an occasional sick day just to be able  to catch up with her paper work.  </P> <P> The demands of her raging ambition -- not shared by many other faculty members  -- to pull her students out of filthy streets and fractured families and into  colleges and careers take every minute of her day. She grows frantic at the  number of students who resist her efforts.  </P> <P> What does she do about Mary Tam, who received a perfect "100 on her  autobiography, 95 on her book report on 'Ethan Frome,' 90 on a test on Indian  and Puritan literature, 90 on a surprise quiz on Thoreau" and yet "missed every  other examination and all but three of 28 homework assignments"? The student's  autobiography, brilliant as it was, had "intimations of suicide." Would Siegel,  who had fashioned a classroom persona as a "tough cookie," be the one to push  one more child over the edge?  </P> <P> The staff of the Seward World, the newspaper that brought her and the school  some unusual recognition, has difficulty even finding a room for an occasional  meeting. Some of the paper's funds come out of Siegel's pocket. She has had to  finesse a growing set of insane district rules to ensure that it is printed  correctly and cheaply. In one painful episode, she begs for the $2,000 needed  to print the year's last issue.  </P> <P> In the end, Siegel decides to leave teaching and try journalism again. "I'm  really tired," she tells her closest friend on the faculty. "I work all the  time. I have no life . . . and I just can't take it any more."  </P> <P> Freedman seems intent on sticking close to Siegel, plus a few of her more  interesting colleagues and students whose stories he sometimes travels halfway  around the world to tell. He makes few attempts to link what he sees to any of  the several debates over theory and practice now raging in Washington and in  the universities, the teachers unions and the offices of governors and state  school superintendents. But even so unadorned, his vignettes suggest real  trouble for some of the most popular of the current educational fads.  </P> <P> Siegel has to violate New York's "equalization" policy to keep a bright  Hispanic youth, whose fragile self-esteem she has built to a critical point,  from being transferred out of her class. This well-meaning rule, a result of  the current emphasis on lowering class sizes, says she cannot have more than 34  students in any period. In practice, it threatens to ruin years of work making  certain children secure in an often hostile high school environment.  </P> <P> In perhaps the most depressing -- and yet fascinating -- episode in the book,  Siegel unsuccessfully begs for $3,000 for a copying machine so that teachers no  longer have to spend hours typing stencils. Other members of the English  department insist on spending the money on video-cassette recorders and  television sets. This is their decision under one of the "teacher-empowerment"  programs that have become so popular lately and have altered the management of  every public school in Los Angeles under a new union contract negotiated last  year.  </P> <P> "The question of why teachers of English would rely so heavily on a visual  medium was never broached," Freedman said of the television and VCR purchase:  "This faction's most persuasive argument was its leadership," most notably  "Judy Goldman, a reading teacher who served as the United Federation of  Teachers (UFT) chapter chairwoman at Seward Park, and as such wielded more  power in school than anyone except the principal."  </P> <P> As rich and compelling as Siegel's story is, it leaves a thirst for a longer  look at where public schools in New York are going and how well Seward Park's  care-ridden classrooms match the picture of educational crisis we hear about in  campaign speeches and on editorial pages. In his introduction, Freedman  describes the falling SAT scores, low teacher salaries and widespread  illiteracy that produced an avalanche of reform proposals in the early 1980s,  then notes that "none of these trends was new. Not even the perception of  crisis was new. In every generation or so, it seemed, America had indulged  itself in a spasm of conscience about the state of the public schools."  </P> <P> Perhaps a writer this talented, no matter how weary from a nerve-rasping year  at Seward Park, has enough energy for another book that will tell us more about  what we can change in our approach to learning. Can we keep the Jessica Siegels  in the schools, or must this generation, like all the previous ones, resign  itself to muddling through, ignoring the prophets of doom and the latest  presidential commission?  </P></p>

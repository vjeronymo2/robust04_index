			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Opec nears agreement to cut oil output LEADING members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries appear broadly to agree on the need to cut output by up to 1m barrels a day to counter the fall in crude prices. Signs of an emerging Opec consensus were cautiously heralded by Mr Alirio Parra, the cartel's Venezuelan president. He arrived in Kuwait yesterday as part of a tour of leading Opec producers, prompted in part by concern over the weaker trend in oil prices. Mr Parra said that following talks with the Saudi Arabian and Iranian oil ministers there was a 'consensus on the type of measures' the cartel should take at its next meeting on February 13. Then, Opec ministers are due to set an output ceiling for the second quarter. His remarks follow a proposal this weekend from Mr Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister. He said Opec members should make pro rata cuts to bring output down by 1m barrels a day from a first quarter ceiling of 24.85m b/d agreed at Opec's last meeting in November. The target figure excludes output from Ecuador, which has since left the cartel. Mr Nazer's proposal followed talks in Paris this weekend with Mr Parra, who in turn held discussions in Tehran earlier yesterday with Mr Gholamreza Aghazadeh, the Iranian oil minister. Mr Parra described both sets of talks as 'positive', adding: 'We have a broad consensus, the Saudis and the Iranians, as I only talked to the two major producers so far.' Any effective Opec deal to cut output substantially would hinge on a deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran, Opec's two biggest producers. Saudi Arabia, which says it is pumping 8.4m b/d, has tenaciously guarded its expanded post-Gulf war oil output. Iran, which was allocated a ceiling of 3.49m b/d in the November agreement, has long been among the most vociferous Opec advocates of output cuts to push prices closer to Opec's nominal target price of Dollars 21 a barrel. However, both countries appear to be responding to broader Opec concern over prices which, for the basket of Opec crudes, have lately fallen to about Dollars 16 a barrel, down from an average of more than Dollars 18 a barrel in 1992. A Gulf Arab official familiar with Saudi oil policy said yesterday: 'There is a general feeling that the fundamentals are not very good for output right now. There is general agreement among members to cut production by around 1m barrels a day.' Opec's cause has not been helped by 'leakage' of extra production among several members which, according to industry estimates, has put actual Opec output somewhat above 25m barrels for the first quarter. Iran's president Mr Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who also met Mr Parra yesterday, was quoted by Tehran Radio as saying too many Opec members had been exceeding their November allocations: 'If oil producers reduced their production by 10 per cent, they would have 20 per cent surplus income,' he said. Agreement among Opec mem-bers to cut output could place particular pressure on Kuwait, where Mr Parra held talks yesterday with Mr Ali al-Baghli, the Gulf state's oil minister. Since the Gulf war, Kuwait has considered itself immune from any restrictions on output while it recovers its prewar output level, makes up for lost revenues and pays for its reconstruction. However, a senior Gulf Arab official said Kuwait was likely to be urged to freeze output for the second quarter at present levels - which Mr al-Baghli yesterday put at 1.778m b/d - as part of a bid to support prices. Mr Parra will also visit Qatar, Algeria, the United Arab Emirates and Oman, which though not an Opec member has often acted in tandem to support prices.</p>

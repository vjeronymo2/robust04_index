			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by M Schnehage and K Swart] </F>   [Text] Reiger Park April 10 SAPA -- African National  Congress President Nelson Mandela addressed a memorial service  for slain SA [South African] Communist Party General Secretary  Chris Hani at the St Anthony's Catholic Church at Reiger Park on  the East Rand on Sunday [10 April]. He said the service in the  Catholic Church for the slain communist leader showed the  importance of the Church in the struggle for change in South  Africa. He said Mr Hani had been one of South Africa's most  important revolutionaries.    Outside the church, Mr Mandela addressed about 300 people.  "We want a better life for all our people without exception.  We are the only organisation in this country which has been in  the forefront of building a national unity. And this audience  indicates our success. We have all communities represented here.  I hope to come here and thank you after April 27 (election  date)," he said.    ANC supporters formed a guard of honour outside the church  where they hoped to catch a glimpse of Mr Mandela as he left the  church grounds. The group of about 400 men were armed with  traditional weapons and stood silently with their fists raised  in a black power salute on either side of the road. The armed  men were dressed with sheets and blankets under which many of  them hid their weapons. They were reportedly from surrounding  squatter settlements on the East Rand.    Peace monitors and ANC marshals formed a human chain between  the men and the middle of the road through which the Mandela  convoy was expected to travel.</p>

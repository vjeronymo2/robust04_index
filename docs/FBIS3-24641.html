			<p>While     predictably welcoming President Bill Clinton's 3 February  decision to lift the U.S. trade embargo against Vietnam, Hanoi  has also sought to reassure U.S. critics of the decision by  issuing a highly authoritative Foreign Ministry statement  reaffirming Vietnam's continued willingness to cooperate in  resolving the question of Americans missing in action (MIA) from  the Indochina war.  The 4 February statement, while claiming that  the decision had "opened a new page" in U.S.-Vietnamese  relations, made it clear that Hanoi will continue to "cooperate  fully" with Washington in resolving "pending" bilateral issues  (Hanoi radio, 4 February).  The authoritative statement then went  on to underscore Hanoi's longstanding position that the MIA issue  is a "humanitarian concern not linked with political issues" and  reaffirmed the willingness of the "Vietnamese Government and  people" to continue to "cooperate in a constructive spirit" with  the U.S. Government and American people in resolving the MIA  question to the "fullest extent possible."     Hanoi's decision to use a highly authoritative Foreign Ministry  statement to deliver its message on the MIA question is  particularly notable, since such authoritative statements are  rare.  For example, last year Hanoi issued only two such  statements--one in March to protest the killing of Vietnamese  residing in Cambodia (Hanoi radio, 12 March 1993) and the other  in June to comment on the Cambodian elections (Hanoi radio, 3  June 1993).  Hanoi last employed a Foreign Ministry statement to  comment on the United States in May 1992 when it issued one to  protest an agreement between Chinese and American oil companies  to exploit oil and gas resources on Vietnam's continental shelf  (Hanoi radio, 17 May 1992).

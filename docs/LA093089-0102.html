			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TREASURER, AIDES FAULTED FOR ABSENCES DURING AUDITS  </P> <P> City Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg and some of his top investment officers were  absent so often in the weeks surrounding a series of critical audits that they  "reduced the effectiveness of operations" in a city department that manages  $2.1 billion in city funds, according to the city administrative officer.  </P> <P> The absences continue as the treasurer's office struggles to comply with a  sweeping subpoena request for thousands of documents requested by a federal  grand jury investigating Mayor Tom Bradley.  </P> <P> As senior treasurer's office staff members feverishly arranged Friday for the  first batch of documents to be delivered to federal investigators, Rittenberg  left for Key West, Fla., to attend the weeklong convention of the National  Assn. of Government Deferred Compensation Administrators, the mayor's office  said.  </P> <P> He was absent on eight of 28 working days between Aug. 10 and Sept. 19,  according to City Administrative Officer Keith Comrie's report Thursday to the  City Council. Rittenberg could not be reached Friday for comment. He earlier  said that he had the flu.  </P> <P> One of his investment officers, George Sehlmeyer, was absent 16 days during the  same period and has yet to return to work. His attorney said Sehlmeyer has had  the flu and dental surgery.  </P> <P> "There is no question the treasurer's office is a mess," said Councilman Zev  Yaroslavsky who requested the report. "There is a problem in the treasurer's  office and it has not been resolved since all of this unravelled on them in the  spring."  </P> <P> The most recent of three city audits, by the city controller's office on Sept.  18, found "major weaknesses " in the treasurer's office, including violation of  competitive bid policies and sloppy record keeping.  </P> <P> Rittenberg and Sehlmeyer were key figures in city investigations of Bradley's  relationship with Far East National Bank, which had paid the mayor $18,000 as  an adviser in 1988. The mayor later returned the money.  </P> <P> In March, after the mayor talked to Rittenberg, the city reinstated a  $1-million deposit with the bank and added another $1 million. Sehlmeyer later  told a City Council hearing that he had noted on the Far East bid sheet that  the deposit was being made "per the mayor." Someone in the treasurer's office  obliterated the reference with correction fluid.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Deputy Put in Charge  </P> <P> Chief Deputy Treasurer Gerald Capodieci, who has been put in charge in  Rittenberg's absence, hunched over a personal computer terminal on Friday and  said he was too busy to discuss the operations of the treasurer's office. "I  don't usually type," said Capodieci. "That tells you something."  </P> <P> On Thursday, it was disclosed that the treasurer's office has been hit with a  subpoena from the U.S. attorney that requests "all notes, drafts, calendars,  diaries, logs, account statements and other written material, photos, graphs,  computer disks, tapes and other recordings," relating to eight banks and  brokerage firms that figure prominently in an expanding investigation of  Bradley.  </P> <P> "It's a lot of work, a major project," said Rona Berns, administrative  assistant to the treasurer, who was arranging stacks of computer printouts.  "We've got to get some of this out today," if the office is to comply with the  Oct. 10 subpoena deadline, she said.  </P> <P> Cash Management Officer Henry Davis, who heads the team that invests the $2.1  billion of city funds, was clearly exasperated as he leafed through paper work  on his desk. "I just can't talk now," Davis said in apology. "We've got to get  these things out."  </P> <P> Adding to the office's problems, cash flow analyst William T. Hoss resigned in  August. His replacement, according to Comrie's report, "is on a steep learning  curve" and has been absent five days.  </P> <P> Since March, when the city first launched an investigation of Bradley's  finances and conduct in office, the treasurer's office and its senior officers  have been under a nearly daily barrage of requests from local, state and  federal investigatory agencies for documents, interviews and appearances at  public hearings.  </P> <P> Efforts to comply with the U.S. attorney's subpoena, the broadest of the  requests, "will severely impact daily operations," according to Comrie. His  report quoted Deputy Treasurer Capodieci as saying that 60% of the work of  collecting the required documents must be done by the small, three-man  investment staff.  </P> <P> City investments appear to be safe, Comrie said, as only a small number of  financial transactions are required each month. A large proportion of the $2.1  billion the office oversees is placed in medium- to long-term securities, which  do not require constant reinvestment decisions, he said.  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky said Friday that the office has managed to keep a good return on  investment but said he is concerned that poor management and morale could  affect "our bottom line."  </P></p>

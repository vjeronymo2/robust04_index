			<p>BFN     [Text] The head of the office of southern border  administration, Wisut Singkachonworakun, said yesterday there is  no new armed group operating in the southern provinces.    Mr Wisut's comment was made after a news report from  Malaysia  that a powerful Malaysian Islamic missionary group, the Al-Arqam  movement, was operating in Thailand, and that the group has  maintained 313 armed men in Thailand including Bangkok.    "We checked with all our intelligence units, especially in  the five southern border provinces of Thailand, and there is no  report about the Al-Arqam movement existing." said Mr Wisut.    He said he has submitted an official report to the Interior  Ministry on the issue.    "The report is inaccurate. We have thoroughly investigated  and tried to find out about the movement of this group. But no  report about it exists," he said.    According to Mr Wisut, the main problem in southern Thailand  now is the economy, especially in the growth triangle area.    "We should push the economy to grow in this triangle," he  said.    However, he admitted that in the past there was a lack of  qualified public relations facilities to inform the public of  events.    One of the main obstacles, he said, is a lack of cooperation  between the government officials concerned.    The centre has tried to improve things by bringing district  officers and police chiefs from all areas to discuss the  problem, he said.    Future policy on the five southern provinces will include  developing intelligence reports, tackling poverty, providing  security and dealing with border conflicts between Thailand and  Malaysia, he said.    Meanwhile, Malaysia's ambassador to Thailand will be  summoned  to clarify a claim that Bangkok was used as a base for training  an armed Muslim suicide squad, Deputy Foreign Minister Surin  Phitsuwan said yesterday.    Thailand would take the opportunity to make clear its stance  on the issue, Mr Surin added.    Thai Ambassador to Malaysia Suraphong Posayanon last week  put  on record in Malaysia that there was no evidence to back a claim  by the Islamic Centre in Kuala Lumpur that Al-Arqam was training  a suicide squad in Bangkok.    The envoy also confirmed Thailand's readiness to cooperate  in  solving the issue.    Al-Arqam is an Islamic group headquartered in Malaysia, with  branches in 15 other countries including Thailand.    The group promotes religious as well as business activities,  including the purchase of agricultural products for farmers.    A Thai government source said it made no sense for Bangkok  to  be the training ground for a suicide squad.    The claim emerged after Thailand caught Iranians, suspected  of involvement in an attempt to bomb the Israeli embassy in  Bangkok, re-entering the country from Malaysia about three weeks  ago, the source said.</p>

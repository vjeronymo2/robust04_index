			<p>BFN     [Text] Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] has assumed  responsibility for the 'Afula attack, claiming that its men  perpetrated the attack. In a leaflet distributed in Janin,  Hamas said that the name of the suicide terrorist is Ra'id  Zakarnah, 19, of Qabatiyah.    Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that a short while ago,  the security forces arrived in Qabatiyah, and took Zakarnah's  father to the Ha'emeq Hospital to identify the body.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yokosuka, Kanagawa Pref., April 11 KYODO -- The  reactors of two U.S. nuclear-powered attack submarines may have  had repair work done in Japan in January in spite of a bilateral  agreement ruling out such activities, an anti-U.S. base citizens  group said Monday [11 April].    The Holland, a 10,500-ton U.S. tender for nuclear-powered  submarines, called at the U.S. Yokosuka Naval Base in Yokosuka,  Kanagawa Prefecture, for about a month from January 11,  according to the citizens group, the National Environmental  Policy Act (NEPA) coalition of Japan.    During the period, two U.S. nuclear-powered attack  submarines  -- the Tunny and the New York City -- also stopped at the base,  group members said.    The group said base employees witnessed in mid-January  several repair engineers from the Holland enter into reactor and  weapons zones within the submarines. The zones are off-limits  to Japanese.    The group members said the tender and the submarines stopped  at the base at the same time apparently because the war ships'  reactors needed repairs. The Holland was designed to provide  repair and supply services for submarines.    A memorandum between Japan and the U.S. stipulates that  power  equipment of U.S. submarines will not be repaired in Japan.    A U.S. Navy commander in Japan said that the Holland  conducted "a routine port visit in conjunction with her current  deployment to the western Pacific."    Yokosuka city officials said that based on the Japan-U.S.  memorandum it does not believe nuclear-related repair work was  done.    Shoji Shimizu, leader of the NEPA coalition, said the port  call by the Holland may indicate future plans to have U.S.  submarines repaired in Yokosuka.</p>

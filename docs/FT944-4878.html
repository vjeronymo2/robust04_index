			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Japanese Industry (4): Yen's rise curbs consumer appetites - The motor industry For the first time in its history, Keidanren, Japan's most influential business organisation, welcomed a member of the motor industry as chairman earlier this year. The appointment of Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota, to the head of Keidanren was widely seen at the time as a signal of recognition that Japan's vehicle industry was at last worthy of representing the Japanese business establishment. Ironically, that recognition has come just as the Japanese vehicle industry has faced one of the most trying periods in its history. It is not just that a four-year economic slump has brought about a 17 per cent fall in new vehicle sales in Japan from 7.8m units in 1990 to 6.5m units last year. More fundamentally, the Japanese market is not expected to provide its vehicle makers with the kind of growth they had become used to since the late 1980s. While demand has recovered in the past several months and is likely to continue to improve, the domestic market, which grew 5 per cent in 1987 and by an average 9 per cent in the following three years, is only expected to show growth of 1 to 2 per cent for the foreseeable future, notes Mr Yutaka Kume, chairman of Nissan. Japan's falling population growth, inadequate infrastructure and the growing cost-consciousness of consumers make it unlikely that the home market will expand significantly in future, he says. Overseas, the yen's sharp rise against leading currencies, and the improved competitiveness of US vehicle makers, has curbed consumer appetite for Japanese cars in both the US and Europe. In the US, Japanese vehicle manufacturers have seen their share of the market slump as Japanese cars have become more expensive due to the appreciation of the yen and as US consumers have embraced the improved quality of cars made by domestic manufacturers. At the same time, the yen's appreciation has slashed the value of their profits made overseas. Honda, which reported a rise in first-half pre-tax profits for the first time in four years, said that the yen's rise had shaved Y39bn off operating profits. The high value of the yen has also helped the manufacturers' foreign competitors make inroads in the domestic market by cutting their prices to bring them within reach of a wider customer base. The share of imported cars in Japan's vehicle market has grown each month for the past year and rose to more than 10 per cent for the first time in August, although the figures include Japanese reverse imports. Japanese vehicle manufacturers have responded to these multiple pressures by cutting costs across the board. Companies have increased the commonality of parts between different models and, in many cases, reduced the range of models they turn out. Mazda and Nissan, for example, two of the worst performers in recent years which both reported losses in the first half of 1994, are supplying each other with pick-ups and vans. Personnel costs are being cut by trimming or even freezing recruitment while sub-contractors are being squeezed on parts prices. Such belt-tightening has started to show in the vehicle makers' financial performances. Honda more than doubled pre-tax profits in the first half, helped in part by savings of Y36.5bn through cost-cutting. But these measures are insufficient to counter fully the falling profitability of their overseas operations and the loss in their international cost-competitiveness. Japan has become one of the most expensive manufacturing bases in the world. Meanwhile, with the domestic market unlikely to provide substantial growth in the years ahead, Japanese vehicle makers are becoming more dependent on overseas markets for growth. The majority of Japanese vehicle manufacturers sell more cars overseas than they do at home. The ratio of overseas sales is as high as 70 per cent for Honda and 66 per cent for Mazda. Calls by foreign governments to increase local production and local procurement of vehicle parts, is also putting pressure on Japanese vehicle makers to reduce their dependence on exports from Japan. Against this background, Japanese companies believe they have little choice but to accelerate the shift of production outside of Japan both to counter the effects of the high yen and to be closer to overseas markets which are becoming increasingly important for their survival. Toyota, for example, plans to raise production in North America by 50 per cent by 1996. It announced recently that it will stop exporting its mainline Corolla sedans to North America and rely on its Canadian plant to manufacture the cars instead. Moving production outside of Japan is a difficult step for any Japanese company: it exposes them to public criticism that they are taking jobs away from domestic workers and contributing to the hollowing out of the nation's industrial base. For the vehicle manufacturers, the decision to shift production overseas is made even more difficult at this time, because most of them made substantial capital investments in the late 1980s. The increased shift of production overseas will mean a further drop in domestic production which has already fallen 18 per cent to 11.2m units since peaking at 13.5m units in 1990. Domestic production is now almost down to the same level as it was 10 years ago, Mr Kume points out. This year, helped by an income tax cut and a moderate recovery in the Japanese economy, vehicle sales have started to pick up. The likelihood is that demand will continue to firm next year as well. But the recovery at home is not expected to fundamentally change the need for restructuring in the domestic industry. 'The problem that the Japanese auto industry has is coming to terms with the fact that they won't be needing so much capacity here,' says Mr Andrew Blair-Smith, industry analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities. Executives of Japan's leading vehicle companies recognise the problem but are hoping that they will be able to deal with overcapacity without massive lay-offs by spreading the pain over several years. Meanwhile, the march into markets overseas will continue as Japanese companies seek opportunities for growth which they no longer expect to find at home.</p>

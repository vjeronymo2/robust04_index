			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Farewell to Arms" column by Carlos Tapia: "Peace </F> Accord: And the Government's Voice?"]    [Text] It would seem President Fujimori likes to announce  important aspects of the government's counter-subversive  strategy when he goes abroad. We have learned from the answers  he gave Chilean journalists that the terrorists sentenced to  life imprisonment will, under no circumstances, be released and  that within the framework of the Peace Accord there will be no  negotiated future integration of any subversive organization  into the legal political spectrum.    Unless our memory fails us, during a news conference he gave  during recent trip to Colombia, Fujimori again denied that any  advantage will be granted to the Shining Path members currently  in prison and who wanted to hold their Second Congress.    This column has evaluated the Shining Path's internal  letters  and documents, circulated with the approval of the SIN [National  Intelligence Service]. Because these documents acknowledge the  achievement of progress within the Peace Accord, a reflection on  the president's remarks is required.    His remarks would seem at first glance to be an open and  public denial of the progress that has been achieved and the  provisos that have been reached between the president's emissary  (Agent 002) and the Shining Path leadership in that "...  prisoners of war and political prisoners will be released one at  a time whether or not they have been sentenced." This is  indicated in one of the clauses of the Accord that is being  discussed inside the prisons. The possibility of holding the  Second Congress has also been discarded. The document containing  the summons for this congress was published in full some weeks  ago by LA REPUBLICA.    If this assumption is true, then the Feliciano Group  argument, which consider the Peace Accord negotiations to be  government "rubbish," are fully strengthened. Thus, the  president's remarks scrap the SIN's "psycho-social" maneuver --  or at least end it -- and therefore the planned objective has  been achieved, in other words, the uncovering of the split that  occurred within Shining Path.    Another hypothesis could be applied: That the  "psycho-social"  objective of the president's remarks is to confuse and thereby  hide the real intentions and exact content of the negotiations  with the imprisoned terrorists. This would not be the first time  one thing has been said and the contrary implemented.    In view of the importance, responsibility, and cost to be  endured, we believe the topic of peace in the country should be  discussed within the sphere of a great national consensus that  can overcome daily disagreements between the opposition and the  official sector. One condition alone is needed for this: Crystal  clarity over what is said and what is done. This is a simple  duty that should be taken up by all Peruvians who want a true  peace, in other words, eternal peace.</p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BUTCHER: SIMPLE WAYS TO SAVE AT THE MARKET  </P> <P> In my opinion, we can eat a lot better for a lot less if we follow a few simple  common-sense procedures when shopping in the American supermarket. The average  supermarket today has hundreds of thousands of different items lining its  shelves to tempt us into parting with as much of our cash as possible. Most of  those items we don't need. The trick is to shop for and buy what we really want  and need, and not to be tempted by the things we can do without.  </P> <P> The place to begin shopping is at home around the kitchen table on the day the  Food Section comes out in this paper. The advertised specials offer good  opportunity for savings -- particularly on meat. Items like whole body  chickens, turkeys and often various cuts of beef, pork and lamb are often used  as loss-leaders. That means they offer these items for less than they paid for  them in order to get you into the store, where you can be tempted by all those  thousands of other items that are not "on special."  </P> <P> Plan weekly menus around some of the advertised specials and make a list . . .  but don't carve it in stone and carry it to the market like Moses coming down  from the mountain. Be a little flexible. Not all money-saving specials are  advertised. That is particularly true in the meat department where the  department manager often lowers the price of a particular cut in order to move  it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shop at Same Market  </P> <P> Unless there is some red-hot special that makes it worth a special trip, you  are best off doing most of your shopping at the same market every week. Pick a  convenient one where the clerks are reasonably friendly and helpful and get to  know it. Learn where things are and who to go to for help if you need any. The  more familiar you are with the layout, the less time you'll need to spend there  and, believe it, time is money -- the more time you spend shopping, the more  money you'll spend.  </P> <P> Try to do the major portion of shopping on one day. More people spend more  money on groceries -- meat in particular -- because they shop for only one meal  at a time. When you go shopping with "What am I going to have for dinner  tonight?" in mind, you are almost certainly looking for something quick. You  know as well as I do that one of the most expensive and often overpriced  supermarket commodities is called convenience. A frozen entree can cost 10  times what the same dish would cost if you planned ahead and made it from  scratch.  </P> <P> A steak or a pork chop may cook quickly, but you'll pay far less per pound for  either if you plan ahead, buy a family pack or a roast and cut your own and  freeze some for later use.  </P> <P> In my opnion, thinking big can save you a fortune, not only on meat but  throughout the store. When chickens are on special, buy several, cut them up  and package the component parts in serving size portions for the freezer. Buy a  couple of first-cut blade chucks when they're on sale. Even if you don't have  the time or inclination for a pot roast, there are all kinds of different meals  to be made from a chuck roast if you'll do a little cutting up in the kitchen.  You can make steaks, stew, stir-fry meat or ground chuck for all kinds of  recipes from a couple of inexpensive chuck roasts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> If the Price Is Right  </P> <P> A leg of lamb on special may be far more than you need for one meal, but if the  price is right, don't pass it by -- buy it. Ring the bell and ask the butcher  to bone it for you, then separate the individual muscles to make smaller  roasts, chops, cutlets or stew meat, all of which will likely cost less than  similar cuts in the same meat case.  </P> <P> The meat counter is not the only place in the store where it pays to think big.  Things like rice, barley, macaroni and spaghetti keep almost forever and they  are always less expensive per pound if you buy the larger package. You can  sometimes get staples at half price if you buy big. The people who pay most for  what they buy are those who shop one meal at a time for only one or two people.  Even if you are cooking for only one or two, you can save money if you plan  ahead and buy for the freezer rather than waiting till the last minute and  buying something "quick" from the frozen food case at the supermarket.  </P> <P> Finally, check out the "outer limits." The outside perimeter of most  supermarkets is where you will find most of the unprocessed foods from the four  basic food groups -- dairy, meat and other protein, breads, and fruits and  vegetables. Try shopping the outer limits and spending as little time as  possible in the "inner zone." In my opinion, not only will you save money but  you will feed your family more wholesome, nutritious meals. The "inner zone" is  where you will find all those high-fat, high-sugar fun foods that your body as  well as your budget can well do without.  </P></p>

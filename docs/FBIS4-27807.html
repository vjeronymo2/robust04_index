			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- A senior Japanese trade  ministry official said Thursday [2 June] the ministry has fully  explained a personnel controversy that took place last year.    "So I have no additional comments," said Hideaki Kumano,  vice  international trade and industry minister, referring to what  ended in the voluntary resignation of a ministry bureau chief.    Speaking to reporters, Kumano said, "I want to refrain from  specific comments on the matter because the issue is very  delicate."    The remark came after parliamentary business stalled earlier  in the day due to renewed bickering over last December's  controversy at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  (MITI).    In mid-December, Hiroshi Kumagai, chief cabinet secretary  and  then MITI minister, asked Masahisa Naito, head of MITI's  Industrial Policy Bureau, to step down to take the blame for an  allegedly unfair promotion he gave to a MITI official who was  leaving the ministry to run in a national election.    The request, which ended in Naito's voluntary resignation,  prompted public criticism regarding political interference in  the bureaucracy.    Naito, tipped as a likely choice for the next vice MITI  minister, said such a promotion was customary at MITI for  officials who leave to run in elections.    Kumano said MITI's director of the secretariat clarified the  situation surrounding the resignation at a House of  Representatives Budget Committee meeting Wednesday and Thursday.    Thursday's lower house budgetary committee meeting stalled  following the coalition parties' rejection of an opposition  demand that Naito be summoned to the Diet to give details about  the personnel controversy.    Naito, who is now in the United States, was quoted as saying  by an opposition interpellator during the committee session that  he is prepared to return home "tomorrow."    Kumagai said at his last news conference as MITI chief in  April that his resignation request to Naito was necessary to  "rejuvenate the management of MITI."    The latest development over the MITI controversy came in  connection with the question of whether Kumano will retain the  current post of vice MITI chief in an overall personnel  reshuffle to be made shortly.    Some within MITI have said he should resign to take  responsibility for causing the controversy.</p>

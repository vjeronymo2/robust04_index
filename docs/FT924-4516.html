			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Forecast of Lloyd's US losses attacked SENIOR UNDERWRITERS at Lloyd's of London have described independent estimates of the insurance market's potential losses from liabilities for US pollution and industrial diseases as 'grossly misleading', Richard Lapper writes. Chatset, the company that analyses Lloyd's results, said on Tuesday that it might cost Lloyd's Pounds 5.3bn to settle claims on the market's 162 'open years' - which occur when a syndicate cannot close its accounts because of uncertainty about future claims. Mr Richard Youell, an underwriter, said Chatset's assessment of his own syndicate's open year of 1989 was 'wholly contrary to our views on the syndicate's future development'. Mr David Foster, of the Lloyd's pollution committee, said Chatset's figures had 'no scientific basis'.</p>

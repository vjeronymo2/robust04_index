			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / The Soviet Coup - One Year After: Coup's leaders exploit conservative backlash from behind prison bars THE VENGEFUL rattling from Moscow prison cells is growing louder as the coup leaders, awaiting trial for their part in the failed putsch, rejoice over the troubles of President Boris Yeltsin and the newly-independent republics. 'As the economic situation in the country worsens, many people have problems remembering why the inmates at Sailors Rest (jail) are being given a hard time,' says Mr Andrei Makarov, a progressive lawyer defending Mr Yeltsin's ban on the Communist party in a parallel trial. 'Very few people remember the coup, the tanks, and the horror of those August nights.' Even Vice President Alexander Rutskoi, who played a prominent role in the 'resistance' to the coup but is now successfully exploiting a conservative backlash, has suggested letting them off. Mr Nikolai Pechenkin, an affable 44-year-old lawyer for Marshal Dmitry Yazov, the former defence minister, warns: 'This trial will split the country in two camps and it is not clear which camp will be bigger. Remember Chile. The media are now presenting Pinochet as a saviour. What is happening in this country now is collapse, ruin and chaos.' But with characteristic elements of a tragi-comedy, the trial is unlikely to happen before next year, if at all. After several false starts  - including the embarrassing leak of interrogation videos and the sacking last week of the deputy prosecutor in charge of the case  - the prosecutor-general, Mr Valentin Stepankov, has so far been unable to bring the matter to court. Only on Friday, he ordered the investigation to be restarted because he is unlikely to make the present charge of treason stick to the 15 defendants, since they will argue that they were, on the contrary, trying to save their country from collapse. One year after the coup leaders were ridiculed and villified for their vodka-fuelled attempt to prevent the signing of a union treaty which would have reshaped the Soviet Union, they are flourishing in political terms. Although most claim to be too unwell to stay in jail, most have found enough energy to defend their records and voice vitriolic criticism of the government in newspaper articles. Mr Anatoly Lukyanov, the parliamentary speaker who issued a sinister policy statement defending the coup, had no qualms in accusing the government last week of trying to ram capitalism down people's throats. Mr Valentin Pavlov, the former prime minister who used to compare running the Soviet economy to managing a western corporation, has been offered a job at the country's biggest commodity exchange if he comes out of jail. He is now blasting government policies in Pravda (the former Communist mouthpiece which has survived thanks to government subsidies) with defences of his disastrous economic policies which debauched the currency and robbed people of their savings. The role of President Mikhail Gorbachev, who was isolated at his holiday dacha in the Crimea from August 18-21, has also been subjected to closer scrutiny. Some defendants have said they believed he might support the coup, but there is no question of his facing trial. It seems most likely that his constant compromising made the coup possible but that he was genuinely taken aback by his ministers' action against him. 'I don't think the coup took place with his agreement,' says Mr Makarov. 'But I am deeply convinced that Gorbachev is guilty of having removed the real democratic forces around him and of promoting the reactionary forces which finally toppled him, of not pursuing reforms which he could have pursued, and of not speaking up clearly when he should have done so. . . . This all helped pave the way for the putsch.' Despite the incompetence of the prosecution and accusations that this is going to be a political trial whose outcome has been decided in advance, it is a triumph for Russia's fledgling democracy that any of this is happening at all. Unfortunately, as often is the case in Russia, it is all happening far too late.</p>

			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEATH PENALTY TWO VIEWS;  </P> <P> IS THERE JUSTICE IN THE GAS CHAMBER?;  </P> <P> IT IS DISTORTING OUR INSTITUTIONS AND OUR POLITICS, AND PROVING TO BE AN  ENORMOUS BURDEN FOR OUR SOCIETY TO BEAR.  </P> <P> Now it is the federal courts that Gov. George Deukmejian finds "incompetent" in  their administration of the death penalty, the state courts apparently having  performed to the governor's satisfaction in the matter of Robert Alton Harris.  But when a jurist as brilliant, morally principled and highly respected (not to  mention conservative) as John Noonan of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals  decides that a defendant has presented facts warranting a further careful look  before we execute him, and when two-thirds of the justices of the U.S. Supreme  Court agree, surely "incompetence" is not the explanation. Nor, given the  background of the judges who participated, is it an unalterable opposition to  the death penalty.  </P> <P> More likely, the explanation lies in the nature of the death penalty itself --  its irreversibility and, more fundamentally, its profound tension with the  value that our civilization attaches to human life. Capital punishment is  different from other sanctions, and the difference ought to, and apparently  does, make those who are responsible for its implementation exceedingly  cautious.  </P> <P> It is understandable that there are many people, and especially the families of  victims, who regard this caution as excessive. We have created a system in  which we look to the death penalty as the way of bringing about "justice" and  "closure," and as long as we continue to accept those definitions, we will  continue to be frustrated. This is so because even if we can expedite some  aspects of death penalty appeals, unless we forsake our Constitution and our  principles of fairness entirely, it will still take many years from the date of  judgment to the date of execution.  </P> <P> The fact is, the death penalty is distorting our institutions and our politics.  It has proved to be an enormous burden for our society to bear, not only  financially but also in terms of social costs and the strain on our democratic  values of life and equality. And, paradoxically, all of this is true because we  continue to be a civilized people, unwilling to accept casually the taking of  human life.  </P> <P> Other democracies seem to have solved the problem of providing justice and  closure to the friends and relatives of the victims through sanctions short of  death. In California, while the polls are inconclusive, there appears to be  substantial support for the alternative of life without possibility of parole,  so long as people can be certain that the defendant will stay in prison and  that the proceeds of his labor will go to compensate the families of victims.  Instead of focusing on the death penalty, where the political harvest is  immediate but tainted, responsible leaders should help us move in a direction  less costly and more compatible with our democratic traditions.  </P></p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Jarvis acquires hotel chain Jarvis Hotels is paying Pounds 43.5m for 20 hotels and two restaurants from the collapsed Resort Hotels group, and is planning a flotation for the enlarged company during 1995. Mr John Jarvis, who founded the company in 1990 and was formerly chairman of Ladbrokes' Hilton Hotel chain, said: 'The acquisition makes us the largest private hotel company in the country'. The sales were expected. Resort had been recently delisted from the Stock Exchange with a negative net worth of Pounds 23m, after it suffered a Pounds 71m loss in the year to April 1993 from property write-downs and provisions. The sales enable Resort to free itself from bank debts, and pay off some trade creditors. Shareholders will be compensated through a total of Pounds 2m of vouchers - around 3p per share - to be spent in Jarvis' hotels. But they will retain shares in what is effectively a worthless shell company. After the acquisition Jarvis will own 61 hotels, and manage a further nine. The hotels made an Pounds 18.5m profit in the year to March, and in spite of recession, the company has increased profitability every year since it was formed from the Pounds 186m purchase of Allied-Lyons' Embassy chain. Jarvis originally planned a reverse takeover of Resort, which would have provided a ready-made shareholder base, and facilitated flotation. However, the amount and quality of Resort's debt made this unfeasible.</p>

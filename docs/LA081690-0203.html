			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: RACES CANCELED FOR LACK OF CANDIDATES  </P> <P> School board candidates in three districts will take office without ever  appearing on the ballot because no one filed to run against them by the filing  deadline Wednesday.  </P> <P> Because they would have appeared on the ballot unopposed during the general  election in November, the candidates in the three school districts --  Brea-Olinda Unified, Los Alamitos Unified and Centralia -- will assume the  offices, an election official said.  </P> <P> In addition, no one filed candidacy papers to fill open seats on two Surfside  governing boards, which means the County Board of Supervisors will appoint  members to fill the community services and storm water districts serving the  gated Seal Beach community, election officials said.  </P> <P> In total, 26 of 78 potential local elections this November were canceled  because of a lack of candidates.  </P> <P> A total of seven races -- the three school board elections, plus four special  district elections -- were canceled Wednesday.

The filing deadline was extended  after the incumbents failed to file for reelection last week.  </P> <P> The filing period for the other local races on the Nov. 6 ballot ended Friday.  </P> <P> School board candidates who will assume office without an election are: Barbara  R. Paxton, homemaker, Brea-Olinda Unified; Keith Polakoff, a graduate-studies  dean, Los Alamitos Unified; and Karen L.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government and ruling parties held a meeting on  8 January to discuss political reform bills being deliberated by  the upper house. At the end of the discussion, they affirmed  their intention to work to pass the bills without revising such  key portions of the bills as the constituency unit for the  proportional representation system and the distribution of the  fixed number of seats between single-seat constituency seats and  proportional representation seats. The government and ruling  parties believe that the opposition Liberal Democratic Party  [LDP] is seeking a joint revision of key portions of the bills  with the ruling parties after giving up its filibuster in the  upper house, and the government and ruling parties view the  LDP's moves as an attempt to buy time. The Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ] has vehemently opposed amending the bills,  and the government and ruling parties are believed to have  decided not to amend the bills after concluding that respecting  the SDPJ's opposition to amending the bills is indispensable for  their passage in the Diet. The ruling parties, which decided on  10 January to hold public hearings on 19 January which are a  prerequisite for adopting the bills in the special committee on  political reform of the House of Councillors, intend to pass the  bills at a plenary session of the House of Councillors.    The ruling parties plan to amend such nonkey portions as the  "3-percent clause," which bans political parties with less than  3 percent of the total vote from receiving seats in the Diet,  and the clause that lifts a ban on house-to-house campaigning by  candidates. The bills are set to be forwarded to the lower house  for their passage during the current Diet session after being  amended in the upper house.    The government and ruling parties have taken the position  that if the LDP cooperates with deliberations of the bills in  the upper house, they will comply with any LDP call for a  certain amendment of the bills. The LDP decided on 7 January  that if it reaches an agreement with the ruling parties on  amending the key portions, it would will the passage of the  bills in the Diet. The LDP's decision has created a situation  wherein the ruling parties are forced to come up with ways to  deal with the opposition party's decision.    Some LDP members are asserting that: 1) The  government-introduced bill sets the constituency unit for the  proportional representation system as a nationwide unit but that  the constituency unit should be divided into about 10  constituency blocs; and 2) The distribution of the fixed number  of seats between single-seat-constituency seats and  proportional-representation seats is set at 280 and 274 seats,  respectively, but that the distribution should be revised. What  the ruling parties are loath to accept is any demand for an  amendment which provides for certain regulations which would  permit the continuation of political contributions by businesses  and organizations. The SDPJ has strongly argued that "if the  clause is amended, we will have no choice but to leave the  coalition government."    Conclusions drawn by the ruling parties are that it is  necessary to win a full guarantee from the LDP that the LDP will  support the passage of the bills in the Diet if they go along  with the LDP's demand for an amendment to the key portions, and  that if they brush aside the SDPJ's resistance without such a  guarantee from the LDP, this would endanger the passage of the  bills. It has been observed that there would be little room for  both the ruling and opposition parties to reach a compromise  unless the LDP takes a clear-cut stand of supporting the bills  after drafting compromise proposals acceptable to the ruling  parties and deciding on them. It has also been observed that in  the present situation, it is highly risky for the ruling parties  to promote a quick deal with the LDP on amending the key  portions in a way that might cause a change to the framework of  the coalition.</p>

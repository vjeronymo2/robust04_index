			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Choe Kyu-sik from Tashkent on a </F> news conference by an unidentified "high-ranking" ROK official  accompanying President Kim Yong-sam on his visit to Uzbekistan,  at the Uzbekistan Hotel on 5 June -- first three paragraphs are  HANGUK ILBO's introduction]    [Text] Regarding our government's position on the North  Korean nuclear development, a high-ranking official accompanying  President Kim Yong-sam on his visit to Uzbekistan said on 5  June: "There is no other way now but to take sanctions.  Allies, including the United States, also recognize that  sanctions by the UN Security Council must not be carried out  from simply a symbolic level but from a practical level."    This high-ranking official held a news conference with  reporters accompanying President Kim on the afternoon of 5 June  at the Uzbekistan Hotel in Tashkent, where they are staying, and  explained the background and prospects of the consultations held  for taking sanctions against North Korea by the UN Security  Council. He also revealed: "Discussions on the North Korean  nuclear issue will be carried out on a full scale starting this  week."    This official added: "The government's position is that the  sanctions must be carried out in stages. We plan to discuss  this matter with allies so that practical sanctions can be  carried out on a step-by-step basis."    Following is a summary of the news conference:    [Reporter] What is the reason for carrying out step-by-step  sanctions?    [Official] It is to give North Korea the opportunity to  prove  the transparency of its past nuclear activities. The method to  clarify North Korea's past nuclear activities has not yet  disappeared completely. Other than measuring the replaced fuel  rods, we can clarify it through a special inspection [tukpyol  sachal] or other inspection methods. Sanctions are not meant to  block the opportunity to prove its transparency from the  beginning.    [Reporter] What are the moves being taken by North Korea?    [Official] There is nothing peculiar. Up-to-date  intelligence capabilities that can inspect every corner of North  Korea 24 hours a day have been mobilized on a full scale. A  close posture of military preparedness has been assumed between  the ROK and the United States, and we can strengthen it further  if necessary. We expect that there will be no provocations from  North Korea.    [Reporter] What is China's position?    [Official] When Tang Jiaxuan, Chinese deputy foreign  minister, visited the ROK from 2 to 4 June, and held the  ROK-China deputy foreign ministers meeting, they discussed the  North Korean nuclear issue. It is known that China also  expressed worry and interest over the fact that North Korea  decided to go ahead and replace the fuel rods.    [Reporter] What is North Korea's attitude?    [Official] The recent remark by North Korean Vice Foreign  Minister Kang Sok-chu emphasizes the inevitability of replacing  the fuel rods, and that if the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks is  held, the issue of special and ad hoc inspections [tukpyol mit  imsi sachal] can be resolved. This shows that there is no  change in its existing position.    [Reporter] Other than the sanctions by the UN Security  Council, are independent sanctions against North among the  allies including the ROK, the United States, and Japan being  examined?    [Official] Under the current situation I believe that it  will  be possible to take sanctions through a UN Security Council  resolution. Of course, we cannot eliminate various  possibilities, and since President Kim received Russia's promise  for a firm support during his visit to Russia, we will work to  promote sanctions through a UN Security Council resolution.</p>

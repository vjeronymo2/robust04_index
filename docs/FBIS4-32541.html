			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Petar Gosev, leader of the Democratic Party, </F> by Branko Geroski; place and date not given: "Brutal Actions  Hurt"]    [Text] They use cannibalistic and nepotistic methods  in politics whereas I must act constructively.    We conclude our series of discussions with political party  leaders with an interview with Petar Gosev, the leader of the  Democratic Party, a party which is a perennial topic of fierce  discussions.  <H5>  Dirty Methods </H5>   [Geroski] Mr. Gosev, do you think that with increasing  frequency you have played the role of zealous critic rather than  of a leader trying creatively to develop something new?    [Gosev] Let me immediately say that that is not the way I  think. I have heard this remark, especially by people in power  and those around them. Such people can fabricate the most dirty  things, spread them daily among the public using the dirtiest  "social warfare" methods, while we must counter them with plans  for the present and the future. They engage in black  marketeering while accusing others. Their people are involved in  illegal deals for which they blame others. Their people trade in  import and export permits and compensation agreements; they grab  housing and free shops, whereas we, or I personally, must  counter them with "projects." They block the work of the  parliament expecting that I or other members of the opposition  will answer with projects which would unblock it. The members of  the coalition held the highest possible positions in the  government for decades, including the time when most of the  foreign loans were "gobbled up," while accusing others of the  same. They are applying cannibalistic and nepotistic methods in  politics, while asking of me to be constructive. This reminds me  of the time when a single party ruled: "Do not criticize, just  offer suggestions and we, at the top, we shall see whether your  suggestions are smart and whether we shall adopt them." What  projects are needed in order to block black marketeering,  corruption, the plunder of public capital, the daily violation  of the Constitution and the laws, discrimination against the  people, nepotism, and the fearful spreading of incompetence in  government, assigning political commissars to the information  media, increasing party involvement in the top police ranks, and  so on, if not to enable those who are doing all of this (and not  only this alone), making it possible, supporting it, or not  preventing it, although this is their duty, while in power?    [Geroski] When we speak of projects, we think of standards,  of unemployment, of the retired, of health, schools....    [Gosev] Yes, I too think about them. However, the latter  cannot be achieved without eliminating the former. Furthermore,  on the basis of what rules of parliamentary democracy should the  opposition draft projects for those in power and submit such  projects to them, telling them, "here is a project, see what you  can do about it while you keep on ruling!" On the other hand,  very basic amendments aimed at correcting ordinary stupidities  are simply rejected with grins of satisfaction. We do not intend  to provide them on a daily basis with this type of  "satisfaction." To the voters I speak of our realities, of what  we would accomplish if we are in power. Furthermore, we shall  present our electoral program which, with or without projects,  will be directed at the voters and not at those currently in  power.  <H5>  Gosev--Nationalist or Not? </H5>   [Geroski] You consider yourselves a party of the political  center. Today you are being described as a member of the  national bloc, while others even describe you as a nationalistic  party....    [Gosev] We are a party of the political center, and that is  what we shall remain. Labels used by political competitors will  change nothing. We have already seen this: If you are not with  them, there must be something wrong with you. I hear labels such  as "Gosev has gone to the right," "he has become a nationalist,"  or else "he has proclaimed a confused type of nationalism!" I am  convinced that I am wherever the national and state interests of  the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] are. I am convinced that it is the other  people who should think about where they stand. However, as was  the case in the past, they will realize this later and,  naturally, apply the greatest possible pressure to prove that  they have always been in favor of what happened (if it was good)  or against it (if it was bad). I read somewhere that a Russian  philosopher wrote that there are two types of nationalism:  zoological and creative. The first type encourages the  irrational features of a people and leans toward intoxication,  and inner triumph, and rejects criticism. The second not only  allows criticism but provides it. It is not cut off from the  trunk of the tree, rather it wants to enrich it with new  meanings and fruit. In our country, there also are the so-called  "anationals." They simply want to be merely citizens, members of  a country, regardless of its name. They would like immediately  to become citizens of the world. They want to live in the world  as a global village. This is splendid. This may happen  eventually. This may be the only formula that will save the  world. Perhaps. I would like this too. I would like before that  happens to practice the Olympic slogan, "We are one." But what  about until then? On the one hand, there we are with the  splendid humanistic slogan of "fraternity and unity," and on the  other, there they are (with others among them as well) with  their zoological nationalism. They would like to eliminate "our  kind" or else tell us that we are one, but of their own kind,  and take us over, either part of us or the entire "unrecruited"  remainder of the Republic of Macedonia. Over the past 50 years,  their practice of the otherwise splendid formula of "fraternity  and unity" changed the demographic structure of Macedonia. The  result today is expressed as follows: "Macedonia is not a  unitarian state" or "it will not be a unitarian state." If such  is the case, Macedonia will not be a state at all. This is worth  thinking about, is it not? Everyone must see where he is: to the  left, the right, in the center, or....    [Geroski] Those who try to estimate your electoral chances  are unable to agree on whether you are "rallying" around you the  voters disappointed by the VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian  Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian  National Unity] or by the social democrats and the liberals. Are  you indeed a party of the disappointed electorate?    [Gosev] The way things are, and given the increased number  of  sympathizers of the DP [Democratic Party], I fear that we may  become a disappointed country. Seriously speaking, your  questions are not serious. Our answer to this is the following:  Those who are in power do not need a new party, a new  alternative. However, if you are waiting for a more specific  answer, most of the present membership (about 11,000) consists  of former members of the SKM [League of [Communists of  Macedonia] or the SDSM [Social Democratic Alliance of  Macedonia], the Liberal Party, or individuals who have never  been members of any party. It is true that neither sympathizers  nor members are satisfied with this type of government, for  which reason I do not understand the meaning of your question  about us being the party of the disappointed.    [Geroski] What is Petar Gosev's view of the idea of a  coalition with the VMRO-DPMNE?    [Gosev] The elections in the 103rd district indicated that  if  the government does not form a coalition, it is bound to lose  the elections. That is, actually, what happened and "rescued"  the government from a defeat. In connection with our electoral  tactics, we are considering what would be the best way to defeat  the current coalition. The possibilities are obviously greater  if the opposition parties (those of any significance) develop  some kind of electoral cooperation. We have still not  definitively determined how intensive such cooperation should be  and the form it should adopt. Actually, we still have time to  reach a final decision. Naturally, this also depends on the  wishes and interests of the other opposition parties.    [Geroski] Do you find an international understanding of your  views, considering the international support given to the  Gligorov regime?    [Gosev] Interest in the DP is clearly increasing. An  increasing number of foreign diplomats, representatives of  foreign countries, and newsmen are interested in having  discussions with us. We openly present our views, profoundly  trusting that they are consistent with Macedonian state  interests. So far, there have been no cases of misunderstanding.  On the contrary, we have noted a high degree of accord and  understanding, even in connection with our views concerning  relations with Greece. In the case of Greece, although they  dispute our own views sometimes, quite frequently they note the  complexity of the situation and suggest a compromise with  Greece, although confidentially they say that they are on our  side.  <H5>  Conversion and Mimicry </H5>   [Geroski] We assume that the current electoral theme adopted  by you and your party will be one of so-called conversion: You  are indeed a "refugee" from the SDSM, a person about whom it is  being said that he "brought" Kiro Gligorov to Macedonia (and is  now criticizing him), a person who formed a party with people  who, until yesterday, fiercely criticized him. What is Petar  Gosev's answer to this?    [Gosev] This will not be our current theme. Many themes are  much more important. Many among those who accuse us of  conversion lack the moral right to do so. Specifically, the  leaderships of the current coalition parties consist of the  former SKM, and some of them incidentally, have had double the  amount of "apprenticeship" in that party and have been for  decades been part of the ruling team of the one-party system.  They abandoned it, and now are once again together, struggling  for power. I may be accused of conversion. I opposed the League  of Communists platform and drafted a different platform long  before they did, even while the country was still ruled by a  single party. These people agreed with the new platform.  Therefore, they too converted. However, looking at the way they  work, the way they consider such conversion and the aspects on  the basis of which they look at it, and considering the cadres  which are promoting and revitalizing their platform, they once  again aspire to be in power (the majority of them were, until  the very last moment, against a market economy and pluralism,  and against the state independence of Macedonia), and one could  say that they did not convert but, as your respectable newspaper  would say, they were not subject to a metamorphosis but remained  like ideological dinosaurs and resorted merely to mimicry. My  political credo and basic ideological line and system of basic  values have been defined for quite some time. I did not avoid,  naturally, making the necessary modifications. I separated  myself from those who did not undertake any kind of ideological  conversion (those who support the program of the League of  Communists of 1950) or those whose ideology and system of values  consist of remaining in power and ruling for the sake of  fulfilling their personal objectives only. As to the fact that I  have joined those who, until yesterday, attacked me fiercely,  let me say the following: To be attacked by a political rival is  one thing; but when you are being attacked secretly, like  Brutus, by someone who thought of as a close supporter is an  entirely different matter. I ask you to whom would you feel  closer? For the latter, the people have suitable universally  familiar sayings, I do not have to repeat them. My former  political rivals, however, rarely resorted to attacking my  personality. Frequently, they displayed greater respect for my  activities and individualism, focusing their criticism on the  old party along with its entire legacy of the past.</p>

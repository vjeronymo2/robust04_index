			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'LAGUNA GAY LIFE EBBING AWAY' -- A DISSERVICE TO THE RESIDENTS  </P> <P> Responding to the article "Laguna Beach Gay Life Ebbing Away" (Dec. 9) about  Laguna Beach, your newspaper did a great disservice to this community.  </P> <P> The tenor of the article perpetuates the myth that AIDS is a gay disease.  </P> <P> This only serves to keep the general population ignorant of the brutal and  unforgiving statistics currently being collected.  </P> <P> When the incidence of the disease on a per-capita basis was cited, the story  failed to observe that doctors and hospitals in this community accurately  report the disease as a primary cause of death, while many others in the state  and the country opt for reporting some other condition in an effort to avoid  the stigma of the disease.  </P> <P> A person with AIDS is apt to come to this city seeking dignified care and  support -- which inflates the incidence rate -- more than to other cities that  are still floundering in bureaucratic morass, bias and bigotry.  </P> <P> The story resorted to ridiculous observations that "25% of the city's  population is gay" and "since the '20s, the city has been a mecca for  homosexuals." Those numbers have no basis in fact. Believing that this  community of 25,000 contains 6,000 or more gay individuals is ludicrous.  </P> <P> The assumption that the city is a mecca for homosexuals is a vapid, inane  claim. This city is an energetic, aesthetic, geographic wonder with a strong  business and social direction and a history of being an artistic vortex.  </P> <P> ROBERT DENNING, Laguna Beach  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Rembau, Sat. -- Negeri Sembilan Menteri Besar  [State Chief Minister] Tan Sri Mohamed Isa Abdul Samad has urged  Al-Arqam followers to abandon the movement which has not only  deviated from Islamic teachings but is also a threat to national  security.    He said the state government viewed the movement's deviant  activities seriously and would intensify efforts to explain to  the people about the group.    "We do not want to see the racial harmony enjoyed by the  people under the Barisan Nasional government threatened by the  movement," he said in response to Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr.  Mahathir Mohamed's statement that the Al-Arqam movement had  reached a level that may threaten national security.    Speaking after attending a district-level Maal Hijrah  [Hegira  Muslim new year] celebration here yesterday, he said the state  government would support any Federal Government action to curb  the movement's activities.    He said religious officers and mosque administrators in all  districts would be asked to explain in detail to their  congregation on where the movement went wrong.    "In this way we will be able to check the movement's  deviationist activities from spreading," he said, adding that  the state government had banned the movement last year.</p>

It is unfortunate that the water utility chose yesterday to run a full-page ad in the Evening Standard extolling the virtues of its new water ring main, an underground tunnel 8ft in diameter and 50 miles long providing fresh water for Londoners: 'Thirsty people we Londoners. And with demand for water growing all the time . . .' Not yesterday, it wasn't. The paper's front page was dominated by the story of how the capital's underground railway system broke down when tunnels flooded after record rains descended.</p>

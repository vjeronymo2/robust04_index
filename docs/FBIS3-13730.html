Army personnel forced the administrative officials  to leave the building and prevented anyone from entering it.    Meanwhile, a Lebanese Army unit entered the students'  building in Tabarja today. Our radio tried in vain to contact  the party's central headquarters to inquire about the situation  there.</p>

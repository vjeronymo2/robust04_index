			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The die appears to have been cast between the  Nigerian military government and Chief M.K.O. Abiola. On  Saturday [11 June], the anniversary of last year's abortive  presidential election, the chief's aides announced that he had  declared himself president and been sworn in before a crowd of  thousands of supporters and that he had escaped from house  arrest and was now in hiding. The Nigerian police say he is a  wanted man and are offering a reward for his arrest. But now,  the police are expressing doubts about whether the chief really  did appear in public on Saturday. Nigerian journalist Eddy Iro  has just flown in from Lagos. Robin White asked him if he  shared those doubts:    [Begin recording] [Iro] I think the swearing in never  happened. I have met nobody, spoken to nobody who witnessed the  swearing in. No newspaper in Nigeria carried it and Nigerian  papers are very independent. Nobody could have stopped them  from carrying a report of that swearing in if it took place.  Even Abiola's own newspaper, the SUNDAY CONCORD -- a copy of  which I had -- didn't carry the story.    [White] So, did anything happen at all, do you think?    [Iro] I have had reports that a recorded message was sent  out  from Chief Abiola, from wherever, I don't know. But I believe  that this whole thing was targeted not at the Nigerian public,  but at Western public opinion and Western media fell for it.    [White] What would be the point of lying about something  like  this?    [Iro] Well, this has been at this stage now more a  propaganda  war. He wrote to Vice President Al Gore to help him persuade  the Nigerian military government to assume power and the  question would be why would he be talking to Vice President Al  Gore?    [White] Do you have any idea where Abiola is?    [Iro] I have absolutely no idea. The police have declared  him wanted. He is presumably...[pauses] he is within Nigeria.  I have also learned reliably that there has been a ban on  private air flights because the last time he left Nigeria, he  left in his private jet and I gather than the military  government has banned all private flights within and outside  Nigeria.    [White] There has been a rumor, I think, that he might be in  the American Embassy. Do you think that might be true?    [Iro] It could be true because there was a statement issued  by the police which covertly warned about foreign embassy  involvement, foreign countries' involvement in this matter.  There has been that suggestion that he might be in the American  Embassy. But if he is declared wanted, one would expect the  American Embassy officials to own up to his presence on their  premises. At the time I left Lagos, they had not responded to  any indication that he might be within their custody.    [White] Do you think Abiola has won a trick or lost a trick  over this weekend?    [Iro] I think he has reduced his quest to something of a  farce. If this was his idea of a swearing in, of assuming the  presidency, I do not consider it a serious political challenge  to the military government. I am by no means a supporter of  this or any military government, I want to make that very clear,  but I believe that the process of this entangling the military  should continue through the National Constitutional Conference,  the elections of which have been held and which should be  getting to motion within the next week or two.

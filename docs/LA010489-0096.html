			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  MCMARTIN TRIAL WILL NOT BE OVER SOON  </P> <P> The long-running McMartin Preschool molestation trial is going to run even  longer than predicted -- probably until autumn, the trial judge said Tuesday.  </P> <P> "I wish all of you a happy new year and an end in 1989 to our sufferings in  court," Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders told lawyers as they  returned from a holiday recess.  </P> <P> Pounders then asked for a "realistic estimate" from defense lawyers on when  their case might conclude. Danny Davis, who represents defendant Raymond  Buckey, said the defense case will probably go "well into May."  </P> <P> The judge, noting that prosecutors have estimated two months for rebuttal and  the defense an additional month, said that with a month of final arguments, the  case probably won't reach jurors before September.  </P> <P> Jurors, who have been serving on the case for a year and a half, had been told  that the trial would conclude in April.  </P> <P> Buckey, 30, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 61, are charged with 65  molestation and conspiracy charges stemming from their operation of the defunct  McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach.  </P></p>

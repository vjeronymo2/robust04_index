			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROUP PROTESTS GRAFFITI AT FURNITURE WAREHOUSE;  </P> <P> VANDALISM: ACTIVISTS SAY LEVITZ ENCOURAGED TAGGING IN AN AREA OF GLENDALE BY  ALLOWING ITS WALLS TO BE USED FOR SPRAY-PAINTED MURALS.  </P> <P> Graffiti foes dumped dozens of empty spray-paint cans in front of a Glendale  furniture warehouse Friday, contending that the establishment has encouraged a  vandalism spree by allowing spray-can artists to paint on its walls.  </P> <P> About 50 members of Valley Organized in Community Efforts, protesting outside  the Levitz Furniture warehouse that abuts the Los Angeles River, said the  company has aggravated the neighborhood's graffiti problems.  </P> <P> Levitz, which had been plagued by graffiti, allowed some self-described  graffiti artists to spray-paint murals on the outer walls about four months  ago, store officials said. They hoped that taggers -- gang members and others  who scrawl words with spray-paint or a marker -- would not deface the  paintings.  </P> <P> But gang members and taggers have sprayed slurs and slogans on top of the  murals and have also marred the walls of nearby businesses, according to VOICE  members and neighboring merchants.  </P> <P> "Levitz started this as an art contest, but they didn't control it," VOICE  spokeswoman Martha Page said. "It's not just art. It's not just an innocent  creative endeavor."  </P> <P> "This is an invitation to gangs and drug dealers," VOICE member Barbara  Mark-Dreyfuss said. "It turns it into a crippled, sick community."  </P> <P> VOICE, which operates an anti-graffiti campaign, includes members from 19 San  Fernando Valley religious groups and claims to represent more than 30,000  families. In a written statement, the group charged that Levitz is "an enemy of  responsible business and contributes to the destabilization of the local area."  </P> <P> Levitz employees told the protesters that the store was not at fault for the  rash of graffiti.  </P> <P> "In no way was Levitz trying to do something to harm the community," said Bill  O'Malley, the company's group operations manager.  </P> <P> Regarding the protest, O'Malley said: "Our building is in the process of being  repainted now. It will be accomplished within the next two weeks. We don't wish  to comment further on this subject."  </P> <P> The owners of two graffiti-stained businesses nearby blame Levitz for their own  graffiti problems.  </P> <P> "They started at Levitz and went to the next building and the next building,"  said Angel Ramorino, co-owner of Furniture Town.  </P> <P> Ramorino said he has had to repaint the exterior of his store several times in  recent months because of the spreading graffiti.  </P> <P> "There was hardly anything on our wall before Levitz started," said Larry  Tackett, president of Trade Rotary Corp., a printing firm. "It just keeps  getting worse."  </P> <P> He added: "They'd always do it on the weekend. Somebody would paint something,  then somebody else would paint something on top of that. I didn't mind it at  first. It is just out of hand now."  </P> <P> Members of VOICE demanded that a top Levitz official meet with the group and  join a citywide crackdown on graffiti, but the company had no immediate  response.  </P></p>

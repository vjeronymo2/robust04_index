			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Government and International Bonds: Bundesbank sells further DM4.2bn of 30-year issue The Bundesbank provided the main focus of attention in the European government bond markets yesterday with the sale of the new 30-year German government bond issue. The central bank sold a further DM4.20bn of the 6.25 per cent, 30-year bond yesterday at a weighted average price of 99.71, giving an average yield of 6.27 per cent. The size of the issue will be DM10bn, consisting of yesterday's tender tranche combined with DM3bn allocated to the Bundesbank's bond-issuing consortium and the DM2.79bn to be used for market operations. The bund market rallied yesterday, but the 30-year area underperformed with the 30-year yield spread over the 10-year bund widening from 66 to 69 basis points. The German central bank intends to make use of the 30-year maturity on a regular basis, expanding the range of government securities on offer to investors eager to have the option of investing at a range of maturities along the yield curve. The increased flexibility is likely to reduce the government's borrowing costs and enhance the attractions of Finanzplatz Deutschland - Germany as a financial centre. Traders expect demand for the new issue to come chiefly from foreign investors who are more optimistic about further cuts in German interest rates than domestic institutions. US Treasury prices eased slightly at both ends of the market yesterday as more news of a strengthening economy continued to put bonds under selling pressure. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was down  3/16 at 100, yielding 6.245 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was down  1/32 at 100 3/32 , to carry a yield of 4.184 per cent. The latest economic data to unsettle the market was a 0.5 per cent increase in the November leading indicators, and a 2.9 per cent increase in November existing home sales. Although the numbers did not come in that far over analysts' expectations, they were the latest in a line of statistics suggesting the economy is growing at a healthy rate. Analysts said the market would probably stay in a tight trading range into the new year, with investors waiting to see if the economy sustains its pace in early 1994. UK government bonds opened on a firm note after the Christmas break, with dealers noting some buying interest as hopes of a cut in the base rate continued to sustain the gilt market. The Liffe long gilt futures contract touched a high of 120.20, but drifted lower later in the day to trade at around 120.10 by late afternoon. The Spanish government bond market shrugged off the financial crisis facing Banesto, Spain's fourth largest bank, in spite of some concern over the impact on the Spanish banking system. Prices ended virtually unchanged, and the news is not expected to have an impact on today's Treasury auction of three, five and 10-year debt. Eurobond activity has virtually ground to a halt, and is expected to remain extremely thin until the new year. Only a handful of new issues emerged yesterday. In the French market, Societe Generale launched two FFr800m offerings. One deal was a further tranche of a FFr2.2bn issue of 5 1/4 per cent bonds due January 1996. The other, using a more complicated structure, pays a fixed coupon of 7 per cent for the first six months, and then a floating rate of interest for the rest of its 10-year life.</p>

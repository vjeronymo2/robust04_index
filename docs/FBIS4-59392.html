			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Hamas Rejects Israeli Conditions for </F> Releasing Its Prisoners"]    [Text] Damascus, AL-HAYAH -- The Islamic Resistance  Movement (Hamas) has refused to respond to the conditions set by  Israeli authorities for releasing its prisoners from Israelis  jails. It stressed that linking their release with its support  of the Oslo agreement is "a one-upmanship rejected by our  mujahidin."    Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for Hamas, said that  the  movement "has decided not to accept the conditions set by  Zionist occupation authorities for releasing our prisoners,  namely to pledge not to return to what they termed the pledge to  continue terrorist actions, and to support the capitulationist  Gaza-Jericho agreement." Ghawshah added in a statement that  "the detainees' release is a natural right which should not be  linked to the required pledge. Because the resistance against  the occupation is a legitimate right in all values and laws  known to mankind. Thus it is not right to describe it as a  terrorist action. Besides, the detainees cannot abandon a  legitimate and national duty they are performing against the  occupation."</p>

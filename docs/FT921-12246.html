			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Yemen's oil-fired optimism - Bidding has been intense for exploration rights NEW DISCOVERIES of oil, gas and precious metals are leading the way to brighter economic prospects in Yemen, long considered one of the world's least developed countries. Precise estimates of the country's potential have yet to be determined, but experts are enthusiastic about initial signs. Exploration rights have been purchased by 18 oil companies over the past year and one of them, Canadian Occidental, has already reported a major find. Located at Masila, in southern Yemen, the new field was early this month declared commercially viable, with total reserves at 550m barrels, of which 235m barrels are recoverable. Can-Oxy plans to start production in mid-1993 after an accelerated programme of development. With exploration still in the early stages experts are wary of making precise predictions about Yemen's oil potential. But most agree that the country will be able to produce about 1m b/d in the foreseeable future. Though Yemen's first commercial strike was in the north, most exploration is now concentrated in the south, particularly around Shabwa in the Hadramaut Valley. Oil companies had long suspected that there were considerable reserves there, but concession rights in the former Marxist state were dominated by the Soviet Union. Unification of North and South Yemen in May 1990 opened the way for western companies and the new Yemen government has been quick to capitalise on the competition, selling rights this year alone for an estimated Dollars 700m. Oil executives say that competition for concessions has been intense and that the bidding for rights has been unusually high. But they point out the potential rewards. Yemen's oil is said to be first-rate, with a low sulphur content and a high ratio of associated gas. Comparable in quality to Arabian light crude, Yemen's oil is said to require little refining and so may attract premium prices on the world market. While optimistic about Yemen's potential, oil executives nonetheless state that full commercial production is still several years away. Apart from seismological work, exploratory drilling and assessment of commercial feasibility, production can be further delayed by the nature of a site and it surrounding terrain. A time span of three to five years between discovery and production is generally thought realistic. That is supported by the local experience of the Hunt Oil Company. In July 1984 Hunt announced Yemen's first commercial oil strike, but exports did not begin until three and a half years later. In addition to normal preparations on the site, Hunt also had to construct a 450 km pipeline over mountainous terrain and a marine export facility at Ras Issa on the Red Sea coast. Apart from oil, Yemen is also reported to have immense gas reserves. Indeed, the country is now rumoured to be sitting on top of the world's biggest gas 'bubble'. According to industry insiders, the discovery of Yemen's gas has come as a surprise and has led to difficulties between Hunt Oil and the Yemen government over concession rights to the unexpected find. Hunt officials, however, play down estimates of Yemen's gas reserves and sharply deny any breach with the Yemen government over concession rights. One says the two sides have now signed a joint protocol to study Yemen's gas potential and results are expected by late February 1992. Depending on the outcome of that study Yemen's income from gas could be considerable, especially from its reserves of natural gas. Liquefied natural gas is an alternative to oil in the generation of electrical power and has potential markets throughout the industrialised world. Marketing experts are said to be paying especial attention to Korea and Japan where LNG is used extensively in industry. Yemen is also said to have considerable reserves of liquid propane gas, used for domestic purposes such as cooking and heating. Though Yemen's reserves have some export potential, their primary use will be for domestic consumption thus ending the country's former dependence on imported supplies. While oil and gas are certain to be the main sources of Yemen's mineral wealth, exporters are also looking into its mining potential. That potential has long been suspected and, indeed, mining experts are now using ancient historical documents to guide their initial explorations. Preliminary reports are so far sketchy. But in addition to traces to gold and silver at traditional mining sites, geologists also hint at the possibility of uranium deposits in altogether new areas of exploration. They stress, however, that their explorations have only just begun and that much preliminary work remains to be done before any reliable statements can be made about Yemen's mining prospects. Tentative as they are, these new discoveries of Yemen's potential mineral wealth are bringing a sense of optimism to the country. Chronically one of the world's poorest nations Yemen was especially hard-hit by the Gulf war and for most of the past year its economy has suffered from steadily rising inflation and unemployment. Recent times have been hard for Yemen and its problems may continue for a while yet. But, as one oil executive put it: 'I'm bullish on the prospects'.</p>

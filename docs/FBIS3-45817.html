			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 21 (XINHUA) -- China has once again  demonstrated its resolution of developing domestic gold industry  by using overseas funds and technologies.    The China National Gold Corporation (CNGC), the only  specialized gold industry company in the country, has set up a  special group to coordinate experimental work of importing  overseas funds and technologies.    Cui Lan, chairman of the board of the CNGC, disclosed that  so  far a dozen companies from the U.S., Canada, Australia and South  Africa have contacted them, showing interest in investing in  China's gold mines.    He said that, besides opening the gold industry to overseas  investment, China is now putting equal efforts into introducing  advanced technologies for prospecting, mining, dressing and  smelting, as well as models for running gold mines and means of  collecting funds.    Cui pointed out that the rumor that China bans overseas  investors from its gold industry is false.    He explained that China's gold industry has made great  strides since the government adopted the reform and opening-up  policy in the late 1970s.    The country's gold production capability has been raised  five  times since then.    Altogether there are 28 enterprises directly subordinate to  the company, which also has nine joint ventures or share-holding  companies.    So as to help China's gold industry move into the world  market, the company has established four overseas branches.    As a group company monopolizing the country's gold industry,  the CNGC has a large business scope covering prospecting,  engineering design, construction of gold-related enterprises,  consultancy, dressing, processing and sales of gold, and  importing materials, machinery and technologies.    Cui foresaw that in the near future the CNGC will develop  into a trans-regional group investment company.</p>

			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOWARD EQUALITY;  </P> <P> EXPLORING A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE;  </P> <P> MAKING A DIFFERENCE;  </P> <P> OFFICER WORKS TO REAP A HARVEST OF HOPE IN WATTS  </P> <P> Officer Wayne Guillary, in his pressed blues, nosed the black and white out of  the Southeast Division parking lot onto the streets of Watts. Guillary has been  staring at these streets and its people all his life. He grew up here, he and  his two brothers, in a modest home on Mary Avenue near 103rd Street.  </P> <P> Guillary, 32, has been on the force for seven years and has risen to the rank  of P-3, a supervisory position.  </P> <P> He approaches his job with almost missionary zeal. He is trying desperately, he  says, to return something to the neighborhood.  </P> <P> For Guillary, the realities of the street and the politics of the job present a  troubling dichotomy. He works in a division where nearly all the residents are  black, save a spattering of Latinos. Nearly all the officers are white.  </P> <P> Guillary heads area A-3, a segment bounded by Central Avenue on the west, Wall  Street on the East, Manchester Boulevard on the north and 103rd Street on the  south. It includes middle-income areas and striving families as well as  stretches of urban badlands, gangs, troublesome liquor stores. On the streets  are baseheads and strawberries, the local nicknames for the men and women  strung out on crack cocaine. Often, he ends up arresting people he grew up  with.  </P> <P> Today is a slow day. He will meet with three block clubs to boost their spirits  with an upbeat crime report, roust crack addicts from three vacant houses,  arrest one woman for prostitution and possession of crack cocaine. Her trick,  on probation, will also be charged with possession.  </P> <P> "Sometimes I believe there is no hope for black people. I was very optimistic  when I started out. I didn't think it would be worse. It's changed in a way  that I sometimes feel, 'Are we going to make it over that hill?' That mountain  looks pretty high. It's a mountain of crime.  </P> <P> "Sometimes I wonder who cares.  </P> <P> "It's tough, but I can't quit. I look at my old grandfather who's 95 years old.  James Fuzee. When he can sit back and tell me the hardships that he's seen  black America go through, I know I can't quit. When he talks about the  hardships and the strides that blacks have made over the years, it's much worse  than what we're dealing with today. My grandfather said if our ancestors could  go through all that hardship, if we can come over here and be put through  slavery for 250 years, we can come out of this condition we're in today.  </P> <P> "But it's hard. It's hard trying to be strong. There are times I look at kids  and tears come to my eyes. I feel for them. I wish there was something that I  could do. I'm doing something morally that I think is right by being in this  uniform. I get down on their level and tell them they can make it. There may or  may not be a lot of other black cops who do it, but it means something to me.  </P> <P> "I feel for these people. I really do. To have to wake up every morning, turn  on your radio and here that in South-Central Los Angeles, 'Three gang shootings  occurred. Three men are dead, separate locations.' You find out that the family  is watching television or having a little birthday party, somebody drives up  and shoots in the house and a little kid gets killed. It's sad.  </P> <P> "People are afraid to let their kids out. You won't see a lot of children  walking up and down Wadsworth because we've got the gangs over here. We've got  Avalon, 89th Street gang. We've got men who are just walking the street  unemployed, and it's intimidating to the citizens. They see graffiti on the  walls. They see gang members walking down the street with their pants hanging  down, a rag hanging out their pocket, their sneakers untied, dark shades on.  That's intimidating to them.  </P> <P> "I spoke to a young lady one time on the street, I said, 'People try to clean  up your neighborhood, take pride in it. There's too much crime.' You know what  that young lady told me. She said, 'We don't need the police around here. We  are the crime.'  </P> <P> "I talk to my friends about it sometimes. They really don't understand the  problems. They hear it on the news, and they say that's sad, but I'm right in  it. They say, 'I don't know if it's that bad.' I say take a ride for yourself  and see how many (prostitutes) you can pick up on Figueroa. If I could get a  bus to follow me . . . I could fill it with girls that I pick up. I guarantee  you."  </P> <P> Guillary turns right off San Pedro onto 92nd Street. He and his partner  cautiously check an apparently abandoned house frequented by crack addicts. The  stench of urine and human feces meets them at the door. They find a man inside.  His fingers are badly singed -- a tell-tale sign of a crack addict who clutches  the glass pipe even as it burns his skin. Guillary warns him that he is  trespassing and promises to arrest him if he finds him in the house again.  </P> <P> The unit heads through Nickerson Gardens. Heads turn. Stares. A young boy asks  about baseball cards that police often hand out. No baseball cards today.  </P> <P> "There's discrimination within the department. There are a lot of blacks who  say Southeast isn't fair, but there have been changes made. Guys look and say,  'Guillary, you're the only black senior lead in the division. You're in a  predominantly black area. Why is that?' I can't answer it. Those decisions are  beyond my control.  </P> <P> "They're making gradual changes. We'll never get rid of racism and  discrimination to 100%. You have to deal with it every day. It's not a constant  or where it's blatant. I've worked with a lot of good white partners in black  neighborhoods. There are some good white officers in the division who care. We  have several lieutenants who like to see the affirmative action plan applied. I  think if you saw a lot of undercover black cops who are effective in those  areas, you're going to see some officers taking interest in that.  </P> <P> "I started out in Hollywood Division as a probationary officer in 1981. I was  the only black on morning watch. They had blacks in division, but on that watch  I was the only one. It's kind of a funny feeling. You're sitting there with  your counterparts, and they might crack and joke, and it might be a racial  joke. And if you took offense, you might find yourself in a hard place. You've  gotta have a pretty thick skin to be a police officer because there are a lot  of jokes being thrown at you. Some are said with meanness, and others are said  to crack a joke. If you don't have a thick skin, it can hurt you.  </P> <P> "It's a very touchy situation to talk about at times because you don't know who  you may offend. Around here, they've had training days when no blacks are  involved. It could have been an oversight or just something they just weren't  aware of. But if you saw more blacks in narcotics, administrative vice, being  detectives and working those areas, you would in fact see a possible change in  the crime factor. They may have some effect in getting to the heart of the  problem. They can't rid the entire community of the problem, but I think to  infiltrate some of those areas, you'll find that a black was able to get into  those areas before a white guy. If some of the black guys went undercover, they  look the part. They can talk the talk."  </P> <P> Cruising down Figueroa, Guillary spots a suspected prostitute. He stops to chat  and notices her left hand clenching something. Inside is crack. She squeals on  a trick inside a hotel. Guillary and a backup unit barge in. The man is in bed  watching adult movies. A smattering of cocaine is found in his possession. Both  are arrested.  </P> <P> "When I went for my interview to become P-3, they asked me why I wanted it and  what I was trying to accomplish. I think my answer to them sums up my feelings  about what I'm doing here. See, I'm like the farmer. Right now land is barren  and the soil rocky, and everybody wants to abandon it. But I feel that if I'm  persistent in staying here, I can get something done. I believe if I could rid  the land of all the problems, then I feel that when the land become productive  and fruitful, I would reap the harvest. I think that we could all reap the  harvest."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- A top life insurance  industry official Friday blasted a government report on postal  insurance for proposing making postal life insurance more  competitive with private-sector products.    Speaking in the capacity of chairman of the Life Insurance  Association of japan, Toshiomi Uragami told reporters that the  proposal runs counter to the law governing postal life insurance  that limits services.    "This could help give more power to the bureaucracy," said  Uragami, who is also president of Sumitomo Life Insurance Co.    The report, prepared by a study group for the Ministry of  Posts and Telecommunications, says postal life insurance is  serving to promote competition in the oligopolistic life  insurance market.    Commenting also on a series of damage suits filed by  variable  life insurance policyholders against life insurance firms,  Uragami said each life insurance company should have explained  the feature of variable life insurance, and noted that the  industry is reviewing a text on the subject for sales personnel.    Variable life insurance policies are investment-oriented  policies that provide a return linked to an underlying portfolio  of securities.    Variable life insurance was a big hit in the so-called  bubble  era in the late 1980s when a booming stock market held the  promise of higher returns.    But with the stock market crumbling since, many  policyholders  facing huge losses have filed damages suits against life  insurance firms.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Foreign  Minister Qian Qichen said that despite a breakdown in  Sino-British talks on Hong Kong political issues, work in other  fields that requires efforts from both sides has been underway  and will continue.    Qian made the remark at a news conference here today.    "Sino-British talks on the arrangement of Hong Kong 1994/95  elections have broken down," he said. "But this does not mean  work of the Joint Liason Group will suspend."    Negotiations on the new Hong Kong airport are continuing,  too, he said.    "In my view," Qian said, "both sides should make efforts to  ensure Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. Despite a  breakdown of Sino-British talks on the political structure  arrangement of Hong Kong, China still cares about Hong Kong's  economy and the livelihood of its people."    China will try its best to cooperate with the British side,  he said.    "Whether or not cooperation can proceed smoothly depends on  both the attitude and action of the British side," he said.</p>

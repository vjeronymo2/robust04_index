Section 251.43 specifies that the written direct case must include all testimony and exhibits, complete with proper referencing. Each party submitting a written direct case must specify its requested royalty rate or percentage of the royalty pool, whichever is applicable. No evidence may be submitted in the direct written case without a sponsoring witness or official notice, unless good cause is shown. Section 251.43 also gives Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels discretion in setting the time for the filing of written rebuttal cases after the conclusion of the hearing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Filing and Service of Written Cases and Pleadings.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 251.44 governs the filing and service of written cases and pleadings. The division of authority, together with the possible differences in the location of the Copyright Office and the places where the CARPs hold their hearings, require special filing and service requirements. The former Tribunal could maintain all records and evidence at one location, but this is not possible under the new system. Section 251.44(a), therefore, requires that an original and three copies of all filings made to a Panel be submitted in such manner as the Panel shall direct. As was discussed above in connection with the official mailing address, location of arbitration proceedings is likely to change, and the circumstances surrounding mail delivery and receipt could be uncertain. Section 251.44(a) allows the Panels flexibility to deal with this problem by allowing them to establish the means of delivery, whether it be by direct hand delivery, delivery to a specified address, or establishment of a temporary post office box. The parties submitting filings, however, are still required to deliver one copy of their pleading or filing to the Copyright Office at its official address. In the case of large or bulky filings, a Panel may reduce the number of copies it requires, but a complete copy must nonetheless be submitted to the Copyright Office. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 251.44(b) prescribes the requirements with respect to all filings with the Librarian of Congress_that is motions and pleadings filed with the Librarian in accordance with these proposed rules both before and after the CARP proceedings. Under the proposed rule, each party must file an original and five copies with the Copyright Office. Section 251.44 also maintains the English-language translation, affidavit, subscription and verification, and service requirements of the former Tribunal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Precontroversy Discovery.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 251.45 significantly expands the scope of permitted discovery in arbitration proceedings. In his statement accompanying H.R. 2840. Representative William Hughes, Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Intellectual Property and Judicial Administration of the House Committee on the Judiciary, commented favorably on the use of precontroversy discovery and exchange of information.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 139 Cong. Rec. H10973 (daily ed. Nov. 22, 1993) (``In order to reduce the amount of actual litigation time, and thereby reduce expenses, I encourage the Librarian to promulgate regulations permitting exchange of information before the tolling of the 180-day decision period, and, to the extent practicable, generally to permit precontroversy discovery.''). Section 251.45 is proposed to explore the efficacy of Chairman Hughes' recommendation. We particularly seek comments on the scope of such precontroversy discovery: whether it should include interrogatories of witnesses as well as production of supporting documents, and whether it would advance Chairman Hughes' goal of reducing costs by being able to stipulate facts and remove issues, or whether the additional procedures might add costs to the proceeding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the case of royalty distribution proceedings, the proposed rule directs the Librarian to designate a period for precontroversy discovery and exchange of documents. This period is to start after the filing of claims and to end at the declaration of a controversy, and is the same time period referred to by section 251.4(b) for the filing of objections to arbitrators. In the case of rate adjustment proceedings, the period for precontroversy discovery and exchange of documents corresponds with the 90-day consideration period for all rate adjustment petitions and proceedings specified by &sect;251.63. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All parties to a proceeding may voluntarily exchange documents during this time, or may make discovery requests. Failure to respond to requests, and any other discovery controversies or issues, will be resolved by the Librarian. All other objections to royalty claims or petitions, or motions for procedural or evidentiary rulings, shall also be submitted to the Librarian for decision during the same time period. All parties to the proceeding will be given 14 days in which to respond to a motion or objection, regardless of whether or not this 14-day period goes beyond the time periods specified in subsection (a). The Librarian, after consultation with the Register, shall rule on all motions or objections timely submitted, and will not declare a controversy and initiate arbitration proceedings until all rulings have been made. See 17 U.S.C. 801(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discovery and Motions during Proceedings.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 251.45(c) prescribes a similar procedure for exchanging documents and motions and objections filed with a Panel once a proceeding beings. The Panel must designate a period for discovery with respect to both the written direct and rebuttal cases. No time limits are set on the length of the discovery periods_although, given the Panel's 180-day existence, the deadline will necessarily be short. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After the filing of written cases, either direct or rebuttal, any party may file objections. If an objection is apparent on the face of the written case, it must be raised or may thereafter be considered waived. Section 251.45(d) allows each party whose claim, petition, written case or direct evidence is the subject of an objection, either before the Librarian or a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel, to amend its filing to respond to the objection. The Librarian or the Panel may also request that such amended filing be made where necessary. All parties will be given a reasonable period of time to conduct discovery on the amended filing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

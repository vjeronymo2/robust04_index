			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / As They Say in Europe: Egbert Mulliner's torrent of tosh There is an air of fatigue in the reports from foreign correspondents in London these days. British political scandals do not match the stories back home. How can you get excited about a FFr4,000 bill at the Ritz hotel in Paris when your readers yawn over Dollars 4m bribery exposes? What interest is there in the complex, and possibly scandalous, marital arrangements of a former minister if actual ministers at home are in prison? Then there is the traditional British obsession with minutiae. Who else would care to unravel the details of the fax sent by The Guardian newspaper to the Ritz to obtain a copy of a ministerial bill, especially when there seems to have been no need for the fax in the first place? In France, it is so simple: a minister is alleged to have had his villa in St Tropez done up by a builder in search of public contracts. Everybody can understand that. In Italy, things are even more straightforward and larger sums are involved. Only the Germans match British tedium. Was a recommendation to buy certain supermarket trolley spare parts written on ministerial notepaper? But, however difficult the British political story is for the foreign correspondent, the crisis surrounding the royal family presents even more horrible problems. There is, even at this stage, the possibility that one's readers may have some passing interest in the affair. The Princess of Wales plays a major role in the popular press around the globe. Prince Charles gained similar fame by marrying her. The problem faced by the London correspondent reminds one of PG Wodehouse's story, Best Seller. It concerns a young man, Egbert Mulliner, whose work it is to interview lady novelists and review their overwrought and monotonous writings for a literary magazine. He is driven to the brink of madness by a particularly horrifying work called Parted Ways. A similar problem is posed by the waterfall of revelations of parted ways emanating from the royal house of Windsor. Books alternate, outlining the grim vortex of emotions into which the protagonists are plunged. Every Monday, readers back home seek more details. La Stampa obliges under a series of subject headings - 'A French marriage?' and 'The divorce' and 'Camilla' and so on. This treatment lends itself to word processor paste-ups and enables the correspondent to provide a reasonable account of latest developments without going mad. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung shares out the story between its London correspondents. Gina Thomas tackles the Charles angle while Bernhard Heimrich reports on the Diana phenomenon. Between them, they handle one story every two weeks, which is as much as flesh and blood can stand. Last month, Thomas gave a robust account of the prince's views as purveyed by author Jonathan Dimbleby under the headline: 'What happened to the stiff upper lip?' This week, Heimrich seemed vulnerable to Mulliner's syndrome. His story had as a subheading: 'Another creepy weekend for British readers.' There followed a Gothic introduction which pursued such matters as: Halloween and Guy Fawkes Night, fireworks concealing another noise that posed an even greater threat to a British institution even older than the Parliament threatened by Fawkes - the royal family. That background noise came from the printing presses of the Sunday Times, churning out pre-publication excerpts from yet another product of the Diana industry. This marital swamp only reinforces the bad name that the British have given to tacky, keyhole journalism. Those who wish to keep a lid on things point to Britain as an example of what happens if you do not. In France, the revelations about President Mitterrand's 'love child', Mazarine, would not have stirred up such a fuss had there not been the ghastly cross-Channel experience to point to. In France today, the toadying attitude towards those in power is justified by a reference to Britain - 'Do we really want to be like that?' Yet, there is enormous cause for concern: Mazarine has been supported by the state, which has employed dubious personalities to liaise between her and the presidency. This is a matter of public interest. In spite of that, one paper could write: 'It was the honour of our profession not to give itself up to voyeurism, not to scrutinise hidden lives through the keyhole.' Even in France, though, some argued that the matter had to be exposed because it was already well-known to a select corps of Paris journalists. The biggest selling daily, Ouest-France, replied: 'But doctors, lawyers, priests know a lot of things which others do not know: should they divulge them as well?' Because no trivial matter can be kept secret in Britain, the French argue that journalists should take a vow of silence. If the 'truth' becomes a torrent of tosh, the opponents of truth feel able to resort to any argument, no matter how fatuous, to support their cause.

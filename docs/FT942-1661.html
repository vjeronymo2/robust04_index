			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Technology: Global gallery for Irish art - Plans to use the Internet to display paintings Technology is an unlikely ally of art, but two private organisations in Ireland hope to change this. They aim to promote Irish art abroad by using digital technology to display paintings over the Internet, the international information network. Toppsi is a Dublin-based bulletin board system, which has its roots in providing information systems for social services. Its founder, Martin Maguire, wants to hold an international art exhibition over the Internet. It will be initially targeted to 15 EU capitals and extended to include Toronto, New York, and Los Angeles, featuring local artists from each city. Fifty paintings will be scanned in at each site, stored on a central server in Dublin, and then relayed over the Internet to art galleries and museums in each city. Each site will have a high-quality printer and prints will be sold for around Pounds 35 each. Internet users will later be able to dial into the server in Dublin and download images of the paintings. Maguire also plans to publish the exhibition on CD. Another Internet provider based in Galway on the west cost has already taken steps to bring Irish art to the rest of the world. Ireland On-line is running a pilot scheme for Kennys book shop and art gallery. Kennys is well known in academic circles as a provider of Irish-interest books. Its customers include US universities and libraries. Kennys is also famous among the artistic community for its exhibitions of Irish artists. Driven by the need to communicate with its US customers and a desire to promote its art exhibitions, Kennys will put a database of all its books on the Internet and offer a free service for people who want to go on-line and get a sneak preview of the next exhibition. The service provides biographies of the artists and examples of their work. One of the artists whose work is displayed on the system is Kenneth Webb, known for his watercolours and depictions of rural Ireland. 'In the early '60s and '70s I travelled a lot between Ireland, New York, Paris, London and even Africa, but now I am not interested in all that. I have my painting and my interests here so I think this is a great opportunity to display my paintings. The beauty is that this is a visual medium. I have never read anything that has done justice to my or anybody else's paintings, but with this people can see for themselves.' Webb believes there are further advantages in the concept of exhibiting paintings on an international network. 'International art has become very sterile; there is a sameness between paintings from almost anywhere in the world. It's made up of the sort of paintings that architects like. I see myself as more of an ethnic painter. I like to express the peculiarity of the landscape around me. This (Internet) will allow painters from anywhere in the world to be exhibited internationally.' Barry Flannigan, head of Ireland On-Line, sees a trade-off between the quality of the image exhibited and the cost of downloading that image. 'It's a balance really; most computer screens have a resolution of about 75 dots per inch but we provide 150 dots per inch and include about 250 colours, which is a long way off being good enough to print lithographically. It's just a taster, if the user likes the painting then they can buy it.' Maguire has approached the problem from a different perspective, mainly because as well as providing the images over the Internet, he plans to produce CDs of the paintings. 'The solution is so simple and already tried and tested. It's share ware. If people like the images then they can pay a licence fee to the artist.' Maguire has teamed up with the artist Paddy Graham, who says the potential of the Internet for artists is staggering. 'The question is whether technology will inhibit the intuitive process of an artist or simply expand it.'</p>

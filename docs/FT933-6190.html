			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / British Coal fails to find takers for four pits HOPES of saving four pits no longer required by British Coal finally ended yesterday when it emerged that an invitation to private-sector operators to mine them had produced no takers. The disclosure will disappoint the government which is already struggling to find a way of providing a future for another 30 mines still operated by British Coal. Further closures among the 30, which include 11 reprieved by the government in March, are considered inevitable by British Coal following a steeper-than-expected decline in the coal market. With a strong political reaction to future closures likely, ministers want the private sector to take over as many as possible of the 19 pits already declared surplus to requirements by British Coal. British Coal has been advertising the 19 pits in tranches of four and five. In the latest tranche - the third - private-sector companies were offered five pits. Just one, Trentham, near Stoke-on-Trent, was the subject of a bid that involves mining. The bidder's identity was not disclosed by British Coal yesterday, but it is thought to be Mr Malcolm Edwards, the corporation's former marketing director. Vane Tempest in County Durham, another of the five in the tranche, also attracted some bids. However, they involved proposed activities on the colliery surfaces. The other three pits in the third tranche, Grimethorpe and Houghton Main, in South Yorkshire, and Westoe, in Tyne and Wear, attracted no offers for the final stage of the process in which bidders had to provide a Pounds 50,000 bond. British Coal is likely to move quickly to seal the four pits which are no longer wanted as mines, although local union officials will have to be consulted. Together the four employed more than 3,500 miners when mining ceased. British Coal has now closed the bidding deadline for 14 of the 19 pits it no longer wants to mine. It has received 17 tenders in all for 10 of them but four pits have attracted no interest - the three disclosed yesterday together with Bolsover in Derbyshire. In addition three pits - Cotgrave and Silverhill, in Nottinghamshire, and Vane Tempest - are the subject of bids that involve use of surface assets only. Another five mines have still to go out to tender. These are Shirebrook in Nottinghamshire, Taff Merthyr in Glamorgan, Coventry near Coventry city, Parkside in Merseyside, and Sharlston in West Yorkshire. Coal analysts believe it is unlikely that mining will be resumed at more than six of 19 pits which have been closed by British Coal. British Coal yesterday closed its north-east headquarters in Sunderland. The office, where 45 people were employed, was considered unnecessary with just two working pits left in the region which once employed 150,000 miners at more than 100 pits. The corporation will administer its north-east operations from Nottingham.</p>

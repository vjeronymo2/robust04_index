			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sean Ryan, environment correspondent: "Diesel </F> `Kills 3,000 a Year'"]    [Text] The government's most senior adviser on air  pollution in cities will trigger an intense debate over the  safety of diesel vehicles tomorrow by claiming that their  exhausts kill 3,000 people a year, writes Sean Ryan, Environment  Correspondent.    Professor Roy Harrison, chairman of a panel of experts  advising ministers on urban air quality, will warn that minute  particles given off when diesel fuel is burned may be causing  heart and lung failure, strokes and cancer.    Harrison accused diesel manufacturers yesterday of "peddling  misinformation" about their vehicles, which have soared in  popularity after being marketed as environmentally friendly.  More than 340,000 diesel cars were sold last year.    "Anyone who is concerned about air quality should not buy  diesel cars," said Harrison.    His claims were condemned by motor industry executives as  "scientifically dangerous". But Harrison believes he has  evidence to justify tighter exhaust standards and tax changes to  discourage diesel sales.    Harrison, professor of environmental health at Birmingham  University, calculated an annual death toll following American  research into the dangers of PM 10s -- "particulate matter" 10  thousandths of a millimetre in diameter. Diesel vehicles are  thought to produce one-third of the particles circulating in  cities, and their exhaust is classified as a probable carcinogen.    A study published by the NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE  analysed the deaths of 8,111 adults in six American cities and  found "statistically significant and robust" associations with  air pollution. The report concluded that the death rate in the  most polluted city was 26 percent higher than in the least  polluted. The strongest link was PM 10s.    Harrison's concerns are shared by medical experts at the  Department of the Environment, whose ministers are becoming  increasingly critical of cars in cities. The government is  expected to announce cuts of &pound;1 billion in Britain's  road-building programme this week.    But motor manufacturers claimed Harrison's calculations were  misleading. Lucas, Britain's sole manufacturer of diesel  injection systems, said that while diesel exhaust probably  caused cancer, the risk was "vanishingly small".    The makers of diesel cars say they are less damaging to the  environment than petrol models because they emit lower levels of  several polluting gases and contain less benzene, a known  carcinogen linked with leukaemia.    Harrison, who disputes most of the manufacturers' claims,  says any technological improvements could be cancelled out by  higher sales of diesel cars.    COPYRIGHT: TIMES NEWSPAPERS LIMITED, 1994</p>

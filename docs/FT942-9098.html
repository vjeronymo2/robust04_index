			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / American Express tests new card American Express, the US-based financial services company, is test-marketing a credit card in the UK aimed at individuals who do not have an American Express charge card but who fit the cardholder profile, Norma Cohen writes. The move comes at a time of increasing competition in the credit card market with several providers launching products which undercut traditional bank providers on both interest rates and annual charges. American Express has been test-marketing a similar credit card product in the US and Canada for several months and is likely to launch it in North America first. American Express is considering a range of annual fees and interest charges which will be lower than those of bank-sponsored cards but higher than those of the most competitive products on the market. The company said that, in spite of the surge of new entrants to the credit card business, 'we think we can compete in our market'.</p>

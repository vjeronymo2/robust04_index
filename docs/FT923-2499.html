			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Guernsey managed funds up TOTAL FUNDS under management in Guernsey rose 45 per cent last year to a record Pounds 6.4bn by the year-end, according to the Guernsey Financial Services Commission annual report. It notes a continuing trend towards funds for institutions and high-net-worth individuals. The commission says the rise has been caused by 'an accelerating trend of consolidation' with several small funds merging or winding up and being replaced by schemes that have attracted substantial investment. Altogether, 20 licences were granted to institutions by the commission under the Protection of Investors Law and licences were surrendered by 12 during the year. Total licensees at the end of last year stood at 141, the report says. Fifty-nine of the 221 Guernsey managed funds are quoted on international stock markets. Guernsey's insurance industry also showed marked expansion during the year. There was little growth in the early part of the year, and increased competition from other centres is blamed. A change in tax laws for captive insurance companies in July last year resulted in 17 new captives registering by the end of the year, bringing the total of offshore insurance companies in Guernsey to 204. A captive is a wholly owned subsidiary that insures some or all of the risks of its parent or can write third-party insurance, mainly reinsurance. The tax change restored to captives a three-option taxation system - either no tax, a sliding scale on investment income from shareholders' equity, or a flat rate of 20 per cent. Bank deposits in the island rose 5 per cent to Pounds 16.25bn. The report says all but two banks attained the risk: asset ratio of 10 per cent by the end of 1991. The ratio is set by the commission and is 2 percentage points higher than that of the Basle committee of bankers which sets international banking standards. In the first six months of this year the amount of funds under management has hardly changed. But there was a further increase in bank deposits of Pounds 1.6bn, nearly a 10 per cent rise.

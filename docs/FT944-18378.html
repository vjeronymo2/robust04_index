			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Just a pinch of ethics Mr Gordon Brown did his best to reach the Labour party's endogenous zone yesterday. He did not quite manage that inherently improbable feat. The shadow chancellor tried, but to little avail. He sensibly avoided the technical terminology, to do with growth theory, that baffled some of us when he delivered his now celebrated lecture to a conference on the economy last week. He was aware that this time he was addressing his party's annual conference, and tailored his remarks accordingly. 'Let the nurses,' he proclaimed, 'nurse.' Warming to his theme, he added, 'Let the teachers teach.' Encouraged by the rising applause he went on, 'Let the doctors care.' That is the trouble with the English language. It catches you out. 'Let the doctors doct', might have carried greater resonance, but the word 'doct', unlike endogenous, has not yet been coined. Mr Brown will, I trust, forgive the above little tease. It was irresistible. He was, however, making a serious point, namely that the Conservatives' creation of quangos and 'phoney markets' has led to 'administrative chaos and paper-pushing'. Not every reader will agree with this, but I do. The health service reforms may be fine in theory, but they have yet to prove themselves in practice. Ditto the opted-out schools. The shadow chancellor also gave populist expression to the 'new Labour' view of how to manage the market economy, something he has spent much energy and time on since April 1992. He did not flinch from the awkward passages, such as: 'It is by liberating people's potential that we build the dynamic market economy we need.' He included several jokes of his own, most of them about Lord Jeffrey Archer. Alas, political life is not conducted according to the rules of fairness. Mr Brown's Herculean effort was insufficiently rewarded. The assembly did not rise to its feet. There was no standing ovation. Tears were not wiped from the eyes of the faithful. How unjust] The shadow chancellor could not have worked harder. He is a long-practised conference tub-thumper, and he did his best. What we need to understand is why the applause, while substantial, was no more than adequate to the occasion. A cold start on a Monday morning did not help, but the explanation runs deeper than that. It is, frankly, that the modernised Labour message has not yet been expressed in terms that quicken the heart-beat. The blood does not course more rapidly through the veins on hearing it. Well, mine may but I have peculiar, commentator's, veins, veins responsive to words like 'communitarian' and, on good days, even to phrases like 'industrial regeneration'. The pulse rate of the Labour party may accelerate when the new leader sits down this afternoon, but, absent a tour de force by Mr Tony Blair, it has to be said that for most delegates this is the most soothing, most gentle, least contentious of conferences. Never mind the posturing of some of the trade union leaders. They are old gentlemen in mid-life crisis, easily slapped down. In spite of them you have to characterise the first day of this conference as Dullsville, squared. Reinventing the Left*, published yesterday, tells us why, although it does not set out to do so. It is a collection of serious essays, edited by David Miliband, head of policy in Mr Blair's office. As Mr Miliband writes in his introduction, none of the authors believes in revolution, but all espouse social and economic reform. This may be sensible philosophy, but it is milk-and-water politics. Old socialism, with its Marxist infusion and its martyrs' blood, is now an anachronism. When in vogue it was, if nothing else, rousing. You were angry with it, or angered by it, as the delegates were by Mr Arthur Scargill's ranting yesterday. The free market and libertarian thinking that rose to such ascendancy during the 1980s releases similar, countervailing, passions. These are, however, cooler, more querulous, times. Most voters would agree that the unregulated market has its failures, and many think that the government ought to do something about that. You need not put your knitting down to make such an observation. It sums up today's mainstream thinking. Mr Miliband puts it thus: 'The Left retains its distinctive place in politics today not because of its utopian vision of the future, but by virtue, first, of its critique of the present, in other words its analysis of advanced industrial societies, and second its ambition progressively to achieve change.' Where does that take us? 'While there is an immediate argument within politics about the sorts of capitalist society - regulated and humanised, or deregulated and Hobbesian - we want to live in, there remain ambitions fundamentally to realign the economic and social order,' says Mr Miliband. I suspect that the most radical agenda that Labour will find itself able to offer includes mildly progressive taxation plus the restoration of civic democracy. The latter is an enterprise to which many thinking Conservatives are attracted. The recipe can only be brought alive by adding a pinch of ethics. If people trouble themselves about the effect of markets alone it is because they know that the market is an abstract. It has no conscience. Mr Miliband quotes several writers to the effect that 'unfettered market rule will corrode precisely the values and institutions on which the social order rests'. This does not mean Tories, whether Thatcherite or one-nation, are amoral; they are patently not that. It does mean there is a longing for an ethical underpinning, felt on all sides of the political spectrum. Religion may attract some; humanist ethics will suffice for the rest of the electorate. Mr Blair neither hides nor flaunts his Christianity, but its existence enables him to speak convincingly of values and principles. His reformist, centrist, prescriptions for the political economy may inevitably lack blood-and-guts excitement, but if he can touch the ethical sensibilities of the party faithful, and by extension the rest of us, he may yet hear prolonged cheering; if he convinces the troops that, blow the principles what he offers is victory, there will be an extended stamping of feet, yells and whistles. *Polity Press/Institute for Public Policy Research, 108 Cowley Road, Oxford OX4 1JF</p>

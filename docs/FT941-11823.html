			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Bidders step up Paramount offers Viacom and QVC Network, the protagonists in a Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.60bn) takeover battle for Paramount Communications, last night increased their bids for the US film and publishing group in a photo-finish finale to the five-month-long contest. The complex new offers were not easily comparable, but Viacom's bid was stronger in several important respects - including its cash element. Traders were last night scrambling to put firm values on the two bids, which appeared to be very close. The new offers came just minutes before a 5pm New York time deadline set by the Paramount board for final offers. Shareholders will have until February 14 to consider the offers while the market's initial verdict will be delivered today in the share prices of the two bidders. Viacom left unchanged its previous offer of Dollars 107 a share in cash for 50.1 per cent of the stock while QVC, headed by Mr Barry Diller, a prominent film industry figure, raised the cash element of its bid from Dollars 92 a share to Dollars 104 - still Dollars 3 a share below Viacom. Both companies changed elements of their so-called second step merger - the package of securities they are offering for the remaining 49.9 per cent of Paramount's stock. Viacom increased the value of its offer by several dollars in three ways: It changed the right to receive Dollars 15.20 of convertible preference stock yielding 5 per cent to Dollars 17.50 of 8 per cent debentures; it added 0.3 of a five year warrant to buy Viacom B stock at Dollars 70 a share; and it improved the terms of its so-called contingent value rights (CVR) - an element of its offer which has been popular with traders and which QVC lacks. Under the CVR, Viacom guarantees to make up to shareholders the amount its B shares trade below Dollars 48 in the first year after the takeover, up to a maximum of Dollars 12. Previously, it had a floor of Dollars 10. QVC, by contrast, has increased the cash portion of its bid by Dollars 750m by decreasing the value of its second-step offer. Paramount shareholders would now get 1.24 a share of QVC stock, down from 1.43, and .2386 of preferred stock, down from .32. QVC said that in addition to increasing the cash portion of its bid, these changes would reduce pressure on its publicly traded stock by reducing the number of shares in its second step deal by 13.6 per cent.</p>

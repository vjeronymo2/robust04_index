			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Maxwell used MCC funds for large French property investment MR ROBERT Maxwell used money from his main public company, Maxwell Communication Corporation, three years ago to support his political and commercial ambitions in France, according to MCC's auditors. This is the first time Mr Maxwell's vigorous attempts to win influence with the French government in the late 1980s have been linked to MCC and to secretive Liechtenstein trusts. It emerged yesterday that MCC had invested heavily in 1988 in La Defense, the prestigious business development west of Paris. MCC's initial investment of Pounds 5m to Pounds 10m was through a joint venture called SAGA in which MCC held 62 per cent and Caisse des Depots, the French state financial institution, the balance. SAGA agreed to invest in the ground floor and basement of the Grande Arche, a striking white marble cube, which is the focal point of the district. There is no suggestion the MCC deal is connected with the recent financial investigation into some of La Defense's backers. Mr Christian Pellerin, a property developer who managed the constructions around the arch, was charged two weeks ago with aiding and abetting financial irregularities. Yesterday he denied the charges. He has applied to have them annulled. It is now clear that MCC sold its stake in SAGA to Hesto Stiftung, a Liechtenstein foundation. Board directors of MCC and its lawyers, gave written assurances to Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte that Hesto was independent of Mr Robert Maxwell, the auditors said yesterday. The transactions - Pounds 22m in 1990 and Pounds 23m in 1991 - were booked as profit by MCC, but payment was deferred for several years. There is no suggestion this was not a normal commercial deal, but it is not detailed in the accounts. According to Coopers, Hesto is included in MCC's debtors in the audited accounts for those periods. All but Pounds 1m to Pounds 3m of the Pounds 45m had been repaid by June 1991. However MCC is still owed Pounds 25m-Pounds 30m by Corry Stiftung, a second Liechtenstein foundation, used for many of MCC's overseas transactions.</p>

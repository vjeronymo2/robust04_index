			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Nahit Mentese by Reha </F> Muhtar on the "Firing Line" program; place and date not given --  recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Muhtar] What does Turkish  intelligence know at the moment concerning the actions and  whereabouts of Apo [Abdullah Ocalan]?    [Mentese] According to our information, Apo is currently in  Syria. Our intelligence indicates that he is going and coming  in various places in Syria. The Syrian authorities, in turn,  claim the opposite. They say that Apo is not in Syria.  According to our intelligence reports, Apo is currently in  Syria.    [Muhtar] Did the Syrian interior minister state that the PKK  [Workers Party of Kurdistan] is a terrorist organization?    [Mentese] Naturally, they also accept this. We say he is  there, and they say no. They invited me to visit Syria. I  wanted our working groups to meet first. They sent their  working groups twice. The second delegation returned a few days  ago and our working group went to Syria. I have not met with  them yet; I believe they only returned yesterday. Now, the  Foreign Ministry wants me to go. I think that I will visit  Syria during this month.    [Muhtar] Press reports note that when you are in Syria you  will be shown the al-Biqa' Valley [as heard] and you will be  allowed to tour the area. Is this correct?    [Mentese] I do not know. Syria, of course, has sovereignty  within its borders.    [Muhtar] What are your demands?    [Mentese] My demands will be determined in line with the  conditions. I do not want to say anything at the moment. I may  or may not go to the area, but our main goal is to prevent this  leadership from taking refuge in Syria. If we are neighbors and  friends with Syria and we want to cooperate and develop our  economic, social, and cultural relations with it, then it is our  right to demand that this leadership cadre not be harbored in  Syria.    [Muhtar] It is a widely held opinion that the leadership  cadres of a terrorist organization are very important and that  terrorist organizations will collapse if these cadres are  eliminated. Do you share this view?    [Mentese] Leadership cadres are naturally important, as in  every field. If the leaders are weakened or destroyed, then the  terrorist organization tends to disperse. There may be  resistance in places, but [word indistinct] will happen.    [Muhtar] Within this context, does the government strategy  for 1994 include crushing the leadership cadres of the PKK?    [Mentese] Naturally; from all aspects. It is our state's  aim to crush this terrorist organization, which is disturbing  Turkey and our people.    [Muhtar] How will this be achieved?    [Mentese] As you can see, our security forces are  continuously conducting operations. Our intelligence  organizations are working and we are assessing this information.  The state has various intelligence organizations and we are  fighting the terrorist organization in line with the information  supplied by these sources.    [Muhtar] In the past, there was an organization named  Black September and Israel eliminated its leaders. Later,  Israel was described as a terrorist country. Would Turkey  consider undertaking such an operation abroad against the  leadership cadres of the PKK?    [Mentese] This would be possible only through cooperation.  If that country would allow it, we would naturally go there.  If they say come because we are unable to deal with this, then  we would go immediately.    [Muhtar] Has Syria not accepted yet that Apo has been in  Syria? Turkish journalists met with him.    [Mentese] No, they do not accept it. They say that they do  not know. We do tell them about journalists' meetings with him.    [Muhtar] He even held a news conference. He has a residence  in Damascus. What is the reaction to all this?    [Mentese] They do not say much. They ask us to come and see.    [Muhtar] Is there any question of launching an operation  into Syria?    [Mentese] Such an operation can only be conducted in  cooperation with Syria.    [Muhtar] Have they submitted such a request?    [Mentese] They may. We may reach that point at the end of  talks. We do not want to obtain results by fighting with our  neighbors.    [Muhtar] Is this possible in the near future?    [Mentese] Yes, it is possible. Things could suddenly  develop.    [Muhtar] When we ask you questions, you say that this matter  will be resolved. Do you know something that we do not?    [Mentese] I said this is possible. We asked Syrian  authorities to expel, extradite, or punish him. We told them  that he is a bandit and he orders people killed.    [Muhtar] Does Syria comply with this approach?    [Mentese] I do not know. There is a certain amount of  temperance. I believe Syria, too, will say yes at some point.    [Muhtar] Is there anything you have failed to tell us with  regard to contacts with Syria?    [Mentese] No. I told you everything. Our aim is to  cooperate with them on these issues, on narcotics.    [Muhtar] I mean with regard to the Syrians' attitude?    [Mentese] We find their attitude warm and sincere. I hope  and estimate that we will be able to cooperate soon.    [Muhtar] Is this possible in the next few months?    [Mentese] Yes, it is possible. Our visits are not for  tourism purposes. I will go there to obtain results, not for  tourism. We will appeal to their common sense and try to obtain  results. We want to conclude this matter by spring.    [Muhtar] Do you mean the leaders as well?    [Mentese] Yes. We want to shatter them totally. [passage  omitted]</p>

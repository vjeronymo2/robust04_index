			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Survey of Chicago - A Centre For Finance and Industry (5): The pro-business mayor 'could be there for life' - Politics: The force of the Daley mantle MAYOR Richard M. Daley sits in his shirtsleeves, chomping on a fat cigar. But the cigar is unlit, in what seems to be one of many concessions to new social views and values by a man who was raised in the old school of big-city politics. Mayor Daley is the son of the legendary Mayor Richard J. Daley, who ruled rather than governed the city for two decades. Mayor Daley the elder, who died in 1976, was the last boss of a big city Democratic party political machine. Although the party remains dominant in Chicago politics, 'Richie', as the current mayor is widely known, now governs with the help of only a shadow of that powerful machine. But the inheritance of the weighty Daley mantle gives him unusual force. He was re-elected last year with a solid majority, lending credence to the notion, voiced when he was first elected to office, that, if he wanted to, he could be mayor for life. 'The feeling is that he's going to be here for a while,' said Mr Ed Noha, chairman of the big Chicago-based CNA Insurance Companies and also recently named chairman of the Chicago Economic Development Commission, a mixed public and private group to promote the city's economy. 'Businessmen trust the mayor,' added Mr Noha. Mr Daley, like his father, holds a pro-business, big-project vision of the city. The elder Daley was responsible for building O'Hare airport, one of the world's busiest, and a web of crucial highways. Today, the mayor is overseeing a near-Dollars 1bn expansion of McCormick Place, already the largest permanent exhibition space in the country, to attract greater convention and trade show business. He will also inaugurate a new international terminal at O'Hare next summer. And, having failed to win the Illinois legislature's approval for a third Dollars 10bn international airport in the city, he is undertaking improvements at O'Hare and Midway, the city's other major airport. Although he is also working on a fistful of other projects, his most controversial proposal is for a privately financed Dollars 2bn casino complex which also requires legislative approval (see page 4 of this survey). To win that approval, Mr Daley is throwing all his political weight into the battle. The project promises some Dollars 500m a year in tax revenues and 35,000 jobs. While all his big-ticket projects promise to leave a legacy at least as large as his father's, Mr Daley cannot count on the same kind of federal and state largess. Such assistance has shrunk markedly in recent years. Yet he hopes that the Clinton administration will follow through on campaign promises to help rebuild and improve America's infrastructure. However, all federal monies go to the states first, and the states then distribute them to cities and towns. This leaves Mr Daley to wrangle for the city's share with the state, whose governor, Mr Jim Edgar, is a Republican. While it seemed that Mr Daley and Mr Edgar were heading earlier this year for a political partnership of sorts, that broke down with the defeat of the mayor's third-airport proposal at the hands of Illinois Senate Republicans. Mr Edgar had favoured the site chosen by the mayor, but he could not, or would not, control his Senate co-partisans. New tension in the Daley-Edgar relationship has arisen over the casino project, which the governor opposes. Mr Daley is pressing hard for the investment to be approved in the current special session of the legislature. If he loses, he is likely to shelve it, as he did with the third-airport proposal. Although the mayor could look terribly empty handed, having lost the political battles for two of his most important public projects, he is expected to denounce the Illinois Republicans for wrecking the possibilities for tens of thousands of new jobs. Some believe that Mr Daley is, in fact, paving his way for a governorship bid in 1994, though he denies it. 'I was in Springfield eight years (as a state senator),' he said. 'No, I have no interest.' If that is true, the Daley dynasty may be set to last until Richie tires of it. 'You can continue to be mayor if you really want it in your heart and mind,' he said. And, though his public approval dipped after several infrastructural disasters during the past year (like the downtown flood in ageing freight tunnels), it seems he retains enough popularity to keep his spirits up. But he will not go unchallenged. Mr Daley represents the old white, Irish-American leadership of South Chicago and, unlike in his father's day, the city is now nearly 60 per cent black and Hispanic. The last mayor elected before him was Mr Harold Washington, a charismatic black politician who died suddenly during his second term. Had Mr Washington lived, he would probably still be mayor. The black political analyst, Mr Grayson Mitchell, who was an aide to Mr Washington, says Mr Daley 'walks on eggshells' to avoid doing anything that will ignite black political anger. Indeed, Mr Daley is careful, tipping his hat to minorities with blanket statements, such as: 'You have to break down racial, religious and ethnic barriers.' But according to Mr Mitchell, who also leads a successful marketing firm, minority feelings are seething under the surface, because 'we've gone back to the social apartheid system of before'. Curiously, it may not take a black or minority candidate to unseat Mr Daley, according Mr Bruce DuMont, a nationally syndicated political commentator. If he sets the black community against him, its votes could easily go to, say, Mr Jack O'Malley, the Cook County prosecutor and a Republican who has established a reputation for competence and honesty. Mr O'Malley was re-elected earlier this month to a second term with a significant portion of black votes. Chicago has always been a heavily segregated city, and even though the edges have softened on that segregation today, it is still starkly apparent. Thus, Mr Daley, even if he continues to want the mayorlty in his heart and mind, faces a battle with demography and, some would say, history.</p>

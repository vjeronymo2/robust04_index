			<p>BFN     [Text] Banja Luka, 20 Apr (TANJUG) -- A woman was injured  in Brcko today when the regular army of the Republic of Croatia  launched an attack from multiple rocket-launchers, the  information service of the 1st Krajina Corps of the republic of  Srpska army said in Banja Luka this evening. This was the  second multiple rocket-launcher attack today and it was carried  out at about 1600. Altogether six rockets were fired from  positions on the left bank of the Sava river, i.e. from the  territory of the Republic of Croatia, and both attacks were  launched on civilian targets. In addition to multiple  rocket-launcher attacks, Croatian artillery fired 16 shells on  the [Bosnia] Serb villages of Krepsic and Loncari from positions  near Zupanja and Bosnjaci, also from the territory of the  Republic of Croatia. Nobody was wounded in the attack but  considerable material damage was caused.    Republic of Srpska army units were forced to respond to the  attacks.    All this confirms assumptions that an intensification of  attacks can be expected, which is aimed at severing the corridor  which links the republic of Serb Krajina and the republic of  Srpska with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>

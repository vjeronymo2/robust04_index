			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- German observers staying in Turkey during  the Nevruz Kurdish new year celebrations were severely  maltreated by Turkish security forces. Several spokespersons of  human rights groups and pro-Kurdish organizations said in Bonn  on Wednesday [30 March] that Germans attending the Nevruz  celebrations and municipal elections were harassed, arrested  temporarily, interrogated for hours, and beaten up. A total of  250 Germans had travelled to Kurdish areas.    Joerg Hilbert from Braunschweig, who wanted to go near Mt.  Ararat with 15 people from Lower Saxony and Thuringia, spoke of  "punches in the face and kicks to the kidneys." In spite of  obstructions, the group repeatedly tried to reach their  destination, for which they were "kicked, spat at, and beaten  up" by security forces. A female interpreter was slapped in the  face. A member of the group was kicked down stairs at a police  station.    Hilbert and Franciscan monk Juergen Neitzert reported a  "massive military presence." They took photographs of German  arms being used against Kurds; among others they spoke of tanks  from the former GDR National People's Army (BTR-60, BTR-80).  Neitzert said that members of the German Embassy in Ankara knew  about the use of FRG arms. The "Christian Organizations Against  Arms Exports" want to make enquiries with the Foreign Ministry  in this context. The spokespersons called upon the government  not to deport Kurds from Germany to Turkey, as they face  torture, displacement, and death.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Plutonium reactor can reopen The French nuclear safety authority yesterday approved the restarting of the accident-prone Superphenix fast breeder reactor, after three years of safety repairs and inquiries. The final decision lies with the government, and ministers are not expected to pronounce for several months. Conceived in the 1970s as a panacea for energy shortages and nuclear waste, the reactor was designed to take plutonium byproduct from ordinary reactors and to produce more fuel than it consumed. But instead the Superphenix, the only full size 1,200MW fast breeder in the world, has become a costly white elephant. Completed in 1986 near Lyon at a cost of FFr29bn (Dollars 4.96bn), it has run at full power for only 174 days.</p>

			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian wool industry hopes for Russian deals THE AUSTRALIAN wool industry should soon be able to announce a breakthrough in its attempts to restart the wool trade with Russia, Mr Mac Drysdale, chairman of the Australian Wool Corporation, said yesterday, reports Reuter from Sydney. He told a news conference that negotiations over some projects aimed at lifting wool demand in Russia, as well as in Europe and Asia, should be finalised in the next few months. 'I think there will be a breakthrough in the Russian (market) . . . in the next few months,' he said. 'Whether it comes in the form of equity in Russian mills or whether it comes from some other enterprise . . . remains to be seen.' There has been speculation that Australia could supply wool to Russia in return for equity in processing mills. Mr Drysdale said the Australian Wool Realisation Commission, which is responsible for reducing the 3.96m-bale stockpile and the ADollars 2.28bn (Pounds 1bn) debt, had been involved in negotiations over projects to boost wool demand. Some negotiations had been taking place for years. 'Some of the projects . . . will be finalised in the next few months,' he said. Options to restart trade with Russia could include barter deals and joint ventures, the AWC chairman said. 'As well as getting wool into (the former Soviet Union) we have to make sure the wool is consumed there.' Mr Drysdale said Australia's unofficial wool stockpile, resulting from farmers delaying selling wool in the hope that prices will pick up, could be as high as 180,000 bales.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Palestinian leader Faysal al-Husayni says  preparations are underway for the elections in the territories.  He told reporter Jack Katzenell the proportional system will be  used to give the opposition parties fair representation.    [Begin recording] [Al-Husayni] I believe that elections will  be on 15 October.    [Katzenell] Do you know if the Palestinian opposition  parties have agreed to take part in the elections?    [Al-Husayni] We hope that they will, especially if they will  have a list, and we hope that everyone will be there, even if  they will be with a small percentage or a bigger percentage, he  will be represented there. This is what we are aiming at. [end  recording]</p>

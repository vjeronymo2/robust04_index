			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL PREVIEW '89;  </P> <P> SUNNY HILLS OCCUPIES FREEWAY'S FAST LANE  </P> <P> Chris Burton, Fullerton High School's basketball coach, insists he was only  joking when he listed the top contenders for the Freeway League championship as  Sunny Hills, Fullerton and Sunny Hills' junior varsity team.  </P> <P> "At least I hope so," Burton said.  </P> <P> Seriously, Sunny Hills is the overwhelming favorite to win its third straight  league title with a talented cast of players that probably will dominate the  league again in 1990-91.  </P> <P> Sunny Hills has averaged 17 victories a season the past three years, and  despite having only two seniors on its roster, should hit the mark again this  season.  </P> <P> "They're going to be the dominant team," La Habra Coach Frank McCarroll said.  "The rest of us should have fun fighting it out for second place."  </P> <P> As usual, Sunny Hills figures to start slowly, with six key players still  competing on its championship football team.  </P> <P> "I had five players for practice this week, so we worked with the JVs," said  Steve White, Sunny Hills' coach. "I'm used to missing players because of the  football playoffs, but I've never had just five."  </P> <P> Brett Mitchelson, the only returning starter who isn't playing football, missed  practice all week with a pulled thigh muscle. Mitchelson, a 6-foot-7 center,  averaged 8.2 points and seven rebounds per game as a sophomore.  </P> <P> Sunny Hills will start four juniors and a sophomore. White is pointing toward  next season, when he anticipates a team similar to his 1987-88 squad that  finished 22-4.  </P> <P> "The league is probably the weakest overall in a long time," White said. "This  is a great year for me to be starting four juniors and a sophomore."  </P> <P> White, who begins his 14th season with a 193-147 record, is the dean of the  league's coaches. But another veteran, Bill Morris of Troy, returns to coaching  after a six-year absence.  </P> <P> Morris led Troy to the postseason playoffs nine times in his 12 seasons before  resigning in 1983. Morris' disciplined style of mistake-free basketball should  be worth an additional three or four victories.  </P> <P> Fullerton guard Rene Arias, who hit 62% of his three-point field goal attempts  as a junior, is the league's top returning player.  </P> <P> A look at the teams:  </P> <P> BUENA PARK -- Coach Ed Matillo had a long rookie season, winning only one game  with an all-underclassman team. Richard Harvey, a 6-4 forward, was one of the  few bright spots, averaging 10.2 points and 7.5 rebounds to earn all-league  honors.  </P> <P> Matillo will have another young team (two seniors), but he should get some help  from three players off a championship freshman team that was undefeated in  league play. Center Charles White is the best of the newcomers.  </P> <P> Buena Park also should improve with the addition of 6-3 guard Ray Lainer, a  transfer from Southern High in Baltimore.  </P> <P> "We have better athletes, better scoring potential and more size and speed,"  Matillo said. "We'll be better than last year, but we're still poor  offensively. This team can win if we can come together and improve."  </P> <P> Matillo handicaps the league race as follows: 1) Sunny Hills with the best  athletes; 2) Troy with the best chemistry; 3) Fullerton with the toughest  players; 4) La Habra with good size.  </P> <P> FULLERTON -- Two returning starters, a potential starter who was injured most  of the season and the addition of the school's best athlete should make  Fullerton a formidable team. Rene Arias, a deadly outside shooter, starts his  third season.  </P> <P> Joining Arias in the backcourt is returner Chris Rubal, who averaged five  steals per game last year. Greg Bach, a 6-2 forward, would have started last  season but was injured most of the year.  </P> <P> John Bailey, the school's best athlete, will join the team after skipping  basketball the past two seasons. Bailey was the football team's leading scorer  the past two seasons and Burton is anticipating a big year from Bailey despite  the layoff.  </P> <P> Among the top newcomers are Illinois transfer John Hill and junior Craig Olson,  who was cut his freshman year but averaged 16 points per game for the junior  varsity last season.  </P> <P> "We have a lot of question marks to be answered," Burton said. "I have a player  who missed most of last year, a transfer, one who hasn't played since his  freshman year and another who was cut his freshman year.  </P> <P> "We open on the road at Los Alamitos and Ocean View and then go to Trabuco  Hills' tournament, so don't expect us to start quickly," Burton said.  </P> <P> LA HABRA -- Former Hacienda Heights Wilson assistant Frank McCarroll led La  Habra to a playoff berth in his first season, but all five starters have  graduated.  </P> <P> James Clegg, a 6-3 guard, and Mark Zehrung, a 6-6 center, were part-time  starters who made key contributions. Clegg begins his third varsity season and  averaged 11.5 points per game last season. Zehrung averaged five points and six  rebounds per game.  </P> <P> "We will be young and not very physical," McCarroll said. "Our strength is our  outside shooting, but we lack varsity experience."  </P> <P> Juniors Erik McFrazier and Ryan Kaneko and sophomores Josh Marshall and Scott  Seminoff are the team's top newcomers.  </P> <P> SONORA -- The Raiders have won only nine games in each of the past two seasons  and all-league center Matt Rechtenwald has graduated.  </P> <P> The top returning player is forward Greg Farlow, a 6-2, 140-pound senior.  Farlow averaged nine points and six rebounds per game as a junior.  </P> <P> Forward Scott Oxyguard, a transfer from Sunny Hills, should start. Oxyguard  played for Sunny Hills' junior varsity team but decided to transfer because his  playing prospects weren't promising, according to Sunny Hills Coach Steve  White.  </P> <P> SUNNY HILLS -- Youth was served last year when Brett Mitchelson and David  Ragsdale when started as sophomores for the co-champions, who tied for first  place with Fullerton. Mitchelson will be the league's best big man.  </P> <P> But the player who has White most excited is sophomore guard Terry Mann. Mann  is the son of former Gerry Mann, who was on Pete Newell's NCAA championship  California team in 1959.  </P> <P> "The kid is really something," White said. "He's a 4.5 honor student who took  two of his senior classes last summer to get them out of the way." Asked if  Mann was planning on graduating after his junior year, White said, "He better  not, or I'll kill him."  </P> <P> Mitchelson impressed college scouts with his play in the Slam-n-Jam league last  spring. "Brett's future will be determined on how much he grows on and off the  court," White said.  </P> <P> White thinks his team's biggest challenger will be Fullerton, with good reason.  </P> <P> "They're awfully tough in their gym," he said. "I don't think I've won over  there in the past five years."  </P> <P> TROY -- Point guard Mike Abbott and forward Richard Wesley are returning for  their senior seasons, but Troy figures to have problems measuring up to taller  teams.  </P> <P> Center Don Ploghaus is the tallest starter at only 6-3, and Coach Bill Morris  admits the Warriors' play inside is sometimes questionable. Still, the veteran  coach is optimistic.  </P> <P> "We should be very competitive and hopefully challenge Sunny Hills and  Fullerton for the league title," he said. "We have some good quickness and some  perimeter players."  </P> <P> Among the top newcomers are Eldon Davis, a key player on Troy's football team,  and Josh Bray, a transfer from La Habra.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FREEWAY LEAGUE  </P> <P> 1988-89 Overall, League Records in Parenthesis  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.65IN:3.98IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> SCHOOL  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> '89-'90 COMMENT  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Fullerton (17-7, 9-1)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Rene Arias among the  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> county's top shooters  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Sunny Hills (17-8, 9-1)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Lancers will dominate with  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> size, speed and skill  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> La Habra (13-12, 6-4)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Inexperience and lack  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> of quickness could hurt  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Sonora (9-14, 4-6)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Greg Farlow among  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> the league's top players  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Troy (7-15, 2-8)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Coach Bill Morris'  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> return is a big plus  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Buena Park (1-18, 0-10)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Only two seniors on the  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> squad the past two years  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE></p>

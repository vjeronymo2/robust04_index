			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PANEL REJECTS SENIOR HOUSING IN BARTON HILL  </P> <P> In a crucial decision that is likely to kill a controversial residential  development, the Los Angeles City Council's Planning and Environment Committee  Tuesday turned down a condominium and senior-citizen housing complex that had  been proposed for the Barton Hill area of San Pedro.  </P> <P> Proponents of the plan, which called for 100 condominiums and 68 rental units  in which occupancy would be restricted to low- and moderate-income senior  citizens, argued that it would provide much-needed housing for seniors.  </P> <P> But the proposed development generated widespread criticism in San Pedro among  residents who said its site -- too far from churches and the downtown business  district and too close to busy Harbor Boulevard and the on-ramp to the Vincent  Thomas Bridge -- is no place for senior citizens to live.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Just Like a Prison'  </P> <P> "It's a terrible location," resident Tony Marino told the committee. "If you'd  see it yourself, you'd see it is just like a prison they're building there for  seniors. . . . You're making a prison for them."  </P> <P> Marino and about two dozen other opponents, many of them seniors and low-income  residents of the Barton Hill area, made the 25-mile trip to downtown Los  Angeles for Tuesday's hearing.  </P> <P> There they learned a basic lesson of city government: that the council member  who represents a district usually gets his wish. And they found out that in the  15th Council District, Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores usually does what she  believes the majority of her constituents want.  </P> <P> A Flores aide, citing the widespread opposition, asked the committee to reject  the project at 515 Beacon St.  </P> <P> Upon hearing that, Councilman Michael Woo said: "In deference to the  councilwoman of the district, I will make a motion to oppose this project." His  motion passed unanimously when Councilman Hal Bernson seconded it and voted in  favor. The third committee member, Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, did not attend  the meeting.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Only Chance for Survival  </P> <P> The proposal's only chance for survival at this point is if the City Council  overturns the committee's decision. Both sides, however, agree that is  unlikely.  </P> <P> In casting their votes, Woo and Bernson said they hoped developers George and  Michael Tumanjan of Torrance would propose the project for another site in San  Pedro. But that was no comfort to the developers, who say they do not know what  they will do with the three-acre Barton Hill site, at Beacon and  OFarrellstreets, which they bought for $3.3 million in 1987.  </P> <P> The site is zoned for manufacturing; the developers had requested it be rezoned  for medium-density residential development. Douglas Ring, a lawyer for the  Tumanjans, said there is already vacant manufacturing space in the area and the  market does not call for more to be built.  </P> <P> "I think it's terribly unfortunate," Ring said of the committee's vote. "I  think the seniors just lost."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Flores Is Praised  </P> <P> Countered Howard Uller, executive director of Toberman Settlement House and a  leader of the opposition: "I think that Mrs. Flores showed her willingness to  listen to her constituents and I think she's to be commended for that. It just  reinforces my belief in democracy."  </P> <P> Uller and other community leaders, including the president of the San Pedro  Peninsula Homeowners Coalition, had opposed the project on various grounds. In  addition to saying the location is bad for senior citizens, they said the  proposed rezoning would take away manufacturing space in a community that needs  jobs, and that the condominium development might gentrify the Barton Hill  neighborhood, squeezing out poor people and bringing in yuppies with children  who would place a burden on area schools.  </P> <P> They also complained that the developer was trying to get approval for  condominiums "on the backs of senior citizens."  </P> <P> In an effort to combat that last criticism, Ring proposed a last-minute  compromise Tuesday that would have allowed the committee to restrict ownership  of the condominiums to senior citizens. Upon hearing that, Councilman Bernson  sent the two sides outside to negotiate, but after a brief discussion on the  steps of City Hall, the opponents decided the offer did not change their  opinion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reverses Recommendation  </P> <P> The committee's decision Tuesday reverses the recommendation of the Los Angeles  Planning Commission, which in April reluctantly approved plans for the project.  All four commissioners present at the April hearing said they did not like the  location of the development, but three of the four voted in favor, saying the  complex would help ease a shortage of housing for senior citizens.  </P> <P> In making his presentation to the committee, Ring relied heavily on that  rationale. He told committee members that the Tumanjans' proposal, in which a  private developer would build housing for low- to moderate-income people  without help from the government, is exactly what city policies are intended to  promote.  </P> <P> "We have no ideal sites left," Ring said. "There just aren't any." He added  that the council should be encouraging development on any site that will  "provide housing for our future generations and our parents' generation."  </P> <P> Flores aide Mario Juravich told the panel that nobody is opposed to senior  citizen housing. "But I think it is the site itself that is being questioned."  </P></p>

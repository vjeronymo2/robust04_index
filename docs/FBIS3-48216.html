			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 17 (YONHAP) -- The Hyundai Business  Group is likely to continue to have a hard time obtaining  assistance from Korea Development Bank [KDB] or other  state-invested financial organizations as long as group founder  Chong Chu-yong remains active in management of the conglomerate,  a senior government source said Monday.    The government has reacted coolly to repeated calls for an  easing of the financial restrictions from group management, the  source said.    Hyundai Chairman Chong Se-yong, a younger brother of Chong,  asked President Kim Yong-sam in their tete-a-tete in September  for his help in having financial institutions resume financial  assistance to Hyundai, and a similar appeal was made to Economic  Planning Minister Chong Chae-sok last week, but to no avail, the  source said.    Even close aides to the president and some cabinet ministers  have tried to persuade Kim to ease the restrictions, but Kim has  reportedly hinted that there is no possibility of the government  relaxing its position with regard to Hyundai.    Hyundai's relations with the government soured so much after  Chong entered politics two years ago that the group has  continuously been excluded from the beneficiaries of KDB  facility investment loans and other financial assistance.</p>

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / California faces new budget crisis California is once again facing a budget crisis, with an estimated Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4bn) cash deficit for the fiscal year which will end on June 30 and a furious political row over whether Governor Pete Wilson's budget arithmetic for next year adds up. Under the state constitution, the California legislature is supposed to pass a new budget by June 15, but this deadline has passed and Mr Gray Davis, the state controller, is warning he may once again have to start issuing IOUs to pay the state's bills. Governor Wilson's Dollars 57bn proposed budget for the 1994-95 fiscal year was thrown out of kilter when voters rejected three ballot proposals 10 days ago authorising nearly Dollars 5bn of bond issues to pay for repairs to roads, bridges and schools damaged in January's Los Angeles earthquake. Californian finance officials are also on edge as they wait for the Supreme Court's decision on the case brought by Barclays Bank of the UK and Colgate-Palmolive of the US against the unitary tax formula under which they have in the past assessed taxes on corporations. The Supreme Court is expected to issue its ruling as early as next week. If it decides for Barclays, California would have to refund about Dollars 400m. If it also decides for Colgate, another Dollars 1.3bn would have to be refunded. A repeat of the 63 day crisis in 1992 when California had to issue IOUs to pay its employees and suppliers is threatened. Mr Davis said that he could not legally issue more conventional short term debt unless convinced the state was able to repay it.</p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Japan looks to low-cost Asia: Yen strength fuels shift of manufacturing industry abroad Japanese companies plan to boost low-cost production in other Asian countries next year, when their overall capital spending is expected to rise for the first time in three years, according to a government survey released yesterday. Corporate Japan plans to increase total investment in plant and equipment by 1.1 per cent in the year to next March, according to a study of 1,615 companies by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. This is a sharp change from the 0.1 per cent investment decline forecast in Miti's most recent survey of this type, released last October, and the latest in a recent series of moderately bright economic indicators. Capital investment fell by 8.7 per cent last year. Direct investment in other Asian countries in the coming year will leap to 37.5 per cent of total foreign investment, up from 16.4 per cent in the previous year, emphasising the Japanese focus on expansion in China and south-east Asia. Investment in new plant in other Asian countries is forecast to rise 26 per cent, a spectacular turnround from last year's 2.6 per cent fall, according to the Miti survey. Within this, manufacturing industry is forecast to increase Asian investment outside Japan by 56.1 per cent. The long-term shift of production out of Japan paused slightly during the recession. But the Miti survey suggests it is now on the verge of a second advance. This is a response to the yen's renewed strength in the past year and reflects manufacturers' strategy of adding component plants to the basic assembly lines they established in east Asia during the late 1980s. This trend has already prompted concern within Japan that its manufacturing industry will be 'hollowed-out' by the shift of production abroad. Japanese investment in China is now aimed at capitalising on the strong growth of domestic demand, along with taking advantage of the country as a low-cost production site for exports. In areas outside Asia, improvement in corporate investment appears to be patchy. Manufacturers expect to cut spending by 3.5 per cent across the board this year, a less severe reduction than the 19.6 per cent cut last year. Service industries and utilities forecast a 3.6 per cent rise.</p>

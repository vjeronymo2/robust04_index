			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / UK Company News: S&amp;N picks Germany for next Center Parcs village Scottish &amp; Newcastle, the brewing and leisure group, yesterday confirmed that Center Parcs, its rapidly-expanding leisure specialist company, is to build its first complex in Germany. The Pounds 80m village in Bispingen, south of Hamburg, will be operational next year. It will be the company's 15th domed holiday complex and will cater for 300,000 visitors a year. The third UK Center Parcs site at Longleat in Wiltshire opens this summer. S&amp;N acquired Center Parcs from its Dutch owners in 1989 and it quickly became the group's star performer. Last year, it continued to defy the continental recession with more than 3m visitors to its year-round sites in the Netherlands, Belgium, UK and France. Occupancy rates were more than 90 per cent. S&amp;N's leisure division, the bulk of whose business is accounted for by Center Parcs, raised operating profits by 9 per cent to Pounds 42.4m in the six months to end-October. Turnover was also 9 per cent higher at Pounds 185.3m. Mr Jim Merrington, S&amp;N's director of corporate affairs, said last year more than 400,000 German holidaymakers visited Center Parcs throughout Europe. S&amp;N is expected to build a second German site in the next few years.</p>

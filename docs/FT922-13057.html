			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / 'An essential act of leadership' The text of Mr Kinnock's statement read: In the wake of the election defeat, I am taking action which in my judgment as leader will serve in the best interests of the Labour party. I trust that members and supporters will readily come to understand and support the course which I am going to follow. The decisions which I have made will require rapid change. Those decisions have not, however, been taken hastily. They result from rational consideration which I have given over a period of time to the future of the Labour party. I will not be seeking re- election as leader of the Labour party. In order to ensure that new leadership elections can be completed without delay, I will be proposing to the national executive committee meeting tomorrow that the elections be held as quickly as proper organisation allows. The elections will, therefore, take place in the second half of June. My resignation from the position of leader of the Labour party will take effect from the date of the elections. The deputy leader, Roy Hattersley, shares my view of the course which must be followed and will act accordingly. This timetable will make it possible for the parliamentary Labour party to elect a new shadow cabinet well before the summer recess. In providing for these developments I am seeking to ensure the Labour party can get on with its work with maximum speed and effectiveness. This will prove to be particularly important when the government has a small majority and faces the continuing and very deep economic difficulties it has caused for the country. In these circumstances I am certain it would not be right for the Labour party to wait for the six months until October before establishing the leadership team and the political course which must be followed. As the election process opens I have only one piece of advice for the Labour movement at every level: do not feed and do not believe the press and broadcasting media in their reporting of these events. The Labour party must conduct its own democratic election and do it in a way that brings credit and strength to the party. That was done in 1983. I am sure it will be done again. I am taking the opportunity of this statement to notify the Labour party of my intention to seek election to the constituency section of the national executive committee at this year's annual conference. My purpose in doing that is to try to continue to play an active and supportive part in sustaining the advances in democracy and policy which I believe to be vital to the future success of the party. I want to record my heartfelt thanks to Roy Hattersley, the rest of the shadow cabinet and the national executive committee for their loyalty, their hard work and the personal and political qualities which have been a source of strength in the recent campaign and for a very long time before that. I also want to express my admiration for members of the Labour party, old and new, whose dedication to the progress of the party and to the well-being of the community makes me proud of them and confident that our cause of democratic socialism will prevail. I want them and the many others who have sent countless numbers of moving messages of support to Glenys and myself in the last three days to know I deeply appreciate their great kindness. I assure them very firmly the action I am taking is an essential act of leadership. It is not to do with any personal sensitivity - it arises entirely from my desire to see that the Labour party will gain further strength and be better able to serve the people of Britain and the wider world community. This is an appropriate time for me to ask all those who wanted Labour to win to join the Labour party and add to the breadth of its support. In the wake of the general election many people want to express their feeling of determined commitment to the politics of mercy and justice and to policies of economic renewal. Joining the Labour party will give them a practical way of making those feelings count. There will be many opportunities to consider the causes and consequences of last Thursday's election result. I will not dwell on them here. I will content myself, for the moment, with drawing attention to the words of the former treasurer of the Conservative party, Lord McAlpine, in yesterday's Sunday Telegraph: 'The heroes of this campaign,' said Lord McAlpine, 'were Sir David English (editor of the Daily Mail), Sir Nicholas Lloyd (editor of the Daily Express), Kelvin MacKenzie (editor of The Sun) and the other editors of the grander Tory press. Never in the past nine elections have they come out so strongly in favour of the Conservatives. 'Never has their attack on the Labour party been so comprehensive. . . This was how the election was won, and if the politicians, elated in their hour of victory, are tempted to believe otherwise, they are in very real trouble next time.' Lord McAlpine could not be expected to acknowledge the degree of misinformation and disinformation employed in the attacks on the Labour party, but in all other respects his assessment is correct. The government elected on 9 April 1992 does not have, and will not develop, the policies necessary to strengthen the British economy, and will not try to address the injustices in British society. My great regret is that I failed to ensure that enough people understood that, and the implications which it has for the future. My sorrow is that millions, particularly those who do not have the strength to defend themselves, will suffer because of the election of another Conservative government. I make, and I seek, no excuses, and I express no bitterness when I say that the Conservative-supporting press has enabled the Tory party to win yet again when the Conservative party could not have secured victory for itself on the basis of its record, its programme or its character. The relationship between the Conservative party and those newspapers which Lord McAlpine describes as being edited by 'heroes' is a fact of British political life. I did think that it would be possible this time to succeed in achieving change in spite of that. Clearly it wasn't. Success will therefore have to wait. But it will come, and I will work for it. The text of Mr Hattersley's letter to Mr Kinnock is: Dear Neil, I have written to Larry Whitty telling him I propose to resign the deputy leadership of the Labour party with effect from the special conference which elects a new leadership team. In the weeks and months ahead I shall play a full part in the debate about Labour's future. Today, I do no more than offer you my thanks for your friendship during the years in which we have served together and express my admiration for the wayin which you have led theparty. When you became leader there was a real fear that Labour could never challenge for government again. Your constitutional and policy reforms brought us back into the mainstream of politics. No-one else could have achieved so much during the last difficult eight years. When Labour wins the general election - as will clearly be within our power in four to five years time - much of the credit for that victory will be owed to you. Yours, Roy.</p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / EC urged to ease regional aid rules THE GOVERNMENT yesterday launched its bid to win EC regional aid aimed at areas hit by defence spending cuts. It called on the European Commission to relax rules that prevent funds being allocated to prosperous parts of the country, such as the south-west, where the decline in military orders has led to large job losses. Submitting an outline bid for Pounds 15m of EC aid, the government said some parts of Britain worst hit by defence cuts might not qualify for aid if the Commission applied its structural funds objectives. These objectives restrict aid spending to areas of industrial decline or rural regions which need modernisation. The government is concerned that adherence to the rules would mean counties such as Avon, where an estimated 7,000 defence-related jobs have been lost in the past six years, would not be eligible for part of the Pounds 100m Konver fund. The fund, announced in April by Mr Bruce Millan, EC regional policy commissioner, is designed to be used for retraining, job-creation schemes and the regeneration of disused military bases. The Western Development Partnership, the public- and private-sector forum which is supporting a joint bid for EC aid by Avon, Wiltshire and Gloucestershire, said yesterday that thousands more jobs would be lost if the Commission rejected the UK bid. The partnership said: 'The three counties could expect to lose a further 7,000 MoD military and civilian jobs and over 12,000 from defence companies by the year 2000 if the Konver initiative fails.' Commission officials in Brussels yesterday signalled a willingness to accept the UK call for flexibility on where aid could be spent, saying the funds would reflect 'the special circumstances of the UK defence industry'. The government outlined a six-point plan to encourage defence companies to convert to civilian activities. This covers aid for start-up businesses; technology transfer schemes; rehabilitation of military sites; vocational training; joint projects to help companies diversify; and new economic promotion agencies.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / People: Taking an early shower Christopher Wilson, who always knew he preferred bathrooms to coal, is leaving Young, the Durham-based mining and haulage company, after less than a year as finance director. Over-extension at Young helped to prompt the removal of company founder Bob Young as chairman and chief executive and the arrival of a new management team earlier this month. With the help of new financial backers, Young is refocusing its activities in readiness for opportunities likely to arise from the privatisation of British Coal. Wilson, who departs with effect from an extraordinary general meeting (to approve the refinancing) probably in August, is cagey about his new endeavour. But he terms it a personal decision, adding that he is responding to the chance to become chief executive of, and a shareholder in, a new London-based company in an area 'not far off' bathrooms - an already familiar field. Brian Calver, the new group managing director, says: 'He hasn't told me what it is. I think a friend of his is setting something up.' He remarks that he is sorry to see Wilson go but denies there is any wider significance in the departure. 'He has seen greener pastures, as happens in business.' Wilson's previous experience includes a spell between 1984 and 1988 as finance director of Smallbone, an upmarket manufacturer of customised bathrooms and kitchens, which was acquired by Williams Holdings. Wilson then led a management buyout of bathroom products specialists B C Sanitan, part of Smallbone, from Williams. But the mbo fell short of its targets and Wilson left in 1990. He describes himself as having 'kicked around' before getting into the coal business. ***** Clive Strowger (left), who resigned as chief executive of the troubled Mountleigh property group last September, seems to have been rehabilitated in the eyes of the City establishment. He is to take over as group chief executive of APV, the world's biggest food machinery maker. (see Observer) APV has been looking for a new chief executive for many months following the early retirement of Fred Smith who had headed the group since 1984. Strowger, 50, a former finance director of Grand Metropolitan, is returning to the other side of an industry he knows well. During his 12 years at GrandMet he headed the brewing, consumer services, foods and retail and property divisions. APV also announced yesterday that Richard Fenny (right), 42, has been lured away from Fluor to be director of the group's liquid foods division. He replaces Mike Smith, who resumes the role of corporate development director.</p>

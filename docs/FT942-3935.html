			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Beijing tightens up on gold trade China will crack down on black-market gold trading from the end of this month, in an effort to re-establish the state monopoly over the buying and selling of the precious metal. The authorities also said at the weekend that futures trading in gold would be banned. The People's Bank, China's central bank, which is responsible for gold acquisition, reported that in the first four months of this year gold purchases were down by 35 per cent on the same period in 1992. China's central bank purchases of gold last year plummeted 32 per cent from 1992. This followed growth of a rampant black market. A circular issued by the State Council, China's cabinet, said officials who allowed a black market in gold to continue after July 1 would be 'charged and punished'. Mines that failed to sell their gold output to the state would be denied government loans and tax breaks. The circular also urged the People's Bank to increase the gold price to international levels. China last September doubled the gold acquisition price to Yn2,986 (Pounds 229) a troy ounce, about 10 per cent below the world market. China produced 100 tonnes of gold last year and imported 150 tonnes. Most of this was used to make jewellery. China is the fourth biggest gold consumer after India, the US and Saudi Arabia. Reuter adds from Beijing: China, blaming blind speculation on international futures exchanges for big foreign exchange losses, said it would allow Chinese brokerages to place orders only on domestic exchanges. 'The state will strictly control futures trading outside the borders,' the official People's Daily said.</p>

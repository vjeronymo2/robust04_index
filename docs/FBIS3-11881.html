			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Al Gore's Visit"] </F>   [Text] Relations between Argentina and the United States  gained new momentum following the U.S. vice president's brief  visit to Buenos Aires on the second leg of his tour of three  South American countries. Al Gore's praises of the Argentine  economic policy before his arrival -- reiterated upon his  departure -- coincide with a growing degree of understanding in  other areas, like cooperation between the United States and  Argentina in operations undertaken by the international  community.    These bonds between the two countries enable them to openly  discuss matters of common interest. Gore raised two issues that  the Reagan and Bush Republican administrations already had  deemed a priority, namely the law on patents -- strictly  speaking, on intellectual property -- and the fight against  drugs.    With regard to patents, Gore reiterated what U.S. Trade  Representative Michael Kantor stated not long ago -- that  Washington gives top priority to the passing of a law that  guarantees foreign pharmaceutical companies' rights to the  patents they have obtained for their medicines. As for drug  enforcement -- which will be one of the main agenda items at the  summit of the Americas' heads of state in Miami this year -- the  United States continues to uphold the advisability of Latin  American armed forces playing some role in this area.    President Carlos Menem conceded that a delay in the  enactment  of the patents law may be a stumbling block in bilateral  relations. He commented on the possibility -- previously  mentioned by Kantor -- of Argentina being included on a list of  countries liable for economic sanctions. This could happen if  considerable progress has not been made in this respect by 30  April. Menem also referred to another possible negative  consequence in the future, namely, the indefinite postponement  of Argentina's joining NAFTA, whose only current signatories are  the United States, Canada, and Mexico.    It would be totally erroneous to interpret the tone of these  warnings as proof of a misunderstanding between both countries.  The Patents Bill already has been submitted to Congress and  even though some of its points -- which to some extent affect  local vested interests -- have been met with opposition, there  is no reason to doubt it will be approved. Argentina's stance  -- like other countries in the hemisphere -- on the struggle  against drug trafficking is different from that of the United  States as far as the Armed Forces' possible role in this area,  but both countries are totally of one mind with regard to the  final objectives and the coordination of efforts.    The U.S. vice president's visit enabled the Argentine  Government to once again protest -- and quite understandably so  -- U.S. subsidies for their agricultural exports. Once again,  the answer was that Washington has no intention whatsoever of  damaging "legitimate" exporters like Argentina and that  subsidies are a response to EC practices. Obviously, this  position does not satisfy Argentina at all, but it spells out  the policy furthered by the United States, which also contends  that the issue of subsidies to farmers must be discussed within  the framework of GATT negotiations and cannot be settled  bilaterally.    The wide coverage given to the differences over these  questions clouded what -- at least in speeches -- constituted  the reason for the vice president's visit: the arrangement of  the December presidential summit in Miami and his presentation  at the World Conference on Telecommunications Development.  Gore's presentation on a future "information superhighway,"  which will link data banks in the entire hemisphere, conjured up  visions of a not far-off future on which they are working  unstintingly. It would be wise to pay attention to this project  and get ready for what will seemingly mark the beginning of a  new era, in which communications developments will impose a new  rhythm to relations between nations in the Americas.</p>

			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Swiss bank cushioned by cut in bad loans CS Holding, the international financial services group built around Credit Suisse, has reported a 19 per cent drop in consolidated net income to SFr712m (Pounds 350m) for the first half of the year. The decline is the most modest among the big Swiss financial institutions that have published interim results in recent days, thanks largely to sharply reduced bad loan provisions. CS said it had decided to cut these provisions by 32 per cent to SFr914m, citing 'the economy's recovery'. Mr Rainer Gut, CS chairman, said the result showed the value of CS's global spread and broadly diversified activities. He described the result as satisfactory and said he was confident that the full-year figures would be good, 'especially as the economic recovery is gaining in strength and the financial markets appear to be returning to a more normal state'. Operating income was down 17 per cent to SFr5.4bn, mainly because of a 43 per cent slide in trading income to SFr1.27bn. CS said that all its financial subsidiaries suffered declines in securities trading, but its Credit Suisse Financial Products derivatives subsidiary maintained its results at the high level of last year. Net commission income eased 6.5 per cent to SFr2.09bn, as a one-third decline at investment bank CS First Boston more than offset gains of 6-16 per cent from the group's asset management activities. Net interest income was off 5 per cent at SFr1.58bn due to a stagnation in loan volume and squeezed margins. Income from investments in companies nearly trebled to SFr229m, lifted by the success of Credit Suisse investment funds. Operating expenses declined 7 per cent to SFr3.43bn, mainly because personnel costs at CS First Boston are tied to performance. Profit before taxes and provisions was down 30 per cent to SFr1.97bn, a broadly similar result to those at Union Bank of Switzerland and Credit Suisse. CS's 32 per cent cut in bad loan provisions is a bigger improvement than the 26 per cent reduction at Union Bank of Switzerland, but well below the 53 per cent decrease at Swiss Bank Corporation.

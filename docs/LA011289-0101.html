			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEXICO'S ARREST OF OIL UNION CHIEF SPURS PANIC BUYING AT GAS STATIONS  </P> <P> Mexican motorists jammed gas stations in panic buying and armed soldiers  guarded most of the nation's refineries against possible sabotage Wednesday  after the violent arrest of the leader of the oil workers union on arms  smuggling charges.  </P> <P> The arrest of the powerful union chief, Joaquin Hernandez Galicia, the day  before provoked early morning work stoppages and slowdowns Wednesday at several  of the state oil company's installations, but most of the workers apparently  were back on the job after receiving orders from union leaders meeting in  Mexico City.  </P> <P> The government news agency Notimex reported that the navy was protecting  coastal installations and oil tankers in the Gulf of Mexico. Reporters in  Campeche state said military airplanes were circling the 36 offshore drilling  platforms in Campeche Sound.  </P> <P> The government had feared violence by some of the nearly 200,000 oil workers  who are considered to be fiercely loyal to Hernandez Galicia, but there were no  reports of disturbances.  </P> <P> President Carlos Salinas de Gortari met privately with Fidel Velasquez, the  leader of the Mexican Workers Congress, the umbrella group for organized labor  in the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or the PRI. The oil workers  union is a key sector of the congress.  </P> <P> The president is scheduled to meet today with the congress' entire executive  committee.  </P> <P> Hernandez Galicia, known as La Quina, is the popular and allegedly corrupt  power behind the union in the nation's strategic oil industry. He was detained  by federal police and the army Tuesday morning at his home in Ciudad Madero in  the coastal state of Tamaulipas, after a gun battle with his bodyguards that  left one federal agent dead.  </P> <P> The attorney general's office said 44 other people have been arrested in  conjunction with the case, including the secretary general of the union,  Salvador Barragan Camacho. Barragan Camacho, who turned himself over to  authorities before dawn Wednesday, is in police custody at a Mexico City  hospital, where he is being treated for a heart condition.  </P> <P> Security agents found 200 Israeli-made Uzi submachine guns and thousands of  rounds of ammunition in Hernandez Galicia's house and are charging the union  leader with arms stockpiling and smuggling, the attorney general's office  added.  </P> <P> Government officials charge that Hernandez Galicia was conspiring to take over  installations of the state oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, to  destabilize the government.  </P> <P> An opposition member of the federal Chamber of Deputies, however, was quoted in  the Mexico City newspaper La Jornada as saying he saw the army plant the guns  in Hernandez Galicia's house. Alfredo Pliego Aldana, a member of the leftist  National Democratic Front, said, "I was there . . . (the army) brought the  weapons in a military truck, unloaded them and took them into La Quina's  house."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Charge by Unionists  </P> <P> Union officials charge that the government has framed Hernandez Galicia and  other leaders in a political move to break their power and that of the union.  In a simultaneous attack on Hernandez Galicia's economic interests, the  government arrested Sergio Bolanos, the businessman who is said to handle  Hernandez Galicia's business affairs. Bolanos and several of his associates are  accused of evading $1.5 million in taxes.  </P> <P> A government spokesman who declined to be identified by name said that two of  Hernandez Galicia's bodyguards in detention told authorities that they murdered  one of Hernandez Galicia's rivals in 1983 on orders from their boss. According  to the official, the bodyguards said they killed Oscar Torres Pancardo, mayor  of Poza Rica in the state of Veracruz, who appeared to have died in a  mysterious car wreck.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, soldiers surrounded several of the country's nine refineries while  troops in army jeeps escorted trucks delivering gasoline to stations throughout  the country. Motorists fearing an eventual strike waited in long gas lines that  clogged streets throughout the capital.  </P> <P> "The people are panicked and we have long lines because they think there is  going to be a shortage," said Alberto Servin, an attendant at one Pemex gas  station.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gas in Short Supply  </P> <P> With the high demand, some stations ran out of gas, but Pemex officials  guaranteed that all stations would have gas today.  </P> <P> In Ciudad Madero, where the union headquarters is situated, state officials  reported stores and gas stations closed and a morning demonstration in the  central square by about 3,000 union members protesting "the kidnaping" of  Hernandez Galicia.  </P> <P> "The workers are disoriented and alarmed," said Manuel Montiel, spokesman for  the state government.  </P> <P> By afternoon, however, the Notimex news agency reported that "hundreds of  workers" had gone back to the refinery there after receiving orders from the  local union leader.  </P> <P> In the states of Tabasco, Campeche and Oaxaca, reporters said that protesting  workers returned to their jobs by midday.  </P> <P> In Tabasco, a local newspaper reporter said that soldiers were searching  employees as they entered the 25 Pemex work sites.  </P> <P> Tuesday's arrests have met with mixed reactions. Business leaders generally  have lauded the move while the leftist opposition has protested the violent and  allegedly illegal way in which Hernandez Galicia was detained.  </P> <P> At a meeting of a permanent joint committee of Congress, lawmaker Jesus Ortega  of the opposition Democratic Front called the arrest a "classic example of  state terror." He said the oil union was targeted because "the government does  not want an obstacle to its policy of privatizing the nation's industries."  </P> <P> President Salinas favors selling off many of the government enterprises and  breaking up others.  </P></p>

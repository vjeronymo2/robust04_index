			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / VW loses top man in structural shake-up MR DANIEL Goeudevert has been squeezed out of his post as vice-chairman of the Volkswagen group as a result of a 'structural reorganisation', VW said at the weekend. He will leave at the end of July by 'mutual agreement'. His main duties, responsibility for the VW brand - accounting for two-thirds of group sales - will be taken on by Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman, but Mr Goeudevert will continue to be a consultant. Once favourite to become group chairman, he lost to Mr Piech in last autumn's selection, when the scale of the group's crisis was becoming clear. Since then he has increasingly appeared the odd man out, especially following the arrival in March of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua as group production and procurement director. This further eroded his operational role, leaving him basically in charge of marketing the VW marque, while Mr Lopez was adopted as the chairman's closest confidant. Mr Goeudevert's intellectual approach set him further apart from the engineering duo committed to rescuing Germany's biggest volume car manufacturer. He was also tainted by Mr Piech's accusation against the former group board that it had failed to do its 'homework' during the eight prosperous years before VW was overtaken by recession in the second half of 1992. After a DM1.25bn (Pounds 489m) loss in the first quarter of this year, the group is heading rapidly back into the black, according to Mr Piech.</p>

			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Israeli-backed militiamen patrolling southern Lebanon shot and killed three  guerrillas from a radical PLO faction who were on their way to attack a target  in Israel, an Israeli army spokesman said. The Marxist guerrilla group said in  a statement that the three fighters killed three Israeli soldiers and two  Christian militiamen before they were gunned down, but the army spokesman said  no militiamen from the South Lebanon Army were injured in the clash. The three  were reportedly killed about a mile north of the Israeli border. Documents on  the bodies of the heavily armed guerrillas showed they were members of Nayef  Hawatmeh's Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a radical faction  of the Palestine Liberation Organization.  </P></p>

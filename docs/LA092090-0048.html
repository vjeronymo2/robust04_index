			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LONG-DISTANCE COSTS MAY DROP BY BILLIONS WITH NEW FCC RULES  </P> <P> The Federal Communications Commission adopted on Wednesday new pricing  regulations for the nation's eight largest regional phone companies that it  says could reduce long-distance charges by billions of dollars during the next  four years.  </P> <P> The new rules, effective Jan. 1, will reduce the rates that the seven Baby Bell  phone companies and General Telephone are allowed to charge long-distance  carriers for interstate services. These services include connecting  long-distance companies with the local phone network.  </P> <P> Lower charges to the long-distance companies should result in reduced charges  for long-distance customers, the FCC said. But while the FCC said the action  could save long-distance callers "billions" of dollars during the next four  years, no firm estimates of the savings were available, and no immediate  savings were forecast.  </P> <P> However, an executive with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the nation's  largest long-distance carrier, said the new price policies would result in a 5%  rate cut by 1995 when contrasted with what the rate might have been without the  new policies.  </P> <P> The new rules will have no direct effect on the rates charged for local service  provided by General Telephone and the seven Bell telephone companies.  </P> <P> The FCC also voted to lower the rate of return that local telephone companies  can earn on their long-distance services to 11.25% from 12%, a move widely  decried by local telephone companies. However, the decrease is expected to  result in an immediate $317-million cut in fees the local phone companies can  charge long-distance carriers.  </P> <P> The new pricing policies for the local phone companies -- similar to those  adopted by the commission a year ago for AT&amp;T -- allow the FCC to regulate  the long-distance prices charged by the local telephone companies, not the  profits generated by those charges. Similar policies governing local service  rates charged to California telephone customers were adopted last year by the  state Public Utilities Commission.  </P> <P> Behind the new policies is the philosophy -- still highly controversial -- that  if regulators focus on the prices phone companies charge, rather than their  profits, the companies will have an incentive to lower their own costs or  increase their revenues. By lowering costs or raising sales, the argument goes,  phone companies would be able to increase their profits beyond what they could  earn if their profits were controlled by regulators.  </P> <P> Under the new FCC order, local phone companies will be allowed to raise their  long-distance prices at the rate of inflation, minus a "productivity factor"  designed to account for the lower costs of producing phone service.  </P> <P> The FCC assured that the complicated formula would result in real price  reductions to telephone company customers. In addition, local carriers will be  required to share with customers any profits beyond a specified upper limit. If  the company gets too profitable, it would have to return all its profits to  customers.  </P></p>

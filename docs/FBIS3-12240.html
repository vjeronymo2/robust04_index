Bill Clinton has invited them  to come to Washington again, but is not under any illusion for  the time being. Yasir 'Arafat prefers to wait and see, as he  told our correspondent in Tunis, Michel Montpontet:    [Begin recording 'Arafat in English with superimposed French  translation; processed from the English] We are in need now of  an international protection for our people. This is very  important and the peace accord we have signed in Washington last  September mentions an international presence, and the Israelis  accepted that. Armed settlers are a real time bomb. We are  asking the Israeli government to take measures, steps, and to  take their responsibility, and to respect what they have signed.  It is true that President Clinton offered us an invitation, but  before that we would want to know under what umbrella. [end  recording]</p>

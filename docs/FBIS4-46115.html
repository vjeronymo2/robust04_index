			<p>BFN     [Text] The terrorists who attacked an Army helicopter in  Quebrada Pena Blanca (Chanchamayo) on 12 May may be members of  an MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement] column that  protects some five "firms" of drug traffickers operating on the  outskirts of the jungle in that region.    This was asserted by Interior Ministry intelligence sources,  according to which the terrorists allegedly come from San Luis  de Shuaro.    The terrorists belong to one of the MRTA columns that have  lost their slight ideological tint, and are surviving as a  mercenary group protecting a Mexican "firm" that is allegedly  trying to grow poppy plants in the surroundings of Sanchirio,  Alto Batinaki, Santa Herminia, and on the banks of the  Paucartambo River near Villa Rica.    This, however, is not the only organization of foreign drug  traffickers: Colombian and Bolivian drug traffickers operate in  the region in cahoots with Peruvian traffickers.    Intelligence experts maintain that this MRTA column, and  those located on the outskirts of the Satipo (Junin) and  Oxapampa (Pasco) jungle, enjoy the compulsory help of peasant  and indigenous communities, whose leaders and heads of family  are forced, under threats of death, to cultivate coca leaf,  marijuana, and poppies.    They are also forced to produce washed cocaine paste, which  provides the MRTA with a significant income.    According to information obtained from peasants in Villa  Rica, 500 kg of washed cocaine paste are shipped to Colombia  each week. This represents an income per shipment for the  terrorists of approximately $225,000, taking into account that  the drugs are sold at $1,800 per kilo and the terrorists collect  25 percent of the total amount.    As for the "political military" organization of that  terrorist group, the analysts believe that the MRTA Central  Regional Committee has lost its geographical domain. In other  words, it no longer has the same control it used to exercise in  Pasco and Junin, and only survives due to its link with drug  traffickers.    Another source of income is allegedly the protection fees  the  MRTA members charge merchants, businessmen, and passengers  traveling through San Francisco, Esperanza, Miraflores, and  Villa Rica in Oxapampa (Pasco).</p>

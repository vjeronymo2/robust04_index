			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Vatman swoops on canned cuppa Customs and Excise has decided to tax drinks which are called tea but are not freshly brewed. The department has ruled that 'iced tea', sold in bottles or cans and sometimes artificially flavoured, is a soft drink and should carry value added tax at the standard rate. Tax experts came to the decision yesterday after coming up with a definition of tea which it thought would be accepted by 'the ordinary man in the street'. Customs said: 'Applying this criteria to tea the commissioners consider tea as a drink made by pouring hot water on leaves, leaving it for a few minutes to infuse, that is drunk, either hot or cold, to refresh and quench the thirst.' It added: 'In our view the ordinary man in the street would see a packaged ice tea product as similar to a soft drink and not as a substitute for the ordinary tea that the majority of the population drinks.' Customs ruled that zero exemption should not extend to preparations which include fruit juice or flavouring and citric acid, and which compete with other beverages in the soft drink market. Mr Carl Short, food manufacturing analyst with SGST Securities, said: 'Iced tea has been a fast-growing market in the US during recent years and could produce some excitement in the UK's tea and soft drinks markets. It bestrides both the fast-growing soft drinks sector and the more mature tea market.' Herbal teas and similar products will continue to be zero rated for VAT because they are considered to be ordinary foodstuffs which are drunk instead of tea, or as an alternative. A spokesman said that the concept of 'iced-tea' was a misnomer and the department was always vigilant when new products started to appear on the market. Iced tea served in a cafe or restaurant would not carry VAT as it was brewed with real tea. Customs made their decision in the light of past judgments of the independent VAT tribunals which consider appeals by manufacturers. An appeal may be made to yesterday's ruling.</p>

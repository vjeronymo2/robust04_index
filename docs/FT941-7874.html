			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Life policies head complaints league Life assurance was the biggest source of complaints dealt with by the insurance ombudsman last year with the most common allegations being maladministration, poor communication and mis-selling. About 39 per cent of life assurance complaints were upheld compared with 29 per cent for general insurance. 'The difference does perhaps underline some of the difficulties involved in satisfactory selling of investment products to the public,' said Mr Julian Farrand, the ombudsman, in his annual report. Responsibility for handling many life assurance complaints will pass to the ombudsman for the new Personal Investment Authority later this year. But the maximum compulsory award in the PIA scheme will be Pounds 50,000, whereas the insurance ombudsman can oblige companies to pay up to Pounds 100,000. Complaints about home income plans sold in the 1980s, when many elderly people were encouraged to take the risky step of mortgaging their homes and investing the proceeds to provide an income, form a large part of the current workload. Companies were required to pay out Pounds 7.4m last year as a result of the ombudsman's adjudications. The largest single payment was Pounds 230,000 and the smallest Pounds 3.88.</p>

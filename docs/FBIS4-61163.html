			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sanita Upleja: "Law on Civil Service Adopted"] </F>   [Text] Riga, 21 Apr -- Today, Saeima [parliament] adopted,  in its third reading, the long-expected law on state civil  service, which is to regulate relations of the civil servants,  as well as candidates for this post, in state and municipal  civil institutions. In accordance with the transformation  regulations of the new law, the reform of the state  administration has to be completed by 31 December 1995.    The transformation regulations of the law foresee that the  Cabinet of Ministers, along with the municipal authorities and  heads of civil institutions are to bear responsibility for  implementing the reform in due course. The transformation  regulations provide that the reform is implemented in a  respective sequence of time. The first stage of the reform will  be carried into effect in the ministries (except the Ministry of  Interior Affairs and the State Forest Service in the Agriculture  Ministry), and the state institutions which are submitted to  them, by 31 December of the current year.    The second stage of the reform of the state administration  will take place in the Ministry of Interior Affairs, the State  Forest Service, and the institutions of municipal authorities,  and will have to be implemented by 31 December 1995.    To ensure a proper course of transformation, the Cabinet of  Ministers will affirm the list of the civil servant positions  available in the state civil service. The employees will be  attestated by attestation commissions.    As is stated by the civil service law, the following are  state civil institutions: the State Office, all state  administration and municipal institutions, court and  prosecutor's institutions, State Control institutions, as well  as other institutions acting as state or municipal authorities,  established in accordance with the Satversme [constitution],  legislative acts, and decisions of the Cabinet of Ministers. As  regards the civil servant, it is a person who has passed an  examination qualifying him as a state civil servant, and has  been nominated, for a definite or indefinite time, to some post  defined on the list of civil service positions. According to the  law, he performs the duties, which have been delegated by the  state to the municipal authorities, or fulfills functions of the  state civil service in a civil institution.    The law states that the posts of the chairman of the High  Court, his deputies, and judges of the High Court, the chairman  of the district court, his deputies, and judges of the district  court, as well as judges of other courts, the posts of the  general prosecutor and other prosecutors, the posts of the state  controller and members of the State Control Council are not to  be regarded as civil servant posts.    The law provides that the candidates for the posts of civil  servants should meet obligatory requirements, such as, to  possess Latvian citizenship, and to have a command of the  Latvian language. The law denies the possibility to become a  civil servant to a person who has been an employee of the former  USSR or LAtvian SSR State Security Committee, the Russian  Defense Ministry, as well as security service, intelligence  service, and military espionage or counterespionage of Russia or  other states. The transformation rules also provide that  foreign citizens and stateless persons, who are performing  duties of civil servants at the moment when the law comes into  effect, are permitted --after passing the attestation  examinations due to regulations adopted by the Cabinet of  Ministers -- to function in the status of candidates for the  post of civil servant, for a time not longer than two years.</p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Media ownership rules to be reviewed The government is pushing ahead with a review of the cross-media ownership rules that prevent newspaper publishers owning more than 20 per cent of conventional commercial television companies, Raymond Snoddy writes. Members of a review group which may start work next month will include officials from the Department of National Heritage, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Cabinet Office and the Treasury. The review, which will take at least three months, could pave the way for a relaxation of the rules in the wake of the recent liberalisation of ITV ownership regulations. The government has been lobbied extensively by newspaper groups wanting to increase their television interests, particularly Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail and The Mail on Sunday, and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times. Both Associated and Pearson were interested in bidding for a significant stake in a new fifth national television channel but were prevented by the rules from holding more than 5 per cent. The argument of the liberalisers is that in an age of growing media competition and choice and the growing convergence between computers, telecommunications and entertainment, the old cross-media rules are too narrowly drawn. When Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, announced last month his intention to allow one company to own two ITV licences, he promised to keep ownership restrictions under review and to re-examine the wider questions of cross-media ownership.</p>

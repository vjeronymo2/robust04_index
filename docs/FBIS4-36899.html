			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 14 Jun (MENA)--Interior Minister Hasan  al-Alfi has stressed that the Interior Ministry has complete  information about terrorist organizations in Egypt and abroad.  He said the Interior Ministry has worked out an integrated plan  to besiege these organizations.    The only aim of those groups, said al-Alfi, is to seize  power  for the funds they receive from abroad.    In a conference held today by the Egyptian-French  Businessmen  Society to learn about the security situation in Egypt and its  impact on investment, the interior minister said the ministry is  using developed and modern methods, and arranging civilized and  scientific training for personnel to confront the terrorist  groups.    Security agencies will never rest as long as a single  terrorist remains on Egypt's soil, al-Alfi said.    He stressed that the problem with the terrorist groups is  not  only a security one. All state institutions must contribute to  the confrontation, and al-Azhar has a role to play in rectifying  the extremist thought, he explained.    Asked about the involvement of Muslim Brotherhood members in  terrorism, the interior minister said certain acts and facts  indicate that some Muslim Brotherhood members committed acts  punishable by law.    He said all facts and all emerging signs point to the  involvement of those elements, who number more than 100 people,  and are now being interrogated by the High State Security  Prosecution.    He said investigations have proved that there is  coordination  between terrorist groups at home and abroad.    Al-Alfi also noted coordination between Egypt and other  countries to confront terrorism and extradite criminals. He  said: Training camps for terrorists do exist in some countries.  We are not talking about a specific state, and it is in the  interest of the investigations that everything is announced in  due course.</p>

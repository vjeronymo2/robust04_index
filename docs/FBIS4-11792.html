			<p>BFN     [Text] The Shamgar Commission of Inquiry into the Hebron  massacre held closed hearings this afternoon. It heard  testimonies from the head of the Jerusalem district in the Shin  Bet. Earlier Colonel Moshe Giv'ati, the former commander of  Judaea, told the commission that the Army's open-fire orders  were unclear, and most soldiers did not understand them.    A spokesman for the prime minister said Yitzhaq Rabin has  been called to testify next Wednesday [6 April], but he will  also be questioned behind closed doors.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by editorial staff writer Masao Kanazashi: "We Must </F> Deal With the Quality of Politicians Before Addressing Policy  Issues"]    [Text] Decline in Morality Has Led to Absence of Qualified  Leaders    An unbelievable statement was uttered from within the Hata  coalition government which faced imminent collapse owing to the  withdrawal of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] from  the coalition.    The origin of that statement was Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party] Secretary General Ozawa who is considered to be the  scenario writer of the series of political events. On the  evening of 25 May amidst the controversy created by the  withdrawal of the SDPJ, it was Ozawa who said, "What difference  does it make as to which woman we sleep with?" in connection  with the formation of the new faction called "Kaishin"  [Innovation].    As usual, he issued a denial via his secretary, stating, "I  do not recall making the statement," but the truth of the  statement is considered reliable in that several of the mass  media have quoted the same words. Several female legislators  protested the statement as being disrespectful of women and  repercussions extended to foreign nations as reports on the  incident were circulated internationally.    Some of the mass media did not cover the incident on the day  the statement was made. It appears that they felt the statement  was so unbecoming of a politician in a leadership position that  they felt it would be inappropriate to mention it in a  newspaper. However, an immutable rule is that statements made by  people of importance are invariably quoted verbatim.    Needless to say, the Ozawa statement's impact was not  limited  to one of being disrespectful to women. Not only was his manner  of speech so vulgar as to cause alarm as being like the  poisonous words of a hooligan in the ghettos, but more  importantly of concern is the political atmosphere that is so  conducive to such expressions and the current situation under  which Japanese politics is controlled by politicians who make  complacent use of such language.    These are issues which are of more importance than policies  or political techniques. Such utterances are tantamount to  publicly confessing to the low quality and shabbiness of  Japanese politics and they distance Japan from qualifying as a  "dignified nation." If we were to refer to Mr. Ozawa's favorite  term, "international contributions," there is no other  conceivable deed that could do greater damage to Japan's honor  or detract from international contributions.    The reason I decry so much Mr. Ozawa's utterance is that an  individual's statements and manner of expression, on an  empirical basis, serve to exemplify an individual's ideas and  routine behavior. As an example, former Prime Minister Nakasone  liked to use military terms for statements and fables, and some  prime ministers referred immediately to the price when paintings  were mentioned.    In terms of the status of politicians before considering any  policy matters, there have been instances that we cannot help  but question. It was just one month earlier that Mr. Kakizawa,  as a representative of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party,  had demanded the resignation of the Hosokawa government, when  suddenly he was appointed as the foreign minister of the Hata  government.    Then, on the other hand, one day suddenly, Chairman Ouchi of  the Democratic Socialist Party--who had allied himself with the  Social Democrataic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and Sakigake  [Harbinger]--criticized the leadership style of Shinseito's  Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Ichikawa as being  strong-armed, and betrayed Mr. Ozawa and became the ringleader  in the SDPJ's withdrawal from the coalition government.    Observing such events reminds one of the turbulent days of  the feudal age, but many individual politicians, in reality,  assess the current confusion arising from political change as a  time of turbulence and try to navigate the rough waters in an  effort to survive or further their careers.    Needless to say, politicians seek power in surviving the  political carnage, but they also seem to find appeal in the  authority that they display ostentatiously.    Announcements on the imperial awards issued in the spring  were given only quiet coverage in the newspapers because they  coincided with the installation of the Hata cabinet, but it was  alarming that former Prime Minister Uno, who had resigned from  his position after only three months because of a notorious  womanizing incident, was being awarded a Grand Cordon of the  Order of the Rising Sun Paulownia, First Class. It is not  unusual for an individual with experience as a prime minister to  receive a medal of the highest class, because awards are based  on the rank of the public or private organizational position  held and the length of service, but Prime Minister Uno's award  looks awfully strange and even comical from a mundane  perspective.    Political scandals of the past were normally concerned with  dirty money or womanizing. However, the recent series of  scandals have broken with past rules and common sense and are  symptomatic of major changes in the political world and indicate  that a process of self-destruction is currently in progress.    When one thinks of the truly irresponsible manner in which  former Prime Minister Hosokawa resigned from office and Mr.  Michio Watanabe's repeated contradictions of prior statements  and threatened departure from the LDP, despite being a faction  leader and former deputy prime minister, he can only conclude  that there is a complete absence of or a radical change taking  place among political leaders. The idea of a political  reorganization is a good one, but there's no way that such a  goal can be achieved in the absence of qualified key personnel.</p>

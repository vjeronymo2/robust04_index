			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Inco cautious on 'abnormal' nickel market The unusual factors that have recently thrown the nickel market into turmoil are reason to be cautious on the outlook for nickel prices, according to Inco, the western world's biggest producer. In a presentation to analysts at the company's head office in Toronto, Inco executives pointed mainly to a surge in stainless-steel production and the uncertainty of Russian supplies. 'It's an abnormal situation,' said Mr Michael Sopko, chief executive. The LME cash nickel price has more than doubled in the past year to around USDollars 4 a pound. The latest spurt mainly reflects uncertainty about supplies from Norilsk of Russia, the world's biggest producer. The three months delivery position at the London Metal Exchange surged by Dollars 1,200 last week and leapt another Dollars 637.50 to a 4 1/4 -year high of Dollars 9,600 a tonne at one stage on Monday. A reaction then set in, however, and by yesterday's close the price was back to Dollars 8,775 a tonne. Inco forecast that Russian production would decline to 152,000 tonnes this year from 182,000 in 1993, with a further significant drop possible in 1995. Mr Ivor Kirman, marketing director for Inco Europe, emphasised that accurate information on Norilsk was hard to come by. He said however, that a 'significant' portion of Russian exports over the past two years appeared to have come from stockpiles. Inco forecast that world stainless steel production, which accounts for 63 per cent of nickel consumption, will climb to 13.4m tonnes in 1995, from 12.6m this year. The recovery has been especially strong in Japan, where stainless-steel output has been running at record levels in recent months. The Canadian group, which supplies about a third of the western world's nickel, plans to lift its own output to 430m lb in 1995 from an estimated 345m this year. Production has been dented this year by market-related shutdowns, as well as a series of mishaps at Inco's mines in Ontario and Manitoba.</p>

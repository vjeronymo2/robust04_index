			<p>BFN     [Text] Cuban Foreign Trade Minister Ricardo Cabrisas stated  that the U.S. blockade against Cuba is an archaic Cold War  policy and contrary to the trade agreements established in  Marrakech, Morocco. During an intervention at the ministerial  meeting of the Uruguayan Round of General Accord on Tariffs and  Trade [GATT], Cabrisas pointed out that negotiating under the  principles of the multilateral system does not seem to be on the  U.S. Government's agenda regarding Cuba. He added that the U.S.  blockade limits the positive effects of the Uruguayan Round for  Cuba by keeping one of the most important markets of the world  closed to Cuban exports.</p>

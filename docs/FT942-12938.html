			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / UK Company News: W Bedford guarded despite recovery Shares of William Bedford dipped 2p to 32p after the antique dealer and restorer accompanied its annual results with a guarded outlook on future trading. Despite the 'worst summer sales that we have ever experienced' the USM-quoted group returned to the black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 95,652 (losses of Pounds 271,759) for 1993. The directors warned, however, that the recovery was partly attributable to devaluation of stock in dollar terms. Turnover improved to Pounds 1.78m (Pounds 1.57m). Earnings per share were 1.8p against losses of 5p.</p>

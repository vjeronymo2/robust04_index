			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a military source, the U.S.  imperialists staged a nighttime airborne refueling exercise for  a northward invasion on 18 and 19 April.    For this war exercise, two KC-130 refueling planes from an  overseas base were deployed to a U.S. air base in South Korea in  the afternoon of 18 April. These refueling planes, which were  mobilized on the skies over the sea off Kunsan around 2100 hours  [1200 GMT], that day refueled some 50 various types of  fighters-bomber and assault fighters, flying between Oeyon  island and Taehuksan island until dawn of the next day.    This war exercise, which was frantically staged under the  cover of fighters from U.S. air bases in Japan, was aimed at  improving the capability of nighttime airborne refueling to  airplanes mobilized from overseas air bases and long-range  airplanes belonging to the U.S. Air Forces unit in South Korea  and the puppet Air Force for a northward invasion.</p>

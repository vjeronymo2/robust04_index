			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Feet drag on road to market: Change goes against grain for many in government ROMANIA faces increased economic and political uncertainty following last Friday's failure to reach agreement on a new stand-by arrangement with the International Monetary Fund. This is another setback for the government as the failure blocks some Dollars 3bn in badly needed foreign credits from the European Community and the G24 developed countries. Few now expect the minority administration led by Mr Nicolae Vacaroiu, which relies on ex-Communist and nationalist parties for its survival, to last in its present form beyond the autumn. The talks foundered chiefly over the IMF's concern at delay in the reform of large state enterprises and the general lack of financial discipline resulting in high inflation. A small technical team plans to return to Bucharest next week to help the finance ministry prepare for a return of a full IMF mission in the autumn. The heart of the problem lies in the state-owned enterprises which still account for 90 per cent of industrial production. Inter-enterprise debts were written off in January 1992, but have risen again to around Dollars 2.4bn, equivalent to 20 per cent of GDP. Enterprises have also taken advantage of negative real interest rates to run up large debts to banks. The 100 most indebted state companies alone have bank debts equivalent to nearly Dollars 300m. Continuing access to cheap credits has undermined the banking system, starved the emerging private sector of capital and threatens macro-economic stability. The government, which includes several non-partisan technocrats but lacks parliamentary support, has been unwilling to take firm action which would involve the politically unpopular closure of large state enterprises. Reformers in the government intend to set up a restructuring agency by the autumn to deal with the 100 most troubled companies, mainly in metallurgy, machine-building and chemicals. They also plan to complete legislation needed for enterprise reform over the summer parliamentary recess. This includes laws covering bankruptcy, the protection of competition, small and medium-sized enterprises, and capital markets and securities. But the main problem is not always the lack of legislation. 'Market instruments don't work because they are not applied fully. We still have to fight for market mechanisms,' says Mr Misu Negritoiu, deputy prime minister who is considered the cabinet's key reformer. Pro-reform opposition parties simply do not believe that an administration staffed with many former senior Communists is capable of leading the country through the transition. 'The government is incompetent because it does not understand or have confidence in market mechanisms,' says Mr Adrian Severin, an opposition leader and reform minister in Romania's first post-Communist government. 'There is general acceptance of the market economy, but in following this route the government is acting against its deepest convictions.' Nevertheless, the government has presided over some of the biggest price rises since the overthrow of the Ceausescu regime in December 1989. Its eight months in office have seen the final stages of price liberalisation, with big cuts in subsidies which pushed up prices of some basic foods and domestic energy more than five-fold in May. The introduction of 18 per cent value added tax on July 1 and the abolition of a 30 per cent mark-up limit on retailers have led to further price rises. 'Poland and Bulgaria went for one-time liberalisation in 1991,' says Mr Mugur Isarescu, central bank governor. 'Then, they had 600 per cent inflation, but now it is down to two digits. We are still fighting inflation of over 200 per cent.' The governing party, the recently renamed Social Democracy Party of Romania, which narrowly won last September's general election by promising gradual reform and increased attention to social welfare, has further fuelled inflation by granting generous pay rises. Official statistics for May show that pay awards more than matched a monthly inflation rate of 30 per cent. But cash handouts have not been enough to bolster the government's popularity. More than 60 per cent of the public considers the government's performance as 'poor', according to a recent survey by Irsop, a Bucharest polling organisation. The government has been damaged further by its failure to respond to widespread allegations of mismanagement and corruption. Both the prime minister and his transport minister have repeatedly failed to state their involvement in the recent sale of Petromin, the country's main shipping company, to a little-known Greek concern. Instead, the prime minister attempted to deflect attention from his role in the deal by accusing the former transport minister of setting up a ghost company with a reputable Norwegian company through which to siphon off Petromin's profits. Similarly, there has been little official response to a parliamentary commission which suggested several leading members of the government, including the finance minister, be investigated for corruption.</p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Egyptian clampdown nets 800 THE EGYPTIAN authorities have stepped up their battle with Islamic extremists, arresting more than 800 people in the past 10 days. According to members of the security forces quoted by Reuter, the latest arrests are an attempt to smash a hitherto unknown group called the Vanguards of the New Holy Struggle. The group is said to have been recruiting members in schools and universities, and advocates the full application of Islamic law. President Hosni Mubarak has blamed Iran for sponsoring the wave of extremist attacks, which have badly damaged the tourism industry, and last month ruled out any possibility of a dialogue with radical Islamic factions. Mr Mohammed Abdel-Moneim, the president's spokesman, said at the time: 'The strategy is steady - to get rid of these people.' US officials have cast doubts on the extent of external involvement in Egyptian terrorism, while liberal, secular organisations in Cairo have warned Mr Mubarak against the dangers of pursuing a confrontational policy with groups in large part motivated by poor social and economic conditions.</p>

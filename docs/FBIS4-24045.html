			<p>BFN     [Text] The body of a former Armed Forces Ruling Council  member, Vice Admiral Babatunde Elegbede, is being buried about  now in Lagos. He was killed last Sunday [19 June] by a gang of  attackers in Oworonshoki area of Lagos. The late Vice Adm.  Elegbede entered the Nigeria Defense Academy in 1962, after  which he attended military and civil training institutions both  at home and abroad. He held various command appointments in the  Nigerian Navy. At the time of his retirement last December,  Adm. Elegbede was chief of administration at the Defense  Headquarters. The late naval chief is survived by three wives  and eight children. His death at the hands of the gang of  attackers is being investigated by the police.    Reports say that the gang had trailed Adm. Elegbede to a  point where his vehicle was forced to stop, and the attackers  then opened fire on him. About three weeks ago Adm. Elegbede  was conferred with a chieftaincy title by the Oba of Lagos.</p>

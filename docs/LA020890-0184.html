			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PETITIONERS TRY TO DERAIL METRO RAIL TAX  </P> <P> Property owners hoping to escape millions of dollars in taxes intended for  construction of the second phase of the Metro Rail subway are trying to kill a  proposed assessment by forcing an election on it.  </P> <P> Some commercial landowners near planned Metro Rail stations in Hollywood,  Mid-Wilshire, North Hollywood and along Vermont Avenue say the tax, which could  raise $627 million over 19 years, should not be borne by them alone. They want  the RTD to poll an estimated 3,000 affected commercial property owners before  imposing the levy.  </P> <P> "We are talking about a question of taxation without representation," said  Andrew Miliotis, a Mid-Wilshire businessman circulating petitions that would  force the transit district to hold an election.  </P> <P> Thomas De Angelo, general manager of the Sheraton-Town House on Wilshire  Boulevard, said his hotel would be assessed $85,000 a year.  </P> <P> "We want Metro Rail, but we think the way they are financing the assessment is  unfair," De Angelo said. "It increases my real estate taxes 115% for 19 years.  This is why we are up in arms."  </P> <P> The RTD board heard complaints about the proposed tax several weeks ago at a  public hearing, but the board is expected to approve it today.  </P> <P> Regional transportation officials are nervous about the petition drives because  they say the tax is key to a $2.5-billion financing package for the 13.3-mile  subway extension, scheduled to begin running between MacArthur Park and North  Hollywood in 1998. Without the money, they said, construction could be delayed  or scaled back, or funding for other segments of the 150-mile rail network  could be jeopardized.  </P> <P> "Obviously, it would be serious," said Richard Stanger, director of rail  development for the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, which  oversees federal funding for Metro Rail. "The project may just have to be  completely rethought."  </P> <P> Gary S. Spivak, director of planning for the RTD, said a vote against the tax  would send officials back to the drawing board to find an alternative  assessment. The current proposal was fashioned by a 30-member task force  appointed by the RTD, including some property owners along the route.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, commercial property owners within one-half mile of 11  planned stations from Mid-Wilshire to North Hollywood would be subject to the  so-called "benefit assessment."  </P> <P> The tax, collected in 19 annual installments beginning in 2000, would enable  the RTD to issue $75 million in construction bonds. RTD officials estimate they  would need to collect between $376 million and $627 million in assessments to  finance and repay the bonds.  </P> <P> The RTD has divided the 13.3-mile stretch into five separate districts:  Mid-Wilshire, Vermont Avenue, Hollywood, North Hollywood and Universal City.  Under state law, the RTD is required to call an election in any of the  districts if landowners holding 25% of the assessed value of property demand a  vote.  </P> <P> Should property owners in any of the districts succeed in killing the tax, the  RTD will face the difficult task of making the assessments stick in the other  districts. Spivak said the RTD would move forward with plans in districts where  it is not defeated, but even the tax's strongest supporters say that would be a  hard sell.  </P> <P> "People would resent having to pay," said Larry Kaplan, president of the  Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which views Metro Rail as an important part of  Hollywood's revitalization. "It would be a problem."  </P> <P> Opponents of the tax have 30 days to collect the necessary signatures, although  there is some confusion as to when the 30-day period begins. Those gathering  signatures in Hollywood and Mid-Wilshire, acting on the advice of their  attorney, began the countdown on Jan. 20, the day the RTD board held the public  hearing on the proposal. The RTD said its attorneys have not made a ruling on  the issue.  </P> <P> After verifying signatures, the RTD would have 90 days to hold the election.  Only those property owners subject to the assessment could vote. Owners would  receive one vote for each $1,000 of assessed value, with a simple majority of  the votes prevailing.  </P> <P> If approved, the assessment would fall between 33 cents and 55 cents per square  foot annually and would affect an estimated 57 million square feet of property.  It would not apply to residential property or land owned and occupied by  nonprofit groups or government agencies. It would need to be approved by the  Los Angeles City Council and the county Board of Supervisors before becoming  law.  </P> <P> RTD officials say the proposed assessment is justified because studies in other  cities have shown that property owners near new subway stations enjoy higher  land values and easy accessibility. The RTD likens the tax to fees homeowners  and businesses typically pay for street lights, sewer systems and other public  benefits.  </P> <P> But a group of property owners near six planned stations in Mid-Wilshire and  Hollywood, calling themselves the Committee Opposed to Metro Rail Taxation,  question those studies. They say the $75 million should be raised from gasoline  taxes or other countywide measures since the entire Los Angeles area stands to  benefit from the subway, not just nearby property owners.  </P> <P> Transportation officials said there are no other sources of funds, unless they  take money intended for other segments of the regional network.  </P> <P> "We don't have money sitting around doing nothing," said Spivak. "The money is  committed."  </P> <P> Opposition to the tax has been greatest in Mid-Wilshire and Hollywood, but  petitions are also circulating in North Hollywood and along Vermont. There  apparently have been no efforts to begin a petition drive in the Universal City  district.  </P> <P> The Mid-Wilshire district includes planned stations on Wilshire Boulevard at  Vermont, Normandie and Western avenues; the Vermont Avenue district includes  stations at Beverly, Santa Monica and Sunset boulevards; the Hollywood district  would have stations on Hollywood Boulevard at Vine Street and Western and  Highland avenues; the Universal City district has one station near the  Hollywood Freeway and Lankershim Boulevard; and the North Hollywood district  has one station near Chandler and Lankershim boulevards.  </P> <P> Miliotis, a spokesman for opponents in Mid-Wilshire and Hollywood, said the  group already has about half the necessary signatures in Mid-Wilshire. The  drive there has been bolstered by support from two prominent business  organizations, the Wilshire Chamber of Commerce and the Wilshire Stakeholders  Group.  </P> <P> In Hollywood, signature gathering has been slower, in large part because there  are fewer large landowners and the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce has thrown its  support behind the assessment district.  </P> <P> "Look, nobody likes to pay taxes . . . but sometimes you have to bite the  bullet and you have to make an investment in the future," said Kaplan, the  chamber president.  </P></p>

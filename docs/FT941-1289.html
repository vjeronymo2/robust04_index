			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Executive upheaval lifts wages bill Sackings and resignations among the Volkswagen leadership contributed to a sharp rise in the loss-making group's boardroom wages bill last year. Payments to members of the management board rose by around 25 per cent, while remuneration and pensions for former directors more than doubled, according to the group's annual report, published yesterday. Although there were only seven directors at the end of 1993, compared with nine a year earlier, total boardroom remuneration rose to DM12.9m (Dollars 7.7bn) from DM10.2m. Mr Werner Schmidt, finance director, said he was not able to explain the increase. However, a spokesman later attributed the difference to the overlap effects of incoming and outgoing directors, which had markedly increased the number of monthly salary payments last year. He also noted that board members' pay had been cut 20 per cent this year, following the recent introduction of a four-day working week for the German workforce, accompanied by substantial pay cuts. According to the report, the group's supervisory board appeared to have taken its pay cuts last year, when its total remuneration fell from more than DM1m to DM190,000. Mr Schmidt said the numbers were too small to concern him. Golden handshakes for three departing main board directors are understood to have contributed to the jump, to DM16m, in payments to 'retiring' members, which are covered from provisions for current pensions. These provisions also rose, from DM78m to DM107m. Last year was marked by a bout of boardroom turmoil following the arrival in January of the new chairman, Mr Ferdinand Piech and his hiring of the controversial Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, General Motors' former global purchasing chief, in March. At the time, the company repeatedly denied reports of an excessive salary for the newcomer.</p>

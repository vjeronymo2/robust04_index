			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 8 (KCNA) -- The South Korean puppets  on June 6 and 7 committed a grave military provocation by  illegally introducing recoilless guns and large-calibre  machineguns into the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and staging a  shooting exercise against the North, military sources said.    On the 7th of June, they deployed 90 mm recoilless guns in  the DMZ under the nose of Komsa-ri, Chorwon County, and staged  an exercise of firing at a post of the North side.    Earlier, on the 6th, they brought many armed bandits and  large- calibre machineguns to the DMZ off Mt. Wolbi in Kosong  County in the eastern sector of the front, Jawon-ri, Phyonggang  County in the central sector and Imgang-ri, Jangpung County in  the western sector, inciting a war atmosphere.    The reckless introduction of heavy weapons and military  provocation by the South Korean puppets posed a grave threat to  the safety of the Korean People's Army soldiers who were on a  routine duty.    This is a deliberate and premeditated military provocation  designed to push to a higher pitch of strain the situation in  the DMZ where Armed Forces of the two sides are in acute  confrontation with the Military Demarcation Line in between.    The South Korean puppets must look squarely at the  developments in the DMZ, stop acting recklessly and pull the  illegally introduced armed bandits and all the heavy weapons out  of there at once.</p>

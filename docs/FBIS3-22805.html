They will not be allowed to deviate a single  inch from the determined route or take a closer look at an earth  mound or a tree at the giant plant. The strictly communist North  Korea will not allow any inspections of the site where the IAEA  expects underground secret nuclear plants to be located.    "We know that the two plants exist," IAEA spokesman David  Kyd  told KURIER. "They are clearly recognized on satellite  pictures. They are located right in the center of the Yongbon  site. "    However, North Korea denies everything categorically. The  plants in question are merely "military facilities."    In the seven declared nuclear plants to which the IAEA will  be granted access, North Korea cannot build an "atomic bomb" but  rather fissile material. "North Korea started its nuclear  program 20 years ago. We are absolutely certain that it  possesses more plutonium than Pyongyang admits," Kyd stressed.  Only 5-8 kg are needed to produce a single atomic bomb.    According to Kyd, the required pressure to ensure the  inspection of the two secret plants can only be exerted by the  United States. "The IAEA does not have any instruments; only  Washington has something to offer" -- that is economic aid for  the extremely poor North Korea or the U.S. promise to renounce  the large-scale maneuver, planned together with South Korea.

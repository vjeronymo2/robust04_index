			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Early rally falters before the close INVESTORS began to focus yesterday on the prospects for an interest rate cut from the Bundesbank on Thursday morning and the UK stock market tried to recover some of the ground lost over the past three trading sessions. But, with views on the chances of a cut in the German discount rate decidedly mixed, and the institutions still unwilling to chase share prices, early gains were halved before the close of business. The FT-SE Index ended the day at 3,049.3 for a net gain of 7.3, having touched 3,058.4 in early trading. Japanese and US investors continued to buy the blue chips, albeit selectively. Oil shares, which have underperformed the market over the past six months, came in for support. But pharmaceutical stocks, having at first continued to extend their recent recovery, ran into determined selling from the US in late trading. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index stuck determinedly to the bull tack on which the market opened and ended 6.8 up at 3,474.2. Increased interest in the second-line stocks was reflected in trading volume statistics. Around 64 per cent of the Seaq volume total of 539.5m shares involved non-Footsie shares. Declining institutional activity over the past few sessions was disclosed in Stock Exchange statistics for Monday's session, in which 546.8m shares traded through the Seaq network were worth only Pounds 1.16bn in retail or customer business worth; this figure is at the lower end of a daily range of retail business which has been as high as Pounds 1.9bn. this month. Although turnover was moderate, there was no shortage of activity by sector analysts. Some continued to look for further rights issues this year, with MB Caradon, Tarmac and Cadbury Schweppes among the suggested names. A favourable re-rating of ICI shares by a leading London investment bank encouraged sentiment at the close. There were signs yesterday that market strategists, few of whom raised their forecasts significantly when the stock market burst through the Footsie 3,000 mark a fortnight ago, were striking a warning note. The strategy team at NatWest Securities reminded clients that, with the UK government's November Budget fast approaching, 'the search is on for ways to increase revenues', and asked whether dividend tax credit might be reviewed. Noting that last month brought the first reversal of the bull run in recovery stocks, BZW said that since the next downward move in interest rates would probably be the last, it would sell high yielding stocks on the news. Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull, who recently raised his year-end Footsie forecast to 3,250, commented that rights issues could exceed Pounds 12bn in 1993, which he thought could well take up any spare institutional liquidity. However, yesterday's rally appeared to confirm that marketmaking firms, having been badly stung already by a shortage of stock in the market's leading stocks, are unlikely to allow share prices to fall far before coming in to pick up stock. The likelihood of rate cuts in Europe and in the UK is expected to keep the market firm, at least for the near term. But for the longer term, there are still concerns over inflation and corporate profits.</p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Shareholders demand US Shoe break-up A group of dissatisfied shareholders at US Shoe, an American clothing, optical and footwear retailer, is to propose at the group's annual meeting this spring that it be broken into three separately quoted companies. The suggestion has been submitted by private investors associated with Mr Alfred Kingsley, who runs Greenway Partners, a New York money management firm. Mr Kingsley has been trying to raise shareholder support for the scheme. His firm owns or has voting control over more than 4 per cent of US Shoe's stock, but has not held it long enough to file a proposal itself. Mr Kingsley, a former associate of Mr Carl Icahn, the corporate raider, argues that US Shoe's three divisions lack synergy. Mr Robert Burton, US Shoe's director of corporate communications, said its board planned to file a preliminary reply to it within a week. US Shoe has annual sales of around Dollars 2.7bn. The company has a lacklustre earnings record and is one of 10 poor performers being targeted for action during the annual company meeting season by the California Public Employees Retirement System, one of the largest and most aggressive investment funds in the US.</p>

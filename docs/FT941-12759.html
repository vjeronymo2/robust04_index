			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: France The newly independent Bank of France scores high marks for presentation. Choosing a 1994 money supply target close to the 4 to 6 per cent range established by the Bundesbank would have seemed barmy after last year's massive undershoot and the prospect of slow expansion again this year. Establishing a medium-term target around what is coincidentally the central point of the Bundesbank's present range keeps intact the theory of convergence. That is in itself an indication that the Bank of France does not intend to stray far from the Bundesbank on interest rates. The trouble with medium-term targets is that, while they prevent policy being unnecessarily influenced by short-term distortions, they also give the authorities the effective freedom to make decisions on the hoof. Since the shift of funds out of money market deposits will again make comparison of this year's M3 growth with the target meaningless, the Bank has to rely on other signals. One indicator which it is emphasising, the exchange rate, again underscores an attachment to Germany. The other, growth of total indebtedness in the economy, will provide an additional excuse for caution in cutting interest rates. That will not help exporters who are struggling to compete in European markets where currencies have been devalued. Nor will it create a propitious climate for the remaining privatisation programme.</p>

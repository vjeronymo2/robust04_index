			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / New guise for Russia's great survivor: 'World's worst central banker' is being seen in changed light Russia's top banker is a survivor above all else. Mr Victor Gerashchenko, chairman of the Russian central bank, has seen many efforts to remove him from his post. They have all failed. Sacked from the chairmanship of the Soviet State Bank after the August 1991 coup because he took advantage of it to try to impose some discipline over the bank's republican branches, he was back in office in under two weeks. Sacked again when the Soviet Union collapsed in December of the same year, he reappeared as Russian bank chairman by the middle of 1992. He was appointed, ahead of Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former deputy premier for finance, by Mr Yegor Gaidar, then the leader of economic reform in the cabinet. When Mr Fyodorov took over at the finance, ministry he quickly established the sourest relations with Mr Gerashchenko, blaming him for pushing up inflation through giving soft credits to enterprises. Last April, Mr Fyodorov's pressure was amplified (according to a Russian government adviser) by a request from President Bill Clinton to President Boris Yeltsin at the Vancouver summit that Mr Gerashchenko should go. Mr Yeltsin said, vaguely, he would look into it, and nothing was done. After another unsuccessful coup in October 1993, Mr Gaidar himself, with Mr Fyodorov, attempted to persuade Mr Yeltsin to fire Mr Gerashchenko, but he withstood the pressure. When resignations did take place in January of this year, it was Mr Gaidar and Mr Fyodorov who left, not Mr Gerashchenko. Thus the 'world's worst central banker', as Professor Jeffrey Sachs has called him, survived to have a joke about the nickname with Mr Michel Camdessus, the International Monetary Fund's managing director, in Moscow last week. Mr Camdessus, buoyed by the conditional agreement he had made with the Russian government to extend it a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1.02bn) loan, complimented the central bank for its commitment to tight monetary policies, and to reform. Has Mr Gerashchenko gone from the worst to, if not the best, at least the good? 'If he has indeed reined in the credits as much as is claimed in the first quarter, then it is a change,' said a western central banker last night. 'He has personality and clout,' says Mr Adrian Ball, head of the Morgan Grenfell office in Moscow. 'He is doing some very useful things, like persuading commercial banks to become sensible institutions. And he has always seen the need to keep money circulating.' Even his detractors say the finance ministry has been as active in printing money as Mr Gerashchenko, in order to cover government budget deficits. They admit, too, that the chairman has been between a rock and a hard place - that is, caught between fuelling inflation and causing bankruptcies and unemployment. The case against him is and has always been that, in advancing soft credits, he has prevented industrial restructuring. Now, however, Mr Camdessus at least seems satisfied that he is running a credit policy tighter even than that which the government recommends. But senior officials from the Group of Seven industrial countries believe there are good reasons of realpolitik for that. First, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister and Mr Gerashchenko's protector against all removal attempts, is now concerned at least to appear to run a tight policy. Three weeks ago, he berated Mr Gerashchenko in an enlarged cabinet meeting for downgrading the importance of the fight against inflation - a clear enough indication that the protection is, if not removed, conditional. Mr Chernomyrdin no longer needs Mr Gerashchenko as he did as a counterweight against the cabinet reformers: now the prime minister must himself struggle with the imponderables of the Russian economy, and needs an ally against inflation, not a stoker of it. Mr Gerashchenko's other great protector, the former Russian supreme soviet, has also gone. The present parliament has less clear powers over his appointment and could in any case choose one of their number for the job. Finally, Mr Gerashchenko has changed the bank, especially by bringing in some younger people at senior levels (he has a problem to match their pay with the relatively vast salaries of the commercial banks) and giving them their head. If he is almost certainly not a convert to tight money, he has one of the best senses for where power lies in Moscow; and while the man who runs the government wants to present a monetarist stance to the world, Mr Gerashchenko will oblige. 'He is a patriot in his way,' says the government adviser. 'He wants the country to remain great, he wants to re-establish links with the former Soviet republics to Russia's benefit and he wants to guard against social explosion. That appeals to Chernomyrdin because he's like that, too.' Mr Gerashchenko, with the unlikely accolade of the central bankers' central banker to add to less complimentary ones, is likely to remain part of the scene for a time yet.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Equities (12): London looks to year-end The first half of 1994 has delivered a drubbing to UK equities that will not quickly be forgotten, and the second quarter came to an end with little sign of a change in the climate. The problems, which started when the US Federal Reserve began tightening monetary policy in February, continued to grind away, and share prices fell as bond yields soared across Europe and in the US. The London stock market fell by about 5.4 per cent over the second quarter, or some 16 per cent from the peak recorded in early February. The fundamental tension between bond and equity yields has undermined other factors in UK equities, including signs of economic recovery and even the steady flow of dividend increases from British companies. Equity strategists have repeatedly pointed to the attractive valuations on good-quality equities, only to see their words swept aside by renewed 'volatility' in bond markets. The slaughter in the UK bond market has been largely caused by developments outside the UK. Constant worry about when the US Federal Reserve would tighten again have effectively outweighed downward trends in Germany and France. Britain, with its hopes for a final cut in base rates now replaced by fears that the next move will be upward, has often seemed helpless in the sway of decisions elsewhere. Bears would warn that share prices have further to fall. Higher interest rates may be just round the corner, and would affect a UK economic recovery still struggling to reach the man in the street. Consumer spending is still cautious rather than carefree, the housing market constantly disappoints, and unemployment remains a serious problem. The more rational underpinning for the bear argument, put by Mr Brian Hilliard, of Strauss Turnbull, the London securities arm of Societe Generale, is that fears of inflation have not been allayed and that 'the Fed will have to tighten policy further'. He sees the peak in US bond yields as unlikely to arrive until the end of the year, and 'probably later'. It is almost common ground in the UK stock market that equities will make no serious recovery until the bond market settles down. And the bond markets, in Europe and in the US, have had weakness in the US dollar added to their problems. However, even the most bearish analysts in London are prepared to put a time limit on their bearishness. Most believe that the FT-SE 100 index will recover ground before the end of the year as economic recovery, in the form of higher corporate earnings and dividends, makes its presence felt. economic recovery than most other countries in Europe. While this may imply the likelihood of higher domestic interest rates, a beleagured government can be expected to postpone them as long as possible. For the investment fund manager, the UK market is becoming a test of nerve rather than an area of rational endeavour. It is difficult to put cash into a market that can still move through a range of 1.5 per cent in a single session, and rise or fall by a net 2 per cent just by following gilt-edged securities. But a steady level of daily retail business totals of Pounds 1bn-plus indicates that there is no shortage of institutional money waiting for markets to settle down. If the Group of Seven countries can agree to calm the dollar, and if global bond markets can take a more rational view of inflation, UK equities have a great deal of ground to make up. But a dividend yield of over 4 per cent is unlikely to be neglected by investors for very long.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 11 Apr (MTI) -- During his trip to Fejer  county today, the prime minister was at a press conference where  he was asked whether the AWACS aircraft would have to leave  Hungary after NATO's Sunday attack on Bosnian Serb positions.    The reporter reminded the prime minister of his statement  made in February to foreign journalists -- that Hungary would  not like NATO's aircraft to use its airspace when bombing  military targets in Bosnia. The prime minister was also quoted  as saying that during an air attack the AWACS aircraft should  leave the country.    "Hungary's airspace has not been used for military actions  against Bosnian targets. And this is the key issue," the prime  minister said in his answer.    The February statement expressed Hungary's determination not  to allow its airspace to be used for concrete military actions  or controlling attacks on Serbia, he continued.    "We have received clear-cut guarantees that the function of  the AWACS aircraft will be only to monitor Bosnian airspace,"  the prime minister added.</p>

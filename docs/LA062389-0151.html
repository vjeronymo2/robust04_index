			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HIGH COURT STRIKES DOWN FEDERAL DIAL-A-PORN BAN;  </P> <P> FREEDOM OF SPEECH CITED IN 9-0 VOTE  </P> <P> The Supreme Court today struck down part of a federal law banning all sexually  explicit telephone message services on the ground that the dial-a-porn measure  went too far in restricting free-speech rights.  </P> <P> The year-old law designed to shield minors from pornography banned any "obscene  or indecent communication for commercial purposes" over interstate telephone  lines at any time of the day.  </P> <P> The high court voted 9 to 0 in ruling that indecent, sexually explicit messages  enjoyed constitutional free-speech protections and could not be banned, but at  the same time ruled by a 6-3 vote that obscene calls could be prohibited.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Can Remain in Business  </P> <P> Since the law had called for a total ban, the ruling means the dial-a-porn  industry -- which started in 1983 and generates an estimated $2 billion a year  -- can remain in business.  </P> <P> In fact, the 1988 law's total ban was never imposed because U.S. District Judge  A. Wallace Tashima in Los Angeles ruled it could be applied only to obscene --  not merely indecent -- phone messages.  </P> <P> Sable Communications, a California-based dial-a-porn company, had challenged  the law.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court in its opinion, and Congress when it passed the law, did not  define what constituted indecent or obscene telephone messages.  </P> <P> Callers of the dial-a-porn numbers hear a short taped, or sometimes a live,  sexually explicit message at a cost of several dollars a call.  </P> <P> The decision represented the second controversial high court ruling this week  that pitted an emotionally charged social issue against the freedom of speech  protections under the First Amendment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Flag Ruling  </P> <P> The Supreme Court on Wednesday overturned the conviction of a political  protester for burning the American flag during the 1984 Republican convention,  saying such activity was protected by the Constitution. The decision sparked a  storm of protest in Congress and criticism from President Bush.  </P> <P> The pornography law, which had been strongly supported by the Reagan and Bush  Administrations, provides for up to two years in prison and $500,000 in fines  for obscene messages and six months in prison and $50,000 in fines for indecent  messages.  </P> <P> "The ban on indecent telephone messages violates the First Amendment since the  law's denial of adult access to such messages far exceeds that which is  necessary to serve the compelling interest of preventing minors from being  exposed to the messages," Justice Byron R. White wrote for the court.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Fail-Safe Method'  </P> <P> "It may well be that there is no fail-safe method of guaranteeing that never  will a minor be able to access the dial-a-porn system," he said in the 15-page  opinion.  </P> <P> "For all we know from the record, the (government's) technological approach to  restricting dial-a-porn messages to adults who seek them would be extremely  effective, and only a few of the most enterprising and disobedient young people  will manage to secure access to such messages," he said.  </P></p>

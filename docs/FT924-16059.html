			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Survey of The New Towns of Britain (5): Inside the triangle  -The North-West IT IS the motorway network which explains the rationale, location and the success of north-west England's four new towns. The network is probably the most comprehensive in Britain and puts Manchester, Liverpool and Preston within about 45 minutes of each other. The new towns - Warrington, Runcorn, Skelmersdale and Central Lancashire - have filled in the triangle which these main regional centres form. The triangle has Preston at its apex and Liverpool and Manchester at the other two corners. It is bisected by the M6 and has the M62 transpennine motorway running along a double baseline with the M56, which runs parallel to it south of the Mersey. The network as a whole has been gradually developed over the last 25 years and most of its links are now complete. The new towns have been built on existing communities at strategic nodes of the motorway network. For example, Warrington is at the crossover point of the M6 and M62, while Runcorn is on the M56 near where the Mersey and Manchester Ship Canal are crossed by road and rail bridges. All are in the M6 corridor, Skelmersdale at the motorway's junction with the M58 link to the Port of Liverpool and Central Lancashire - comprising mainly Leyland and Chorley - actually straddling the motorway, with its eastern sections fitting neatly between the M6 and the M61. The result is that people living in Warrington, Skelmersdale, Leyland, Chorley or Runcorn can commute easily almost anywhere in the region; rush-hour queues on all the motorways suggest that many do. Finding work locally is, therefore, not necessarily crucial, although all the new towns have fared reasonably well in being able to provide it. Location has been the crucial benefit to offer inward investors. Financial assistance has also helped - and still does in Runcorn, which is in the Merseyside catchment area for special selective assistance. This has helped attract several US and German companies. However, the investment record of companies around Warrington in particular emphasises the value of quick access to markets by road, rail or through Manchester Airport, only 20 minutes away. A circle of 200 miles radius drawn on Warrington takes in 97 per cent of Britain's population; the distribution industry was quick to take advantage of the benefit, as Warrington's vast complexes of warehouses prove. Total population growth in the four towns has been dramatic: they had a little over 395,000 people between them when the programme started but the latest figures show them now approaching 560,000, a rise of more than 40 per cent. Many are young married couples raising new families. Not everything has been wonderful: the late Sir James Stirling, the celebrated architect, had a notorious failure at Runcorn, where a large public sector housing estate designed for Liverpool's overspill became known as 'Legoland'. Crime-ridden, and with social and constructional defects, it had to be abandoned. Skelmersdale also had problems, including vandalism, now largely solved by redesigning the configuration of housing estates to encourage neighbourliness. Whether the new towns genuinely create new jobs in a region or just relocate them from old conurbations such as Merseyside and Greater Manchester has always been a moot point among politicians. However, the list of companies based there is impressive and many would almost certainly have never expanded in, say, Liverpool, had the new towns not been there. Warrington and Runcorn - which combined their previously separate new town administrations in 1981 - claim 63,000 new jobs, many at such giants as Digital Equipment, Goodyear, Coca-Cola, Nacanco, Guinness, Nestle, YKK Fasteners, British Nuclear Fuels, the UK Atomic Energy Authority, Securicor, Schreiber, British Gypsum, Rowntree Mackintosh and Safeway. This is a comprehensive spread for two towns known chiefly for chemicals, brewing and making wires. Moreover, the big companies support a network of suppliers or - in the case of the nuclear industry - high tech service, design or consultancy businesses staffed by highly paid professionals who make a disproportionate contribution to the local tax base and spending power. Skelmersdale, once a small community of 10,000 people between Ormskirk and Wigan, is now more than four times bigger and has created 12,000 jobs in sectors such as automotive, electrical and chemical engineering, electronics, textiles, plastics, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, food processing, banking and distribution. Leyland and Chorley already had an automotive industry - a troubled one - but the Commission for the New Towns says there are 18,000 new jobs there, in spite of the restructuring that has hit the buses and truck industries. Foreign investment has come from the US, Germany, Japan, France and Portugal.</p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitive EIS seeks Pounds 24m to rebuild cash balances EIS, the specialist engineering company, yesterday tapped shareholders for Pounds 24.4m through a 1-for-5 rights issue designed to rebuild cash balances for a fresh round of acquisitions. The company also announced a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 14.2m to Pounds 15.1m for the 12 months to end-December on the back of a 6 per cent rise in sales to Pounds 202m. Earnings per share fell to 27.26p (28.24p). A final dividend of 8.775p makes a 12p (11.7p) total. The rights issue - underwritten by SG Warburg at 340p - comes less than two years after EIS last went to shareholders at a price of 265p. The company's share price closed down 25p yesterday at 388p. Mr Peter Haslehurst, chief executive, said the group found it was a distinct advantage to negotiate with potential sellers of companies when they could see EIS had cash with which to pay for the purchase. COMMENT EIS has enjoyed a reputation for conservatism and acquiring wisely. There is, however, a limit to the amount shareholders will want to stump up without seeing the benefit in earnings growth. Spending the proceeds of the latest rights quickly will avoid too much dilution this year, but the group is clearly going to need to look at bigger fish if its next acquisitions are to justify management effort and make an imprint on profits. As most of the recent purchases have been of small loss-making companies, EIS might therefore be moving into riskier territory. On the other hand, the group is now well positioned to pick up any specialist engineers that stumble as they emerge from recession. With profits expected to rise to about Pounds 16m this year, or 27p of earnings, the group is on a sub-market prospective multiple of about 14  - a correct level until investors catch sight of EIS's shopping list.</p>

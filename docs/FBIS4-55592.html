			<p>BFN     [Text] Brcko, May 17 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslem and Croat  forces on Tuesday attacked Bosnian Serb positions in an attempt  to cut off the Serb land corridor in the Posavina region near  Brcko in northern Bosnia. Around 15:00 hours local time on  Tuesday, Moslem forces fired 15 82-mm shells on Serb positions  in Begovaca in the Brcko area, Bosnian Serb army sources said in  a statement. The Bosnian Serb army did not return fire, it said.    Croat units in Orasje, Posavina, opened fire from  anti-aircraft machine guns and anti-tank weapons on Serb  settlements of Lesnici and Jenjici, the statement said, adding  that the Serb side again did not return fire. Croatian and  especially Moslem forces have massed heavily armed units around  Brcko, a town which is situated in the narrowest part of the  Serb land corridor linking the eastern and western parts of the  Bosnian Serb republic. Moslem and Croat military commanders  have announced an offensive on this part of the Serb corridor.    Earlier this month, Moslem forces launched artillery attacks  on central Brcko, killing four civilians and wounding 15, which  was confirmed by monitors of the United Nations Protection Force  (UNPROFOR).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, "official in </F> charge of planning and international cooperation in the  Palestinian National Authority Council", in Gaza; by Ashraf  'Abd-al-'Aziz, in Cairo; date not given; from the "Dialogue From  Afar" program -- recorded]    [Text] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What are the real reasons that made  you cancel your visit to Jerusalem, which was planned for  yesterday?    [Sha'th] Actually, there were two reasons. First, I had to  return to Gaza to handle some issues, which would have made my  trip to Jerusalem very short and I like to have enough time to  see Jerusalem. Also I must add that the mere announcement of my  trip to Jerusalem caused an enormous uproar in Israeli rightist  circles and maybe in some Israeli Government circles. I was  told that there were threats and there would be disturbances if  I went to Jerusalem and that this would require my protection by  1,000 Israeli policemen. I do not want to go to Jerusalem under  the protection of Israeli policemen and this was another reason  for postponing my visit to a later date.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] You had talks in Jericho yesterday with  members of the Palestinian side. What happened in these talks?    [Sha'th] In fact, Jericho City differs from Gaza and this  should be noted clearly. In Gaza, the Israeli forces left the  greater part of the Gaza Strip, which is populated by one  million people who never see an Israeli and are not subjected to  any friction with the Israeli authorities. Gaza is rife with  security and peace.    As for Jericho, the Israeli authorities are almost besieging  the city and a number of roadblocks delay movement between the  two parts of Jericho--Jericho and Nizzana. I spent a whole hour  forcing the Israeli roadblock to open to let me pass along the  main road between Jericho and Nizzana. I traveled by road to  Allenby Bridge to be sure myself of what I had been told.  Indeed, I became certain that the Israeli authorities prevent  trucks and tourist buses from entering Jericho. This means that  1,200 tourists are barred from Jericho every day, which actually  means an economic catastrophe for this small city. When they  set up roadblocks between Jericho and Nizzana, they bar  agricultural goods from entering the market, which also means  catastrophe.    The situation in Jericho is very worrying, because the  Israeli authorities there are not implementing the agreement we  had signed and are implementing it only in Gaza. The aim of my  trip to Jericho was to acquaint myself first hand with these  problems and to forward my demands to the Israeli leadership and  say that things cannot go on like this in Jericho. I also spent  the night with the liberated brothers whom the Israeli forces  kept in Jericho City wrongly and in violation of the agreement.  I visited all places to learn first hand how we can avert these  problems so that Jericho can enjoy the same freedom, dignity,  and security which Gaza enjoys.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] I have in front of me a statement in which  you accuse Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin of committing  flagrant violations of the peace accord that he signed with the  PLO. How true is this statement?    [Sha'th] Yes, the statement is true and I said that they  prevented me from going to Allenby Bridge and Nizzana City which  is an inseparable part of the Jericho area. I experienced these  violations first-hand. The agreement does not give them the  right to set up any roadblocks between Jericho and Nizzana or  between Jericho and Allenby Bridge. It does not give them the  right to besiege Jericho and prevent the entry of vegetables or  tourists to the city, nor the right to an economic (?blockade)  and strangulation of the city. There are also other violations;  they are behind in the issue of the prisoners, which I have  mentioned. They should have released 5,000 by now and there are  still about 1,000 who have not been released.    They have withdrawn on time and the Palestinian police  forces  also entered on time but there are other violations that have to  be stopped immediately if we want the peace process to advance  and succeed.    ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What about Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat's return to the Palestinian territories?    [Sha'th] There are many considerations governing this and we  hope he will be among us soon. But frankly, after visiting  Jericho, I join those who advocate the postponement of his  arrival until these problems have been resolved. I cannot  imagine President 'Arafat facing what I saw with my own eyes in  Jericho today. Of course, 'Arafat's trip will not be limited to  Gaza and he is bound to go to Jericho. We have to solve these  problems, face these Israeli violations, and tell the Israelis  that they should rectify the situation. The entire world and  the Israelis themselves must see that the situation has been  corrected if they want this process to be a success. Once we  resolve these problems, I believe that the arrival of brother  Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] will be desirable from all aspects.</p>

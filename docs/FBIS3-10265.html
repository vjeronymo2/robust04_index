Escorted by the International Red Cross and  nongovernmental organizations, the delegates left the San  Cristobal de las Casas Cathedral, 1,200 km southeast of Mexico  City, for their hometowns. These delegates will inform their  communities about the results of their dialogue with Camacho  Solis in which they received promises to meet their economic,  political, and social demands for upgrading the living standard  of the Indians.    The results of nine days of talks at the cathedral require  the approval of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and local  Indian communities before they can be transformed into a peace  agreement.    As he saw off eight of the 19 delegates in San Miguel  Ocosingo, Camacho Solis insisted on implementing initial  agreements on meeting the needs of the Indians to avoid loosing  the hope and trust achieved during the dialogue. "At this time  no one can fail to honor his word because that would actually be  tantamount to failing Mexico," the commissioner said as he saw  off the delegates headed by "Subcommander Marcos," military  chief of the armed group.    The dialogue began on 21 February to find a political  solution to the conflict the group initiated on the first day of  this year to present Indian demands by occupying towns and  attacking the military. This forced the Mexican Army to  intervene.    In Las Margaritas delegate "Juan" also urged those involved  to comply with the agreements to avoid putting "distance between  the two parties."</p>

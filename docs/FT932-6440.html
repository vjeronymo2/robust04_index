			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Management: Tough act to copy - Barry Romeril is leaving BT to head Xerox finance. Lucy Kellaway talks to him about achievement and style Barry Romeril is not yet 50. Quickly and with little fuss he has risen up and out of ICI and BTR to become one of the most powerful people in one of Britain's biggest companies. He was made finance director of BT five years ago, and now, despairing of the log jam on the way to the very top of that company, is trying his luck across the Atlantic. At the end of next month he becomes chief financial officer of Xerox Corporation. It is still almost unheard of for a US company to parachute a foreigner into a senior position. Companies such as Morgan Guaranty, and Philip Morris have been run by British executives, but most of these have worked their way up in the US and become naturalised citizens. Romeril, by comparison, was approached by a US head hunter. Insiders at BT speculate that Romeril's nose was put out of joint by the appointment in 1991 of the equally youthful Michael Hepher as managing director, a position which Romeril would have liked for himself. They also refer to the appetite for creative tension of BT's chairman Ian Valance: Romeril was meant to report to him, yet to support Hepher. They also question whether the move counts as promotion. After all BT, which is a larger company, faces increasingly exciting challanges as its old monopoly position is undermined and as it ventures into new businesses and areas. In conversation, Romeril keeps his cards more or less glued to his chest, and brushes aside such speculation. 'I was tempted by the fact that it was in the US and that the job itself was more than interesting', he says. So he took it, simple as that. On the face of it, Romeril might seem a surprising choice for Xerox. Direct almost to the point of being blunt, he is also low-profile. While Xerox is known for its enthusiastic espousal of the latest in management fashions - it was an early convert to total quality management, to benchmarking, and is now leading the way in creating small-is-beautiful organisations - Romeril is a graduate of the no-nonsense school of management. A colleague tells the story that when asked to recite BT's four core values - which employees are meant to eat for breakfast with their cornflakes - he could not name one. 'People who spend a lot of time reading management books may not be good managers', he says. 'The guts of management is about common sense. Excellence comes - as Owen Green (of BTR) once said - in making ordinary people do extraordinary things'. Despite a certain lack of charisma, Romeril has left a large imprint on BT's corporate culture. He is seen in the City as a formidable cutter of costs, although perhaps a little lacking in vision. However, insiders argue that this understates his contribution. 'Barry taught everyone that they must always consider the financial impact of every sale, which was a revelation to some people. Valance, as a GPO man, always wanted to build wonderful new networks from scratch. Barry convinced him that, by tweaking the existing network, almost the same result could be obtained, at a fraction of the cost,' says one colleague. Romeril agrees that he has helped change the way the company thinks. 'Too many decisions were made on the basis that him up there wants it. What I have sought to do is bring a commercial attitude to the way the company approaches its business.' In so doing, he has raised the status of his job. 'My style of being a finance director is to be very much involved in business decisions', he says, arguing that accounting and fundraising are more a specialist part of the job than its very core. Romeril is regarded by some as a hatchet man: he was involved in the mass lay offs at ICI in the early 1980s as well as the present wave of redundancies at BT. About job losses he is unsentimental, verging on the unsympathetic. 'You would be surprised at the number of people who left with generous or fairly generous terms, who said later that it was the best thing that had ever happened to them,' he says. Romeril's general approach to business may make him more at home in the US - where he has spent much time for all of his three employers - than in the UK. He is an advocate of the US attitude that says tomorrow is the first day of the rest of my life, and the 'can do' mentality. 'Over here, managers are inclined to slip into a more discursive and debating approach. I believe that in management you make up your mind what you want to do. Once the decision has been made, you go, do. Too much management time in Britain is spent revisiting decisions'. Would he still make that criticism of BT? Romeril hesitates, and then says that, although the tendency is there, it is less strong than it used to be. At Xerox, Romeril's function is to remain broad: he is to be in charge of business strategy and business development as well as finance. He is undaunted by the fact that the copier market is unknown to him. In any case, he is used to making career changes, and cites his own breadth of experience as part of his strength. 'The variety gives one a better nose for the fallacious argument or for the manager who is most likely to succeed.' The money at Xerox will also be better. His base salary will be about the same, but he will have the rich menu of performance-related stock incentives, options, and bonus schemes to which US executives have become accustomed. Does he fear that as a foreigner in a US corporation his progress will be stopped by a glass ceiling? Absolutely not: 'Xerox is a truly multinational company which wants to reflect in its mangement appointments the nature and diversity of its business.' Romeril is ambitious, and sees no virtue in trying to hide the fact. 'Responsibility at middle and senior levels is as much taken as given', he says. 'If you wait to be told what to do, you'll never reach the top.' He suggests that one area in which people should take on responsibility is to criticise others, and if they make enemies in doing so that is inevitable. 'No one can get to the top on a universally friendly pattern', he says, shrugging.</p>

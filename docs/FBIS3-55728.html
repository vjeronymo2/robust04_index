			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 10 TASS -- The leaders of major  Russian parliament factions have not adopted the final decision  on the candidate to the post of the State Duma speaker, but  succeeded in "working out the concept of approach to this  issue," Viktor Zerkaltsev, a communist lawmaker told ITAR-TASS.    He said the factions have decided not to disclose the  preliminary agreements on this issue, but did not deny that the  Communist Party would not claim the speaker's post as "it does  not consider itself to be a small faction".    The leaders of the four biggest factions agreed that the  post  of the speaker should be occupied by the representative of "a  neutral small faction" while all the big factions will get the  posts of deputy speakers, according to a statement made by  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic  Party. But on January 7 leaders of the Russia's Choice bloc  abandoned the talks on the question.    Zerkaltsev regards this decision of the Russia's Choice bloc  as "surprising". Until recently the bloc "though not accepting  the candidates still agreed with the conception of choosing the  speaker", he pointed out. He believes that the chairman of the  State Duma will be elected on the second day of the session.  Otherwise the process will become endless, Zerkaltsev stressed.</p>

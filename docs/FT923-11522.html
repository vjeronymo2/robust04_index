			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Wellcome bolsters demand for issue: Drugs group will not sell shares below 800p WELLCOME Trust, the charity which is selling around half its 73.5 per cent stake in Wellcome, the drugs group, said yesterday that it would not sell shares below 800p. It also said it would set the size of the issue with the aim of creating a successful aftermarket. Robert Fleming, the merchant bank handling the global share sale, also reported progress in identifying dealers who had sold Wellcome shares short, thus pushing the price down and reducing the likely proceeds to the trust. Although selling short is perfectly legal, there is some anger that these dealers have profited at the trust's expense and they will not be allocated stock in the sale, forcing them to buy in the market to close their short positions. One fund management group whose name was thrown up by Section 212 notices sent out by the company was EBC AMRO International Investment Management. Its pattern of dealings since May shows large sales of Wellcome shares and then purchases at lower prices. The trust's announcement was designed to bolster demand for the global tender for the shares which closes at 5pm in London today. By suggesting that supply of stock will be limited, the trust might encourage bidders for stock to ask for more in anticipation of being scaled down. Some institutions increased bids following the announcement. The shares rose 2p to 830p yesterday. Investors putting in tender offers have to 'go firm' by the 5pm close. At that point their bids must either state a fixed price in pence or be good at the strike price set by the trust on the basis of demand for shares. The strike price will be set over the weekend and trading will begin on Monday morning. Fund managers in the UK yesterday were positive about the shares. One said of the company: 'Fundamentally it's a very sound story. It's an attractive issue.' He said he expected the shares to perform well in the aftermarket. Another said: 'We are positive about the sector and the company.' He aimed to put bids in accepting the price set by the Trust. In June the trust indicated that it would sell 330m shares, but reserved the right to increase or reduce the issue size. Originally it said it could sell as many as 417m shares which would cut its stake to 25 per cent. It has said it would not proceed with the sale if could not reduce its holding to below 50 per cent.

They have held extensive meetings to  become familiarized with current situation in Cuba. (Ernest  Whasthle), member of the presidency of the committee of the  party and senator of the Federal German Parliament, gave his  opinion on the blockade that for more than three decades the  United States has imposed on Cuba:    [Begin (Whasthle) recording in German with  passage-by-passage  translation into Spanish] Our delegation agrees that this  embargo should be eliminated in the interest of the Cuban  people, and we will do everything we can to contribute to the  lifting of the U.S. embargo. However, we must stress that we do  not have enough pull to influence the decisions made by the U.S.  Government.    However, I can say that we agree with the many groups, some  of which are in the United States, that think the embargo should  be eliminated. [end recording]    The Social Democratic Party delegation from northern Hessen  visited Santiago de Cuba Province where they held meetings and  talks to strengthen future relations.    [Begin (Whasthle) recording in German with  passage-by-passage translation into Spanish] We selected  Santiago de Cuba for our meetings for a definite reason. This  region and ours have similar structures. We have conducted a  very broad and constructive political dialogue. This dialogue  should be continued at the provincial level. We also expect that  our visit serves to encourage the Social Democratic Party to  establish ties at a higher level. [end recording]    During their stay, the delegation visited several  institutions and economic and social centers of interest, which  will allow them to have a panoramic view of the current Cuban  situation.</p>

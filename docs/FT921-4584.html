			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Many fund managers see hung parliament UK FUND managers remain convinced the Conservatives will emerge as the strongest single party in the UK House of Commons after the general election, although a significant number now foresee a hung parliament, according to the latest survey by Smith New Court, the UK securities house, and the Gallup polling organisation. Managers are optimistic about the outlook for domestic interest rates and inflation but slightly less bullish on UK equities than when last polled. A balance of 30 per cent of managers intend to reduce holdings in US equities, which are widely seen in London as over-valued at current levels on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. For this week's budget speech from Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, the 101 institutions surveyed, which handle funds worth Pounds 523bn, are in broad agreement. An overall net tax reduction of around Pounds 3bn, including a 1p cut in basic rate income tax, accords with the general view in the City of London. However, many managers reiterated alarm signalled last week in the bond and currency markets over the outlook for the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR). The consensus is that the chancellor will on Tuesday announce a PSBR of Pounds 23bn for 1992-1993. But 5 per cent of those surveyed fear a PSBR estimate of Pounds 30bn or more. Increasing concern over the outlook for US equities displayed in the survey was counterbalanced by enthusiasm towards continental European equity markets where 38 per cent of managers plan to increase their holdings. While opinions on UK equities remained positive, the net 10 per cent of managers taking the bullish view had fallen from a net 17 per cent in January. On longer-term prospects, 75 per cent of the survey was bullish on the outlook for UK market over the next 12 months, while for Japan, the balance on the positive side was 73 per cent and for Europe 49 per cent. A balance of 2 per cent is bearish for the US equity markets for the year ahead. UK optimism is based on expectations that the economic background will improve this year. Managers believe that in 12 months base rates will be down to 9.2 per cent from the present 10.5 per cent, while yields on 15-year high coupon government bonds will have fallen to 8.9 per cent.</p>

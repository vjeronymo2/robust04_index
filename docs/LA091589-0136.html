			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THREE CHEERS: PIONEERING POLICE PILOT HAS HOVERED ABOVE HUNTINGTON BEACH FOR  DECADES  </P> <P> Huntington Beach Police Lt. Robert Morrison, 58, who founded the city's Aero  Bureau and has logged more than 2,700 hours as a pilot in a police patrol  helicopter, will retire today after more than 30 years of police work.  </P> <P> Morrison, who has served with Huntington Beach since 1966, was one of the first  two pilots to fly helicopters for the city in 1968. Huntington Beach was the  first city in Orange County and fifth city in the United States to initiate a  helicopter patrol program.  </P> <P> "Looking back, law enforcement has been very rewarding. There has not been a  day that I got out of bed and didn't look forward to going to work," said  Morrison, who lives in Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> San Clemente resident Mo Tidemanis, a development firm executive, has been  appointed to the board of directors of the Boys and Girls Club of the South  Coast Area.  </P> <P> "Mo's dedication to the youth in this area and to the San Clemente community  enhances the high level of our current board members," said Kent Campbell,  executive director of the club.  </P> <P> Cheryl Bingham, 20, and Christine Bingham, 43, of Yorba Linda were named  winners of the recent California Mother-Daughter Pageant in Hollywood, sharing  the $3,000 first prize. Each also received a new dress.  </P> <P> It was the first time either of the Binghams had entered a beauty pageant. "I  thought it sounded like a new and exciting experience and it was," said the  mother, a tax accountant and part-time model. Her daughter, a student at Cal  State Fullerton, is also a model.  </P> <P> Anaheim Hills resident Craig Miller, owner of the Anaheim-based American  National Watermattress Corp., was inducted into the Waterbed Retailers Assn.'s  Hall of Fame at its convention in Memphis.  </P> <P> The 1,500-member association, based in Chicago, cited Miller for 24 years of  work for the group as well as his charitable work and enterprise. It was only  the seventh time that a Hall of Fame induction has been made by the water-bed  association.  </P> <P> "Craig built a successful manufacturing business from a two-bit garage  operation," the citation states.  </P> <P> Supervisor Thomas F. Riley will be presented with an Open Space Award from the  Landscape Architectural Foundation/Class Fund at its fourth annual award  banquet Oct. 12 at the Irvine Hilton and Towers.  </P> <P> Banquet chairman Francis Sullivan said the award is being presented to Riley  for his outstanding contributions to the preservation and development of public  open space.  </P> <P> Capistrano Beach residents Betty and George Wakeling, founders of Concept 7, a  family service for abused and neglected children, were honored for their years  of work at a champagne reception aboard the yacht Dulcinea.  </P> <P> Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) presented the Wakelings with a  congressional award and a letter from President Bush and his wife, who cited  the couple for their "years of service to your fellow man. . . . "  </P> <P> The Wakelings have been with Concept 7 for 17 years.  </P> <P> Garden Grove schoolteachers Barbara Barker, Jack Sorter, Ed Peterson, Margaret  Duhamel, Jan Burwell, Carol Schnitger and Lynne Saito will be honored with I  Make a Difference awards from the Garden Grove Education Assn. at a recognition  banquet Thursday. The seven recipients were selected for their volunteer work  and community involvement.  </P> <P> Wes Bannister, mayor of Huntington Beach, will be presented the Exploring  Community Service award by the Orange County Council, Boy Scouts of America, in  recognition of his service to youth. The presentation will take place at a  dinner Oct. 11 at the Seacliff Country Club in Huntington Beach.  </P> <P>  Submit items to Three Cheers, The Times, c/o Herbert J.

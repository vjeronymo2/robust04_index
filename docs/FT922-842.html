			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Arts: English National Ballet It was a brave move on the part of English National Ballet to open a brief Coliseum season with a programme of new works - and with tickets at half the usual prices. The ballet audience is in decline, put off by the inhibiting cost of seats, and hence not prepared to gamble on the unknown. Thus the ghastly predictabilities, and predictable box-office returns, of safe titles and full-length ballets whose name is more important than choreographic merit. I cannot say if ENB's gamble on Tuesday and Wednesday with five new pieces will be justified in the accounts, for all the economy of the stagings, but it is treasure in Heaven for a troupe that has looked artistically blinkered of late. There were two creations for the company, Kim Brandstrup's White Nights and Robert North's A Stranger I Came. Brandstrup takes as his starting point a Dostoievsky story of a man obsessed with a girl whom he meets while she is waiting vainly for her lover. Brandstrup opens out the tale: his hero is a photographer, recording life rather than living it, until this meeting turns him from dispassionate observer into passionate player. The narrative develops by being intercut with scenes in which the man photographs groups of young lovers. Brandstrup studied film at Copenhagen University, and his dance works often suggest cinematic structure. The action flows, then lingers on incident. Revelatory images spring vividly from a long shot of the narrative; dreams (the girl's longing for her lover; the photographer's feelings for the girl) shadow each moment of the drama. I find the resultant work allusive, haunting. Brandstrup's ability to fix emotion with gesture is wonderfully exact; his choreographic language is fluent, clear and true. Kevin Richmond, as the photographer, gives a performance beautifully judged both in its intensity and in its control; Josephine Jewkes is no less fine as the girl. The score is by Gerard McBurney, based on piano fragments by Mussorgsky; minimal, efficient design is by Fotini Dimou. Josephine Jewkes and Kevin Richmond also take leading roles in Robert North's A Stranger I Came. Seven Schubert songs provide a basis for a study in high Romantic despair as Thomas Edur wanders the world, unhappy in love (Miss Jewkes the woman), his every step dogged by his doppelganger fate (Mr Richmond). North's choreography has a directness of response to the score that disarms our suspicions that the songs are not to be so arbitrarily used (the musical desolation of Die Leiermann is dissipated in character capers), and the cast respond with no less direct interpretations. Edur is superb, an Apollonian premier danseur who uses the classical vocabulary as his native tongue, and can speak of feeling as well as of the beauties of academic propriety. Here he gives the dance a Schubertian dignity and poignancy. The remaining pieces in this programme were lighter in weight. From the American choreographer David Parsons two clever jokes. The Envelope is about an un-put-downable, inescapable letter, that passes among seven dancers and won't go away, while fragments from Rossini overtures goad the quirky movement ever onward. Sleep Study is about seven pyjama-ed people who behave as insomniacs will know only too well: twitching, turning, lying on their backs, sides, on each other, prey to every known form of fidget. Non-dance as dance, and great fun. Both pieces are short, impeccably timed by creator and interpreters. And to close the evening, L, a choreographic tribute to Liza Minnelli from Ben Stevenson. It proposes 13 men, three percussionists, and a torrent of trick steps and show-biz cliches that make it a mockery of male dancing as anything save cheap-jack physicality. It was singularly unexhilarating, and unflattering to its cast. English National Ballet is at the Coliseum until June 27</p>

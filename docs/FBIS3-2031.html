Speaking at a press conference this afternoon, U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor called the Super 301 a "strong  market opening tool" which was to "complement our market opening  efforts and to establish trade priorities."    As early as November 1991, during the presidential campaign,  Clinton pledged to reinstate the trade law, which was called  America's ultimate weapon in forcing trade concessions from  foreign countries.    "It should be clearly understood we are not designating or  identifying any practice of any country today, rather, we are  putting in place the Super 301 procedure." Kantor stressed to  reporters.    In 1994 and 1995, Kantor said, the U.S. Trade Representative  Office will identify unfair trade practices of the priority  countries by September 30, six month after the annual trade  estimate report on March 31.    Twenty one days after the September 30 identification,  priority countries will become the subjects of U.S.  investigation on unfair trade practices.    The first step, Kantor explained, is the consultation in  effort to eliminate barriers to the U.S.. If no agreement is  reached, further U.S. investigation will be conducted which  might lead to trade sanctions.    The Super 301, Kantor said, was a "flexible instrument" and  an "early warning." "Our goal is to eliminate all the major  trade barriers around the world which block market access for  our products and services. No one should doubt our commitment  to move forward," he said.    The trade representative stressed, meanwhile, that Super 301  was a message to "any country" which practices unfair trade with  the U.S..    "Japan is unique among developed nations in maintaining  trade  barriers, it could have impact on Japan and other countries,"  Kantor said.</p>

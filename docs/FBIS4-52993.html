			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 12 (KCNA) -- A scientific symposium on  the reunification of Korea was held here today.    Speeches were made on the subjects of "formation of 'two  Koreas'", "present status of the Korean question and prospect of  its settlement" and so on.    The speakers pointed out that the division of Korea, a  product of the "cold war", was caused by the moves of big  powers, the United States in particular.    They said that President Kim Il-song called a joint  conference of political parties and public organizations in the  North and the South of Korea to prevent the division of the  country, initiated building a democratic unified state and later  put forward the three principles of national reunification, the  proposal for founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of  Koryo and 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole  nation, thus opening a bright vista for the reunification of the  country.    They noted that the proposal for reunification through  confederacy and the 10-point programme, advanced by President  Kim Il-song, are a reunification proposal acceptable to  everybody because they reflect the will common to the nation,  and the proposal and the programme are positively supported by  the world's people as well as the Korean people.    Referring to the prospect of Korea's reunification, the  speakers said Korea should be reunified by the Korean people  themselves without outside interference.    They held that Korea must become one unified state.</p>

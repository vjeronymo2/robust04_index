			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Critical Control Points  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Consistent with the HACCP principles identified by NACMCF,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.6(b)(2) that critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control points be identified for each of the hazards that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor or importer has identified. Hazards may be caused by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improper processing or by events outside the processor's or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importer's direct control. To control the latter type of hazard,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is, environmental hazards and hazards that may be caused by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poor handling prior to receipt of fish or fishery products by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor or importer, the point of receipt by the processor or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importer represents a critical control point. As indicated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously in this preamble, the processor or importer may need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to ensure that it obtains imported shipments or raw materials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only from harvesters, transporters, and others who can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate that they also have exercised appropriate controls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The hazards that may be caused by both improper processing and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> events outside the plant are controlled by the critical limits,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring, control procedures, and recordkeeping that are done  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as part of HACCP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Critical Limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In &sect;123.6(b)(3), consistent with NACMCF principles, FDA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing that processors and importers identify critical limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the plan that must be met at each critical control point.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Critical limits must be met to ensure that the relevant hazard is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> avoided. Thus, some critical limits can be set to reflect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory levels established by FDA in the form of action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels, regulatory limits, and tolerances for such contaminants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as pesticides, histamine, and other contaminants. FDA intends to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compile all such levels in the guidance document described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> earlier.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other critical limits can be set in consultation with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outside experts, in keeping with the longstanding practice for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> low acid canned foods. For example, as explained later in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preamble with respect to cooked, ready-to-eat products, there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exist a range of possible cooking time-temperature combinations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that will deactivate pathogens during the cooking step, depending  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the type of equipment being used by the processor and the size  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and species of fish being cooked. The existence of a range of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective cooking time-temperature combinations convinced FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not to establish specific cooking time-temperatures for industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the regulations for low acid canned foods. Rather, FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decided to rely on outside experts and on research within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scientific community to establish cooking times and temperatures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for these products. FDA is not proposing specific cooking time-temperature requirements for most seafood products (although FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is providing guidance on time, temperature, and salinity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parameters for smoked and smoke-flavored fish, as is fully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explained in Appendix 1 to this document) for the same reason.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Monitoring and Control Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;123.6(b)(4) requires that the processor or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importer identify in the HACCP plan the procedures that it will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use to control and monitor each critical control point.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Monitoring steps are necessary to ensure that the critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control point is in fact under control and to produce an accurate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> record of what has occurred at the critical control point (Ref.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 34, p. 197). Among the procedures that are to be used under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed &sect;123.6(b)(4) is monitoring of the consumer complaints  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received by the processor. While the goal of an HACCP system is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to prevent all likely hazards from occurring, no system is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foolproof. Consumer complaints may be the first alert that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor has that deviations are occurring that are not being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevented or uncovered by the processor's HACCP controls. FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has tentatively concluded, therefore, that each HACCP system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should take advantage of consumer complaints as they relate to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the operation of critical control points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;123.6(b)(4) also requires that procedures for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlling and monitoring critical control points must include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calibration of process control instruments and validation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> software for computer control systems, as appropriate. For a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor's preventive controls to work, the instruments and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment that it relies upon in monitoring critical control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> points, such as thermometers, temperature-recording devices, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> computer software, must be accurate and reliable. FDA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tentatively concluded that the best way to ensure such accuracy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and reliability is to require that the processor's monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures include steps necessary to verify the reliability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these instruments and devices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] New movements of Serbian Army and  police are reported in Kosova, while raids and the mistreatment  and arrest of Albanians still continue. For more, Mehmet Haziri:    [Haziri] The frequent movements of the Serbian Army are  giving distressing dimensions to the wave of the Serbian  repression in Kosova, which have, in the last months, been  displayed in raids, mistreatment, and arrests.    The Information Commission of the Kosova Democratic Alliance  [LDK] in Peje reports that in Tabje, a small hill near the city,  a group of Serbian solders and policemen have been stationed  since yesterday, while the bridge of Zall over Bistrice is kept  under continuous control.    Another report from Zhur stresses that recently a Serbian  Army convoy that marched in front of this locality, provoked the  inhabitants by mistreating several Albanian youths. It is  reported that the trucks were carrying large-caliber weapons.    Reports that arrived today at our editorial office in  Prishtina and the Kosova Information Center confirmed Serbian  police raids in many Kosova localities. On the pretext of  searching for arms, dozens of families were raided in Drenoce  and Balince of Malisheve, Dobercan in Gjilan, in Bratash in  Podujeve, in Rahoshish and Jabllanice in Peje, in Ogosh in  Kamenice, and in Suhareke. There are reports that many persons  were maltreated and were held under arrest for many hours.    As part of the wave of continuous Serbian repression, we  should mention the dismissal of Albanian workers with no pretext  at all. The Serbian-installed leadership at the Coca Cola  Factory in Lipjan dismissed 49 Albanian workers. Sometime ago,  the Serb occupying power fired 30 other workers from this  Kosovar factory. Thus, the number of the Albanian workers in  this factory in Kosova is now only symbolic.</p>

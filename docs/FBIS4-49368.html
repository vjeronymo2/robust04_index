			<p>BFN     [Text] New York, May 3 (XINHUA) -- U.S. express carrier  United Parcel Service (UPS) today announced the opening of its  own business development offices in three gateway cities of  China: Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.    The move, as the first of a series of planned expansions in  China, is an integral part of UPS's strategy to boost its  presence in China and the Asia-Pacific region. It follows the  opening of UPS service to Vietnam on April 1 and the addition of  a direct UPS flight between the U.S. and China's Taiwan Island  in March.    UPS, based in Atlanta, Georgia, first entered the China  market in 1988 through a service partner agreement with  Sinotrans, a China-based carrier also known as China National  Foreign Trade Transportation Corporation. Since then, UPS has  made significant inroads and is currently one of the leading  international express carriers in the market, serving 57 cities  in China.    "With the rapid rise in economic activities in China, we see  tremendous growth in demand for integrated express service,  especially in the major export cities and manufacturing centers  within the mainland," said Ed Schroeder, UPS senior vice  president in charge of international operations.    Schroeder said UPS has been closely monitoring the business  and economic developments in China and sees great potential in  the Chinese express distribution industry.    "With our new offices strategically located in the key  export  cities of China, we can stay close to our customers and gauge  local customer requirements and the market situation. This can  also allow us to better tailor our services to meet the  transportation needs in China," he said.    UPS is a worldwide company serving more than 185 countries  and territories. With revenues of 17.8 billion U.S. dollars and  a volume of 2.9 billion packages and documents in 1993, UPS is  the largest distribution company in the world.</p>

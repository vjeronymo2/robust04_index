			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> CRANE OPERATOR LICENSING BILL GAINS  </P> <P> The state Senate approved legislation Friday that would require crane operators  to be licensed by a new three-member board, a move inspired by the deaths of  six people in the collapse of an industrial crane in San Francisco.  </P> <P> The bill by Sen. Bill Greene (D-Los Angeles) would set up a new board within  the Division of Occupational Safety and Health to license crane operators. The  board would have the authority to set testing procedures for several classes of  cranes, including the giant machines used in high-rise construction. Last  November, a crane on a San Francisco building collapsed, killing crane workers  and bystanders.  </P></p>

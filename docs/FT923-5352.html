			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Liberals lose seat in Hong Kong HONG KONG'S liberals suffered a setback on Sunday when Mr Martin Lee's United Democratic (UDHK) party lost its New Territories West Legislative Council seat to a pro-China independent candidate in a by-election. This was the first liberal seat to fall since a sweeping victory in last year's direct elections. A low turn-out - despite a tight contest - raised some concern over Hong Kong's appetite for its new slice of democracy. Only 32 per cent of the eligible voters turned out, compared with the disappointing 39 per cent average in last year's elections. Yesterday's winner Mr Tang Siu-tong, picked up 51 per cent of the vote. Mr Tang had shunned the support from Hong Kong's growing number of political parties, relying on grass roots backing from rural areas. By contrast, his United Democratic opponent Mr Albert Ho, was viewed as an outsider in the district. The two men were fighting for the seat vacated by United Democrat Mr Stephen Ng, who died of leukaemia in June. Mr Lee put a brave face on the loss. 'We will take heed. We go away this morning with greater determination to be united both as a party and also with the other democratic groups.' Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's new governor, paid a visit to the New Territories on Sunday to watch Hong Kong politics in action and he gave further proof of his desire to speed up the democratic process in Hong Kong. 'I want to see our governing institutions and the participation of the public in the management of our affairs in Hong Kong more deeply rooted in the community,' he said, after visiting the polling station. At present, only 18 of the 60 seats on the Legislative Council are directly elected.</p>

			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Markets: Building society lottery tickets - Serious Money Personal investors are paranoid. But maybe that is because everybody is trying to get them. Look at the evidence. Last week Financial Secretary Stephen Dorrell appeared to be threatening dividends. This week the High Court scotched Lloyds' plans to hand money out to thousands of happy Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester savers and borrowers. And now the Inland Revenue has been caught sending incorrect assessments to half a million taxpayers. The people who are baying hardest for blood are the 1.4m C &amp; G members who have seen large cash sweeteners torn from their grasp. True, the scheme has been scotched not killed. And Lloyds and C &amp; G have always made it clear that if their original proposal was challenged they would fight. But the fresh uncertainty is deeply worrying for members, particularly the newer savers and borrowers, who fear that they may get squeezed out. The best advice for C &amp; G savers is as clear as it is unpalatable. Sit tight. Closing down an existing account endangers any rights you may have to any future payouts. It is possible but by no means certain that newer savers may be excluded from any payout. But if there is a chance of sharing in a handout, it would seem foolish to abandon an opportunity which cost you nothing. If the court ruling holds, and a merger is pushed through, it sounds as if no borrowers will benefit. For existing borrowers that is just tough: you presumably took out a C &amp; G mortgage because it was the best available. And C &amp; G is doing its best to find some other way of rewarding you. Remortgaging purely because you may not get a handout would be as expensive as it is pettish. The far smaller number of people who were considering taking out a C &amp; G mortgage, purely in order to benefit from the proposed Pounds 500 handout to all borrowers, new and old, are in a trickier position. It was always hard to believe that new borrowers could sign up for the sweeteners. Buying a winning lottery ticket before the draw is one thing. Buying a winning ticket for the same price after the draw seems too good to be true. If you are looking for a new mortgage and you believe in fairies, it is worth chancing your luck by going to C &amp; G. Otherwise get whichever mortgage looks best on the normal yardsticks and, if the answer to your search happens to be C &amp; G, drink a toast to Tinkerbell. All those people who were scouring the streets in order to deposit money with the next C &amp; G can also take a breather. The High Court ruling is effectively saying that longer term 'shareholders' are entitled to share in any bonanzas; short term 'speculators' are not. And the dividing line between the sheep and goats is put at two years. This rulebook may be torn up. But if you are happy with your building society account on fundamental grounds (ie you are getting a good rate of interest without unacceptable strings), sticking with your existing society will also consolidate any sitting tenant rights you already have. Once the dust clears, other short-term strategies may become sensible. It now rests with C &amp; G to challenge the High Court or come up with a workable proposal. But longer term what is needed is a far clearer framework for building society members to act within. Creeping demutualisation means that people are sometimes suddenly bounced into quasi-shareholder status, with unexpected claims on the society's assets. But most building society members have no idea whether their society has any spare assets or whether merger plans which will unlock them are pending. No wonder, then, that many of them are starting to treat building society membership as a lottery ticket. The fault is not in them but in the fuzziness of the system (Page VII). ***** Stockbrokers often recommend a nice portfolio of blue chips as if they were Ovaltine. Our snapshot of winners and losers during the recent stockmarket shakeout (page V) provides a salutary reminder that not all blue chips are equal. Between the market's February peak and its recent trough, the FT-SE 100 index fell by almost 17 per cent. But the best individual FT-SE 100 shares managed to hold their own, while the worst lost over 30 per cent. And that is over a period of just four months. Similar comparisons over longer periods show a far wider range of rises and falls. There are two seemingly contradictory messages for investors there. First, if even blue chips can be that skittish, investing in individual shares should be avoided. Secondly, if investing in individual shares, even blue chips, can be that profitable, it is well worth the effort. Both messages are right. If you have both the knowledge and the time to select individual shares, it can be more lucrative than investing through unit and investment trusts. But that is a rather demanding 'if'. ***** The sad thing about the latest exposure of the Revenue's failings is that few people will be surprised. Many individual tax inspectors try their best to be helpful as well as accurate. But some remain both uninformed and unhelpful. No wonder, most people still see them as 'the enemy'.</p>

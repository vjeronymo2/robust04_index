			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries little changed ahead of Dollars 40bn refunding US Treasury prices were little changed across the maturity range yesterday as dealers and investors prepared for this week's Dollars 40bn quarterly refunding auctions. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/16 at 84 29/32 , yielding 7.532 per cent. The two-year note was also slightly firmer, up  1/32 at 99 27/32 , to yield 6.192 per cent. Trading activity was very light from the opening, with participants reluctant to commit funds to the market ahead of the refunding round. The auctions begin today with the sale of Dollars 17bn in three-year notes. That will be followed by auctions of Dollars 12bn in 10-year notes tomorrow and Dollars 11bn in 30-year bonds on Thursday. Last week's strong July employment report raised fears in the bond market that the Federal Reserve will once again raise interest rates to slow the economy, and the talk of another monetary policy tightening has only made dealers and investors even more cautious than usual in the planning of their strategies for the Treasury auctions. European government bond markets were quiet as investors focused on this week's US refunding. In the absence of meaningful investor activity, the market continued its debate on whether Germany would continue to cut interest rates in the wake of buoyant economic data. Salomon Brothers took the view that the strong German recovery could mean that the Bundesbank would not cut rates further in this cycle, turning its attention instead to inflation worries. However, Kidder Peabody Securities said the Bundesbank was likely to cut interest rates after Germany's federal elections in October. On Liffe, the September contract of the bund future traded in a narrow range before easing 0.34 to 93.07 in the late afternoon in meagre volume of 58,000 lots. Dealers noted that a widening in the yield spread between UK gilts and bunds, which reached 175 basis points on Friday, prompted some switching from bunds to gilts. This caused the spread to tighten again to 158 basis points. Gilts rose on the release of weaker than forecast producer prices data for July but, surprisingly, shrugged off a big rise in consumer credit for June. Mr Simon Briscoe of S. G. Warburg said the Bank of England was likely to interpret the lending data as a clear indication that the economy was still growing fast and that it would be that bit keener to raise rates soon. In the meantime, news that the Bank was raising Pounds 700m through four taps of existing bonds strengthened the view that it would not be holding an auction this month. On Liffe, the September long gilt future stood  5/16 higher at 102 5/8 in the late afternoon in small volume of 31,200 lots.</p>

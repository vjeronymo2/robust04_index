			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / New floppy disc poised to spur industry battle The 3.5-inch floppy discs that record computer data may not seem likely to lead the charge into the multimedia age. But a significant advance in floppy disc technology looks set to spur a battle in the electronics industry over what format will dominate the market for next-generation recording media. Fuji Photo Film, the Japanese film maker, has developed an advanced 3.5-inch floppy disc which is capable of recording 50 times as much data as those currently in use. This opens up the possibility for floppy discs to dominate future markets for portable recording media for the digital data created on the PC. Conventional floppy discs have a recording capacity of just 4 to a maximum of 21 megabytes, which enables them to record data comprising only words and numbers. In the age of multimedia, however, recording media would need to be able to record moving pictures and sounds, as well as words and numbers. This requires capacity on the scale of gigabytes, rather than megabytes. At their current capacity, floppy discs therefore would not be able to record multimedia information. Even magneto-optical discs, until now thought to be the frontrunners in the race to increase recording capacity, can record up to only 230 megabytes. Fuji's development of floppy discs which can record up to 100 to 200 megabytes of information, puts floppy discs in the frontline of next-generation recording media along with magneto-optical discs. An advanced floppy disc has several advantages over magneto-optical discs. While MO discs are a relatively new product, floppy discs are in wide use, with production reaching nearly 2.4bn units last year, according to Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Demand for floppy discs is expected to reach 3.5bn units in 1994, according to the industry. Not only would floppy discs be able to capitalise on their familiarity, they are relatively cheap to produce. The new floppy discs developed by Fuji Film can be used in conventional PCs by installing a special, relatively inexpensive, component. Kyocera, the Japanese high-technology company, has been ordered by the International Court of Commerce to pay LaPine Technology of the US and Prudential Bache Trade Corporation damages totalling Dollars 257m for breach of contract.</p>

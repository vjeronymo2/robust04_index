			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WOMAN KILLED AS VAN SWERVES OFF FREEWAY  </P> <P> A Glendale woman was killed Friday morning when her van mysteriously swerved  off the Glendale Freeway.  </P> <P> The California Highway Patrol has been unable to determine what caused the  crash, said Officer Tami Low of the CHP's Verdugo Hills substation.  </P> <P> Low said Lili Amirian, 34, was driving south between 8:20 a.m. and 8:45 a.m.  Witnesses said the vehicle was in one of the middle two lanes and suddenly  swerved to the outside, Low said.  </P> <P> The van turned end-over-end and came to rest in a culvert on the side of the  freeway.  </P> <P> Amirian was pronounced dead at the scene. Her son Edwin, 2, survived with only  a bump on the head, probably because he was strapped into an infant car  restrainer in the back seat, Low said.  </P> <P> The van showed no sign of mechanical defect, and all four of its tires were  intact, Low said.  </P></p>

He was speaking in an interview with Portuguese  Television in Huambo. Dr. Savimbi said UNITA is determined to  advance the negotiating process under way in the Zambian  capital, Lusaka. As stated previously by UNITA high officials,  Dr. Savimbi has once again said that it is not possible to solve  the Angolan crisis through a military solution and appealed to  the Luanda government to extend to other areas the truce  unilaterally declared by UNITA in September 1993. Currently,  UNITA controls 70 percent of Angolan territory. Dr. Jonas  Malheiro Savimbi on 10 February met with members of UNITA  delegation to the Lusaka talks for consultations.</p>

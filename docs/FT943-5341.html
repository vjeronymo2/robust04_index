			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Spending urged to cut crime The enormous financial costs of crime make a convincing case for more investment in its prevention, says the national crime prevention organisation Crime Concern in a report today. It says that although crime is a significant drain on individual, public and corporate resources, little information is available about its impact in a number of economic sectors. The report says the full cost of crime is difficult to quantify since much of it is not reported to the police. A CBI/Crime Concern working party estimated the loss to business from crime to be between Pounds 5bn and Pounds 10bn a year.</p>

			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE NEWS: EXPO '92 IN SEVILLE TO IMPORT OPERA  </P> <P> Expo '92, scheduled to take place in Seville, Spain, from April 20 to Oct. 12,  1992, will mount six famous operatic works set in Seville.  </P> <P> The six operas -- Mozart's "Don Giovanni" and "Le Nozze di Figaro," Rossini's  "Il Barbiere di Siviglia," Beethoven's "Fidelio," Verdi's "La Forza del  Destino" and Donizetti's "La Favorita" -- will be performed in Seville's new  opera house, the Maestranza Theater, which will open in the spring of 1991.  Another operatic masterpiece set in Seville, Bizet's "Carmen," will be produced  outdoors in the southern Spanish city.  </P> <P> Consultant to Expo '92 in matters musical is the Spanish tenor Placido Domingo  -- who serves a similar function with Los Angeles Music Center Opera. Domingo  has planned the operatic repertory at the six-monthlong exposition with Luis  Andreu Marfa, artistic director of the Maestranza.  </P> <P> "Musicians and librettists have made Seville the scenario of their fantasies,"  the tenor said recently in a prepared statement.  </P> <P> "Why not take advantage of this? The operas inspired by Seville will be  presented at Expo '92, and could be the basis for an annual festival."  </P> <P> With negotiations still incomplete, according to spokeswoman Esther Grau of the  Expo management, the lineup lists "Don Giovanni" as performed by a touring  company from the Staatsoper, Vienna, and conducted by Claudio Abbado; "Nozze di  Figaro" from the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, conducted by Zubin Mehta; "Forza  del Destino" also from Florence, and also conducted by Mehta; "Fidelio" from  the Metropolitan Opera, New York, conducted by James Levine; "Barbiere di  Siviglia," from the Rossini Opera Festival of Pessaro, Italy; and "La  Favorita," about which the spokeswoman had no details.  </P> <P> Seville, Grau said, has no tradition of resident opera -- the Maestranza is the  first opera house to be built in the city in its history -- a condition which  will change in the fall of 1991, six months before Expo '92 begins. In October,  1991, the new Maestranza, with a seating capacity of 1,650, will produce a  season of four operas: "La Boheme," "Rigoletto," "Tosca" and "Dona  Francisquita."  </P> <P> Outside of the operatic genre, Marfa said, the new opera house will also host  zarzuela performances, and concerts by visiting symphony orchestras and ballet  companies. Among Spanish singers already engaged to appear during the  festivities are Montserrat Caballe, Alfredo Kraus, Victoria de los Angeles,  Jose Carreras and Teresa Berganza, the administrator said.  </P> <P> Expo '92 will produce 55,000 separate performances, according to Manuel  Olivencia, commissioner general of the State Corporation for Expo '92. "From  the very highest level of classical culture to mass popular entertainment and  the avant-garde -- there will be something to suit all tastes," Olivencia said.  </P> <P> The exposition begins on Easter Monday of 1992, and closes on Columbus'  birthday, nearly six months later. Official estimates are that 18 million  visitors will attend Expo '92. To date, Olivencia said, 103 nations, 21  international organizations and 23 multinational corporations have officially  accepted invitations to participate.  </P> <P> The theme of the exposition, which celebrates the 500th anniversary of  Columbus' encounter with the new world, is "The Age of Discoveries."  </P> <P> Besides the Maestranza Theater, other show places being constructed for Expo  '92 include an open-air theater seating 7,000; an outdoor cinema; a large,  canopied plaza to be called the Planeque Marque; Cinema Street, which will  recreate famous Hollywood film sets; an exhibition arena for circuses and  rodeos; a track and field complex; a facility for water sports, and several  more indoor and outdoor theaters.  </P> <P> Offsite, Olivencia said, historical venues in and outside the city will also be  available to Expo events: the Lope de Vega theater -- a legacy of the  Ibero-American Exhibition of 1929 -- and the Amfiteatro Romano in the suburb of  Italica.  </P> <P> COMPOSERS' CORNER: The 80th birthday of William Schuman, which was celebrated  Aug. 4, is being noted all through 1990 with various performances of the  composer's works. An important revival of the Symphony No. 3 -- Schuman  discarded the first two symphonies -- was given at the Cabrillo Festival in  Santa Cruz last month, with Dennis Russell Davies conducting. Davies also  conducted the Third Symphony, on Schuman's birthday, at the Tanglewood  Festival. On Sept. 26, the Los Angeles Philharmonic will play the Third  Symphony in Carnegie Hall, opening the historic hall's centennial celebration.  In December, the Juilliard Opera Center in New York will perform two Schuman  operas, "The Mighty Casey" and "A Question of Taste," both conducted by Gerard  Schwarz. And, among many other Schuman performances scheduled through the end  of the 1990-91 season, Schwarz will lead the Seattle Symphony in the Symphony  No. 5 in Seattle in April. . . . The family of the late Alfred Newman has  donated $1 million to the School of Music at USC for the building and equipment  for a recital hall, green room and memorial lobby to be named after the film  composer, who died in 1970.  </P> <P> PEOPLE: Edo de Waart, music director of the Minnesota Symphony, has been named  principal guest conductor at Santa Fe Opera commencing with the 1991 summer  season. De Waart's first assignments in his New Mexico position are three  Mozart operas: "Nozze di Figaro" in 1991, "Don Giovanni" in 1992 and "Magic  Flute" in 1993. . . . Soprano Gail Robinson, a former member of the roster at  the Metropolitan Opera, has been named executive director of the Met's National  Council Auditions and director of the company's Young Artist Development  Program, succeeding Lawrence Stayer, who died in April. . . . Choreographer  Garth Fagan has changed the name of his dance company, formerly called Garth  Fagan Bucket Dance, to Garth Fagan Dance. Now approaching the end of its second  decade, the Fagan company is in the midst of celebrating its 20th anniversary;  the celebrations will culminate with a gala in Rochester, New York, where the  troupe is still based, in November.  </P></p>

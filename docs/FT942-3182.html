			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Food prices up sharply in China: Press told not to report details as grumbling increases Chinese consumers have been rocked by a series of steep price increases for staple foods such as grain, prompting widespread grumbling at a time of worker and peasant unrest. The authorities last week increased the price of premium quality flour by 37 per cent and rice by nearly 17 per cent. This comes on top of steep prices rises for most basic commodities in the past 12 months. A Beijing municipal official confirmed yesterday that the price rises had come into force on June 10, but he said the Chinese media had been instructed not to report details, to avoid inflaming opinion. The price increase coincides with simmering unhappiness over price increases in urban and rural areas. Agitation among industrial workers has become commonplace. Cost of living increases are running at more than 20 per cent in China's cities. China's press, warning of the dangers to the economy of spiralling price increases, has demanded action. The official Business Weekly said at the weekend the 'side-effects of the pricing reform and the rocketing cost of production materials have combined to form the Achilles heel of the economy'. In March, China reintroduced price controls on 20 items, including services and food. It authorised local governments to implement measures to ease the inflationary burden on consumers. Meanwhile the State Statistical Bureau yesterday forecast that it would reduce economic growth this year to between 9 and 10 per cent compared with 13 per cent in 1993. It reported that growth slowed to about 12 per cent in the first half of this year. This would 'make it easier' to achieve the targeted growth rate of 9-10 per cent. Beijing yesterday ordered the virtual suspension of trading on most of the country's futures exchanges as part of continuing efforts to toughen regulation of chaotic financial markets. The Securities Commission, a regulatory arm of the State Council, China's cabinet, is expected to limit severely the number of exchanges after reviewing their licences. Some 40 futures exchanges dealing in commodities and currencies had mushroomed in China's cities since last year and were in effect operating beyond the control of the hard-pressed regulatory authorities in Beijing. Peoples' Daily, the Communist party newspaper, reported at the weekend that speculation on international futures markets through local brokerages had led to huge foreign exchange losses.</p>

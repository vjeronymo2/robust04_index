			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / International Company News: Renault pushed to front of the grid - France is clearing the way for an important privatisation Slowly, but surely, Renault is being pushed towards the front of the privatisation starting grid. Friday's appointment of adviser banks to counsel the French government, and the preliminary selection of six advertising agencies, are the latest and clearest signs that France is clearing the way for one of the most important operations of its privatisation programme. 'The preparations are in place,' said one official. 'But we cannot say when the starting flag will fall, nor how long the race will be.' A spokesman at the economics ministry was also cautious, claiming no decisions have yet been taken about the timing or scale of the operation. In spite of such reticence, the government appears set for at least a partial privatisation by the end of the year. The various scenarios for the reduction of the state's 80 per cent stake in Renault are also narrowing. The government has indicated that it will maintain at least a blocking minority of the shares, citing a minimum holding of 34 per cent. The operation is likely to involve a share offering to employees and the general public, rather than simply a sale of shares to financial and industrial partners, as suggested earlier this year. The French government is also weighing a capital increase to coincide with privatisation. The timing and scale of the operation will, however, be affected by political considerations. Renault, one of the best-known symbols of public sector industry, has been a stronghold for trade unions for much of the post-war period. The Communist-led Confederation Generale du Travail, although no longer representing a majority on the company's workers' committee, repeated at the weekend that it would oppose privatisation. With presidential elections due next spring, Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, will not want to risk a damaging labour dispute. Such considerations explain the government's step-by-step approach to the sale of Renault. The timing of the latest announcements, on a Friday afternoon in the middle of the holiday period, is also significant. The common theme is that the government is treading cautiously, while leaving its options open. Pressures for the privatisation of Renault have grown steadily, however. In particular, Mr Gerard Longuet, the industry minister, has pushed for a rapid and relatively extensive operation. 'The state should not be in the business of building cars,' he says. Other members of Mr Balladur's centre-right government argue that it is important to maintain the momentum of the privatisation campaign to ease pressure on the budget deficit, targeted at FFr300bn (Dollars 56bn) this year. An element of urgency is also provided by the divorce agreement between Renault and Volvo following the collapse of their merger plans last year. Under the agreement, Volvo will reduce its stake in Renault from 20 per cent to 12 per cent at the time of privatisation, if this occurs before December. After that date, new negotiations would be opened between Renault, Volvo and the French state. The collapse of the Renault/Volvo merger has left the French group without a big partner in a consolidating international industry. Specific projects have been agreed on a case-by-case basis. Renault last month concluded an agreement for the joint development of cabs with Iveco, the trucks division of Fiat of Italy. The industry ministry is thought to favour a broader alliance to bolster Renault's position, although it accepts the number of possible candidates is limited. As the Volvo experience demonstrated, moreover, strategic alliances could be easier after privatisation. Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault's chairman has made no secret of his desire for privatisation. His case has been buttressed by the group's strong financial performance and the improved image of its products. Since the mid-1980s, Mr Schweitzer, and his predecessor Mr Raymond Levy, have transformed Renault from the sick man of the European car industry to one of its leading performers. Profits have been recorded through the recession in the motor vehicle industry, the worst since the second world war. This year, Lehman Brothers, the securities company, is forecasting a doubling in net profits to FFr2.2bn. The resilience of Renault is partly the result of an improved model range. 'A succession of strong chief executives has implemented a turnover strategy based on a significant upgrading of the model range, from below-average cars to distinctive, more luxurious, better styled and built products. These include niche products like the Espace and Twingo,' said Lehman. Such considerations may strengthen Renault's case compared with other privatisation candidates such as Assurances Generales de France, the insurer, which is also on the starting grid for privatisation. As with other French insurance companies, AGF shares have been hit heavily this year and, although up from their lows, are still down for the year. As a result, the government may wait until the issue would prove more lucrative. As for Renault, the proceeds depend on the ultimate scale of the operation. The company as a whole is valued at more than FFr40bn, implying receipts for the state of between FFr10bn and FFr18bn, in the case of the government's retention of a majority stake or a blocking minority stake respectively. The government says it has time to make up its mind between Renault and AGF. 'It is our strategy to have two companies in a state of preparation,' says one official. Renault's bid, however, is picking up speed. It may well cross the starting line first.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- RENAULT'S PERFORMANCE (FFr m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                    1993         1992*           1991*  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Revenues                        169,789        184,252         171,502 Operating income                    609            7.7             4.8 Share of net income from associated companies: Volvo                             (147)        (1,280)           (208) Other companies                      95             70              51 Renault net income                1,071          5,680           3,078  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Financial statements have been adjusted to comply with new accounting standards.

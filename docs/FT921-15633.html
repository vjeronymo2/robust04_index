			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Goode Durrant slumps 50% to Pounds 2.64m GOODE DURRANT, the vehicle hire and housebuilding group, maintained its dividend in spite of interim pre-tax profits dropping more than 50 per cent, writes Peggy Hollinger. Mr Michael Waring, chairman, said the interim dividend is being held at 2.15p - covered 1.6 times - because of the board's confidence in long-term prospects. However, he warned that a recovery was further off than had originally been estimated. Pre-tax profits for the six months to October 31 fell from Pounds 5.33m to Pounds 2.64m on turnover down almost 27 per cent to Pounds 97.8m. Earnings per share tumbled from 6.5p to 3.5p. Winnedael, the hostile 25 per cent shareholder attacked the results as abysmal. Mr Waring stressed the improved performance on the second half of last year when profits were Pounds 2m. He said the improvement followed reorganisation of the small commercial vehicle hire business. Housebuilding had had a tough six months and motor distribution almost halved profits from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 714,000.</p>

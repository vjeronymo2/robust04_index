			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Books: Rounding up the villains in a big-budget disaster - A look at the making of Baron Munchausen LOSING THE LIGHT by Andrew Yule Applause Pounds 12.99 240 pages The production history of Terry Gilliam's The Adventures of Baron Munchausen demonstrates one of the oldest truths of cinema: that big-budget film-making is the Creation story in reverse. Give God six days to make the world and he will create order from chaos. Give a director 60 days to make a film - and almost as many million dollars  -and chaos will be conjured unfailingly from a carefully costed, theoretically foolproof gleam of inspiration. Andrew Yule's book, funny and informative, is the appalling made real. He never went near the set during the film's making but has been rounding up the suspects ever since: including director Terry Gilliam, one-time Monty Python cartoonist turned film director; German producer Thomas Schuhly, ex-collaborator with Fassbinder and Fellini; and a mixture of international stars and technicians (Italian designers, Hollywood comedians). Baron Munchausen began as a Dollars 20m extravaganza, funded by Columbia on a pick-up basis and to be made in Italy and Spain by a director with a track record in low-budget inventiveness (The Time Bandits, Brazil). Then, like Heaven's Gate and Topsy, it just growed. Yule's book begins with teasing innocence. What could be brighter and safer than signing up a great modern movie fantasist (Gilliam) to remake a great bygone movie fantasy? The old Baron Munchhausen, made in 1943, was a living picture-book. Stuffed with trips to the moon, headless giants and heroes riding cannonballs, it was one of the few good things to come out of Germany during the Hitler years. The 1989-model Munchausen, when it came out, sank without a ripple at the box office. But long before that it was measuring up for disaster. The budget reached Dollars 40-50m (ledgers always become blurry after a movie's initial cost has doubled), and the shooting schedule spun out from weeks to months as if Scheherezade were in charge of production management. In such stories there has to be a villain and Andrew Yule's is Schuhly. He is Losing The Light's dark angel: a vainglorious egomaniac (so alleged) who spent more time pumping his muscles at the gym or basking in the lights at Press briefings than he did in making sure sets were built, costs were controlled and promised international stars (Marlon Brando, Sean Connery) turned up for work. Eric Idle, one of the film's performers, comments: 'He told us that what you need for film-making is balls. And that's all he ever talked - balls.' In the other corner, we have Mr Gilliam. Gilliam - it is the book's major failing - is presented with an almost unblotted copybook. His one mild foible seems to be a lovable absent-mindedness: note the day he ordered his age-hopping hero (John Neville) to get into Munchausen's 80-year-old guise (four hours in the make-up room) and then realised that the day's shooting called for a 65-year-old Baron. Neville, already seething at a schedule that threatened to eat into his next Stratford Ontario season, duly exploded. Elsewhere, Yule acts less like Gilliam's portraitist than his defence counsel. But surely a director must have prime responsibility for the unravelling disciplines on a movie set - especially if he conceived the movie and proclaimed its financial viability to begin with. Instead, Losing The Light finds fault with other parties, some of the finger-pointing no doubt justified: with Rome's Cinecitta Studios for its old-fashioned work methods; with Film Finance, the completion bond company, for insisting on niggardly and false economies; and with the world of international bacteria for spreading plagues around the cast both animal and human - African horse fever, dogs struck by liver ailments, actors struck down by everything available. The book, whatever the justice of its apportioning of praise and blame, has its comic momentum horribly correct: once things start to go wrong on a big movie, they don't stop. It makes cinema unique as an art: a form of Promethean presumption that results either in gorgeous artistic conflagrations or in entire creative enterprises having their innards pecked out. Losing The Light is a book to learn from, smile at and shudder over.</p>

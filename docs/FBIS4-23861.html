			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Stephen Laufer and Anton Harber] </F>   [Text] The aborted attempt by Minister of Defence Joe  Modise to censor the WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN [WM&amp;G] last  week  revealed a titanic struggle between Modise and Defence Force  chief General Georg Meiring for ultimate control of the armed  forces. And a major element in this battle is information that  Military Intelligence [MI] operatives claim to have that would  compromise individual ANC leaders.    Meiring took the initiative last Thursday when, with some  last-minute arm-twisting, he pushed Modise into the interdict  against this newspaper. Sources close to the Ministry of  Defence say the general won Modise over with the threat of major  political damage to the ANC and the government through the  revelation of highly placed South African moles in the ANC,  dating back to its period in exile.    This has raised fears that such information could give the  military a hold over some ANC leaders, including ministers and  deputy ministers.    Said one intelligence source: "Meiring is a sharp  strategist.  He would have known all the implications of the interdict and  may have been testing Modise."    But neither of them banked on the strong reaction they  faced.  In a move unprecedented in South African politics, the  minister's own party, the ANC, and its alliance partners, the  South African Communist Party and COSATU [Congress of South  African Trade Union] all criticised him sharply and publicly.    Modise won back some ground in a crisis meeting on Monday  morning when he ordered Meiring to withdraw the affidavit,  blamed him for the criticism he had faced and over-rode Meiring  when he did not want to concede the newspaper's legal costs.  Modise is now taking steps to surround himself with civilian  and political advisers, such as his long-standing colleague  Ronnie Kasrils, to ensure he does not rely directly and solely  on Meiring's advice.    Observers are now watching to see if Modise is able to  follow  this through and assert his authority as civilian and political  leader of the military.    This leaves the question of what, if any, compromising  information the military gathered in its decades of fighting the  ANC that it can now use. Government and ANC intelligence  operatives believe a decades-long programme to recruit agents  inside the ANC by the South African spy services was ultimately  successful in penetrating the top echelons of the political and  military wings of the organisation.    The South Africans allegedly used "false-flag operations",  in  which they pretended to be British, American, Israeli or Soviet  agents gathering information and won over ANC leaders  sympathetic to those governments. At a later point, they would  reveal to their source that they had been supplying information  to the apartheid government, thus compromising them and forcing  them to continue supplying material.    The South African intelligence operation was allegedly so  successful that at least one cabinet minister and one deputy in  the present government are alleged to have been South African  informants. This newspaper is aware of the alleged identities  of the two, but will not publish their names without conclusive  proof of any collusion with the apartheid authorities.    Intelligence analysts are sceptical about claims from the MI  operatives interdicted along with WM&amp;G last week. "They are  too  junior to have run or even had knowledge of really senior ANC  figures working as agents for the other side," said one. Modise  appears to have acted with little reference to his advisors,  instead trusting Meiring's advice. Contacted by this newspaper  on receipt of the interdict last Thursday, the minister's  political advisor asked somewhat sheepishly to have a copy of  the court papers faxed to the ministry.    The debacle, commented Institute for Defence Policy  director Jakkie Cilliers, "illustrates the need for the Defence  Ministry to seek policy advice from outside, from a  parliamentary defence committee, from civil society, and other  advisors. The minister should not depend solely on the generals  for guidance."    The interdict debacle was a prime argument for the rapid  establishment of the truth commission, argued several government  sources. "It will create an ordered framework for dealing with  the past and reduce the risk of blackmail to the government or  leading political figures," said one.    It is understood that President Nelson Mandela received an  extensive counter-intelligence briefing by the ANC's security  department prior to choosing his cabinet. Sources refused to  divulge what the president was told, but said "he is a lawyer.  You must be careful not to come to him with circumstantial  evidence, he demands proof".    And one cabinet insider said: "Craig Williams left a network  behind inside the ANC (when his cover was blown). Some might  now be in politics and positions of influence. The way out for  poor Modise is to recommend to the president the publication of  the Steyn report" into the DCC's [Directorate of Covert  Collection] activities.    Mandela angrily told viewers during his televised  pre-election debate with FW de Klerk that the then president had  refused to show him the Steyn report. Repeated requests to the  President's Office this week failed to produce clarity on  whether Mandela had seen the report since coming to power.    Modise has been criticised for going into overdrive in  implementing Mandela's reconciliation policies within the  Defence Force at the expense of senior Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear  of the Nation, MK -- ANC armed wing] cadres waiting to be  appointed to the Defence Force. He is known to have built a  close relationship with Meiring and other senior staff members  through months of integration talks.    Besides spending hours together at the negotiating table,  the  former adversaries visited submarines and soldiers, had braais  and beers together. Some angry MK cadres this week pointed to  Modise's failure to get a single senior ANC military officer  appointed to the top echelons of the SANDF [South African  National Defence Force] since taking office.    Among those waiting in the wings is MK chief of staff  Siphiwe  Nyanda, tipped to take Lieutenant General Pierre Steyn's old job  as chief of staff. Expected during Modise's first week in  office, it is understood Nyanda's appointment has been delayed  by resistance from Meiring and his colleagues, who say the MK  man is not qualified.    Modise's critics counter that he should nevertheless have  shown sufficient resolve to appoint Nyanda, even if only to send  him for advanced staff officer training. They believe Modise is  reluctant to ruffle the general's feathers not least because he  has been seduced by the status and privileges available to the  minister of defence.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 6, IRNA -- The Islamic Republic last  night condemned the American officials' mistreatment of Iranian  delegation to the joint spring session of the International  Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank (WB) in Washington on April  22.    The Iranian interests section in Washington in a  strongly-worded letter to the U.S. foreign affairs department  through the Pakistani embassy, described as "insulting" the way  customs officials at Washington airport behaved with Iranian  Minister of Economy and Finance Morteza Mohammad-Khani and  Governor of Central Bank Mohammad Hoseyn 'Adeli.    The U.S. Customs officials stopped the two senior Iranian  diplomats, re-checked their suitcases and took photographs from  them.    The letter voicing dissatisfaction, said the treatment not  only violated the basic diplomatic principles but contradicted  the U.S. Government's responsibility towards international  organizations based in America.    It continued that U.S. Customs officials had repeatedly  shown  such disrespect for Iranian officials visiting America for  international sessions.    The letter expected that the U.S. as a country which hosts  international sessions would put an end to such practice.</p>

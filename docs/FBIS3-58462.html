			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In the Bundestag yesterday the NATO summit in  Brussels was praised on all sides (?because of its calls) for  increased help to East Europe and further measures, as well as  accepting other countries into NATO and the European Union. I  now welcome on the telephone Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel.  Good morning, Herr Kinkel.    [Kinkel] Good morning, Frau [name indistinct].    [Announcer] Clinton and Yeltsin decided yesterday not to  target their long-range missiles at each other but toward the  sea. How do you evaluate this decision?    [Kinkel] Extraordinarily positive. Everything that  contributes toward reducing tension and disarmament as a whole  can only be profoundly welcomed by us. I am pleased that the  U.S. President went directly to Russia following the NATO  summit. I welcome greatly the agreement due to be reached today  with Ukraine as well. That is quite an important area of  tension, particularly between Russia and Ukraine: the question  of nuclear arms, the question of the fleet...    [Announcer, interrupting] Perhaps we will come to that in a  moment...    [Kinkel, interrupting] There was at least a solution to part  of this.    [Announcer] Is the agreement between Boris Yeltsin and Bill  Clinton also a first step toward ending the doctrine of  deterrence, Herr Kinkel, or is it more a matter of cosmetics,  because the missiles can be retargeted very quickly?    [Kinkel] No, I don't think that is a cosmetic move. Rather  it is a sign that We can say goodbye to the East-West conflict.  It is very, very important that the two countries, the United  States and Russia, understand each other well, and I am very  pleased that the U.S. Government is quite obviously making great  efforts to involve the still great and important Russia in all  significant and important issues, particularly in the security  of Europe.    [Announcer] Is Russia still a superpower?    [Kinkel] Russia was a world power and it still has huge  dimensions, 50 times as large as unified Germany, twice as many  people, and a huge country.    [Announcer] Was the atmosphere at the talks between Clinton  and Yeltsin, the careful NATO approach on new members in  Brussels, justified in your view, Herr Kinkel?    [Kinkel] I think it was. That was our policy, too. Again  and again I have pointed out that we need a new security  structure in Europe, that we must not create any new breaks or  rifts, that we must make a balanced effort to meet the security  needs of the Central and East European states on the one hand,  and also meet the interests of Russia and Ukraine on the other  hand, and I believe the decisions made in Brussels represent a  good and important beginning.    [Announcer] How would you describe the position of Yeltsin  in  Moscow, who must proceed carefully and who does not exactly have  a stable majority?    [Kinkel] Well, I think it is a success in the first place  that there were elections, it is a success that the Constitution  was adopted. Now we must hope that the forces of reform are  successful against the extremists, who gained astonishingly good  results in the Duma elections. I am working on the assumption  that the forces for reform will win the day; we will support  them, we must support them, so that the process there toward  democracy and a market economy becomes irreversible.    [Announcer] Is it right then that President Bill Clinton  should not talk to Zhirinovskiy, should avoid him?    [Kinkel] I think that is absolutely right.    [Announcer] Let us turn to the nuclear renunciation treaty  with the Ukraine, Herr Kinkel. How do you evaluate the signing  today, if it actually happens, after all it is not absolutely  certain.    [Kinkel] That will be a very, very important step toward the  pacification of that region. During my visit to Russia on 19  and 20 December I remarked to my opposite number, Kozyrev, how  much Russian-Ukrainian relations were burdened by the SS-18 and  SS-24 missiles, and by the issue of the fleet in Sevastopol. We  were always the ones who strongly urged that Ukraine should sign  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. This would be a great step  forward, one we should not underestimate, and which I welcome  very much.    [Announcer] Herr Kinkel, in view of the fact that the  agreement still has to be approved by the Ukrainian Parliament,  how reliable is a signature on such a controversial document  against the background of political conditions, which are still  unstable?    [Kinkel] Well, Mr. Kravchuk thinks he can get the treaty  through Parliament. It is no secret that there are very  conservative forces in the Ukrainian Parliament, and it may well  be that one or the other, as in the past, will attempt to speak  against it. I hope that won't happen, I hope that the treaty  gets through.    [Announcer] What does the Ukrainian renunciation mean from  your point of view for the debate on the nonproliferation of  nuclear weapons?    [Kinkel] It is quite a decisive step forward. One should not  forget that Ukraine is still a country with a population of 350  million, the third largest nuclear power. Ukraine has enormous  economic difficulties and has quite obviously insisted on  keeping its nuclear arsenal as a bargaining counter. We must  see to it very quickly that we help not only Russia but also  Ukraine. We need a cooperation treaty with the European Union  and we must do all we can bilaterally as well. You see, the  foreign ministers at the NATO meeting in Brussels pushed  extremely strongly for dealing with Ukraine. The economic  conditions there are much, much more difficult than here. I  constantly remind people that the hourly wage here is worth half  a day's wages in Leipzig, a day's wages in Budapest, a month's  wages in Breslau [Wroclaw], and the same in Ukraine, so you see  the economic comparison.    [Announcer] What is the time span for such aid,  realistically, because several have to sit down at one table  together?    [Kinkel] It has to be soon.    [Announcer] When is soon?    [Kinkel] I cannot give you a timeframe in which that will  happen. Such processes are difficult, it is a problem for the  G-7, it is a problem for the Europeans. I have pointed to the  cooperation treaty we are concluding with Russia -- we also need  one with Ukraine. We must do bilaterally all we can. And I  must say others will have to do their bit. I am pleased that  the U.S. President has made such major promises. I would point  out that we have already pumped in over 80 billion German marks  into the former Soviet Union, mainly of course into Russia and  Ukraine. We have done by far the most -- 53 percent of aid so  far comes from Germany. We do not have to put our light under a  bushel, the others should do their bit, too.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lagos, Jan 25 (AFP)--A senior lawyer and human  rights activist, Gani Fawehinmi, has issued a court challenge to  the composition of the Provisional Ruling Council (PRC),  Nigeria's highest decision-making body.    In a suit filed in a federal high court here Monday here,  Fawehinmi asked the court to declare that the make-up of the  council violates the "federal character" provision of the 1979  constitution.    The main element is that four states that are home to the  Ibo  ethnic group in eastern Nigeria--Abia, Anambra, Enugu and Imo  states--have only one representative on the 11-member PRC.    Chief of Naval Staff Rear Admiral Allison Madueke, is the  only member of Ibo origin. Six other members are from the  north, three from the west and one from a south-western minority  group.    Fawehinmi said that minority groups who populate Akwa Ibom,  Cross River and Rivers states, whence comes most of the crude  oil that contributes more than 90 percent of the nation's annual  revenue, are unrepresented. The council's composition, he  argued, is against the spirit of "federal character" and  inimical to national unity.    Under the "federal character" policy contained in the 1979  constitution, each of Nigeria's 30 states should be given equal  consideration when making appointments into national bodies,  organisations or agencies in order to promote national unity and  command national loyalty.    According to Fawehinmi, renowned for devoting more than 20  years of his professional career to fighting for the rights of  the poor and the underprivileged, the non-inclusion of any  representative of the three minority states from the east in the  PRC violates the 1979 constitution.    The constitution was reinstated by decree 107, promulgated  shortly after General Sani Abacha took power last November,  replacing a short-lived unelected civilian regime that had been  installed in August by the outgoing junta of Genera Ibrahim  Babangida.    By going to the court to challenge the PRC's composition,  Fawehinmi has added legal weight to complaints of  "marginalisation" made against the government early this month  by a group of Ibos.    In a one-page advertisement in DAILY TIMES newspaper of last  January 12, a group calling itself "Concerned Igbos" (or Ibos),  alleged that since the end of the Nigerian civil ("Biafra") war  in January 1970, the Ibos have been "persecuted, condemned and  sacrificed".    An estimated one million people, including women and  children, died in the war which lasted for 30 months. An  attempt by the east to secede from the rest of the country  triggered off the bloody war.    The group also alleged that the Ibos have been denied  prominent ministerial positions and posts in the federal public  service, rarely appointed to head federal agencies or given  either ambassadorial positions or "effective command of body of  troops". They specifically cited the fact that there is only one  of their own number in the PRC, despite the fact that the Ibos  represent one of the three main ethnic groups in Nigeria.    Apart from the Ibos, several minority groups, particularly  the Ogonis in south-eastern Rivers State, have recently  heightened agitation for justice and fair distribution of the  nation's revenue.    In the heat of a nation's political crisis after Babangida  annulled the outcome of a civilian presidential election last  June, six of the seven states in the eastern part of Nigeria  threatened to secede over what they called the injustice meted  to them by the federal government in the sharing out of the  nation's resources and political offices.</p>

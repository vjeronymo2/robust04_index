			<p>BFN     [Text] It was learned on 13 May that the Ground  Self-Defense Force [GSDF], which is in the process of studying  the role of the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] in the post-postwar  period, has formulated the "outline" of a new strategy which  shifts from "emphasis on the north," in consideration of the  Russian forces in the Far East, to one that also emphasizes the  defense of western Japan and the metropolitan area.    As the "threat from the north" diminishes after the  disintegration of the Soviet Union, and the GSDF is being forced  to reduce personnel, the Ground Staff Office has also focused on  the significance of the "effects of the situation on the Korean  peninsula," and the "political and economic center of the  country" in its review of the strategic role of GSDF divisions  stationed nationwide. It has also suggested steps to enhance  mobility, including the creation of a new unit of helicopters  for personnel transport.    Among the 13 divisions stationed all over Japan, the  downgrading of the Fifth Division (headquartered in Obihiro  City, Hokkaido) and three other divisions to brigades is also  being proposed. The above plan is believed to represent the  GSDF's position in preparation for the Defense Agency's formal  decision to reorganize the SDF within fiscal 1994.    Consideration of plans to reorganize the GSDF gathered  momentum after former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa ordered a  review of the 1976 "National Defense Program Outline" last  February. The above "outline" worked out by the Ground Staff  Office in late April is meant to be a preliminary draft on which  to base further discussions.    The "outline" states that from the standpoint of national  defense, Japan can be divided into "northern Japan," referring  to the area north of Aomori Prefecture, "western Japan,"  consisting of northern Kyushu and the Chugoku region, and  "central Japan," comprising the remaining territory. These  three regions are then discussed individually in terms of the  "territorial issue," "effects of the situation on the Korean  peninsula," and the "location of the political and economic  center," considering them equally important in terms of national  defense. This indeed represents a shift from "emphasis on the  north," which entailed giving priority to frontal deployment in  Hokkaido, among other things. The "outline" is not premised on  any specific threat, and in this sense, it is a return to the  philosophy of the "National Defense Program Outline."    Partly owing to the difficulty in recruiting SDF members,  the  Defense Agency has already decided to reduce the size of the SDF  from 180,000 to 150,000. As a concrete step to implement force  reductions, the present "outline" proposes downgrading the 10th  Division (based in Nagoya), the 12th Division (based in Shinto  Village, Gunma Prefecture), and the 13th Division (based in  Kaita Town, Hiroshima Prefecture), apart from the Fifth Division  mentioned above, to brigades. It suggests reducing the size of  these divisions from the present 7,000 to 4,000 or 5,000.  Brigades have the same functions as divisions although they are  smaller in size. At present, the GSDF does not have brigades.    In the process of determining which divisions to downgrade  into brigades, the metropolitan area and the Kansai area, which  are Japan's political and economic centers, and the northeastern  region and Kyushu, where it is relatively easier to recruit SDF  members, have been excluded. Likewise, four divisions in  Hokkaido -- the Second Division (based in Asahikawa City) which  defends the Soya Strait, the Seventh Division (based in Chitose  City) which is the GSDF's only armored division, and the 11th  Division in Sapporo City -- have also been excluded. Candidates  for downgrading were said to have been selected from the  remaining divisions according to their degree of importance.    Furthermore, the size of infantry members forming the core  of  all divisions and brigades will be reduced to a small commanding  unit during peace time, forming the so-called "core units"  without rank-and-file members, to implement force reductions.    The following steps to strengthen mobility are also proposed  to realize a balanced national defense strategy: 1) deploying a  considerable number of helicopters of the 12th Division in  Gunma, reorganizing this into a "mobile air brigade," which can  be dispatched to any place in Japan in an emergency; and 2)  increasing the number of armored vehicles in all divisions and  brigades. The plan also suggests an upgrading of the reserve  SDF officers system to staff the core units.    In addition, the "outline" also proposes possible  consolidation and retrenchment of operational bases which have  become difficult to maintain and manage around bases where GSDF  divisions or brigades are stationed. It estimates that, of the  159 bases all over the country, around 40 need to be closed.</p>

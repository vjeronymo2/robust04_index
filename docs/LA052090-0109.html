			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIXED MEDIA;  </P> <P> * 1/2 "ROCK ART: THE MOODY BLUES" AEON HOME VIDEO. ($19.95): WORKS ARE RATED ON  A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE STARS (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> This is a psychedelic version of one of those insufferably soothing New Age  videos that feature serene nature scenes accompanied by tranquil instrumental  music.  </P> <P> In this half-hour video, colorful, constantly-changing geometric shapes pulse  and cavort to the rhythms of melodic old Moody Blues tunes, like "Nights in  White Satin." As a psychedelic light show, it's often mesmerizing -- certainly  much more exciting than those boring New Age videos. The problem, though, is  those bland Moody Blues oldies, which are probably only of interest to those  feeling nostalgic about the hippie era. The best way to watch this video is to  turn down the sound and add your own soundtrack. DENNIS HUNT  </P></p>

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / HK delays democracy legislation GOVERNOR Chris Patten's proposals for greater democracy in Hong Kong are unlikely to be put before the local legislature until the end of next month, increasing the time available for legislators to draw up any alternatives. The Executive Council, Mr Patten's highest advisory body, begins its deliberations on the legislation today. Its consideration could last a month or so, far longer than had been generally assumed. Moreover, according to one government official, the Executive Council's blanket approval for all the proposed reforms cannot be taken for granted. 'You cannot assume it goes to LegCo (the Legislative Council) as proposed,' he said. 'The Executive Council could advise that the proposals need amendment, although I would be surprised if they were changed.' The general expectation in Hong Kong was that the Executive Council would approve the legislation at today's sitting. This would have cleared the way for the package to be introduced into the Legislative Council in the first week of February. The suggestion that the Executive Council may want to spend up to three sessions considering Mr Patten's legislation is bound to raise expectations that the governor's proposals might be altered to make them more acceptable to China. Beijing has ruled out accepting an Executive Council or LegCo-induced solution to its objections to the governor's plans. Beijing claims it will be satisfied only with the complete withdrawal of Mr Patten's proposals. However, there has been a marked change in the tone of recent Chinese criticism. Over the past week, senior Beijing leaders have sought to reassure the colony about China's confidence in Hong Kong's future, especially its economy. Some have emphasised the need for what LegCo decides to accord with the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and the 1990 Basic Law - Hong Kong's mini-constitution which comes into force in 1997. This appears to raise the possibility of China accepting Mr Patten's legislation if Legco amends it sufficiently.</p>

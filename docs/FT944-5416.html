			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Easing the pain of a prostate: A dramatic new technique Having your prostate 'cooked' by microwaves might not seem the most pleasant way to spend a Tuesday afternoon but it does appear to offer a revolutionary, cost-saving way to treat one of the most common medical disorders afflicting middle-aged and older men. One in three over 50 has difficulty urinating, mainly because the prostate gland - which sits below the bladder, with the urethra passing through it - enlarges with age. This constricts the urethra, slowing urine flow and making it impossible to empty the bladder completely. In only a small proportion of cases - about one in 27 - is cancer involved. For most, the swelling is benign. But it becomes dangerous over time if retained urine becomes infected, or affects the working of the bladder, or backs up into kidneys where it can cause stones or permanent damage. The conventional treatment is a prostate operation - rather similar to coring an apple - to make the hole through the middle of the gland larger. It entails between four and 10 days in hospital, carries risks from general anaesthesia and bleeding - the prostate has an abundant blood supply - a long recovery, and an outside chance of post-operative impotence. The new treatment uses microwaves to heat up the gland to around 70`C and 'cook' it. The microwaves are emitted by a specially-designed radio-frequency antenna inserted along the urethra. To keep its effect localised within the prostate, iced water circulates through the catheter carrying the antenna. A balloon thermometer in the rectum - right next to the prostate - monitors temperature and switches off the machine if things get too hot. No general anaesthetic is needed - just a 'local' for the urethra, plus an injection of pain-killers and sedatives into a vein if discomfort becomes too great during the 90-minute procedure. What happens is that a third-degree burn is inflicted, killing cells and nerves. The dead cells are absorbed naturally by the body over the next 10 weeks or so. The results are proving similar or better than having a conventional operation. It sounds unpleasant and - as someone who had the procedure performed one Tuesday afternoon in August - I can assure you it is. But you go home within hours of treatment, usually the same day. A catheter remains inserted until the initial swelling caused by the treatment dies down, but it is removed at the hospital a few days later. After that, nature takes its course. In many cases, patients have been back at work within two weeks and well on the way to full recovery after six. The treatment was invented by Urologix Inc, a Minneapolis company backed by Dollars 15m of US venture capital. Chief executive Jack Meyer says the average conventional prostate operation in the US costs between Dollars 8,000 and Dollars 10,000. The microwave technique will cut these costs by at least half and release hospital beds for other cases. Complications have been infrequent, although I developed an infection and prostatic ulcers which took six weeks to heal. But, as a result, Urologix says it can re-design its special catheter and cooling system to minimise the risk to other patients in the future. So far, more than 150 men have been treated at five centres. Two are in the UK - the Royal Liverpool University Hospital and the East Surrey Hospital at Redhill - while the others are the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona; the Abbott Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis; and the University of Manitoba Hospital in Winnipeg, Canada. The US Food and Drugs Administration has now approved the treatment for use at six other hospitals there and it will be introduced into a German and a French hospital in the new year. The attraction to British politicians and health service administrators is the potential saving. Keith Parsons, a Royal Liverpool consultant urologist who is in charge of the new technique, does 300 conventional prostate operations a year with his team. There is a 12-month waiting list, not least because they consume more than 1,200 bed-days a year. Theoretically, 10 patients a week could be microwaved with no need for a hospital stay, but three single-day visits are required to ensure patients are suitable for treatment and make preparations. Theoretically, too, the treatment could be given in a health centre, or at a group practice of general practitioners, or in a urologist's consulting rooms. But Parsons always prefers to do it in hospital where support is at hand immediately if anything goes wrong. Parsons' own role is crucial to proving the new technique because, of all the hospitals involved, the Royal Liverpool is collecting the most detailed scientific data on every patient. This will be presented to conferences of US and British urologists in about six months. The benefits, however, go well beyond what might be expected from solving what is basically a plumbing problem. For, once the kidneys are again being flushed properly, general health blooms and the risk of kidney stones - which have put me in hospital as an emergency case twice in the past three years - diminish.</p>

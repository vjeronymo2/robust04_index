			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Despatches: The night that friends turned into murderers - Gillian Tett thought she knew the gentle people of a valley in Tajikistan. But that was before civil war set neighbour against neighbour I thought I had misheard my friend Jamila when she said: 'They took the men out and killed them . . . .' For a few seconds, the words hung in the air while I stared in shock. On my lap, Jamila's little daughter was putting muddy fingerprints all over my notebook. In one corner of the village house, a television was playing spangly Iranian pop music. But Jamila herself was terribly still. 'You killed them? Dead?' I asked, stupidly. Jamila thought I had not understood. She drew a flour-covered finger across her throat. 'Dead, dead,' she repeated slowly, in Russian instead of her native Tajik. Uncomprehending, her little daughter mimicked her. 'Do they do that type of thing in England?' asked Jamila, slowly. I did not know how to reply. When I set out from Moscow to visit this remote village in Tajikistan, where I had spent 12 months working as an anthropologist, I expected the worst. In England during the past year, I had heard bits and pieces about the vicious civil war there and knew it was unlikely my friends in this valley had escaped entirely. Indeed, I arrived suspecting they might have been victims. But killers? That had never occurred to me. These people did not match the wild television pictures that I had seen from Georgia, Azerbaijan, Afghanistan or Bosnia. They seemed simply too ordinary and kind to be really violent. At least, they had when I sat with them during a winter gossiping, laughing, and watching the raunchy, Russian-dubbed Mexican television soap operas to which they were so addicted; and then travelled with them in the summer to their mountain pastures where I got thoroughly sunburnt while they tended their goats. When, 18 months before, I met a group of villagers during a demonstration in the Tajik capital, Dushanbe, they were clutching shopping lists, not rifles. And although I wondered occasionally what was happening on the ground, I could never match the news reports mentally with my photographs and memories. But then, sitting in a pizza restaurant in Moscow a few weeks earlier, I heard something that alarmed me. A Dutch diplomat, who had been monitoring the civil war, mentioned casually that the valley had been captured by anti-communist forces. That hit me with a jolt. Then, and even worse, I realised that, since my friends generally were pro-communist, they would have been the first to be killed if the opposition really had taken control. I flew to Dushanbe immediately and began to ask questions. The city, once as green and calm as a central Asian Milton Keynes, was scarred by war. Russian troops and aid workers had overrun the hotels. A chronic fuel shortage had brought the cars to a standstill and people were too scared to go out after 4pm. Since no one seemed to know what had happened to the village. I took a car into the mountains with a driver and his son who declared, cheerfully, that he was a martial arts expert. As we bumped along the devastated road, I asked for news. Why were all the bridges in the area destroyed? Was it fighting? 'Just earthquakes,' he said, scornfully - and I felt a little foolish. And when, finally, I arrived in the village, it seemed for a few minutes that nothing had changed. A roadblock had been set up, but the goats were wandering around as usual. And although the opposition had passed through the mountains, scaring the shepherds and stealing some horses, only a few people had been killed. I concluded, a little smugly, that I had been right all along - these simply were not violent people. Then, when I had been plied with more plates of mutton soup than I could possibly eat, I stopped to see Jamila (for obvious reasons, not her real name). She is an elegantly featured and intelligent woman who often had lively debates with me about Gorbachev and Britain's former prime minister, Margaret Thatcher. When once I showed her an English coin she asked me, admiringly, if that was Thatcher's head on it. This time, however, she started talking about the Pamiris. At first I hardly listened. Although the Pamiri people, who generally supported the opposition, had been among the biggest victims of the civil war, they lived far away - in the Pamir mountains at the foot of the Hindu Kush. A handful also lived in this particular valley, but they had been there so long that the Tajiks worked with them, ate with them and went to their weddings. To the casual observer they seemed identical to the villagers. Indeed, one particular Pamiri boy, who looked like James Dean and had a highly suggestive swagger, was considered a heart throb by many of the village girls. 'They took the Pamiris,' Jamila told me, slowly. Then she began a monologue so intense that I suspect she had never voiced it before. Her story was this. One day, after months of fighting, isolation and fear, government forces entered the valley. They asked Jamila's husband and the other village men to find the Pamiris. Terrified, the Tajiks descended on the houses of their Pamiri neighbours. And then, as darkness fell, they took them up into the hills and killed them. Exactly how they died, Jamila did not say. But the detail that kept recurring to me was that, when the Tajiks walked into their houses, the Pamiris had cheerfully asked them to stay for supper. I wondered if the James Dean lookalike had been there - and, if so, at what point he had realised his fate. 'But why? Why them?' I asked. 'These are ordinary people]' I wanted to shout, and then wondered how many thousands of other wives were now sitting in Tajikistan, Georgia, Azerbaijan or Bosnia, hugging their own untold stories of fear, madness and a terrible night when they had turned on their neighbours. Jamila did not answer. Probably she couldn't. Instead, she said only: 'What happened was very, very bad. They did not deserve it.' Later, when her daughter had gone out to play, she cried quietly. Perhaps she was mourning for the village that, only two years ago, had been so quiet. I like to think she was crying also for the dead Pamiris. Above all, though, I know she was grieving with a terrible fear - because she knows that, if the Pamiris ever return, the next victim of the killing could be her husband.</p>

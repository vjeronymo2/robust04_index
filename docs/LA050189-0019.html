			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAUMA CENTERS  </P> <P> With the closure of St. Joseph's Hospital trauma center, public officials  should now admit that the ill-conceived, expensive and overblown trauma system  in Los Angeles is finished, kaput, no more.  </P> <P> Trauma systems in Los Angeles, San Diego and Orange counties have never been  proven to improve patient survival. In the five years since the L.A. system  began, mortality from motor vehicle accidents has not improved at all! How long  will the taxpayers have to subsidize this white elephant which does us no good?  </P> <P> Emergency care at St. Joseph's and in the rest of L.A. County will continue to  be excellent without the dead weight of the trauma system. It will worsen if  paramedics have to bypass good emergency hospitals to transport patients to  trauma centers.  </P> <P> JOSEPH MORALES, M.D.  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / International Company News: News Corp predicts rising profits NEWS CORPORATION, Mr Rupert Murdoch's Australia-based international media group, is promising shareholders 'rapidly increasing earnings' and is looking for new ventures, AP-DJ reports from Sydney. In the company's annual report, Mr Murdoch says that steps taken to consolidate the group, coupled with 'intensive management' of its businesses, will 'continue to bring us rapidly increasing earnings'. Last month News Corp posted an operating profit after tax of ADollars 501.7m (USDollars 368.2m). Mr Murdoch said the company was continuing 'to examine opportunities for owning and operating media and entertainment ventures around the world. Most recently we made a small investment in a Spanish television network and are looking at other similar ventures'. The company's risk-taking corporate culture remains unchanged, despite the financial crunch of the past two years. Mr Murdoch said News Corp was 'institutionally committed to the proposition that fortune favours the brave'.</p>

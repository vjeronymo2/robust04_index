			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe June 24 TASS -- The Friday attack on a bus  with children of Russian military serving in Tajikistan was "a  planned terrorist act" and a "continuation of the well-planned  and controlled terror against Russian troops deployed in  Tajikistan," according to Vladimir Novikov, deputy commander of  the Russian frontier troops in the Central Asian republic.    Several Russian military have fallen victim to the terrorist  campaign only in the first four days of June. The latest attack  on the bus with some 30 kids and their parents did not harm any  of the passengers, however a passer-by was killed and several  others wounded. Unknown gunmen fired a grenade on the bus early  on Friday.    Novikov told reporters that Russian troops will mount  protection of their personnel by seting up additional guarding  posts and patrols in places where Russian servicemen live. He  added that armoured vehicles will be used for protection.    Novikov stressed that the leadership of the Russian frontier  troops in Tajikistan is preparing a statement in connection with  the attack on the bus.    Russian border guards defend the Tajik-Afghan border to cut  short the infiltration of armed Tajik opposition militants from  Afghanistan.</p>

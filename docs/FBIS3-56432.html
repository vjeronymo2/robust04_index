			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian  at 1500 GMT on 16 January 1993 broadcasts a telephone interview  with Yegor Gaydar in which he is asked if his resignation could  be considered final. Gaydar replies:    "I spoke about this to the prime minister. I spoke about  this to the president. The decision has been made on this. So,  it is final. Unfortunately, I am forced to decline the offer  put to me to join the reorganized Russian Government.    "The essence of the reasons that led me to make that  decision  is very simple: When they begin to adopt on a broad scale  decisions on most fundamental issues that I disagree with, it is  difficult for me to continue to do any useful work.    "For instance, I was categorically against the decision to  build the new parliamentary center. That is no small question.  As far as the budgetary applications -- which I know were  presented to the Finance Ministry -- are concerned, we are  talking about sums roughly equal to four times the amount spent  on financing culture and art. I do not agree with this decision.  I am against it categorically. Moreover, I do not understand  how, in adopting such a decision, one can at the same time  justify taking a tough economic line, for instance, on  allocations for ecological needs. For instance, the sums that  we need for resolving a most acute problem -- the dumping of  liquid radioactive waste into the world ocean -- is 10 times  less than those that it is proposed to allocate to these needs.  If one has to understand and agree with such a policy or line,  I do not understand that, nor do I agree with that. Then, at  least, I cannot bear responsibility for it. I cannot implement  it.    "That also is true of other decisions by the government,  including on the question of expanding the ruble zone. I  consider this question to be of extreme importance. That  gradual consolidation of control over the money in circulation  within the framework of the ruble zone was one of the pivots of  our policy. Namely progress in resolving this task guaranteed  the relative stability of the ruble exchange rate, the  convertibility of our national currency. I consider it wrong to  introduce once again chaos into money in circulation, without  clearly regulating all the most complex technical questions of  the operation of a single monetary system, to put at risk the  already not very high level of our people's well- being for the  sake of current political affairs. These are the reasons why I  made my decision."</p>

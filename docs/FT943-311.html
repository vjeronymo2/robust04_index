			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Markets hit by US data and Alcatel results Financial markets in Europe and the US fell sharply yesterday after figures showing strong US economic growth and weak results from a leading European industrial group. In the US, an upward final revision to second-quarter gross domestic product growth to 4.1 per cent year on year from 3.8 per cent, together with a lower-than-expected figure for weekly jobless claims, pushed the 30-year US Treasury bond yield to touch a 2 1/4 year high of 7.87 per cent in early US trading. Analysts said bond investors feared that the Federal Reserve's decision this week to keep interest rates at their current level meant the authorities were not acting fast enough to keep inflation under control. 'The markets are increasingly of the opinion that Mr Greenspan (the Federal Reserve chairman) hasn't got a grip,' said Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist at broker James Capel. The fall in Treasury bonds depressed US equities, with the Dow Jones Industrial average closing 23.55 points lower at 3,854.63. European markets were already fearful that the downward trend in European interest rates had ended, and the weakness in US shares and bonds reinforced problems in futures and equity markets. Shares in Alcatel Alsthom, the big French industrial group, fell 13.8 per cent to FFr488.7 after a warning of a sharp drop in annual profits. The decline in the shares in the telecoms, transport and engineering group depressed Paris stocks and the CAC-40 index closed 1.5 per cent lower. In Germany it contributed to the 3.9 per cent decline in the shares of Siemens, a quarter of whose turnover comes from telecommunications equipment. In London, the FT-SE 100 index closed 46.2 points or 1.5 per cent lower at 2,992.5. Digesting the bad news at Alcatel, Page 26 World stocks, Page 37 London stocks, Page 40</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Management: GrandMet's life on the streets - A new age in corporate responsibility is dawning Trevor, kitted out uneasily in the Job Club's communal suit, prepares to leave for an interview. Eviction only hours earlier from the hostel next door for failing to pay his rent means he badly needs work. Brian Stack, manager of the Centrepoint Job Club, close to London's Vauxhall Bridge, gives Trevor his fare and a quick pep-talk. 'He wants to work and, with our help, he will work,' Stack insists. Stack's cramped, spartan premises are a world apart from the stylish, St James' Square headquarters of Grand Metropolitan, the international food, drink and retailing group. But his job club owes its existence to the financial support and manpower provided by a business best known for brands like Smirnoff, Haagen-Dazs and Burger King. 'I asked the employment service how we could help young people arriving in London looking for jobs. They told me, rather unhelpfully, to stop them getting off the coach at Victoria station,' adds Stack. Now 90 per cent of his clients - around 40 a week sign on - end up getting a job, usually within five weeks. Through its ambitious community programme GrandMet is now one of the UK's largest providers of training and job counselling for the unemployed. Last year, more than 20,000 people received help under GrandMet-funded schemes. In one of its newest initiatives, the group is committed in London's East End - in partnership with the Cities in Schools (CIS) organisation and Tower Hamlets council - to help persistent school truants complete their education and prepare for work. GrandMet has provided manpower, funds and premises to assist the CIS programme and this month will see the opening in London's Docklands of the first UK Burger King Academy for truants, based on an already successful US formula. Some of the group's landlords, currently joining battle over leases which they claim threaten the very future of the British pub, might sneer at the GrandMet imagery of harmony and co-operation between business and community. But it is the vision which lies behind a global community programme now costing Pounds 20m a year and undertaken in partnership with a range of organisations and authorities. Community involvement for companies is not a new concept but Sir Allen Sheppard, GrandMet chairman and group chief executive, says it now represents a core element of corporate responsibility in what he describes as the new age of consumer-driven capitalism. 'Customers are increasingly looking through the front door of the companies they buy from. If they do not like what they see in terms of social responsibility, community involvement, equality of opportunity, they won't go in.' He recognises that there are plenty of cynics as well as some company executives more driven by public relations than genuine commitment. But he reckons hypocrites are quickly sniffed out, particularly by the voluntary agencies involved in many community activities. The strategy supporting GrandMet's programme is to give a lead in helping combat the growth of an underclass by promoting the concept of self-help. Howard Chandler, head of GrandMet's worldwide community programmes, says they are aimed at those 'not getting a fair shake'. But, he emphasises: 'We are not a refuge for the unemployed and unmotivated. We believe in self-development and personal initiative but companies like ours must play a critical role in helping the process along.' Integration into the community of those who might otherwise remain excluded is a key objective. Group community initiatives embrace schemes for inner city regeneration, as well as a range of educational and training projects and sponsorship programmes. There is help for potential school drop-outs, for the young, homeless unemployed and support for a range of charities. GrandMet employees are also encouraged to join volunteering programmes. Sir Allen says: 'It's a big part of career development. I like to see people in the trenches, not stuck in the back office. It's better than 1,000 management courses. It's playing the game for real.' There is no compulsion on staff to participate but the chairman is not unhappy for employees to believe that taking part will do no harm to their career prospects. Although GrandMet embarked on its community programme a decade ago, it recently realised that its efforts needed reappraisal. Its efforts to fulfil its broader social obligations had to be scrutinised like any other part of the business. 'There was a scatter-gun approach, under which individual businesses pursued as far as possible their own ideas. Initiatives also tended to be reactive, rather than proactive,' says Sir Allen. Now, GrandMet identifies its community action priorities from the centre, agrees the scale of its rolling commitments - it currently allocates between 1.5 and 2 per cent of profits before tax - and continuously monitors what it now regards as a more cohesive strategy. The group lays heavy emphasis on forward planning for its community work, conscious that anything less than a consistent, longer-term approach could be disastrously counter-productive. Three-year plans are reviewed annually and the core charities it backs - now including the Civic Trust, the British Sports Association for the Disabled, Cities in Schools and Foyer Federation for Youth - can expect help for at least three years. 'It is high risk,' warns Sir Allen. 'The worst thing you can do is flash a chequebook around, especially as it's not your money. If you go up front and make a big song and dance about helping out and are then forced to retract, your reputation can fall a long way. 'Each time you put up a significant amount of money you have got to agree clear success criteria with your partners and then monitor effectiveness. We can never measure performance as scientifically as other parts of the business but we are building up a great deal of best practice.' Sir Allen is in no doubt that business has no choice but to play a full role in shaping - to quote the prime minister's phrase - 'a country at ease with itself'. More pointedly, he warns: 'Businesses which don't recognise their obligations in this respect face a stark choice - they will either fail rapidly or progressively.'</p>

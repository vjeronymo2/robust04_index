			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Raja' Mansur from Nicosia: ``Tehran Expects </F> Important Changes in Baghdad Within Months. Iranian Scheme To  Partition Iraq. The Iranian Intelligence Services Prepare  Terrorist Cells From the Iraqi Opposition, Distribute Them Among  European States;'' date not given--all names as transliterated]    [Excerpts] Three years after Operation Desert Storm, Iraq's  future is still ``at a precarious position.'' Some observers  expect that Saddam Husayn will remain the head of a country that  is militarily destroyed, politically isolated, and economically  besieged. Meanwhile, others await the toppling of Saddam through  a military coup or a popular revolution.    A surprising analysis, however, comes from Tehran, where the  mullahs expect serious changes in the next few months that will  partition Iraq. Hence, Iran is preparing to gain the ``lion's  share'' of ``Saddam's heritage.'' Iran has prepared a  comprehensive scheme to exploit the new situation by adopting,  supporting, and entrusting opposition Shiite factions with  military and terrorist missions in and outside Iraq. AL-WATAN  AL-'ARABI reveals the details of the Iranian scheme designed to  use Iraq's Shiites in the partition scenario, which includes  Baghdad, Beirut, and European capitals. [passage omitted]    Informed Iranian sources told AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI that the  higher authorities in Tehran have for a while been acting as if  Iraq is heading toward partitioning. The sources add that the  Iranians want to take a lion's share from the changes that may  occur in Iraq. Toward this end, they are strengthening their  relations with the Shiite majority, especially after Iran  managed to move the Shiite religious authority from al-Najaf to  Qom. [passage omitted]    For weeks, there have been disclosures about Iranian  practices, activities, and intensive contacts with fundamental  opposition factions, some of which have been briefed on the  situation. Reports affirm that Iranian Ambassador in Damascus  Shaykh Ahmad 'Ali Akhtari recently met with Muhammad Baqir  al-Hakim, head of the Supreme Assembly of Islamic Revolution in  Iraq, and told him explicitly that important changes will happen  in Iraq within the next few months. He told him that the  international changes will eventually arrive in Iraq, which will  be divided in accordance with a confederation system after  international troops are sent into it. He also told him that  many regions in Iraq will become autonomous.    Information obtained by AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI from very  reliable  sources in Tehran says that officials from the ``Liberation  Movements Bureau,'' which is headed by Iranian 'Ali A'qal  Mohammadi, head of the Iraq Affairs Center, began to prepare  plans for bolstering the position of the Iraqi opposition,  especially the fundamental opposition, both inside and outside  Iraq. According to this plan, action cells will set up in Iraq,  and they will be ready to intervene when the zero hour arrives.  As for foreign action, Iraqi opposition elements will be  recruited. They will be linked with the terrorist cells  affiliated with the Liberation Movements Bureau and foreign  intelligence. They will work to strike at Iraqi interests,  embassies, and institutions in a number of European countries.  They will also carry out assassinations.    The plan calls for seeking the help of a large number of  Iraqi opposition elements residing in Iran, Syria, Lebanon, and  some Arab countries. They will be urged to travel to Sweden,  Britain, Denmark, Italy, France, Cyprus, and other countries.    Iranian embassies in these countries will get in touch with  Iraqi opposition groups and terrorist cells and organize their  activities and plans and establish their objectives. It was  learned that the Iranian embassies will issue Iraqis with forged  passports and equipment suited to their operations. These  embassies will provide information and details about movements  of Iraqi diplomats and mission staff.    It seems the Iranian authorities are anxious not to raise  suspicion that they are directing these operations. It was  noticed that their activities and contacts with the  fundamentalist Iraqi opposition have, for some weeks, focused on  Lebanon. In fact, the Lebanese security agencies have been  surprised by the strength of the Iraqi fundamentalist presence  on Lebanese territory and the increased activity of Iraqi  fundamentalists.    Some reports speak of intensive meetings by Iraqi  fundamentalists in the central al-Biqa' region chaired by an  Iraqi called Abu-Haydar. According to information obtained from  security sources, the al-Biqa' meetings are preparatory. They  represent one of a series of intensive, secret sessions that  take place in the Iraqi opposition office in the southern suburb  of Beirut, chaired by Abu-Maysam, the Da'wah Party  representative in Lebanon. The reports mention the name of  another Iraqi called Fakhir, who was charged with providing  forged Iranian, Kuwaiti, and Bahraini passports for a large  number of the Iraqi opposition members, some of whom actually  began travelling to a number of European nations.    It was learned that this official holds meetings for Iraqis  in Bi'r al-'Abd in the southern suburb of Beirut. The  information indicates that the external Iranian intelligence  services began cementing their links with elements of the Iraqi  opposition some time ago. For instance, in the German city of  Aachen, Iraqi opposition elements have joined hands with Iranian  intelligence presonnel to launch an Arab language daily under  the name of AL-JIHAD for distribution among Iraqi, other Arab,  and Islamic communities in Germany. A version of the paper  printed in Tehran arrives in Lebanon where it is distributed  among Muslim and revolutionary extremists.    Lebanese security agencies recently noticed that Hizballah  has been tightening its ties with Iraqi fundamentalists,  sponsoring their operations. It has been learned that financial  remittances have been transferred in the past few weeks from  Iran to a number of Iraqi opposition members stationed in Syria  and Lebanon to finance their activities and moves. According to  some reports, the Iraqi Affairs Bureau in Tehran has requested  additional funds from the Iranian Foreign Ministry's  intelligence section to meet potentially increasing foreign  operations.    The Iranian project to organize opposition Iraqi factions  calls for merging the Iraqi organizations and fundamentalist  parties in an expanded front led by Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim,  president of the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in  Iraq. The front is supposed to have a secretariat, committees,  general secretariat, and a central shura council. It was  learned that the front would incorporate some Iraqi Kurdish  factions.    These are some of the Islamic forces that could join the  expanded front:    1. SAIRI, which is headed by Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim.    2. The Iraqi Islamic Movement, represented by Shaykh 'Ali  'Abd- al-'Aziz.    3. The Iraqi Islamic Grouping, represented by Hojjat  ol-Eslam  Muhammad Bahr al-'Ulum.    4. The Islamic al-Da'wah Party, represented by 'Abd-al-Hamid  Kashani.    5. The Islamic Action Organization, headed by Hojjat  ol-Eslam  Muhammad Taqi Mudaressi. Ayatollah Taghi will represent the  organization.    6. The Imam Soldiers Movement led by Sami al-Badri.    7. The Islamic Movement in Iraq led by Shaykh Jawad  al-Khalis. The Islamic Scholars Organization in Iraq,  represented by Hojjjat ol-Eslam Muhammad Baqir al-Naseri.    The following are some of Kurdish organizations that could  join the expanded front:    1. The Kurdistan People's Democratic Party, led by Sami  'Abd-al- Rahman.    2. The Kurdistan Socialist Party, led by Rasul Mamand.</p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / How to Spend It: The finishing touch INTERIOR designing, as anybody who has ever tried it knows only too well, is much less a matter of choosing pretty colours and much more a lot of sheer know-how, painstaking attention to detail and real hard work. If you still think that is what you would like to do, KLC runs one of the best interior design training diploma courses around and it has a few places on the 30-week course starting next week. The price may seem high (Pounds 9,400 plus VAT) but if offers proper professional training and almost all its ex-pupils have no trouble finding work, even in these dire times. It covers everything from budgeting and programming to lighting, plumbing and, of course, the decorative side. It is a chance to rub shoulders with and learn from working professionals, people of the calibre of Bert Chapman, who did all the curtains for the newly-restored Hampton Court, Janet Turner of Concorde Lighting and a host of practising architects and designers. For details contact KLC, KLC House, Springvale Terrace, London W14 OAE. Tel: 071-602-8592.</p>

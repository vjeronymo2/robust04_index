			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Growth): British Biotech British Biotech, which changed its name this year from the slightly less snappy British Biotechnology, is the star of the UK sector. Its dramatic share price rise this year has made it 10th biggest in the sector and attracted US investors. The warrant, issued in the spring, has almost trebled in value since. The company has picked potentially lucrative disease areas (mostly cancer), has plenty of money in the bank and an energetic and imaginative management team. It has kept all the rights to its products, maximising potential. But the company is burning money at a ferocious rate. It could be in trouble if warrant holders do not convert in a year's time. Meanwhile, the company's drugs seem to work well, but crucial clinical trials have yet to be conducted.</p>

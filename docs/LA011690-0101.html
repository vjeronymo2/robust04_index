			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: FOSTER MOTHER MAKES CAREER OF CARING  </P> <P> At 43, Tina Devonald is a devoted mother. She vows that "until my children are  grown, my life is theirs."  </P> <P> The way things are going, that may be a long time.  </P> <P> Besides her own five children ranging in age from 10 to 21, Devonald has been a  foster mother in recent years to 50 others from the Holy Family Adoption  Services in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> "I was at a soccer game eight years ago when someone told me about being a  foster mother with the adoption agency," said Devonald, "and I really got  excited. I even think our soccer team won that day."  </P> <P> After discussing it with her family, she filled out the forms and waited a year  before the agency gave her a foster child.  </P> <P> "I've always been a perennial mom," said Devonald, who married Frank Devonald,  an Irvine computer management consultant, right out of high school. She said  she feels "it is unfortunate that many young couples can't afford to have a mom  at home." Devonald's mother died when she was 5.  </P> <P> Besides the backing of her children, "my husband is very supportive of me. He  knows this is my niche in life."  </P> <P> "I love what I am doing," said the Fullerton mother who has yet to hire a  baby-sitter for any of the foster children. "These children need one-on-one  care. These children need love all the time, and I don't want to leave them."  </P> <P> In fact, "I go everywhere with them," she continued. "I take them to football  games when my daughter is cheering and soccer games when my other daughter is  playing. I have a twin stroller, so it's sort of like 'Have babies, will  travel.' "  </P> <P> She currently has two foster children in her home.  </P> <P> At times, Devonald has taken some of the foster children with her while she  goes horseback riding.  </P> <P> "It's good for the babies, too," she said, adding: "I've always loved newborn  infants and started baby-sitting when I was only 10. I liked to take care of  little children."  </P> <P> While she gets paid from the agency for foster parenting, "it never does cover  the expenses of caring for them, but to me it's really worthwhile," Devonald  said.  </P> <P> Only recently she was given newborns that came from broken homes.  </P> <P> "My own children learn through experience how to deal with young children," she  said. One reason she decided to become a foster parent was so her own children  would "see what could happen if they got involved," she said.  </P> <P> But unlike her own children, "At least we don't have to put them through  college," she said. "These newborns come into our house and we enjoy them from  day to day. Next week it might change."  </P> <P> The time frame changes from baby to baby -- some have stayed just two weeks,  while others have stayed a year.  </P> <P> While she is caring for the infants, "I know it will hurt when they leave. But  I know there will be another one out there that will need me as much."  </P> <P> Rudolf Lukes, 87, managed to leave Czechoslovakia 10 years ago and set up a new  life and home in San Clemente with his wife, Frantiska. Their sons Paul and  Rudy live in the San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> Rudolf and his brother Hugo Lukes, 79, who still lives in Czechoslovakia, are  the only remaining siblings from a family of 10.  </P> <P> Last Sunday, one son took Rudolf to Los Angeles International Airport to  supposedly pick up the other son as he arrived from a flight. To Rudolf's  surprise, however, it was Hugo who stepped off the plane. It was the first time  the two had seen each other in 10 years.  </P> <P> "We had first checked with our father's doctor to make sure it was all right to  surprise him," said Paul, who pointed out his father has had five heart bypass  operations.  </P> <P> After an emotional meeting, the brothers went to Rudolf's home to talk about  politics in Czechoslovakia and catch up on lost time.  </P> <P> "Disneyland is on their agenda," Paul said. "Anyone who comes to Southern  California has to go to Disneyland."  </P> <P> Acknowledgments -- Stanton resident Bob Keller received the WAVE Award (Western  Access Video Excellence) from the National Federation of Local Cable  Programmers, Far West Region, for his promotional videos for "The Model Club,"  which he produces as part of the North Orange County ROP (Regional Occupational  Program) video production class.

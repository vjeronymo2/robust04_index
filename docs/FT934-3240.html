			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Silver market surges to Dollars 5 an ounce The silver price surged above the USDollars 5-a-troy-ounce mark for the first time in four months yesterday, dragging gold and platinum in its wake. At the London close the cash price stood at 500.5 cents an ounce, the 15-cent rise on the day extending its advance over the past six trading days to 56 cents. Gold was up Dollars 6.95 at Dollars 383.25 an ounce, also a four-month high, while platinum gained a comparatively modest Dollars 3.30 to Dollars 380.20 an ounce. Dealers said silver was continuing to attract keen interest from US investment funds as falling oil prices raised hopes of a further easing of inflationary pressure. Mr Andy Smith, analyst at the Union Bank of Switzerland in London, explained that low inflation and the perceived upturn in the US economy were bullish for silver, principally an industrial metal, but bearish for gold, still widely regarded as a haven for funds in times of economic difficulty. Platinum, though also an industrial metal, was benefitting less than silver because of its heavy reliance on consumption in Japan, where economic problems were deepening, Mr Smith said. Underlying the stronger tone in the precious metals markets, he added, was the development of 'cash anxiety' among investors as interest rates fell. Lower rates also made it cheaper to 'have a bet' on markets that were widely believed to have already seen their lows. 'It has been encountering tremendous interest from the funds,' Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst at brokers T. Hoare and Company, told the Reuter news agency. 'And its low unit price as a metal makes it even more attractive than gold.' She said that the funds had begun to take an extra interest in silver about a month ago, at a time when physical purchases by Saudi Arabia were very strong. Silver was being used there as a relatively cheap method of hedging against a possible devaluation of the riyal, she explained. Analysts also pointed out that silver shipments to India had been very strong throughout this year, following the easing of restrictions on imports.</p>

Zhou Duo who had worried about being allowed back after a  year's stint in the United States is trying to set up a  foundation to finance education.    In Shenzhen last week, he said he would get the foundation  going no matter what the government thought of it.    "Although there is an official education foundation called  Project Hope, it is not enough to solve all the problems," he  said.    His foundation, he said, would try to raise the quality of  education. This was not confrontational towards the government,  he said.    He said he had good connections with some private  enterprises  and was confident he could raise the necessary funds.    Mr Zhou, a prominent sociologist, was one of the prime  movers  of the Tiananmen Square protest in June 1989.    Describing himself as a moderate, he said he supported rule  by the Communist Party for now.    "There is no alternative party powerful enough to take over  from the Communist Party, so there is no choice but to support  it for the sake of stability," he said.    But he thought the party should relax its grip on the media  and allow opposition parties to flourish. The party should  eliminate dictatorship and become "open-minded" to save itself.    Mr Zhou suggested a step-by-step reform for the party,  allowing popular elections in localities, introducing rule by  law and strengthening the powers of the National People's  Congress, giving up some of its monopoly on benefits and sharing  them with the people.    He is concerned about stability in the post-Deng Xiaoping  era  and has urged experimentation in various styles of government.    Mr Zhou said intellectuals should get more involved in the  modernisation drive.    He said a hands-off attitude on the part of intellectuals  had  allowed Mao Zedong's disastrous Cultural Revolution.    Intellectuals now were too absorbed in their professions and  too short-sighted, he said.    Mr Zhou said intellectuals could help out in the  modernisation drive through education. Intellectuals should  help the government in that area, he said.    "Education is very important in promoting a democracy among  the people. China cannot build a really democratic system with  a population which is poorly-educated and which does not  understand what is rational," he said.    During his stay in the U.S., mainly at Harvard as a visiting  scholar, he was impressed by the sight of primary students being  taken into Congress to learn about democracy.    Mr Zhou said he developed a great admiration for the  American  system, impressed by people's politeness and the efficiency of  the administration. But he missed China.    "My heart beat faster every time I read the overseas edition  of the PEOPLE's DAILY. I missed China so much. Now I'm so very  glad to be back on the soil of my own country."</p>

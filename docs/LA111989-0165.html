			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUSKIES CELEBRATE VICTORY IN BATTLE OF WASHINGTON  </P> <P> Washington's Huskies overcame three intercepted passes and a lost fumble by  quarterback Cary Conklin to beat Washington State, 20-9, Saturday in their  annual Apple Cup rivalry to earn a trip to the Freedom Bowl.  </P> <P> After the game, jubilant Washington students overwhelmed security police and  tore down the goal post on the west end of Husky Stadium and threw it in nearby  Lake Washington.  </P> <P> Police sprayed tear gas on several students and scuffled and wrestled with  others on the field. Some students pelted police with ice kept from behind the  Washington bench.  </P> <P> In the game, the Huskies' offense managed only one touchdown, a 21-yard run by  Greg Lewis with eight seconds left in the third quarter, but their defense did  an outstanding job against WSU quarterback Brad Gossen and Cougar star running  back Steve Broussard. Washington sacked Gossen eight times for losses of 41  yards and also intercepted two of his passes.  </P> <P> Eric Briscoe intercepted a Gossen pass and returned it 35 yards for a touchdown  on the first offensive play of the game.  </P> <P> By winning the Pac-10 game, Washington (7-4) moved in line for its 10th bowl  invitation in 11 years. The formal invitation is expected next week. Washington  State dropped to 6-5.  </P></p>

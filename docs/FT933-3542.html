			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Obituary: Shirt-sleeved manager who was 'Mister Mercedes' MR Werner Niefer, 65, died at the weekend less than four months after he retired from a career at Daimler-Benz which spanned 50 years. Mr Niefer, who was known in Germany as 'Mister Mercedes', started with the company as a toolshop apprentice in 1943. He worked his way up to be appointed deputy group chairman in 1987, and reached his career peak two years later when he was put in charge of the group's supporting pillar, Mercedes-Benz. Mr Niefer played a key role in the restructuring of group production facilities after the takeover of aero-engineering and electrical and electronics interests such as Dornier, MTU and AEG. During the late 1980s Mr Niefer enhanced his reputation as a 'doer', acting as right-hand man to Mr Edzard Reuter, the group's chairman, who has dedicated his term of office to transforming Daimler into a broad-based technology group. More recently, Mr Niefer, a self-confessed old-fashioned, shirt-sleeved manager operating often by 'gut feelings', was quicker than some to recognise the dangers facing German auto makers. Last year, for example, he pushed through the first painful phase of a continuing job-cutting programme. However, he was also progenitor of the latest S-Class Mercedes, a so-called 'cathedral on wheels' which was in the old tradition of the marque, and was damned in the German media for being out of touch with modern consumer demands. His other main projects at the company, including a new Mercedes mini-car and the German concern's first production plant in the United States, are now the responsibility of Mr Helmut Werner, who took charge in May.</p>

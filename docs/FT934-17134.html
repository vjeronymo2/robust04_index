			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Something's gotta give: Labour's economic policy is deficient So, distressed FT reader, you are fed up with the government. Your house is worth less than your mortgage and has been burgled twice in the last year, probably by the young layabouts on the nearby council estate. You are wondering how long you will keep your job. After 14 years, it looks like time for a change. The question is whether Labour has become a fit and proper steward of the UK's market economy. Fortunately, this is not a question you have to answer just yet. Meanwhile, the Labour party is struggling to transform itself from a union-dominated dinosaur into a modern social democratic party. As the party conference has made clear, this will be hard, since many activists still prefer the people's flag of deepest red. Yet John Smith, party leader, and Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, are plausible figures, particularly where fiscal and monetary rectitude is concerned. Mr Brown says in his pamphlet, 'how we can conquer unemployment', that 'Labour believes in keeping inflation low and of course will stick to strict low inflation'. This is not an implausible claim. Labour has produced many austere chancellors, from Philip Snowden through Stafford Cripps, James Callaghan and Roy Jenkins. Few have ever slashed public spending as fiercely as did Denis Healey, in 1976. Mr Brown, who writes sternly that 'what Britain cannot afford is yet another round of the boom-bust economics so favoured by Tory chancellors' could fit comfortably among this number. What about the level of taxes and public spending? Here it is possible only to guess. To be fair to Labour, neither today's fiscal deficit nor the large tax increases proposed by Mr Norman Lamont in the budget of last March nor those Mr Kenneth Clarke, his sucessor as chancellor, is almost certain to add in November figured prominently in the Conservative party manifesto for the 1992 general election. On taxation and spending we know four things, two about the economy and two about Labour's announced intentions: Public finances are already in an unsustainable position. The share of public spending in gross domestic product is also quite high by British historical standards. Mr Smith believes passionately in the need to increase public spending, 'work waiting to be done and crying out to be done now . . . which could be made available to the millions who seek no more than the chance of worthwhile and satisfying employment'. Mr Brown intends to replace higher value added tax on fuel with no more than an attack on tax exiles working in the UK, on offshore trusts, on the rich who pay no tax, on executive share options, on the excess profits of utilities and on foreign companies 'defrauding' the UK of corporation tax. These points do not add up. The proposed revenue increases are probably too small, especially once the VAT increase is abandoned, to finance the already envisaged public sector borrowing requirement, let alone higher public spending. What matters most, however, is the party's economic 'vision'. Mr Brown's pamphlet does present the outlines of a strategy. The heart of his diagnosis is his statement that 'the vicious cycle of poor competitiveness leading to balance of payments deficits leading to low growth leading to low investment leading to poor competitiveness is a manifestation of the structural imbalance which has been condemning Britain to higher and higher rates of unemployment'. Mr Brown also asserts that 'unemployment in the 1990s represents a very specific failure of the British economy and of economic government. Fourteen years of Tory policy have resulted in persistent under-investment in our economy.' British workers must be given not any old jobs, but 'fulfilling employment'. And 'if', says Mr Brown, 'there are worries about a wage-price spiral taking off, the approach that will work is to raise the productive potential of the economy, so that higher wage aspirations can be met without inflation or unemployment.' To achieve this the twin deficits of skill and investment must, he asserts, be closed. What we are to get, it appears, is 'an enhanced Keynesian approach, which treats demand management as an integral part of a structural policy, and which deals with the radical institutional reforms without which the British economy will continue to stagnate'. As to policy for the supply side, that is to have two main elements: more education and training and a 'strategy for industry'. The latter will demand 'steady growth of aggregate demand, low inflation, low and stable real rates of interest, and a stable competitive exchange rate'. So goodbye, it appears, to that old exchange rate mechanism policy. But it will also demand examination of 'every institution, whether apparently successful or not' to assess its contribution to the overall success or failure of investment in Britain. It sounds wonderful. But does it also sound credible? Alas no. First, it is untrue that unemployment in the 1990s represents a specific failure of Tory Britain. The UK has not done worse than the continental economies Labour so admires. The continental model Labour wants the UK to adopt has been tried and, by the criteria of low unemployment, failed. Second, even if you believe those layabouts down the road can be educated or trained, it would take decades, rather than years, to transform the country's labour force. Even then it is questionable how far skills create growth, rather than the other way around. Third, where are the incentives for the private sector to invest more or offer more employment? Manufacturing companies in particularhave not seen it in their interests to expand capacity or high wage employment for many years. One reason for this is that profitability has been both too low and uncertain. Will Labour really do anything to improve that? Fourth and most fundamentally, how is UK growth to be made more labour absorbing than it has been in the past? After all, between 1982 and 1992 UK real GDP rose by 26 per cent, but employment rose by only 7 per cent. Yet if Mr Smith believes in anything passionately it is in greater worker protection, including his charter of worker rights and a national minimum wage. 'You can't build an advanced competitive economy on the basis of low pay, low skills and poor working conditions,' he insists. Oh yes you can. That is precisely the route by which Japan, Hong Kong and Korea have advanced towards higher pay and better skills. Mr Smith says simply that 'where you find low pay, long hours and exploitation of workers, you see poverty. Where you find high wages, shorter hours, decent working conditions and good employment protection, you see prosperity.' If you too believe the high wages and short hours caused the prosperity, rather than the other way round, Labour is for you. If not, you will just have to remain perplexed.</p>

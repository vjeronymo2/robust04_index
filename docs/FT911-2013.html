			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Textiles setback as Jerome falls to Pounds 0.1m SHARPLY LOWER profits from its textile operations and a substantially higher interest charge led to 'very disappointing' annual profits at S Jerome, the West Yorkshire-based yarn and electronics group. The final dividend is passed. Mr Alan Jerome, chairman, warned that no improvement was likely in the first half of the current year. The shares dipped to 57p on the announcement but staged a recovery to close 6p down on balance at 62p. Taxable profits for 1990 slumped to just Pounds 105,000, against Pounds 1.58m previously. The latest figure was struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 411,000 relating to wool prices - the Australian government reduced the floor price by 20 per cent in May 1990 - and the Gulf war which prevented shipments to Middle Eastern countries. Interest charges totalled Pounds 910,000, up from Pounds 643,000 last time. According to Mr Jerome, the increase reflected the need for higher borrowings to finance the completion of the group's long-running capital expenditure programme and provide increased working capital for the electronics side. That division increased operating profits by 38 per cent to Pounds 647,000 (Pounds 469,000), an advance achieved on turnover of Pounds 12.1m (Pounds 7.84m). The order book was 'greatly increased,' Mr Jerome said, and its market share continues to grow. In contrast, the textile side saw operating profits tumble from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 779,000 on turnover marginally down at Pounds 25.72m (Pounds 26.29m). Mr Jerome anticipated a recovery to get under way in the second half. Earnings per share emerged at 1.1p (14.1p). The total distribution for the year - the interim of 2.6p - compares with payments of 8.4p in 1989.</p>

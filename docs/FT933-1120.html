			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / From businesswoman to watchdog: David Lascelles and Hugo Dixon assess the task of the gas industry's new regulator MS CLARE Spottiswoode, the new director-general of Ofgas, will be 'reading herself into the subject' before she makes any public comments, the Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday. That could be quite a task. Apart from the 1,000 pages of the recent Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the gas industry, she will have to familiarise herself with the short but tempestuous history of Ofgas's relations with British Gas. But she arrives in the job with a reputation for intelligence and toughness, as well as an ability to charm - all traits that she will need in the tricky period ahead. A Cambridge graduate in mathematics and economics, she began her career as a Treasury economist but soon left to run her own business, selling gifts and publishing computer software. She sold her company in 1988, since when she has been involved in a number of activities, including working on the government's deregulation initiative. Not, at first sight, the most obvious set of qualifications for a gas industry regulator. But few of the UK's utility watchdogs had close connections with the job beforehand. What counted strongly in Ms Spottiswoode's favour was her entrepreneurial flair: regulators these days are supposed to understand business. She succeeds Sir James McKinnon. The hard-hitting Scottish accountant will be a tough act to follow. It was his relentless assault on British Gas which provoked the monopoly inquiry, and a virtual breakdown in relations between Ofgas and British Gas. So infuriated was British Gas by his behaviour that it called on the MMC to curb his powers, accusing him of manipulating the press and engaging in devious practices. However, the worst of that may now be past. Sir James said yesterday that the atmosphere was much improved. 'It's quite different now,' he said. 'British Gas are much more willing to co-operate.' There was an acceptance at British Gas of the need to change. Ms Spottiswoode's arrival should therefore give Ofgas and British Gas the opportunity to begin their relationship afresh, though it will be interesting to see how a female regulator is received in the very male bastion of British Gas' Rivermill House head-quarters. The exact nature of her role will depend on how far the government goes in accepting the MMC's recommendations. These called for the break-up of British Gas by 1997 and the abolition of its monopoly in the domestic gas market within five years of that date. Even if the government only accepts part of these measures, Ms Spottiswoode will be heavily involved in the future reshaping of the gas industry. One of her main jobs will be to design a free market in gas where new suppliers can set themselves up in competition with British Gas. This will be an enormously demanding task, requiring a delicate balance to be struck between market forces and the need to protect consumers' rights. If the government went the whole way, she would also have to oversee one of the largest company break-ups ever seen in the UK.</p>

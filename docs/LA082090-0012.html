			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGERS WASTE INSPIRATION;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: ROOKIE OFFERMAN HITS A HOME RUN IN FIRST MAJOR LEAGUE AT-BAT, BUT  THEY DON'T SCORE AGAIN IN 2-1 LOSS TO EXPOS.  </P> <P> The Dodgers, knowing the first-place Reds had already lost Sunday, unveiled  21-year-old shortstop Jose Offerman against the Montreal Expos. Offerman hit a  home run in his first major league at-bat, had two other hits and stole a base.  </P> <P> But the Dodgers didn't score in the next eight innings after Offerman's home  run and suffered a 2-1 loss that left them 6 1/2 games behind the Reds.  </P> <P> The Dodgers left 11 on base, stranding runners on second and third with one out  in the eighth inning.  </P> <P> Ramon Martinez (15-6), who lost his second decision in a row, worked out of  jams for most of the game, giving up only a fifth-inning home run to rookie  catcher Jerry Goff until the ninth. Martinez then gave up a one-out single to  Dave Martinez and left with a 2-and-0 count on the next batter, Goff.  </P> <P> Jay Howell completed Goff's at-bat by walking him, got a fly ball out, then  gave up the game-winning single to pinch-hitter Mike Aldrete.  </P> <P> The game left much of the Dodger Stadium crowd of 40,603 seeing visions of a  bright future for Offerman, who received several standing ovations, but it left  Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda disgusted by the present.  </P> <P> "You're . . . right this was a tough one," he said. "We had a chance to win it  in the eighth inning, we had a . . . chance right there -- second and third,  one out. Then (the Expos) get a (game-winning) hit with two outs. We just  didn't score any runs, that's the answer to it. Ramon pitched good enough to  win. We gotta win. We're not in the lead, (the Reds) are. We've gotta win and  pray they lose."  </P> <P> Dennis Martinez (10-8) held the Dodgers to seven hits in eight innings and  struck out eight. Steve Frey pitched the ninth for his sixth save. The victory  allowed the third-place Expos to stay within eight games of Pittsburgh in the  East.  </P> <P> Aldrete, the Expos' leading pinch-hitter with eight, said he went to the plate  looking for a fastball from Howell and got one. He slashed it to center. "It  helped that he started me with a curveball that was low. I had a better chance  of getting the fastball," he said.  </P> <P> Ramon Martinez, who made 128 pitches but said he wasn't ready to leave in the  ninth, said, "Today was a very good game, tight game. Denny Martinez throws  very good. We leave lots of guys on base."  </P> <P> Expo Manager Buck Rodgers said his Martinez was a little sharper. "Both  Martinezes were very good today," Rodgers said. "Dennis had a very good  breaking ball, all his pitches were working well. Ramon didn't have his  breaking ball -- it was fastball-changeup all day. Dennis has been our big man  every year he's been here. It just goes to figure if we're going do something,  it's going to be with him on the mound."  </P> <P> In the first, the switch-hitting Offerman's first swing produced a pop foul,  but third baseman Tim Wallach slipped while starting after the ball and it fell  untouched. Martinez worked the count to 0-and-2, then came in with a  split-finger fastball that Offerman hit over the 385-foot mark in right field.  Offerman didn't have a home run at Albuquerque this year.  </P> <P> As he touched home, he got a standing ovation, acknowledged the crowd with a  pointed forefinger, then was called out of the dugout for a curtain call.  </P> <P> "I wasn't nervous," said Offerman, who appeared less comfortable talking to the  media than playing his first major league game. "Baseball is the same (on all  levels). Yeah, I was surprised I hit it."  </P> <P> Ramon Martinez said the home run energized the Dodgers. "The other players were  excited," he said. "I told him, 'Welcome to the big leagues.' That's the best  feeling, to homer in the first at-bat."  </P> <P> Offerman also made several good defensive plays and showed wide range. He  finished three for five, but an afternoon that started out all smiles and  high-fives finished with grumbles and low notes for the Dodgers.  </P> <P> "That's a great way for a youngster to start his career off," catcher Mike  Scioscia said. "It's a shame we couldn't build on it."  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> Jose Offerman is the 61st player to hit a home run in his first at-bat, and the  55th to hit one in his first plate appearance. The last player to homer in his  first at-bat was Toronto's Junior Felix May 4, 1989. . . . Manager Tom Lasorda  said Offerman will continue to see spot duty behind Alfredo Griffin.  </P> <P> Mike Scioscia made several fine fielding plays Sunday. In the first inning he  caught Tim Wallach's foul pop while sliding into the screen behind home. And in  the seventh he protected a 1-1 tie by keeping Tom Foley off the plate while  handling Kal Daniels' throw from left field.  </P> <P> Daniels was one of several Dodgers who didn't care for home plate umpire Jerry  Layne's strike zone. Daniels struck out three times. . . . A three-man crew  worked Sunday's game. Rookie umpire Mike Winters did not work because of flu. .  . . The Dodgers and Expos played six consecutive one-run games here, with L.A.  winning five. . . . Ramon Martinez lost for only the second time in 11  decisions at Dodger Stadium this season. It was only the second time he has  lost back-to-back games this year. . . . Kirk Gibson was caught stealing but is  17 for 19 on the season.  </P> <P> Juan Samuel, who didn't have an at-bat, has two hits in his last 20 at-bats, no  extra base hits in his last 53 at-bats and has struck out 110 times in 106  games.  </P> <P> Fernando Valenzuela now ranks eighth on the all-time Dodger list in victories  with 138, having moved past Johnny Podres. Next is Claude Osteen at 147.  Valenzuela, who has thrown 2,306 innings as a Dodger, needs 19 more to move  past Sandy Koufax into eighth place in innings pitched.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE LONG CHASE  </P> <P> The Dodgers have gone to the postseason 12 times since moving to Los Angeles.  However, they have never been this far behind after 120 games and still won. A  look at their 120-game position during their first-place seasons and this  season.  </P> <TABLE CWL="1.56IN:2.44IN:1.34IN:1.45IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>

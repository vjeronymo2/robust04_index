			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: ICI moves towards demerger NOW ON the brink of its demerger, ICI shed 16 to 1243p as the tussle for the shares gathered momentum ahead of the pricing of the Pounds 1.3bn rights issue for the bio science arm on Wednesday. ICI shares were hit by a bearish circular from Smith New Court which suggested that the company should make a one-for three rights issue at 530p a share, which would give an ex-rights price of 630p. Last week's final unofficial 'grey' market price for ICI new shares was 590p, which would give a full price of 1220p if the Smith valuation was accepted. Analysts said SG Warburg, one of the securities houses involved in the impending Pounds 1.3bn rights issue, was yesterday approaching underwriters and institutions to float the idea of an issue at 600p a share for Zeneca. They said this would suggest an underwriting price of between 500p and 550p a share and an ex-rights or fairly valued price of around 700p a share.</p>

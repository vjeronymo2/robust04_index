			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Fashion: Suit yourself for summer / A look at the styles and fabrics which look chic and cool on the hottest days IN ENGLAND the summer suit is still a rarity. The Englishman views it as a purely practical necessity rather than an item to be enjoyed. Men should learn to enjoy wearing suits; they are, after all, the foundation of men's fashion. Over the past few decades the 'designer suit' has been growing in status, gaining more cache than its bespoke relation and reaching a high-point in the 1980s. Style and taste came to be seen as something you could purchase along with everything else - and there is nothing wrong with that. In many ways it has proved a boon to tailors who are now visited by men who have some idea as to what they want and require in a suit. If you buy 'off the peg' you get a ready-made style. When you visit a tailor he works with you to interpret your ideas and to advise and guide you through the complexities of detailing and fashion. One of the great advantages of having a suit made is the large selection of cloth to choose from. Richard James delights in using wonderful fabrics - 'all British,' he will proudly tell you. He has made a classic suit in denim, that most classless of fabrics, at the made to measure price of Pounds 750, plus VAT. He excels not only in choice of fabric but also in use of colour, which is hardly surprising since he trained as an artist. Unlike Richard James, Mark Powell does not have a Savile Row address, his studio is up several flights of stairs in the heart of Soho. Do not be put off by the exterior for once inside you will find one of the most imaginative and skilled tailors in London. He will look after his clients' needs but also offers a strong personal signature so whatever suit you choose it will never be described as boring. You could pick a suit in navy or grey wool for the office or in lightweight flannel to punt past the Stewards' Enclosure at Henley. His tailoring is quintessentially English in cut and cloth, acknowledging classical tailoring skills but not being constrained by them. He has also developed a washable suit made of treated linen or cotton which is perfect for the man who travels a great deal. A two-piece starts at Pounds 450 and will take two to three weeks to make. If you feel uncomfortable visiting London's Bohemia then he will visit you at your office bringing with him fabric books, his portfolio and his charm. Most men wear woollen suits made from cloth weighing 11 ounces which can, with the addition and subtraction of layers be worn throughout the year. For really lightweight suits, suitable for summer wear, 9oz or 10oz is preferable. Linen is a wonderful fabric but because it creases it is not really suitable for work, however it is perfect when worn in a casual manner and, like any summer suit need not always be worn with a shirt and tie. They can be replaced by T-shirts, sweaters in fine cotton, or linen and waistcoats. Espadrilles or plimsolls taking the place of brogues to give a louche, between-the-wars, Riviera look. The Italians have always been expert in the casual wearing of suits. Giorgio Armani is a past master at this look. His Emporio collection not only offers suits ideal for the office but also for summer holidays. His suits have all the right fashion details and remain classics. Another designer well worth looking at is Romeo Gigli, who creates 'easy dressing' suits in 100 per cent linen, and in a linen/Lycra mix which does not crease. He also uses a fine summerweight wool and he chooses colours beautifully to complement his unstructured look. Linen suits can be bought as separates (jackets about Pounds 420, trousers, Pounds 150), the wool ones as a suit (from Pounds 600) and the peau de peche versions are also sold separately (jackets, Pounds 370, trousers Pounds 150). The range can be seen at the recently opened shop in South Molton Street, London, W1. Romeo Gigli, it seems, is interested in promoting 'the sensitivity of a man.' In England it is Paul Smith who is sensitive to customers' needs. He has helped to keep alive the suit as an alternative to the jacket and trouser. The Floral Street shop is the perfect place to start your search for the summer suit and there are plenty of accessories, such as v-neck cotton slipovers, as well. Whether you choose designer or bespoke, choose wisely. Do not be frightened of asking for advice. In England there is a short summer and the days when you need a real summer suit are few so the one you choose should be one you will really enjoy wearing for years to come. Above all, remember, not to dry clean your suit after just a few outings - it will knock the life out of it. Simply air the suit on a clothes line.</p>

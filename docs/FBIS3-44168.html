			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [By Craig Doonan]    [Text] Durban Jan 25 SAPA -- About 30 disgruntled members of  the African National Congress [ANC] in northern Natal began a  sit-in at the ANC's Empangeni regional offices on Tuesday  afternoon, demanding fresh elections for a regional executive  committee. An official who wished to remain unidentified said  about 30 members had occupied the office's reception area by 3PM  but "more are on the way".    The ANC's northern Natal region has been riddled with  division among the leadership, particularly after last year's  elections in which former regional chairman Aaron Ndlovu was  ousted and a number of trade unionists were installed in top  positions. Among them is the new regional chairman Bheki Ntuli  who, when telephoned about the sit-in on Tuesday, said: "Yes,  there are problems, but let us handle them first." He could  barely be heard above the noise from protesters in the office.    The protesters' primary grievance was the "irregular"  appointment of the new regional executive committee, said the  official. He said there was a number of discrepancies in the  November elections, including unfair lobbying and voting by  unauthorized delegates. "The people here want fresh elections  and are unhappy with the way elections were conducted last  year," he said.    Other demands included greater security for ANC members in  the region and a halt to negotiations with the Inkatha Freedom  Party [IFP].    The new regional committee is dominated by perceived  "moderates" who reportedly favour negotiations with the IFP in a  region characterised by bloody political conflict.    Internal tensions in northern Natal led to a commission of  inquiry last year and intervention by ANC National Deputy  Secretary Walter Sisulu earlier this year. The inquiry examined  grievances about last year's regional elections and recommended  they be declared null and void and the election be held again,  according to a confidential ANC letter in SAPA's possession.  However, the letter states that a "self-centred" and  "malicious" member of the ANC's national working committee, had  with "unbridled" ambition manipulated the recommendations and  the newly elected committee remained intact.    When Mr Sisulu stepped in it was agreed that a  "reconciliation" committee, comprising three members of each of  the opposing groups, oversee the running of the region and  attempt to resolve the dispute, said SAPA's informant. "But the  current regional committee is taking unilateral decisions and  people are unhappy," he added. He said Tuesday's sit-in would  continue until "our demands have been attended to".</p>

			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 1990 GIRLS' SWIMMING PREVIEW  </P> <P> Top teams: Capistrano Valley, El Toro, Foothill, Los Alamitos, Mission Viejo,  Trabuco Hills.  </P> <P> Top swimmers: Christy Carolin (Capistrano Valley); Laura Ellison, Sionnaion  Marcoux (Foothill), Cindy Focht (El Toro), Michelle Ham, Julie Vogt (Fountain  Valley), Natasha Khone (Rancho Alamitos), Stacy St. Martin, Nicole Williamson  (Los Alamitos), Shannon Quinn (Tustin), Katarina Triska (Mission Viejo), Amy  Ward (Trabuco Hills).  </P> <P> Important dates: April 7, Southern Section Relays; April 21, Foothill swim  games; April 21, Mission Viejo invitational; May 1-5, league finals; May 11-12,  Southern Section finals.  </P> <P> Notes: Los Alamitos has won two consecutive 3-A championships and should be a  cinch for a third. The Griffins return their top six swimmers from last year's  team, which finished 91 points ahead of second-place El Dorado. The Golden  Hawks lost most of their top swimmers, including Olympian Janet Evans, and will  have trouble finishing second this season.  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley has won three consecutive 4-A championships and is strong  again this season. However, the Cougars will be challenged by Foothill, which  has its best team in 11 years, according to Coach Tom DeLong. However,  Capistrano Valley has the edge because the Cougars have a strong diving team;  Foothill has no divers.  </P> <P> Trabuco Hills ran away with the 2-A title last season, finishing nearly 100  points ahead of runner-up Mater Dei. The Mustangs return almost everyone and  will be tough to beat.  </P></p>

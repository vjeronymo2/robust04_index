			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / International Company News: Pasminco heading back to the black MR PETER Barnett, chief executive of Pasminco, the Australian zinc and lead producer, expects the company to return to profitability in the year to June 1993, AP-DJ reports from Melbourne. 'The good operating performance of 1991-92 has continued into the 1992-93 year and unless Australian-dollar metal prices decline significantly, Pasminco should return to profits in the current year,' Mr Barnett said in his annual report. Pasminco reported net losses of ADollars 58.6m (USDollars 41.8m) for the year to June 1992, widening from year-earlier losses of ADollars 47.6m. The losses were caused by low world metal prices and one-time factors. The company also reported it cut costs in the year and returned to profitability by August, when the Australian currency fell against the US dollar and metal prices rallied. Lead and zinc metal prices trended up in the July-September quarter, but they have slipped in the past two weeks.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 16 (CNA) -- The Inter-American  Development Bank (IDB) reportedly has reached an agreement with  the Export-Import Bank of the Republic of China [ROC] on a US$50  million low-interest loan to Nicaragua.    Under the agreement, the Taiwan bank will extend a US$30  million 20-year soft loan to Nicaragua at 3 percent annual  interest. The loan includes a 78-month principal and interest  holiday, the Taipei- based UNITED DAILY NEWS reported in a  dispatch from Washington, DC, on Friday [15 April].    IDB agreed to provide U.S.$20 million of the loan, which is  expected to be used for Nicaragua's agricultural development  projects, the paper said.    If realized, the paper said, it will be the second loan  extended by IDB and Taiwan. In 1992, they loaned U.S.$130  million to Nicaragua to help the Violeta Barrios de Chamorro  administration modernize its trade and banking sectors. Taiwan  provided U.S.$30 million of the loan, the paper said.    However, an Export-Import Bank spokesman told CNA that he  knew nothing about the proposed loan and a Ministry of Foreign  Affairs official, speaking on condition of anonymity, denied an  agreement had been reached with the IDB.    The official declined to elaborate.    The report came less than three weeks Before president Li  Teng- hui is scheduled to visit Nicaragua. Li will meet  Nicaraguan President Chamorro during his May 4 visit.    Nicaragua is a staunch ally of Taiwan. Nicaragua, together  with six other Latin American countries, submitted a letter to  United Nations Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali last August  requesting that the UN put the Republic of China's UN bid on the  agenda for the 48th General Assembly in September 1993.</p>

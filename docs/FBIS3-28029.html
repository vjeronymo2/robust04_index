Though less than one year has passed since the self-styled  "civilian" regime of the traitor Kim Yong-sam made its  appearance, its treacherous nature has been fully laid bare, the  article says, and continues:    The regime of Kim Yong-sam is a more anti-national,  flunkeyist and treacherous colonial puppet regime than any of  the preceding regimes.    There has been not a South Korean ruler who did not beg for  the presence of the U.S. troops in South Korea, but there has  never been such a ruler who has begged for the permanent  occupation of the U.S. troops with a promise to pay more than 3  billion dollars squeezed from the people for their maintenance.    The traitor Kim Yong-sam has opened the South Korean rice  market, yielding to the U.S. pressure, which the preceding  traitors had not dared to do. This is the biggest treachery.    His first-year record in power is really criminal and  treacherous because he has tried not only to do harm to the  South Korean people but to slay the fellow countrymen in the  North, obeying foreign forces.    Among the successive South Korean rulers there were those  who  busied themselves in isolating the North but there was no such  a traitor as Kim Yong-sam who is rushing about in the East and  West, crying for "sanctions" against the fellow countrymen in  the North.    The traitor Kim Yong-sam has inflicted bigger sufferings  upon  the people with a "civilian" fascist repressive rule more  truculent than the military fascist dictatorship of the "Fifth  and Sixth Republics", while advertising "civilian  administration" and "reform politics".    The Kim Yong-sam puppet regime has maintained and reinforced  the fascist laws and repressive tools made by the preceding  military dictatorial regimes, pursuing a vicious fascist  dictatorial rule against the people.    Its anti-national and anti-democratic fascist repressive  rule  is the most crafty, vicious and brutal despotism of a "civilian  fascist" outstripping the preceding military fascist regimes.    It is the blackest crime of the Kim Yong-sam "regime" that  it  has totally prohibited the dialogues, contacts and visits,  seeking North-South confrontation rather than national unity.    The "civilian" treacherous group hay intentionally rendered  the situation strained with the resumption of the "Team Spirit"  joint military exercises suspended in the waning days of the  "Sixth Republic's regime", the freeze all North-South dialogues  including the North-South high level talks and foil the exchange  of presidential envoys between the North and South.    The "civilian" rulers have not only frozen the dialogues  between the authorities but also banned non-governmental  dialogues and contacts.    The puppets are now inciting the North-South confrontation  continuously while seeking a reckless war in league with outside  forces to slay their fellow countrymen in the North.    Leaving intact such a most anti-national flunkeyist regime,  a  most anti-democratic fascist regime and a most  anti-reunification and divisive regime as the Kim Yong-sam  puppet regime, it is impossible to realize national  independence, democratization of the South Korean society and  national reunification.</p>

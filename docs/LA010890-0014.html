			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OLD MEN RIDING A TIGER AND FEELING PARANOID;  </P> <P> CHINA: THE LEADERSHIP THAT GAVE US THE TIAN AN MEN MASSACRE LOOKS TO EVENTS IN  ROMANIA AND ASSESSES THE OUTCOME WITH DOWNRIGHT ALARM.  </P> <P> Timisoara and Tian An Men. The parallels were striking, enough so to make  China's aging oligarchs visibly nervous: An intransigent Communist regime,  facing a rising tide of democratic protest fueled by deepening economic  contradictions, employs deadly force to halt the spread of "bourgeois  liberalization," in the process slaughtering scores of unarmed civilians.  </P> <P> For the authors of last June's Beijing massacre, it was, in Yogi Berra's  immortal words, "deja vu all over again" -- until the people of Romania  dramatically altered the script by overthrowing their Communist government and  executing the dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu. At the point, Chinese nervousness  turned to outright alarm.  </P> <P> Already forced on the defensive by their inability -- more than six months  after the Tian An Men incident -- to regain public credibility at home and  restore investor confidence abroad, Chinese authorities quickly erected a wall  of defiance to shield them against the fallout from the Romanian revolution.  Dismissing out of hand all hints of similarity between conditions in Bucharest  and Beijing, they quietly beefed up security forces in their capital and placed  them on standby alert.  </P> <P> At the same time, government "truth squads" were dispatched to college campuses  in Beijing to calm down restive students and to propagate the party line on  Romania.  </P> <P> That line is both complex and convoluted. Officially, Beijing's response to the  demise of Ceausescu has been to publicly congratulate the new Romanian  government of Ion Iliescu and to pledge continued bilateral friendship and  cooperation. Privately, however, Chinese leaders are disseminating to party  cadres two radically different versions of the Romanian upheaval -- one for  domestic consumption (blaming Mikhail Gorbachev for undermining socialism and  stirring up political unrest in Eastern Europe) and another designed to assuage  the fears of foreigners (presenting a more balanced, neutral view of  Ceausescu's downfall).  </P> <P> Such contorted explanations are unlikely to prove effective. Reports from the  Chinese capital indicate that anti-government wall posters have begun to  reappear on dormitory buildings at Beijing and Quinghua universities.  </P> <P> Like a proverbial bad penny, memories of Tian An Men keep turning up to haunt  China's leaders. Public anger, generally kept under wraps since the bloody  crackdown of June 3-4, has periodically percolated to the surface, attaching  itself to convenient symbols of government repression.  </P> <P> Government fears of renewed urban unrest have been further fueled by recent bad  news on the economic front. Industrial output plummeted in September and  October, resulting in negative growth for the first time in a decade. Some  factories have reportedly cut wages and there have been persistent rumors that  workers will have to forgo cash bonuses -- supplemental income considered vital  to survival in an economy marked by fixed low wages and inflationary price  hikes. Industrial sabotage and other incidents of passive resistance are said  to be on the upswing.  </P> <P> What China's leaders fear most is the conjoining of student and worker unrest.  It was just such a fusion that made possible last spring's pro-democracy  movement, prompting authorities to invoke martial law in Beijing. A similar  fusion presaged autumn's tidal wave of popular protest in Eastern Europe,  culminating in the collapse of Communist regimes throughout the region.  </P> <P> Few observers are predicting an imminent recurrence of large-scale political  disturbances in China. Yet the mood in Beijing remains strained, with strong  undercurrents of indignation.  </P> <P> Beijing's attempt to sweep the carnage of June 3-4 under the rug was rendered  ineffective by the presence of too many eyewitnesses, too many video cameras  and fax machines, too many radios tuned to BBC and the Voice of America. It is  striking that the citizens of Romania also relied heavily upon BBC, VOA and  Radio Free Europe to keep abreast of local and international developments  throughout their December upheavals.  </P> <P> In the aftermath of the Romanian revolution, China's leaders find themselves  more isolated and embattled than before. But their rigid, circle-the-wagons  attitude bodes poorly for China's future tranquility.  </P> <P> Nor does it bode well for China's visibly strained relations with the United  States. Since last June, the Bush Administration has taken a calculated risk,  making a series of near-term concessions in hopes that the forces of moderation  and restraint within China would thereby be strengthened. In the wake of the  Timisoara and Bucharest massacres, Bush's gamble has been angrily assailed as a  form of appeasement -- or "kowtowing" -- by a rising chorus of U.S.  congressional and media critics, many of whom are now calling for a tougher  line against Beijing.  </P> <P> Against this background of heightened tension at home and increasing isolation  abroad, China's leaders face an uncertain future. Unable to terminate martial  law in Beijing for fear of unleashing new urban unrest, yet painfully aware of  the fate that befell Bucharest's unyielding, hard-line Communists, Deng  Xiaoping and his associates are riding a tiger. In the aftermath of the  Romanian uprising, they are less likely to manage a soft dismount.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 14 Apr (EFE) -- Dominican President  Joaquin Balaguer today said his government has not agreed "at  any time" with a total embargo against any country, be it Cuba  or Haiti.    He revealed that his government's position, which has been  forwarded to the United States, has nothing to do with the  cordial relations he maintains with Cuban President Fidel  Castro. Nevertheless, he said the blockade against Cuba and  Haiti should be completely lifted only "when international  organizations consider this course of action to be correct."  Balaguer stated his views during his regularly scheduled  Thursday news conference.    Balaguer said his government's support for the embargo and  its surveillance along the border with Haiti "will not threaten  the Dominican Republic's sovereignty, because this is not at  stake." Nevertheless, he reasserted he will not permit the  presence of international observers, although he respects the  decision by international organizations to maintain an economic  embargo against Haiti -- a decision he does not endorse.    The president said the embargo is detrimental to the poorest  people in Haiti, and, therefore, the Dominican Republic has  never favored the embargo. Nevertheless, Balaguer said he  decided to strengthen surveillance along the border with Haiti  in the wake of complaints from international organizations that  said he should not allow fuel to pass into Haiti from the  Dominican Republic. He announced that surveillance will be  increased in the future, but he did not specify when.</p>

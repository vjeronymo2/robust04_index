			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Australian imports fall by 16% A LARGE reduction in imports helped cut Australia's current account deficit in December to ADollars 767m (Pounds 319.5m) in seasonally adjusted terms, almost ADollars 1bn, or 55 per cent, down on the November shortfall. Merchandise imports fell 16 per cent in December to ADollars 3.8bn, reflecting the continuing recession. Exports remained almost unchanged, down just 1 per cent, resulting in a trade surplus of ADollars 638m. The improved current account results follow last week's announcement of a 1.5 per cent inflation rate in the quarter ending December 1991, the lowest in almost 30 years. It is now thought almost certain that Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, will announce additional fiscal spending in an economic statement on February 26. Several lobby groups are pressing the government to let the value of the Australian dollar fall before then. During the last few weeks, the Reserve Bank has been propping up the currency at a value against the US dollar of about 74 cents.</p>

			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Paramount The defining moment in the battle for Paramount is still some way off, despite QVC's initial victory in the auction stakes. Both sides can increase their bids before the tender deadline of January 7, but there is no hurry for Viacom, which must now counter QVC's bid. The art for Viacom is to look like a loser for as long as possible in the hope that its own shares will rise while those of QVC fall, thereby reducing the overall value of its bid. Yet the mere fact that such a strategy appears appropriate underlines the silliness of the sums on the table. Success will probably go to the bidder which offers the most cash. That will hurt. Viacom must persuade its partners to dig deeper into their pockets, but a successful bid would almost certainly leave it with much higher gearing than QVC. Despite fine talk about the multimedia revolution, the winner's immediate challenge will be to turn round Paramount, which is short of box office hits. QVC could find that task easier - unlike Viacom it does not plan to leave Paramount's top management in place.</p>

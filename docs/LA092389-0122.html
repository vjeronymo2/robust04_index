			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEYBOARDIST PEET PLANS DARING 'DAY OF MUSIC'  </P> <P> Wayne Peet has been a fixture on the local jazz scene for years, supplied the  ballpark organ music for the hit movie "Bull Durham" and toured Japan last  year. The Mar Vista keyboard player has three albums out on the local Nine  Winds label, two tapes on his own Killzone label, played piano jazz standards  in a Beverly Hills hotel and recorded demos with aspiring singers in his home  studio.  </P> <P> But chances for Peet, 34, to perform his own compositions in Los Angeles are  rare -- except at events like the California Outside Music Assn.'s Day of Music  in Long Beach today, when 32 artists will present non-mainstream music from  noon to midnight at four small venues in downtown Long Beach.  </P> <P> Said Peet, whose quartet is scheduled to perform a set of his electric keyboard  material at Mum's Ristorante at 6 p.m., of the local scene: "It's like a roller  coaster. You carve out your own niche and it's there for awhile and disappears  and you start from ground zero again. The weird thing is that any time we've  played music that's a little more adventurous, we've always gotten a very good  response from audiences."  </P> <P> The Day of Music program will include musicians working in the  electronic-contemporary classical, world-ethnic, jazz and avant-rock  improvisational fields. The venues -- the Systems M Club, Mum's, the  Williams/Lamb Gallery and the Works Gallery -- are clustered around the corner  of West 3rd Street and Pine Avenue. Admission is free until 5 p.m. -- after  that, one $4 admission will gain admittance to all performances at any venue.  </P> <P> "It's an attempt to do something very non-L.A. -- to concentrate rather than  diverge," said Titus Levi, association president and founder. "Part of the  reason was to show the diversity of (music) programming available in Los  Angeles by concentrating it in one place.  </P> <P> "When you're doing little concerts in L.A. as the ICA (Independent Composers  Assn.) or COMA, it's only going to attract so much attention. If you get all  the little people together and they yell at once, you can hear something."  </P> <P> The California association was formed in 1983 by Levi, 26, and several friends  who shared an interest in non-mainstream music. The nonprofit organization  quickly became a network for musicians working in assorted noncommercial veins  and presented concerts in various clubs around Los Angeles and Long Beach. The  assistance was invaluable to musicians such as Tom Dougherty, who played in  various bands in Oregon before selling his drums for a computer and starting  his postgraduate studies in cognitive psychology and music perception at  Claremont College in 1985. Saturday, Dougherty will perform his "remote  control" style compositions on a Macintosh SE computer hooked up to a  synthesizer.  </P> <P> "When my father hears new music, he say he doesn't understand it and wants to  know what to listen for," Dougherty said. "I don't have any good suggestions --  I try to create fresh, original music and avoid every possible cliche to come  up with new ways of thinking about sound and music.  </P> <P> "People give me interesting feedback -- some say that my music has more soul  than any computer music they've heard. The term 'computer music' scares a lot  of people because they think someone's just gonna be onstage, hit a button and  walk off."  </P> <P> Levi now divides his time between managing the association's $5,000-$10,000  annual budget, working as the curatorial associate for music on the forthcoming  Los Angeles Festival and postgraduate studies in economics at UC Irvine. The  schedule won't deter Levi from his quest to expose Los Angeles audiences to  non-commercial music.  </P> <P> "It's like Stravinsky said, 'People don't know what they like -- they like what  they know,' " he said. "The problem is that people won't try anything different  and the press and radio stations, with the possible exception of KPFK, have  really ignored the creative music scene in L.A."  </P> <P> "People have to get through their heads that innovation invigorates everybody.  The music is good so I know I've got the right ace in the hole...if I can just  get people to the hole."  </P></p>

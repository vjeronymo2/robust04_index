			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Europe rocked by Maastricht fall-out It was another choppy week in Europe as share prices continued to weaken in the wake of Denmark's 'no' vote in its referendum on the Maastricht treaty. Equities followed the bond markets down, with only Germany and the Netherlands, among the majors, resisting the steep falls recorded by other bourses. Beyond Europe, where the Danish 'no' held less interest, a weak Wall Street and a lacklustre Nikkei average, which seems unable to break out of a range around 17,000, weighed on sentiment, leaving the FT-Actuaries World index 1.4 per cent lower on the week in local currency terms. Within Europe, Italy, Spain, France and the UK led the others lower. Spain and Italy stand out because of the perceived problems which both have in meeting the convergence criteria which form part of the Maastricht treaty. Other factors depressing sentiment in Milan included the difficulty in resolving the deadlock over the formation of a new government, and technical problems with the computer-linked trading system towards the end of the week which kept volumes low. Although the Maastricht fall-out is likely to affect European markets for some time to come, the release of German money supply data this week may inspire a little confidence, with some analysts forecasting a small fall in M3. Mexico had its own problems, with unsubstantiated rumours that Telmex employees were about to sell their 2.9 per cent stake leading the market down. Uncertainty remains as to what the employees will do, with reports that each could be allocated Dollars 20,000 worth of stock presently held in a trust fund. Among the Asian markets, Hong Kong was a negative feature while Singapore had a reasonably good week. Mr Michael Franklin of Kim Eng Securities in London said steady institutional buying of blue chips in Singapore helped the index advance.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                    % change   % change             % change in local currency**         sterling**      in US                                                              Dollars**             1 Week   4 Weeks   1 Year   Start of   Start of   Start of                                             1992       1992       1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      -0.60     +2.75   -20.59      +9.23      +6.10      +5.02 Belgium      -0.94     -1.99    -1.97      +3.34      +0.54      -0.47 Denmark      -1.55     -4.14   -12.01      -8.14      -9.83     -10.47 Finland      -2.73    -10.17   -27.79      +1.93      -0.68      -1.68 France       -2.51     -4.02    +6.36     +10.02      +8.42      +7.33 Germany      -0.62     +1.44    -0.61     +10.52      +7.40      +6.31 Ireland      -1.92     -3.72    -6.56      -3.18      -5.12      -6.08 Italy        -3.45     +0.36   -20.24      -3.79      -5.88      -6.83 Netherlands  -0.30     +2.41    +6.87     +11.92      +8.78      +7.67 Norway       -2.53     -3.41   -15.81      +6.59      +4.36      +3.30 Spain        -2.52     -4.88   -10.87      +1.17      -0.42      -1,43 Sweden       -2.61     -1.99    -8.39     +10.04      +8.14      +7.05 Switzerland  -1.67     -1.23   +11.31     +13.46      +8.91      +7.81 UK           -2.57     -3.31    +3.69      +5.52      +5.52      +4.45 EUROPE       -2.02     -2.05    +0.89      +6.77      +5.25      +4.18  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia    -1.41     -0.51    +8.98      -0.49      +0.41      -0.62 Hong Kong    -3.52     +3.43   +61.74     +38.15     +40.44     +39.01 Japan        -1.47     -1.61   -29.65     -23.30     -23.56     -24.33 Malaysia     +0.78     +0.52    -8.53      +3.03     +12.57     +11.43 New Zealand  -2.25     -0.76    +4.64      -1.32      +0.24      -0.77 Singapore    +1.19     +4.64    +2.18      +3.95      +4.92      +3.86  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada       +0.17     +0.30    -5.50      -2.92      -4.80      -5.77 USA          -0.97     -0.26    +9.39      -1.76      -0.76      -1.76 Mexico       -5.08     -1.39   +59.88     +17.00     +15.28     +14.11  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa -0.89     +0.33   +13.71      +7.93      -1.27      -2.27  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX  -1.43     -1.00    -5.28      -5.55      -5.74      -6.70  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on June 12th 1992.

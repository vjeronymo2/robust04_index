			<p>BFN     [Text] Mashhad (Khorasan), April 22, IRNA -- Friday prayer  leader Hojjat ol-Eslam Aba'i was the target of an assassination  attempt by a terrorist here today. Aba'i, who substitutes as  Friday prayer leader in this holy city was fired at twice just  after delivering the sermon and was immediately rushed to the  hospital where his health condition was reported as  satisfactory, said a local official to IRNA.    The terrorist after his failed attempt tried to kill himself  when faced with angry reaction from the worshippers chanting  `Death to Munafiq (hypocrite)'.

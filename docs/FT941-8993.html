			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / End urged for binding-over Court powers to 'bind over' a person to keep the peace or 'be of good behaviour' should be abolished, the Law Commission said yesterday. The government's law reform body said the 'archaic power' offends against modern notions of justice and human rights. A person can be bound over without being convicted of an offence, and although people cannot be bound over without their consent, they may be jailed if they refuse to give it.</p>

			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIME FOR A FIRST GENTLEMAN  </P> <P> It was a speech writer, a woman, who wrote the words "kinder, gentler nation"  that helped propel George Bush into the White House. But it is another woman,  his wife Barbara, who is giving force to the words.  </P> <P> In her self-effacing way, this smart First Lady has probably scored more  political points for the President than any superpower summit could.  </P> <P> America loves leaders who poke fun at themselves. So when they said Barbara  Bush looked like everybody's grandmother (including, some said unkindly, her  husband's) she replied, "My mail tells me that a lot of fat, white-haired,  wrinkled ladies are tickled pink."  </P> <P> Barbara Bush is not pushing the conventional boundaries of the First Lady's  role. She is comfortable with who she is, and she has a talent for putting  others at ease, be it Raisa Gorbachev, who for her own domestic political  reasons probably needed a low-key visit; or the students of Wellesley, some of  whom didn't want the President's wife as commencement speaker.  </P> <P> Mrs. Bush disarmed most of her Wellesley critics at Friday's moving  commencement ceremony by talking about respecting differences -- and by  throwing in humorous references to cinematic bad boy Ferris Bueller. Sure, the  First Lady, not surprisingly, is no rebel. But did she tip her hand? "Somewhere  out there," she told the Wellesley graduates, "(there) may even be someone who  will one day follow in my footsteps and preside over the White House as the  President's spouse -- and I wish him well."  </P></p>

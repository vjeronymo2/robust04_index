			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Trade plan sows wrath of Chilean grape growers / A move to allow Argentine competitors to ship through the country's ports FRANCISCO ECHEVERRIA lost his faith in modernity around 1850, when the latest mining equipment he had imported from Britain caught the trailing garments of his Parisian bride and ripped her to shreds. Echeverria never returned to his foundry in the valley of Copiapo, an oasis in the Atacama desert that was the centre of Chile's feverish mining boom 150 years ago. He would not recognise his barren valley today. Thousands of acres have been reclaimed from the desert, which is now carpeted with row upon row of delicate grape vines. Under the harsh midday sun, the grey, almost colourless mountains that rise on either side of the valley are in stark contrast to the deep green trellises below. Chile has an exceptionally long grape harvesting season. It starts at Copiapo in November and follows the sun to end south of Santiago in March or April. A 20,000-strong labour force also follow the sun. The largely female workers leave their families at the start of the summer and put up in rough accommodation offered by large estates and packing plants, swelling small towns like Copiapo at weekends. Desert reclamation, which began 10 years ago, is an expensive business. Because the Copiapo river is little more than a brackish trickle, deep wells must be dug to tap the valley's water table. The grape vines are watered by drip irrigation, which rations the most precious commodity in the desert. Initial outlays are high - requiring a typical investment of Dollars 5,000 an acre - and yields are much lower than in the orchards around Santiago. But handsome profits are earned from Copiapo's early produce at a time when fresh grapes are not available anywhere else in the world. The first fruits of the valley can fetch up to Dollars 40 per 8.2 kg box when they arrive at the port of Philadelphia in November. By March prices have fallen to about Dollars 11 a box. A shiver of fear swept through the Copiapo valley earlier this month when the government announced plans to allow Argentine fruit exporters a Pacific outlet through the port of Caldera. The opening of Chilean ports to Argentine trade next year forms part of an economic integration accord signed in 1990. Instead of trundling through hundreds of kilometres of pampas to reach Buenos Aires, fruit exports from northern Argentina will only have to make the relatively brief trip across the Andes before setting sail. Fear rapidly turned to indignation. Chilean producers do not want competition from Argentina, which harvests in the same months. But over and above this, they are terrified that the transit of fresh Argentine produce through the valley of Copiapo might bring pests such as the Mediterranean fruit fly. Up to now, the desert, the Andes and the Pacific Ocean have formed natural barriers against infestation. The Chilean Ministry of Agriculture promises to apply quarantines and strict sanitary controls at border crossings, but fruit growers have not been pacified. 'Any lorry driver could bring the Medfly in an apple in his packed lunch,' says Mr Guillermo Irrarazabal, who works for David del Curto, Chile's biggest fruit exporter. For Chile's fruit business, which earned close to Dollars 1bn last year, the double-edged sword of competition and infestation conjures visions of Argentine orchards riddled with uncontrollable plagues all storming the Andes. Mr Ricardo Ariztia, president of Fedefruta, the fruit producers federation, says he cannot understand why the government is willing to put Chile's fruit exports at risk. 'We are strongly urging the authorities to reconsider this decision,' he says. Foreign markets, particularly in Japan and the US, are hard to win and easily lost. 'An outbreak of Medfly could wipe out years of marketing efforts,' says Mr Mauricio Meyer, a quality control expert. As an example, Mr Meyer recalls that the Chilean Exporters' Association had to build a Dollars 1m experimental station in the middle of the Atacama desert to prove to Japanese trade officials that the Mediterranean fruit fly could not cross the desert and was killed by 10 days in cold storage. 'This despite 20 years of published research already proving the point,' he concludes, a note of exasperation creeping into his voice. Japan has just put Chile through a tough five-year test period to monitor the quality of its fruit. The US recession, which has depressed demand for Chile's produce, has put exporters in a fighting mood. They are working hard to open new markets in Asia's Pacific Rim countries. The last thing they want is Argentine rivals muscling in on their territory.</p>

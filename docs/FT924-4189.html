			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / International Company News: Viag sees bleak outlook for 1993 VIAG, the energy-based German conglomerate, expects little improvement in profit and sales growth until the end of next year. Net profits fell in the first nine months of the current financial year by 9 per cent to DM292m (Dollars 185m), while turnover eased marginally to DM17.75bn, compared with the same period in 1991. Mr Alfred Pfeiffer, Viag's chairman, said the results were affected by the slowdown in growth in the domestic market, as well as currency fluctuations on the international markets. Two sectors of the group appear particularly vulnerable, with turnover rising less than 1 per cent for aluminium, and falling by 7 per cent for fire prevention equipment. At the same time, surplus stocks, increasingly common across German industry, are also hitting Viag's packaging arm and primary aluminium sectors. Gerresheimer Glas, under which Viag's glass manufacturing sector is grouped, also showed a sharp fall in turnover from DM142m to DM67m. However, the group's interim results have been partly cushioned by the chemical sector, where turnover rose by 7 per cent. Total spending on new investments also fell from DM2.03bn to DM509m, although this was expected following a rapid expansion of Viag throughout 1991. Sales at Preussag, the German industrial group, fell 3.9 per cent to DM24.5bn (Dollars 15.5bn) for the fiscal year which ended on September 30, however net profits were slightly above last year's DM425m . Mr Ernst Pieper, the group's chairman, said last year's dividend of DM10 per share would be unchanged. He added that order inflows continued to be stable at DM28.1bn, and the order backlog had risen by 5.3 per cent to DM11.8bn. However, Preussag Stahl, the group's steel subsidiary, yesterday announced that it was planning to introduce a shorter working week, which will last for three months, starting in January. Preussag Stahl profits fell 51 per cent, from DM91m in 1991 to DM45m this year.</p>

			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Poles back Bush on trip to Warsaw PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH came to Warsaw yesterday to bury one long-dead Polish prime minister and receive the unstinting praise of its current president. His five-hour foray into Warsaw, en route to the G7 summit in Munich, was perhaps conceived as much with domestic politics as diplomacy in mind. There are an estimated 12m Polish Americans. It therefore did Mr Bush no harm to have President Lech Walesa say, albeit undiplomatically, that if he were an American he would vote for Mr Bush in November. Mr Walesa is, after all, probably more revered in the US than he is at present in Poland. Nor could there be any doubt that the sizeable crowd in Castle Square appreciated Mr Bush's gesture in personally bringing back home the ashes of Ignacy Paderewski, the pianist who symbolised the cause of Polish independence in the dark days at the start of the second world war. Paderewski's remains had lain in Arlington National Cemetery outside Washington at the behest of President Franklin Roosevelt 'until Poland would be free'. That day, Mr Bush proclaimed yesterday, had now come. There was some substance amid the symbolism of the president's mission. The US would, he announced, allocate its unused Dollars 200m (Pounds 100m) contribution to Poland's currency stabilisation fund to other uses 'once Poland is back on track with the IMF'. This sum might be used, he said, to help finance Polish exports or the capitalisation of banks to support new businesses. He promised to press the cause of aid to Poland at the summit. But mostly his purpose, as outlined in a speech after the Paderewski funeral mass, was to link Poland with 'the American dream,' past and present. Traditionally, Polish Americans, in the big cities such as Chicago, Milwaukee, Cleveland and New York, have been working-class Democrats. President Ronald Reagan made inroads into this opposition stronghold by inveighing against the 'evil empire' that was the Soviet Union. Mr Bush needs to hold on to these gains. So, in bringing home the ashes of a Polish patriot, he was campaigning as effectively as he would in the union halls and bars of the mid-west. The applause and chants of his name wafting over Castle Square yesterday afternoon far exceeded in their warmth and spontaneity anything he can expect back home. Mr Bush's visit to Warsaw offered a fleeting break for Poland's politicians, busy with their long search for a government with a stable parliamentary majority, Christopher Bobinski adds from Warsaw. At the weekend seven parties agreed to back Ms Hanna Suchocka, 46, a lawyer from the pro-market Democratic Union, for prime minister. Mr Walesa has to approve the choice, which marks the end of efforts by Mr Waldemar Pawlak, head of the PSL farmers' party, to form a government.</p>

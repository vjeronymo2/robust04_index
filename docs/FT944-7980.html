			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Allied Dunbar to replace pensions with single plan Allied Dunbar, the life insurer owned by BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services group, is to replace its range of pension policies with a single adaptable plan intended to give customers greater flexibility. From the start of next year, customers will be able to decide on a specific payment term for regular contributions, and switch between different types of personal pension within a single plan. The commissions which Allied Dunbar pays its sales force and independent financial advisers will be trimmed and spread over a longer period of the policy instead of being taken entirely from the initial premiums. The move is a further sign of the way the life insurance industry is responding to the forthcoming new regulatory regime. From next year companies will have to disclose to customers more information about products, including the cost of paying commission and the payment back to investors who surrender long-term policies after just a few years. Standard Life and TSB have already responded to the disclosure regime by announcing changes in their products. Allied Dunbar, which has 5 to 6 per cent of the personal pensions market, said that the new adaptable pension plan would encourage client loyalty as it was designed to maximise the benefits of customers who continued their contributions throughout the period chosen as the payment term, which could be any time from two years up to the expected retirement age. However, by including a range of options - customers could decide, for example, to commit themselves at first only to a five-year plan - it should also offer a better deal to investors who want to stop contributions after just a few years. While two successive five-year policies would produce a lower value after 10 years than a single 10-year policy, they would give better value to customers at an earlier stage. The new plan will allow customers to move more easily between types of personal pensions - for example, from a free-standing personal plan to an additional voluntary contribution which could run alongside an occupational scheme. Mr Tony Reardon, pensions marketing manager, said that the plan would enable Allied Dunbar to reach new areas of the pensions market: its current products were more than 10 years old, he said.</p>

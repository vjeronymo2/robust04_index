			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Vladimir Taranov and Andrey </F> Urban]    [Text] Moscow, 6 Apr -- "At the Russian-Estonian talks the  work of the delegations of the two sides has stalled." This  appraisal of the 18th round of the talks was given by Vasiliy  Svirin, Russian Federation ambassador-at-large, who heads the  Russian delegation.    "Numerous draft agreements and treaties are 'wandering' from  one round of talks to another," he explained. "This means that  a basis of relations, in the legal form of a treaty, between our  states remains in embryo."    Vasiliy Svirin said the only positive outcome of the round  in  Moscow was the Estonian delegation's consent to resume  discussion of the draft treaty on questions of citizenship. He  said that Russia is hoping that the discussion of this document  at subsequent rounds of the talks would be more dynamic.    The 18th round of Russian-Estonian talks was significant in  that the Russian side extracted from the draft treaty on the  withdrawal of troops from the republic's territory the date for  the final withdrawal of the contingent of troops -- 31 August,  without giving new timetables. This was stated today at a  briefing at the Russian Foreign Ministry by Vaino Reinart,  ambassador-at-large, head of the Estonian delegation at the  talks.    "We cannot allow the final date for the withdrawal of troops  to be linked with the signing of an agreement on social  guarantees for pensioners from among the former Russian  servicemen," the head of the Estonian delegation said. He  stressed that during the course of the 18th round of talks  Russia took a tougher line regarding its demands on the position  of the Russian "military pensioners" in Estonia. These demands,  he believes, were put in the form of an ultimatum and there was  virtually no businesslike discussion to seek compromises.</p>

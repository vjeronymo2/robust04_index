			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Management: Glance backwards for clues to success Recently I changed jobs and offices, and discovered that my predecessor, in his haste, had left his books behind. What a peculiar collection. Odder than you could imagine. Most of them were dispatched with severely limited ceremony, especially those with titles like Feminism and Materialism: Women and Modes of Production. But one of them caught my eye in time to save it, although its reprieve was only temporary. It was called Foresight in Science, and was about picking winners. It contained a brief section that I found illuminating, for it described Project Hindsight, a study conducted in the mid-1960s by the US Defence Department that assessed the relative contributions of science and technology to the development of 20 types of weapon, including Polaris, the Minuteman ICBM and the C-141 aircraft. Apparently, Project Hindsight consumed more than 50 person-years of effort, and produced some valuable findings. Another indication of the potential benefits of hindsight is offered by Douglas Rushkoff in his book Cyberia, which is sub-titled Life in the Trenches of Hyperspace and is better than it sounds. Rushkoff describes an off-the-record chat with a personnel executive at a leading southern Californian defence contractor. This man admitted that his company's biggest problem was persuading 'alternative culture members' (ie, psychedelic-friendly computer programmers) to work for it. He told Rushkoff, between sips of Earl Grey, that the 'long-hairs we've hired have the ability to attack computer problems from completely different angles. It would be interesting to take the plans of a stealth bomber and trace back each innovation to the computer it was drawn on. I bet the tie-dyes would win out over the pocket-protectors every time.' Hindsight is such a useful thing that I am astounded that companies spend so much of their time staring forwards - instead of glancing backwards - for clues to greater success. I myself, for example, have made numerous resounding suggestions over the years. I made an outstanding suggestion for corporate advancement in 1970, another in 1971, two in 1972, one in 1973, 1974, 1976, 1978, 1981, 1985 and 1993. Hindsight would seem to be of most use to companies that are heavily marketing-oriented: that rely on the frequent production of good creative ideas. On reflection, though, I don't see why it shouldn't be of equal use to stodgy old banks, or stodgy old anythings - enterprises that one does not, automatically, associate with the frequent production of good creative ideas. Hindsight could be the wave of the future. The headline on a recent advertisement for Scottish Amicable European was big, black and arresting. It said: 'Death begins at 40.' The ad was about critical illness insurance. I was feeling well at the time, but the headline was so insistent that I read the whole thing. (Nothing unusual there: I am that strangest of creatures, a journalist who likes ads.) 'Things,' said the ad, 'start to go wrong at about 40. That's when the incidence of cancer, heart attack and stroke begins to climb . . . One in seven 40-year-olds will suffer a heart attack or cancer before the age of 60. If you're one of them, what will happen when you recover?' It was a nicely-written ad, and went on to plug the merits of the client's new Flexible Critical Illness Plan, which need not detain us. However, it reminded me of the convulsions in the insurance market likely to occur when genetic testing gets into its stride. For example, those two great killers, heart disease and cancer, are strongly influenced by genes. Before long, many of us may be able to learn the probable date of our death. But should insurance companies have the right to demand the results of genetic tests? Some weeks ago I had lunch with Steve Jones, who is professor of genetics at the Galton Laboratory of University College, London. In his view, genetics may kill off the life insurance business, because it erodes our ignorance of future disease. 'No one,' he has written, 'will pay for health cover when they are pretty certain that they will live to a ripe old age, or when the (insurance) company knows that an expensive illness is programmed into the genes and charges accordingly. Insurance already suffers from the fact that people at high risk are more likely to buy a policy. There may be a war of cost escalation which ends with only risk-prone people paying for health insurance.' All this, says Jones, is an argument for a national health service, which diffuses individual risk among a whole population. Personally, I hate insurance. I resent being asked to pay inflated premiums to cover claims made by people who are unluckier, stupider, more negligent, more pixilated or less truthful than I am. There's an awful lot of you around.</p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: Western Mining warns of flat results WESTERN Mining Corporation, the large Australian minerals and metals group dogged by recent controversy, told shareholders yesterday it expected flat first-half profits. 'We expect that the financial result for the first half of 1993-94 will be comparable to the first of last year,' Sir Arvi Parbo, chairman, said at the annual meeting in Melbourne. He said it was not possible to predict the full-year result yet, and declined to forecast when metal prices might show any significant turnround. Last year, WMC saw pre-tax operating profit fall 23.8 per cent, to ADollars 156.6m (USDollars 105.1m). Profit after tax and abnormals was ADollars 64m. At a packed meeting, the chairman faced a barrage of critical questioning from representatives of the Australian Shareholders' Association. Topics included the presentation of the company's results, disclosure of accounting principles, and the cost and current valuation of the group's investments in North America. One shareholder also wanted to know why 'heads had not rolled' over the Ernest Henry deposit debacle earlier this year, which led to WMC losing control of the rich copper-gold deposit in northern Queensland, and paying out ADollars 20m in legal settlement expenses. The problem arose when it emerged that WMC employees had trespassed on a lease held by another mining company to gather data, and then withheld the result while arranging an option deal over the area. 'The reason why heads didn't roll was that there wasn't any intent to deceive, any dishonesty,' said the chairman. He added that it would have been 'against the interests of the company to lose people with high levels of expertise'. WMC also told shareholders the WMC Finance arm had raised USDollars 400m through the issue of two tranches of debt securities in New York. The capital-raising involved Dollars 250m of notes due 2003.</p>

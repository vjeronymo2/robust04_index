			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / League sees plot to delay polls ITALY'S opposition Northern League, denouncing what it called a plot to delay general elections, yesterday threatened to set up an alternative parliament, Reuter reports from Rome. Mr Umberto Bossi, head of the party which dominates Italy's industrial heartland, said he would set up a 'constituent assembly' in the north to draw up rules for turning the country into a federalist state. The League's threatened rebellion follows a move by the main parties in Rome's scandal-tainted parliament to revise a new electoral law passed this summer.</p>

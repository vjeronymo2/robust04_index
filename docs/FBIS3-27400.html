Sources with the United Nations Commission on Human Rights  said Tuesday that the Chinese delegate had denounced Amnesty  International and Human Rights Watch the previous day.    "Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have not  changed their mentality since the Cold War," he declared. "How  can they assess the human rights situation in China without  prejudice?"    He accused them of ignoring the progress made in China since  1949, notably its victory over famine.    Amnesty, in a report submitted last week to UN human rights  officials, charged that "hundreds of people (in China),  including political dissidents and members of ethnic and  religious groups, have been arbitrarily detained for peaceful  exercise of their fundamental human rights."    "Torture, which is prohibited by law, continues to be  widespread, sometimes resulting in death.    "In the past two years the death penalty has been  increasingly used for non-violent offenses," according to  Amnesty, which said it had received reports on the execution of  1,250 people from January to November 1993.    Human Rights Watch issued findings similar to those of  Amnesty.    Western countries are currently holding private discussions  on a draft resolution on the human rights situation in China,  which will also make reference to Tibet.</p>

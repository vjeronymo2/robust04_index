The following summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> Appeals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=4 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Ivan J.

Broussard filed an Appeal from a determination issued to him by the Privacy Act Officer of the Idaho Operations Office (Idaho) of the Department of Energy (DOE) in response to a request Mr. Broussard had submitted under the Privacy Act. In that determination, Idaho released to Mr. Broussard his entire Personnel File and portions of his Personnel Security File. Idaho withheld under Section 552a(k)(2) of the Privacy Act portions of Broussard's Personnel Security File which Idaho termed ``confidential source information.'' In considering the Appeal, the DOE found that Idaho had not adequately justified the application of Exemption (k)(2) to the information withheld from Mr. Broussard. Therefore, the DOE remanded the matter to Idaho with instructions to explain why Exemption (k)(2) applies to the facts of this case, and/or consider, and adequately justify if necessary the application of other exemptions to the facts at issue. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> KECI Corporation, 6/20/94, LFA&hyph;0382  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Keci Corporation filed an Appeal from a denial by the Richland Operations Office (DOE/RL) of its request for documents concerning a whistleblower complaint that had been filed by a Kaiser Engineers Hanford contractor employee, Mr. George Lengas. DOE rejected Appellant's claim that Exemption 6 could never protect the requested information from disclosure, but remanded the Appeal to DOE/RL because the determination failed to describe the withheld documents or to state with particularity the justification for withholding such documents. On remand DOE/RL will either release the requested documents or issue a new determination which contains a descriptive index and specific justification for withholding the requested documents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Williams &amp; Trine, P.C., 6/24/94, LFA&hyph;0884  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Williams &amp; Trine, P.C. filed an Appeal from a determination issued to the law firm on April 22, 1994, by the Manager/FOI Authorizing Official of the Rocky Flats Office of the Department of Energy (DOE). In that determination, the Manager stated that the DOE did not find any documents responsive to the appellant's information request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). In considering the Appeal, the DOE confirmed that the Manager followed procedures which were reasonably calculated to uncover the requested information. Accordingly, the DOE denied the law firm's request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Request for Exception  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Pledger Oil Co., Inc., 6/24/94, LEE&hyph;0080  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pledger Oil Co., Inc. (Pledger) filed an Application for Exception from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) requirement that it file Form EIA&hyph;782B, the ``Reseller/Retailers' Monthly Petroleum Product Sales Report.'' In considering Pledger's request, the DOE found that the firm was not experiencing a gross inequity or serious hardship. On April 8, 1994, the DOE issued a Proposed Decision and Order determining that the exception request should be denied. No Notice of Objection to the Proposed Decision and Order was filed at the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the DOE within the prescribed time period. Therefore, the DOE issued the Proposed Decision and Order in final form, denying Pledger's Application for Exception.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Refund Applications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Donco Carriers, Inc., 6/20/94, RR272&hyph;130  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bassman, Mitchell &amp; Alfano, Chartered, filed a Motion for Reconsideration on behalf of Donco Carriers, Inc. (Donco) and McMickle &amp; Edwards in the Subpart V crude oil refund proceeding. The Motion requested a modification of the estimation technique used in the Supplemental Order issued on April 5, 1994, which partially rescinded the original refund granted to Donco on November 30, 1993. Bassman argued that Donco based its gallonage claim on its dollar purchases according to Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) reports which exclude taxes. Therefore, Bassman argues that the price per gallon figures used to convert the dollar purchases to gallon should also exclude taxes. The DOE found this argument to be convincing and used tax-excluded prices when revising the estimation technique used to calculate the gallonage purchase. The applicant received an additional refund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Good Hope Refineries/Exxon Company, USA., 6/22/94, RF339&hyph;18  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting an Application for Refund filed in the Good Hope Refineries special refund proceeding on behalf of Exxon Company, USA, a purchaser of covered Good Hope petroleum products during the refund period. In the Decision, the DOE determined that during the consent order period (August 19, 1973 to July 31, 1976) Exxon's purchases from Good Hope were made on a spot basis. Exxon was, therefore, found ineligible for a refund based on the allocation of total Good Hope overcharges (2.0854%) calculated by ERA and listed in the Good Hope audit file. The refund period, however, extends beyond the time frame covered by the ERA audit, until July 31, 1979; and Exxon had established 32,518,051 gallons of regular Good Hope purchases made after July 1976 and before August 1979. The firm was, therefore, found eligible for a volumetric refund under the mid-level presumption of injury and its Application for Refund was granted for $50,000 plus interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Nashua Corporation, 6/21/94, RF272&hyph;25435,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RD272&hyph;25435  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting an Application for Refund filed by Nashua Corporation (Nashua), a manufacturer of paper coatings, in the Subpart V crude oil refund proceeding. A group of States and Territories (States) objected to the application on the grounds that the applicant was able to pass through increased petroleum costs to its customers. In support of their objections, the States claimed that in 1979 the pulp and paper industry experienced record sales and profits, and that in 1973 and 1974 the return on shareholders' equity increased. The States further asserted that while energy costs increased during the 1970s, the pulp and paper industry was able to reduce its petroleum costs unit through energy conservation and use of alternate energy sources. Specifically with respect to the applicants, the States claimed that Nashua's sales and net earnings increased throughout the period of crude oil price controls. In addition, the States submitted an affidavit of an economist stating that, in general, the pulp and paper industry was able to pass through increased petroleum costs. In response to the State's Objection, Nashua argued that the States inappropriately relied on generalizations about the pulp and paper industry. Moreover, Nashua stated that it is not a pulp and paper manufacturer, but is in the coated paper products business. The applicant submitted an affidavit of the President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Nashua, stating that the company's products were sold in a highly competitive market, forcing Nashua to absorb increased product costs. The DOE determined that the evidence offered by the States was insufficient to rebut the presumption of end-user and that the applicant should receive a refund. The DOE also denied the States' Motion for Discovery, finding that discovery was not warranted where the States had not presented evidence sufficient to rebut the applicant's presumption of injury. The refund granted to the applicant in this Decision was $17,680. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

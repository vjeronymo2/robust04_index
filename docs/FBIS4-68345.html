			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Barkashov by correspondent Valeriy </F> Batuyev; place and date not given: "Those Who Are Called Brown.  Honor and Russia Barkashov-Style"]    [Text] Aleksandr Barkashov too, it turns out, intends  to put himself in the running in the presidential elections in  1996 and offer the people his model of society. Its essence is  reflected in the "code of honor"--the party document of "Russian  National Unity." Our correspondent Valeriy Batuyev met with  Aleksandr Barkashov a couple of days ago.    A couple of provisions of the code of honor:    "The comrade-in-arms (party title.--ed.)...must restore  justice to the Russian people with his power and his arms,  without appealing to judicial or other authorities."    "Any questions are decided by the comrade-in-arms,  guided only by his national sense of justice in keeping with the  authority granted to him by the Chief Comrade-in-Arms, and he  obeys no other laws."    "The comrade-in-arms must constantly recall that Russia  has no friends. Anyone who forgets this becomes a traitor."    "Persecution of foreign and domestic enemies of the  Russian Nation, regardless of how far they might be outside  Russia's borders, is a matter of honor for the comrade-in-arms."    "The comrade-in-arms can cleanse himself of shame only  with blood."    "Betrayal is the most heinous crime for the  comrade-in-arms and is punishable by the death sentence."    [Batuyev] Aleksandr Petrovich, what do you mean by the word  honor?    [Barkashov] This is a person's internal condition (each  person concretely!) as well as the general condition of people  who are joined together by a national or civil principle. A  person cannot allow others to spit in his face. Regardless of  what kind of spit it is: social, political, ethnic...if small  ethnic groups can join into communities to protect their  political and ethnic interests, the Russian people have been  deprived of this right. As soon as we join together to protect  our national interests, people immediately begin to call us  chauvinists and fascists. Is that not spit?    [Batuyev] "Everything for the Nation. Nothing against the  Nation. The Nation is above all." It is this "life principle" of  the comrade-in-arms that gives many people justification for  calling you Nazis or fascists.    [Barkashov] Since they have no alternative to our ideology,  they have no arguments with which to respond to us, they, like  little children, descend to the level of name calling and pin  labels on us. Yes, I am a Nazi. What is wrong with that? Nazi  consists of two words--nationalism and socialism. The first is  the elevation, the revival of our nation, and socialism is  social justice, that is, I am in favor of what the communists  and democrats are fighting against.    [Batuyev] If you are really guided by the teachings of Jesus  Christ with respect to the Russian people, certain points of the  Code: "A comrade-in-arms can cleanse himself of shame only with  blood," and "betrayal is punishable by the death  sentence"--contradict the Christian "thou shalt not kill."    [Barkashov] If the comrade-in-arms has violated his oath,  the  Code of Honor, he must take actions which can wash away this  shame. He can go to a "hot spot" and defend the interests of the  Russian people. There are also other alternatives.    [Batuyev] You said that you are offering a new model of  society.    [Barkashov] The power will belong to the people and at the  same time be authoritarian.    [Batuyev] That is, according to the principle of your party:  The Chief Comrade-in-Arms, the other comrades-in-arms, the  associates, and the sympathizers?    [Barkashov] Quite right. The hierarchical ladder is not  frozen in place. The most worthy people, the nation's cream of  the crop, will advance to the power structure.    [Batuyev] And all "non-Russians," "non-sympathizers" with  your movement will end up outside our state?    [Barkashov] Why so? Any state has a Constitution which  determines the activity of any citizen. If he is obedient and  follows this law of the society and the state conscientiously  fulfills its obligations, this person can live peacefully in our  state, even if he does not share our views. But if he undermines  the system of our values, fights against them, and thus  undermines the unity of our nation, the state, naturally, will  have no place for him.    [Batuyev] I have heard that many comrades-in-arms viewed  your  flight as a violation of the Code of Honor and that the attempt  on your life on 20 December 1993 was made by them as a kind of  revenge.    [Barkashov] There was no flight. We all left together when a  decision was made to cease resistance. I wanted them to arrest  me along with Achalov, but the officer from the Ministry of  Security said that he had no order for my arrest and he would  not act arbitrarily. I left with everyone else.    [Batuyev] On 6 October you were 40 years old. Where did you  celebrate your birthday?    [Barkashov] At someone else's dacha. It was 20 kilometers  from Moscow.    [Batuyev] But your neo-Nazi friends in Germany were waiting  for you at that time.    [Barkashov] Indeed, a group of our comrades-in-arms had gone  to Germany and met there with people who share our  views...without contacting me, the boys accepted their  invitation, but I had other plans. I was in Moscow the whole  time. True, I went to Belarus for three days.    [Batuyev] What authority do you delegate to your  comrades-in-arms? Is it possible for them actually not to obey  "any other laws" of the society?    [Barkashov] Only a person who enters our organization can  know what this authority is. In what case can we go against the  law? If the Constitution is changed by the will of several  people, as it was in September-October, and is violated  unilaterally, the other side automatically receives this right.</p>

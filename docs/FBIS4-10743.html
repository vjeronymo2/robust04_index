			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report]  <H5>  Samper Resumes Campaigning Following Convention </H5>   In a tour of Antioquia and Bolivar Departments, his first  since the 18 March Liberal Party convention, the party's new  leader and presidential candidate, Ernesto Samper, said he wants  to "transform the party into a great force for change" and  invited Colombians to join him in creating a social coalition  called "Alliance for Colombia." (EL ESPECTADOR, 27 Mar)    During a Liberal Party gathering in Rionegro, Antioquia, on  25 March Samper announced that the party's renewal would be  based on five pillars: modernization, democratization,  participation, institutionalization, and moralization. Samper  said he was pleased with the enthusiastic response to his  "Alliance for Colombia" proposal and said that some members of  the rival Conservative Party see in it the possibility of  transforming their own party into one which is "less dynastic,  more democratic, and more concerned about social aspects of  Colombia's future," according to EL ESPECTADOR (26 Mar).    Samper and the party's new secretary general, Pedro Gomez  Barrero, announced the names of those who will serve on various  party committees. These include an ethics tribunal which will  work in coordination with campaign ethics director Jorge  Valencia; the committee for the renewal of Liberalism which will  be headed by Samper's running mate Humberto de la Calle, with  Pedro Gomez and national campaign director Fernando Botero  acting as coordinators, and additional members to include six  women, seven youth representatives, and some legislators. Carlos  Lleras de la Fuente, David Turbay, Carlos Lemos, and Rodolfo  Gonzalez--all of whom competed with Samper for the Liberal Party  candidacy--will serve on an advisory committee. In addition,  Samper appointed Carlos Lemos, Carlos Lleras de la Fuente, and  former acting mayor of Bogota Sonia Duran to help direct his  campaign in Bogota. (EL ESPECTADOR, 24, 26 Mar)    The candidate has also begun a new publicity campaign which,  according to Samper's "image adviser" Rodrigo Pardo, emphasizes  the candidate's desire for a "new social policy, since people  have been the candidate's primary concern." (EL ESPECTADOR, 24  Mar) New posters are now being circulated which show Samper, his  wife Jacquin, and their two sons, standing at the center of a  long line of people--representing every social class and age  group, as well as different races--in front of a banner  displaying Samper's name in huge letters and the slogan "It's  the people's time." (EL ESPECTADOR, 24 Mar) Speaking with  reporters after launching this new publicity campaign, Samper  said the strategy now is to spread that message, according to EL  TIEMPO (24 Mar). Another version of the poster, symbolizing  Samper's support for women's rights, shows Samper's wife with an  all female group.  <H5>  Pastrana Warns About Political Influence of "External Forces" </H5>   In a letter to Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff,  Conservative Party presidential candidate Andres Pastrana  expressed his "tremendous concern" about the "recent invasion  into politics, in a brazen manner, of external forces and  dealings" which he likened to "the first stages of drug  trafficking in symbiosis with sectors of politics," according to  the 25 March EL TIEMPO.    In a likely reference to his rival Samper, Pastrana began  his  letter by stating that at the start of the presidential  campaign, he had "found a candidate and his political director  to be running contrary to the idea of making morality and  scrupulosity a campaign issue, openly discussed before the  people of the country."    He went on to warn that, the "invasion" of "contraband  mafias" not only "corrodes the moral fiber of politics," but  makes a "mockery" of tax-paying citizens. He declared that  "contraband" is the "antithesis and number one enemy" of  countries seeking to strengthen ties to the rest of the world  and develop competitive industries, adding that Colombia "cannot  be complacent in the face of this contraband." Pastrana ended  the letter with an appeal to De Greiff to investigate the matter.  <H5>  Reaction to Vice-Presidential Selections </H5>   In a 20 March editorial, Liberal Party oriented EL TIEMPO  expressed enthusiasm about Ernesto Samper's selection of  Humberto De la Calle as his running mate, saying that De la  Calle's performance as Minister of Government under Gaviria had  earned him the right to be considered "a big player in the  Liberal Party's future."    The paper also solicited reaction to each candidate's  vice-presidential selection from the opposing candidate's  campaign director and from senators of both parties.    Samper campaign director Fernando Botero described  Pastrana's  selection of Luis Fernando Ramirez--a member of Pastrana's own  New Democratic Force faction of the Conservative Party--as the  "last nail in the coffin" for Pastrana's effort to present his  candidacy as one that "transcends political parties," according  to EL TIEMPO (23 Mar).    Pastrana campaign director Luis Alberto Moreno said the big  difference between the Liberal and Conservative tickets is the  importance each places on honoring its word. Moreno noted that  Humberto De la Calle went from being Samper's most ardent critic  to serving as his running mate, and cited numerous quotes from  De la Calle's campaign speeches which criticize Samper's  proposals and accuse him of changing his views to suit public  opinion.    In addition, noted Moreno, De la Calle declared on numerous  occasions that he would not accept the vice-presidential slot  "for any reason." In the end, however, De la Calle "went back on  his word and surrendered his principles," according to Moreno.    In contrast to Samper and De la Calle, Moreno observed,  Pastrana and Ramirez are "men of their word." He noted that,  while mayor of Bogota, Pastrana kept his promises and later, as  a senator, supported President Gaviria during difficult periods  in his administation. Ramirez, Gaviria's former Labor Minister,  was committed to pushing forward with social security reform  despite the fact that Congress "was asking for his head,"  according to Moreno.    Liberal Party Senator Victor Renan Barco praised De la  Calle's intellect and experience, describing him as "right on  target" as a vice-presidential choice. In contrast, he described  Ramirez as a "technocrat," noting that while he views Ramirez as  someone who would appeal to those in central banking and  national planning circles, he doubts that his appeal will be  universal among Conservative voters.    Conservative Senator Fabio Valencia Cossio said the  Pastrana-Ramirez ticket seeks to present an image of change,  adding that Ramirez has proven himself as a public servant and  is identified with some existing programs. Valencia said  Samper's choice of De la Calle was based strictly on party  affiliation and gives the impression that it was done to avoid  division in the party (EL TIEMPO, 23 Mar).</p>

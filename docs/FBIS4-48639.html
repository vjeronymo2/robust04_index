			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Pierre Claassen, political correspondent] </F>   [Text] Cape Town May 24 SAPA -- Parliament will adjourn for  almost a month at the end of this week following a three-day  debate on the state president's opening speech on Tuesday.    Nonetheless, various committees will start with open  sittings  soon to consider legislation due to be tabled for debate  immediately after Parliament reconvenes for the budget on June  22.    Parliament will then be in session for little over two weeks  during which it will debate the budget before once more going  into recess for the July winter holidays.    The budget vote committee stage will commence once  Parliament  reconvenes in August.    This unusual programme underscores the clear break with past  parliamentary schedules while upholding the practice of breaking  for the winter recess.    According to government and parliamentary sources, debates  on  the new government's first legislation are due to start the day  after Finance Minister Derek Keys introduces his 1994/95 budget.    The budget will be referred to committee for the required  seven-day "sweat" period immediately after being introduced.  Then the National Assembly will start considering other  legislation.    The Senate, empowered to review legislation passed by the  National Assembly, will in all probability start debating bills  a day later.    It is uncertain when the Constitutional Assembly (the  National Assembly and Senate sitting jointly) will convene for  its first working plenary. These sittings are expected to be  rare and primarily aimed at ratifying work agreed to by a number  of specialised committees to be set up within the next week or  so.    Officials said on Tuesday there was some urgency to get the  committees functioning to prepare enough work for Parliament to  continue sitting until the budget debate itself started. This  would require enough legislation to occupy the house for little  over a week.    The various committees will now function in open session as  opposed to the closed-door deliberations which characterised  law-making in the past. The public and press will now have  direct access to debates on bills unless a committee chooses to  go into closed session.</p>

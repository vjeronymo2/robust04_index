			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RECOVERING GAMBLERS OFFER ROSE ADVICE: SEEK HELP FOR ADDICTION  </P> <P> When Bob W. finally decided to seek help six years ago, his gambling addiction  had drained his $50,000 savings account and left him $32,000 in debt.  </P> <P> Like many other recovering compulsive gamblers, the 47-year-old Anaheim  businessman sees in himself the problems currently embroiling baseball great  Pete Rose, who has been banned for life from the game by Commissioner Bart  Giamatti.  </P> <P> And while the Cincinnati Reds manager has professed that he does not think he  has a gambling problem, Bob, other recovering gamblers and experts in the field  say that Rose exhibits an addict's classic denial.  </P> <P> It is the same denial they say they went through before their gambling habits  became so costly they had to try and quit.  </P> <P> Bob's advice to Rose: "I think he should go to Gamblers Anonymous. But it's  hard for anyone to say, 'Hey, I'm sick'. "  </P> <P> An estimated 3 million people nationwide have a gambling problem, said Richard  Rosenthal, a Beverly Hills psychiatrist who heads the California Council on  Compulsive Gambling. In Southern California, about 500 people -- many of them  professionals -- regularly attend Gamblers Anonymous meetings, according to  leaders of the groups.  </P> <P> The common denominator among all compulsive gamblers is that they are out of  control, consumed by "the action," say former gamblers.  </P> <P> "I used to tell my wife I would play cards for two hours and I'd come back 30  hours later," said Bob, who like several other members of Gamblers Anonymous  declined to give their last names.  </P> <P> "The family, the friends and the job all get in the way of gambling," added  Bernie A., 50, a negotiator and recovering gambler from Westminster.  </P> <P> Bernie said that he refused to acknowledge he had a gambling problem until he  lost his wife, his children and his home. Bernie said he attended his first  Gamblers Anonymous meetings the same day he was so broke from gambling losses  that he did not have enough money to get his clothes back from the cleaners.  </P> <P> "Toward the end, my whole life was caught up in gambling," said Bernie, who was  rendered penniless despite an annual income "in the six figures."  </P> <P> "It was like I was in a fog all the time," he added. "It was horrible."  </P> <P> Jim, 28, a salesman from Long Beach who has been attending Orange County  Gamblers Anonymous meetings for nearly two years, said that he lived like a  pauper -- despite making $90,000 a year -- because of his obsession with sports  betting.  </P> <P> "I'd bet on anything. I'd bet on games that I couldn't name two players on  either team," he said. "I couldn't stop. It started off as a fun thing. But  then it was more and more until I hit bottom."  </P> <P> By the time Jim was 26, he said he had lost $400,000 to gambling and was  $10,000 in debt at the time he finally decided to seek help.  </P> <P> "I think Pete Rose has a problem," he said. "You start betting illegally with  bookies (as Rose allegedly has done) and you've got a problem."  </P> <P> Rosenthal, the psychiatrist, said that denial is "extremely common" among  compulsive gamblers; even more than other addictions.  </P> <P> "Since no substance is ingested with gambling, the denial is even stronger,"  Rosenthal said.  </P></p>

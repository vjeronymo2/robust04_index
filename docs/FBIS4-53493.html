			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 17 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- The launching  of the Malaysian East Asian Satellite (MEASAT) by the end of  next year will make Malaysia a regional communications centre,  Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said Tuesday.    MEASAT, as a regional satellite system, would not only meet  part of the telecommunications and broadcasting needs of the  country but also play an important role in Malaysia's  contribution to the development of communications in Asia, he  said.    This was acknowledged at coordinating meetings with the  countries concerned over the last 18 months, he said at the  signing of a contract, for the manufacture of two MEASAT  satellites, between Binariang Sdn Bhd [Company Limited], a  Malaysian consortium, and Hughes Communications International  Incorporated (United States), here.    Dr. Mahathir said communication links throughout the  country,  including to the remote areas, would no longer be bound by  restrictions with the availability of MEASAT.    In fact, he said, the communication links would stretch to  areas outside the country which would be covered by MEASAT.    This will bridge the gap in communications between our  country and neighbouring countries, apart from stepping up  communications with India and other countries in Asia, he said.    Dr. Mahathir said the government would also encourage MEASAT  to invest in satellites launched by Asian countries.    The government wants communication links in the region to  depend on and be connected with one another and be capable of  upholding our regional traditional values, he said.    In this connection, he said, Malaysia welcomed the  participation of other countries in the region in the launching  of the second MEASAT satellite system in 1996.    Dr. Mahathir also said that the launching of MEASAT would  take Malaysia to the era of a proper broadcasting service.    This was because MEASAT would pioneer the use of the KU-band  transponder which had hitherto been assumed as unsuitable for  the Asian region because of poor reception by small antennae in  homes during heavy rain.    Other satellite systems in the region only operate on the  C-band for analog telecommunications and broadcasting, which  requires larger antennae and related cable systems, he said.    Dr. Mahathir said MEASAT had been designed with the latest  technology, including the use of digital modulation and  encryption.    In this way, the people in the country would be able to use  the direct to user service through the KU-band whereby only  authorised receivers would obtain the programmes.    He also said that the DTU system used by MEASAT not only  provided for a high quality of broadcast and reception but its  technology also allowed the government to license MEASAT under  the broadcasting act unlike the C-band from overseas which was  beyond control.    Dr. Mahathir said another of MEASAT's safeguards was for any  other satellite wanting to cover Malaysia to coordinate with the  energy, telecommunications and post ministry.    In the business sector, he said, DTU services could provide  the latest news in the region, video conferencing facilities and  despatch of financial data quickly.</p>

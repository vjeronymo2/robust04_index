			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Survey of Design in Europe (3): Identities have to endure - Graphic designers work across national borders For graphic designers who believe they have a vital message for business, the early 1990s is a period of both modest progress and - at times - frustrating retrenchment. On the one hand, clients left reeling by designers making a hit-and-run dash for the fast buck in the 1980s are now understandably shy of sweeping invitations to throw out perfectly servicable identities and start all over again. On the other hand, the future of almost any ambitious European business will lie as much outside its national borders as within them, and there is an all the more pressing need for design as a way of differentiating yourself. 'I don't think there's less work,' says Chris Ludlow, a partner in Henrion, Ludlow &amp; Schmidt, corporate identity specialists in London. 'But there is more nervousness about making visual changes. People want to maintain or adapt or service their existing identities, but also to see them in the context of the total organisation. You can't always demand a clean sheet of paper'. Designers, like their clients, must increasingly think European if they are to thrive. A German partner helps to give Henrion, Ludlow &amp; Schmidt a close understanding of the German mentality and market place. Clients include Beiersdorf (cosmetics and pharmaceuticals,) Krups and Volkswagen. Lloyd Northover Citigate, a 35-strong consultancy, numbers Banco Santander, Madrid, Intrum Justitia and Amsterdam among its clients. But what makes a German manufacturer turn to a British consultancy? The answer lies in what Ludlow guardedly calls the 'myth, or fact, of British creativity.' The humour element,' he adds, ' is very much appreciated.' At the same time, the very fact that design is so well integrated into German companies (there are fewer external consultancies; designers work in-house) means they often feel a need to go outside in search of a strategic overview. 'A lot of the work they do on the continent is much more more formal - systems - less emotional and imaginative,' says John Lloyd of Lloyd Northover Citigate. 'Our style in the UK is closer to the US style.' That may be so, but the designer working across national borders faces some obvious pitfalls. Is it possible to reconcile and satisfy the tastes of so many different markets without reducing the individuality of a country's graphics to an inoffensive but bland and flavourless Eurostyle, which ends up making everywhere look the same? As Lloyd himself concedes: 'There is a danger that you try to please everybody and end up pleasing no one.' Lloyd Northover Citigate's railway identity and livery for European Night Services recently received approval from the Dutch, Belgium, French, German and British partners in the cross-Channel project. 'It really is a pan-European brand,' says Lloyd. 'It's more to do with the benefits of the service than any of the destinations.' The other important changes in European graphics are being driven by technology. In design studios Apple Mackintosh's domination is now complete. Neville Brody, the 'bad boy' of 1980s design who became an international star, believes that the computer will force change at all levels of the design business. 'The annual report still needs laying out,' he says, 'but more and more companies have gone in-house with their design because they can - it makes financial sense, it makes manpower sense. The outside designer's role is to come up with a structure, a language, and probably a series of digital templates. The age of the corporate design manual is completely finished.' Not quite finished, perhaps, but certainly evolving fast. CD-Rom-based identity management systems are already replacing cumbersome paper manuals. Electronic multimedia annual reports will soon be commonplace. The big studios may be slower to retool for change, but they can see it coming. Lloyd Northover Citigate has recently established a 'new media group' to explore these issues. But there is a larger problem. Whatever the merits of the identity specialists' strategic thinking, the design outcome is often disappointing. Since the 1980s, the gap between the larger, business-conscious consultancies and smaller creative teams has widened. Ironically, the reason Neville Brody has been visible in the 1990s is because, like his larger rivals, he has been working on the continent - in France, Germany and Spain. His most elaborate commission, an ingenious indentity for Osterreichischer Rundfunk, the Austrian state broadcasting company (ORF), based on structure and graphic relationships rather than a simple inflexible logo, suggests that a reassessment is in order - not only of Brody himself, but of the way corporations commission their graphics.

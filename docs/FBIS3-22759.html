Sethna has described a "absolute hogwash"  recent reports that Pakistan has acquired nuclear weapon  capability and that the Indian sub-continent was "a  screwdriver's turn" away from a nuclear holocaust twice in the  last seven years.    In an interview with INDIAN EXPRESS Sethna who was AEC chief  from 1972 to 1983 during which time the country exploded an  experimental nuclear device at Pokhran in Rajasthan said  contrary to Pakistan's claims, it had not been able to achieve  more than 60 per cent uranium enrichment with the centrefuge  technology that it had acquired.    The enrichment required for gas to be converted into  bombgrade heavy metal was at least 90 per cent, he pointed out.    Besides, it had never seriously taken the plutonium path  whereas India had started reprocessing plutonium way back in  1967-68.    Sethna said the Americans were given to exaggeration and it  suited Pakistan to be seen as a burgeoning nuclear power in the  region for domestic political reasons.    While contending that India was way ahead of Pakistan in the  nuclear field he denied that it ever had aggressive intentions.  Reacting to the reported claim by an American journalist William  E. Burrows in his book Critical Mass that Indira Gandhi had made  elaborate plans to bomb Pakistan's Kahuta enrichment plant  before she was assassinated in 1984 he said this was a blatant  lie.    Being in a vantage position in the AEC and the Government  there was no way such a plan could have escaped his attention,  he added.    Asked how he felt now about the 1974 Pokhran blast as he  looked back, Sethna said he was confused as to what purpose was  served in exploding a device and then not following it up. "We  should have gone flat out, acquired the status of a nuclear  power and bargained for a place in the Security Council," he  said with authority.    Reacting to a question on how secure Bombay's nuclear  installations were from enemy air attacks, Sethna said the Cyrus  and Dhruva reactors as also the plutonium reprocessing  facilities were well protected. However, the radio metallurgy  and radio chemistry labs in the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre  were vulnerable.    Queried about the possibility of a nuclear arms race in Asia  in the wake of North Korea's acquisition of nuclear capability  he said American attempts to bring the North Koreans to heal  were in order.    However, reports about US plans to supply Scud missiles to  South Korea were disturbing.    The Scuds were proved ineffective during the Gulf War and  any  effort to arm South Korea with them would fuel suspicions that  the US is pandering to its strong arms suppliers lobby.</p>

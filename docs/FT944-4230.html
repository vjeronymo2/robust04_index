			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Budget Statement: Motor industry condemns increase - Petrol duty The additional 1p per litre duty to be imposed by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, on petrol and diesel fuels was widely attacked by motor industry, freight transport and motoring organisations last night, John Griffiths writes. The Freight Transport Association said the change would add Pounds 100m to the industry's costs in addition to the Pounds 250m to Pounds 300m burden it already faced from higher fuel taxes announced in last week's Budget. Both increases come into effect on January 1. Yesterday's 1p increase applies to leaded and unleaded petrol and follows Budget increases of 2.5p a litre on leaded and unleaded petrol and 3.2p per litre on diesel. It equates to an increase of 4.5p a gallon and brings the post-Budget price increase to 15.75p on a gallon of petrol and to 18.9p on a gallon of diesel. On average, a gallon of unleaded petrol or diesel will cost Pounds 2.50, and leaded Pounds 2.75. The Automobile Association, which in the immediate aftermath of the Budget accused the government of regarding the UK's 20m motorists as 'wallets on wheels', said last night: 'This proves what we've always said. Whenever the Treasury is short of a few bob, the chancellor mugs the motorist.' It estimated that the combined increase would add about Pounds 51 to the average private motorist's annual costs. The Royal Automobile Club said that the new rise would particularly hit the elderly, disabled and those living in rural areas. 'Motorists in the shires may well vote with their wheels,' it said. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said it was 'disappointed' but not surprised by the extra increase, and warned that it could put extra upward pressure on inflation. The increases are, however, more likely to cause minor shifts in the structure of the new car market, with increased emphasis on diesel and economy models, than significantly affecting new car demand.</p>

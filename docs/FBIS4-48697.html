			<p>BFN     [Text] The Cease-Fire Commission [CCF] has decided to  continue investigating the alleged training of a battalion of  government troops in Tanzania, following complaints by the  Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] in April. In its  report, Renamo named a witness who is now missing. The  government does not agree with continuing the investigations,  saying that this should take place only if the missing witness  is presented. The commission -- made up of government, Renamo,  and UN members -- worked twice with Renamo's witness in Nampula.  Raul Dique, Renamo's representative in the CCF, said that  (Renuge Paconote), who was living under Renamo protection,  requested to visit his family, with whom he spent the night.  Brigadier Dique says that on the following day, 10 May, the  witness went missing.    Renamo believes that (Renuge Paconote) was detained or  killed  by the government to hinder the investigations of the alleged  training of a military battalion in Tanzania. Renamo says that  the troops would be used should the Mozambique Liberation Front  lose the October elections.    Lieutenant Colonel Ozorio Mateus of the government  delegation  in the CCF believes that the absence of the alleged Renamo  witness hinders the continuation of the investigation of the  Tanzania battalion issue. Ozorio Mateus said that on previous  occasions Renamo alleged violations of the General Peace Accord  by the government, but nothing has been proved on the ground.</p>

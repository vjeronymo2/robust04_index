			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Bond returns may be flattering to deceive SOMETHING unprecedented in the post-war era has been happening over the last few years: bonds have been a better investment not only than cash but even than equities. The question is how long this performance can last. A report* published in July by a British investment advisory boutique brings together the facts and assesses both the process and the prospects. The chart, taken from that paper, shows the value of an assumed investment in the Standard &amp; Poor's composite index, with reinvestment of dividends, since 1957, relative to cash. Over the entire period the lucky investor would have earned 3 1/2 times more in equities than in cash. Not so the hapless investor in bonds. Over the same years the value of a US bond portfolio, with reinvestment, would have fallen by about a quarter, relative to cash. The UK offers a similar picture, although Germany, not surprisingly, is a country where bonds have been a somewhat better investment than cash. Bad things, like good things, do come to an end. The turnaround for US bonds relative to cash came in the early 1980s, thanks to Paul Volker's disinflationary heroics at the Federal Reserve. More remarkably, global returns on bonds have outstripped those on equities since 1987, while returns on bonds have exceeded those in equities in each of the main financial markets since 1990. The advantage of bonds has been very small in the US, where the equity market has been buoyant, but huge in Japan. A Japanese investor who bet on the bond market in 1990 would have made 31 per cent per annum more than in the equity market, on average, since then. In the UK the margin in favour of bonds has been 5 per cent per annum, on average, over the period. Theory suggests that ex ante returns on different assets should be the same, allowing for risk. So equities should be more profitable than bonds and bonds more profitable than cash over any long period. This is not what has tended to happen. Furthermore, if the return on bonds is to be the same as that on cash, allowing for risk, a steep positively sloping yield curve, such as the one now in effect in the US, implies that bond prices are expected to fall and vice versa. If bonds have returned much less or more than cash, these expectations cannot have been fulfilled. Up to the early 1980s bond prices fell more than expected. Since then they have risen more than expected. The main reason for this is that inflation outstripped expectations for a long period. But since the early 1980s the reverse has been the case. The authors of the study argue, however, that the reason for the market's mistakes has not just been unanticipated developments in inflation. The market has also not been processing the information available to it efficiently. In particular, bond prices should be relatively high when short-term interest rates are much below long ones, because bond prices should then be expected to fall, and vice versa. In fact, the yield gap has been a poor predictor of subsequent changes in bond prices. The authors of the report argue that they have been able to identify better predictors, which means that an active trader should be able to earn higher returns than a passive holder of bonds. What now? Whether or not traders can outperform the market, the principal determinant of exceptionally high relative returns on bonds is bound to be unexpectedly low inflation (or unexpectedly low real rates of interest). Since the inflation expectation implied by present bond yields is already around 3 per cent in the US, the chances of further favourable inflation surprises may be relatively low. At the same time a trading rule the report recommends is to hold bonds when the gap between bond yields and short rates has recently risen and hold cash when it has recently fallen. On that basis too, the chances of further high returns may be modest, at least on US bonds.

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Board urges acceptance of Quebecor takeover HunterPrint Group, the debt-burdened printing company, yesterday warned shareholders that failure to back an agreed takeover by Quebecor Printing, North America's second-biggest commercial printer, could force it to appoint receivers. Announcing a 24.4 per cent increase in full year losses, the Corby-based company said it would be unable to guarantee the group's financial future if the CDollars 3m (Pounds 1.4m) acquisition was derailed. Pre-tax losses rose from Pounds 3.16m to Pounds 3.93m in the year to September 25 on turnover down from Pounds 50.8m to Pounds 49.2m. The group, which is Britain's leading independent printer of national newspaper supplements, saw gearing increase from 134 per cent to 183 per cent - equivalent to total debts of Pounds 17m. That meant it was unable to declare a dividend or pay dividends due on its cumulative redeemable preference shares. 'The level of on-demand (banking) facilities available to the current management does not provide sufficient working capital for the group's future trading requirements,' said Mr Jeoff Samson, HunterPrint chairman.</p>

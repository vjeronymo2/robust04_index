			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> T-Bill Rates Fall: Interest rates on 52-week Treasury bills fell at the latest  action to the lowest level since July. The Treasury sold $9.8 billion of new  bills at an average discount rate of 7.35%, down from 7.61% at the last auction  on Sept. 21. The rates were the lowest since July 27, when the one-year bills  sold for 7.22%. The new discount rate understates the actual return to  investors -- 7.90%, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,256.80.  </P></p>

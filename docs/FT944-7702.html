			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / International Bonds: Activity slows in run-up to holidays New issuance activity in the eurobond market slowed yesterday ahead of holidays in Japan and the US today and tomorrow. The short-dated dollar sector, which witnessed a flurry of activity after last week's rise in US short-term interest rates, nevertheless managed to attract three borrowers in the two and three-year area. Bayerische Landesbank launched a Dollars 300m offering of three-year bonds. Traders criticised the launch spread - 15 basis points over US government bonds - as too expensive and described selling as 'slow'. The spread widened to around 19 basis points after the bonds were freed to trade. 'A spread of 20 basis points would have been a fairer price,' said one trader. However, joint lead manager Lehman Brothers said the spread was in line with similar existing bonds trading in the secondary market and that virtually no bonds had been bought back through the brokers. The bonds were launched into Asia in the hope of attracting some interest there, traders said. But they suspected that most would be placed with European retail investors. In the sterling sector, National &amp; Provincial Building Society launched a Pounds 100m offering of bonds due December 1997, priced to yield 45 basis points over UK gilts. Traders cast doubt on the decision to launch a three-year offering. 'This area of the sterling yield curve is only going to retail accounts and National &amp; Provincial is not a retail name,' said one dealer. 'The spread is not going to attract institutional interest,' he said. Challenge Bank launched a Dollars 200m offering of three-year floating rate notes, priced to yield 35 basis points over three-month Libor, which joint lead manager CSFB said found strong European demand. Ireland is planning to tap the euroyen market for around Y30bn within the next few weeks, the Irish National Treasury Management Agency said.</p>

			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Company News (This Week): Swedish banks - Other companies Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and Svenska Handelsbanken will put Sweden's banking crisis further behind them tomorrow when they are expected to show a strong improvement in first-half profits. Sharply reduced loan losses will more than offset a likely drop on the securities side. Top expectations for SE Banken are profits of SKr2.2bn (Dollars 280m) and for Handelsbanken, SKr2.4bn.</p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Redland strong Building materials group Redland was one of the FT-SE 100's best performers, the shares rising 23 to 622p, after stories that the shares were being given a strong push by Cazenove, the company's own stockbroker. Cazenove wields immense influence in the stockmarket but adheres strictly to a long-standing policy of not commenting on its corporate and agency broking activities 'There has been some persistent and sizeable demand for Redland shares,' said one building sector specialist, who added that the share price may well have been pushed ahead by recent market stories that a series of Europe-wide interest rate cuts could be in the pipeline. A quiet day in pharmaceuticals was dominated by a positive trading statement from Zeneca, up 10 to 818p. 'Not a dramatic bit of news' was how one analyst described it, although others were more complimentary; Mr Nigel Barnes at Hoare Govett said Zeneca and Glaxo, flat at 661p, were the only two stocks that were still attractive in terms of yield. 'The rest of the sector has been looking a bit tired,' he said. SmithKline Beecham 'A' shares were up 4 at 436p, little affected by NatWest's Securities issue of 50m warrants. Mr Nick Conington at NatWest said that over the long term, the stock appeared undervalued. 'It's too early to call the stock a buy - we have to wait and see,' he said. Among supermarket groups, Park Food saw improved sales and earnings and the shares climbed 3 to 294p, after touching 303p. The majors were weak on a combination of profit-taking and lingering concerns over the industry's direction in the wake of Tesco's trading statement this week. The company cut its capital expenditure, made provisions for property write-downs and signalled its intention to grow dividends, in the face of continuing margin pressure. How market leader J Sainsbury will respond to the Tesco move is the question being pondered in food retail circles, and it was concern over this that saw the shares come off 11 to 460p. Tesco fell 5 to 243 1/2 p. Food manufacturers were subdued, although Hazlewood declined 5 to 174p on talk of poor Christmas sales. Stores were mixed although Great Universal Stores surged 16 to 629p amid a market rumour of an impending warrant to be issued by a leading securities house. Talk of healthy margins at Marks and Spencer underpinned the shares, up 7 1/2 at 459 1/2 p. WH Smith jumped 16 to 545p ahead of results next week, while MFI Furniture, also reporting, slipped 1 1/2 to 167p. Despite market talk of weak margins over Christmas, brokers close to the company are confident of profits above the average of market forecasts. The range is Pounds 18-25m. Shares in business services group Inchcape, moved sharply ahead after Robert Fleming reiterated its buy recommendation on the stock. The move follows Thursday's recommendation from US investment bank Goldman Sachs and the shares jumped 34 to 589p, on volume of 2.9m. Mr Mike Smith at Fleming said the stock had been left behind due to uncertainty about trading at Gestetner in which it has a 15 per cent stake and nerves about next Thursday's trading update. Gestetner closed 12 ahead at 171p, following favourable comment on its results. European demand continued for British Steel following a Credit Lyonnais recommendation earlier this week. The shares hardened 1 1/2 to 128 1/2 p as turnover soared to 27m.</p>

Robaina also announced that during the first half of April  he  will tour several Latin American nations, thus responding to  invitations from several regional foreign ministries.    During an impromptu news conference following a three-day  tour of Central Cuba with members of the diplomatic corps,  Robaina said last night that the first nations he will visit on  the Asian continent are Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar. He added  that at present certain aspects of his visits to India,  Malaysia, and Indonesia are being arranged.    This tour of Asia is very important to us because of what  these countries represent and because several of their foreign  ministers have paid official visits to Cuba, Robaina said.    Robaina also pointed out that acting on an invitation from  the Spanish Foreign Ministry, he will make a week-long trip to  that country.    Regarding his Latin American tour, Robaina refused to  disclose any details, saying only that he has received  invitations from several foreign ministries. He mentioned the  first half of April as a tentative date for this tour.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Policy changes clear way for new fields Recent changes to Norwegian oil policy have cleared the way for three new North sea field developments for which more than NKr10bn will be invested to boost domestic crude oil production. Saga Petroleum, Norway's largest independent oil company, is seeking approval to develop the NKr5bn (Pounds 470m), 180m-barrel Vigdis oil field and for a NKr4.5bn extended development of the Snorre oil field, for which the company has upgraded recoverable reserves to 1bn barrels from 717m. Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, also plans to develop the tiny (20m-barrel) Yme field in the southern part of North Sea. Because fewer and smaller commercial oil discoveries have been made in Norway in recent years the government is anxious to maintain a high level of exploration activity, which could contribute to extending the duration of peak oil production, expected to drop sharply in the next few years from a current average daily production rate of 2.6m barrels. The policy has been eased in an attempt to stimulate activity off Norway, Europe's biggest oil producer, which faces stiff competition from regions elsewhere in the world for oil company investment, which was set to plunge next year from an average annual NKr30bn. In response the government has scrapped the so-called sliding scale arrangement, which allows the state to increase its direct shareholding in all licences that may contain undiscovered resources and for all discoveries in the Barents Sea. The top level of the sliding scale arrangement allows a direct state interest of up to 75 per cent in fields and implies that the oil companies have to cover a larger share of exploration costs than is indicated by their shareholdings. The policy changes also call for the state to relinquish rights to participate in fields with less that 50m tonnes of oil equivalent assumed discovered reserves. The state will also consider reduction or disposal of its shareholdings in small fields and for the 15th licensing round may decide not to participate in new licences which are due to be awarded next year.</p>

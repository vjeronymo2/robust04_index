			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2ND AMERICAN TO BE FREED, BEIRUT MESSAGES DECLARE  </P> <P> An American educator held hostage in Beirut, Frank H. Reed, will be freed  within 48 hours, according to statements delivered to news offices in the  Lebanese capital Sunday evening.  </P> <P> The statements were accompanied by photos of Reed, a native of Malden, Mass.,  the first hard evidence of him since his kidnaping on Sept. 9, 1986.  </P> <P> The pledge to free the 57-year-old school official came one week after  pro-Iranian kidnapers in Beirut released Robert Polhill, a college professor  who had been held captive for 39 months. Polhill, 55, was the first American  hostage to be released in 3 1/2 years.  </P> <P> An initial communique on Reed, delivered to an international news agency and  the Lebanese newspaper An Nahar, was unsigned. But a second message, dropped at  the newspaper three hours later, identified the kidnapers under the name  Islamic Dawn, which has never before surfaced in the long-running hostage  crisis.  </P> <P> But an article in today's Tehran Times appeared to place Reed's abductors among  the 100 or more pro-Iranian extremists whom Western intelligence services hold  responsible for the majority of the Beirut kidnapings.  </P> <P> As monitored by Associated Press in Nicosia, the article quoted an unidentified  Iranian official as saying that "extensive talks" took place after the release  of Polhill, apparently between Iranian authorities and the kidnapers.  </P> <P> "We asked them to release a second hostage unconditionally and on humanitarian  and Islamic grounds to once again display their goodwill," the official told  the Tehran Times.  </P> <P> "We do believe that with the fulfillment of this promise, the Lebanese Muslim  groups have displayed maximum goodwill. The ball is now in the other party's  court to reciprocate," the article said, in an apparent reference to the United  States or other Western nations whose citizens have been held hostage in  Beirut.  </P> <P> In the United States, President Bush was asked about the report while playing  golf at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington. He told journalists: "I just  won't say anything. If that proves to be true, that's wonderful."  </P> <P> A State Department spokesman said: "We remain hopeful; we hope this report is  true, and we continue to urge the release of all the hostages." But he said  Washington has had no contact with the kidnapers.  </P> <P> Earlier Sunday, Sen. David L. Boren (D-Okla.), chairman of the Senate  Intelligence Committee, said he is "very optimistic that we're going to see  more hostages released."  </P> <P> Interviewed on NBC's "Meet the Press," Boren said his optimism stems in part  from the fact that both Iran and Syria, which are believed to have influence on  the kidnapers, are experiencing economic problems and need stronger ties with  the West.  </P> <P> After Polhill's release April 22, statements by Lebanese militants and Arab  press reports speculated that a second American hostage would soon be freed,  but by the middle of last week, remarks from the same sources left the momentum  of the breakthrough on the hostages in doubt.  </P> <P> Typewritten in Arabic, Sunday's initial statement on Reed said:  </P> <P> "In the name of God the merciful, the compassionate, we have decided to free  American hostage Frank Reed within 48 hours. He will carry a message addressed  to the American Administration."  </P> <P> No conditions were set, and there was no further information immediately  available in Beirut.  </P> <P> According to press reports from the Lebanese capital, each of the copies was  accompanied by a different photo of Reed, who was director of the Lebanese  International School when he was abducted from his chauffeured car on the way  to a golf club near the Beirut airport.  </P> <P> One photo, in color, showed him in a blue-and-white striped shirt and clean  shaven. The other, in black and white, depicted a bearded face.  </P> <P> While the accompanying statement was not signed, the last previous  communication on Reed -- until Sunday there had been none since Sept. 14, 1986  -- said he was a captive of the Arab Revolutionary Cells-Omar Mukhtar Brigade.  </P> <P> The Arab Revolutionary Cells is one of many cover names for the terrorist  organization run by Abu Nidal, a Palestinian believed to be operating out of  Libya.  </P> <P> After news reports about the statement were broadcast, mentioning the Omar  Mukhtar Brigade, a subsequent message was sent to An Nahar, with a third photo  of Reed. That message read:  </P> <P> "We assert that the (first) statement we issued did not carry the signature of  the Organization of Arab Revolutionary Cells-Omar Mukhtar Brigade. News  agencies . . . should seek accuracy in news reporting. Otherwise they will be  exposed to our persecution and stern punishment.  </P> <P> "We also stress our previous statement that we shall release American hostage  Frank Reed with a message for the U.S. Administration. We hope the media will  carry our statement fully without tampering."  </P> <P> At the time of Reed's kidnaping, the initial claim of responsibility came from  a telephone caller saying he represented Islamic Jihad, a pro-Iranian faction  of Lebanese Shiite Muslims. Islamic Jihad issued a statement disavowing any  part in the kidnaping, and the subsequent claim was made in the name of the  Omar Mukhtar Brigade, the mystery group whose only professed hostage is Reed.  </P> <P> The release of Polhill, five days after his kidnapers said he would be freed  within 48 hours, signaled a break in the agonizing ordeal of the foreign  hostages. The Bush Administration, while declaring it had made no deal for the  release of the professor and would not negotiate with kidnapers for the freedom  of others, applauded the Syrian government for its role.  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III also said, "We thank Iran for these  efforts, noting the Iranians have a responsibility to help secure the release  of other hostages in Lebanon."  </P> <P> The initial signs of movement on the deadlocked hostage crisis appeared earlier  this year in the Tehran Times, a newspaper aligned with President Hashemi  Rafsanjani, whose centrist administration supports improved relations with  Western powers.  </P> <P> Polhill was held by a group calling itself Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of  Palestine, and he told an American debriefing team in Wiesbaden, West Germany,  that the only hostages he saw during his captivity were Jesse Turner and Alann  Steen, fellow professors from Beirut University College who were abducted with  him.  </P> <P> American counterintelligence officials say they believe that all the Beirut  kidnap groups, which now hold seven Americans and several other Westerners, are  closely related and may simply use different cover names.  </P></p>

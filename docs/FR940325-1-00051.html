			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 directs the Secretary to establish advisory councils of not less than 10 and not more than 15 members appointed from among persons who are representative of the various major citizens' interests concerning the problems relating to land use planning or the management of the public lands located within the area for which an advisory council is established. To comply with this direction and to improve on current practices for obtaining advice on the management of public lands and resources, the Department has adopted the suggestions, with appropriate modifications, provided in the Colorado model for purposes of its proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule would establish multiple resource advisory councils. These councils would be subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. Appendix; FACA). The multiple resource advisory councils would focus on the full array of ecosystem and multiple use issues associated with BLM-administered public lands. However, the multiple resource advisory councils would not provide advice on internal BLM management concerns such as personnel or budget expenditures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A multiple resource advisory council would typically be established for each BLM administrative district, but under this proposed rule the area of jurisdiction could be modified to permit ecosystem-based management and planning. The Department intends that BLM State Directors would be encouraged to consider whether the formation of multiple resource advisory councils along ecoregion boundaries would be a more effective organization for obtaining advice on the management of public lands within their areas of responsibility. A governor or multiple resource advisory council could petition the Secretary to authorize these councils at a BLM resource area level. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The multiple resource advisory councils would advise the Secretary of the Interior and Bureau of Land Management on matters relating to ecosystem and multiple use issues associated with public lands and resources under the administrative jurisdiction of the BLM. Multiple resource advisory councils would provide advice on preparation, amendment, and implementation of land use management plans and activity plans, and would be consulted in the planning for range development and improvement programs and the preparation of standards and guidelines for grazing administration. The multiple resource advisory councils would not be involved in matters such as personnel decisions, or the allocation of budget except to the extent of providing advice on the establishment of long-term plans and resource management priorities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Multiple resource advisory council members would be appointed by the Secretary or other Federal official designated by the Secretary. Governors of States in which the councils would be organized would be requested to provide a list of nominees for the Secretary's consideration. The Secretary would encourage Governors to formulate nominations through a process open to the public, and would consider whether such a process was undertaken in evaluating the nominations. In addition, a public call for nominations would be made through a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as is provided in the existing 43 CFR 1784.4&hyph;1. Persons could nominate themselves for membership. Nominations would be required to be accompanied by letters of recommendation from local interests that the nominee would be representing. The Department invites public comment on whether such letters should be required to come from individuals within the area to be served by the multiple resource advisory council. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Membership of the multiple resource advisory council would reflect a balance of views to ensure that the council represents the full array of issues and interests associated with public land use, management, protection and an understanding of the Federal laws and regulations governing public lands. Individuals would qualify to serve on a multiple resource advisory council because they have a commitment to collaborative effort, possess relevant experience or expertise, and have a commitment to the successful resolution of resource management issues and to applying the relevant law. An individual may serve on only one multiple resource advisory council. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each of the multiple resource advisory councils would have 15 members, selected by the Secretary, with criteria for membership clearly outlined. One third of the members of each multiple resource advisory council would be selected from persons representing commodity industries, developed recreational activities, or use of public lands by off-highway vehicles; one third would be selected from representatives of nationally or regionally recognized environmental or resource conservation groups and wild horse and burro interest groups, from representatives of archaeological and historical interests, and from representatives of dispersed recreational activities; and one third would be selected from persons who hold State, county, or local elected office, and representatives of the public-at-large, Indian tribes within or adjacent to the area, natural resource or natural science academia, and State agencies responsible for the management of fish and wildlife, water quality, water rights, and State lands. At least one member of each multiple resource advisory council would be required to be an elected official in the area covered by the council, in accordance with the requirements of section 309 of FLPMA. The proposed rule would require the Secretary or designee to provide for balanced and broad representation from within each of the three categories in appointing members of a multiple resource advisory council. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

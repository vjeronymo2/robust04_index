			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The interim chairman of the Burundi Democratic  Front [FRODEBU] ruling party, Mr. Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, and  who is also chairman of the National Assembly, held a press  conference yesterday. Mr. Ntibantunganya first presented the  FRODEBU's candidate to the presidency of the republic.  FRODEBU's candidate is Mr. Cyprien Ntaryamira, current Burundi  minister of agriculture. He is an old companion of late  President Melchior Ndadaye.    According to an amendment to the constitution, which the  National Assembly has analyzed upon request by the government,  which in its turn has to ratify it, the unique candidate would  be presented to the parliament to be elected. Today the  National Assembly was due to elect him, but the proceedings  could not take place because the government has not yet ratified  the amendment. [passage omitted] In fact, Article 182 of the  same constitution says that no amendment of the constitution can  be undertaken when the nation is facing serious internal  troubles.    The opposition parties yesterday held a press conference to  denounce this. They have even presented candidates to the  presidential election stated by the law when the head of the  state and the chairman of the National Assembly can no longer do  their job. Two candidates already known are Dr. Jean Ndeberi  from the Abasa [Burundi-African Alliance for Salvation] party  and Mr. Joseph Nzeyimana from the RADDES [Rally for Democracy  and Economic and Social Development] party.</p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Buoyant Sandvik sees market growth in 1994 Sandvik, the Swedish speciality steel and carbide group, yesterday reported a 30 per cent increase in profits for 1993, saying a four-year decline in demand for industrial products was over. 'There are now clear signs that the world market will expand during 1994,' it said. Mr Per-Olof Eriksson, group chief executive for more than 10 years, would be retiring in May, it said. He would be succeeded by Mr Clas Ake Hedstrom, head of Sandvik Tooling. With market conditions again weak last year, the company relied on the fall in the krona and restructuring to lift profits to SKr1.98bn (Dollars 253m) from SKr1.52bn. The improvement was achieved in spite of a sharp drop in financial income, partly because of lower interest rates. Sales rose 26 per cent to SKr21.8bn in 1993, in spite of lower volumes in all business areas except steel. Excluding currency factors and structural changes, sales were down 5 per cent, largely because of depressed demand in Europe, which accounts for 55 per cent of sales. Orders rose 28 per cent to SKr22.1bn, but only process systems showed a clear increase in volume terms. Star performer last year was the steel division, which lifted profits to SKr461m from SKr159m. The group's biggest division, cemented carbide, lifted profits to SKr1.28bn from SKr879m, helped by currency factors. The saws and tools division was weakened by the performance of a German unit, Sandvik Belzer, but losses were cut to SKr3m from SKr82m. The dividend is being increased to SKr2.25 per share from SKr1.90. Earnings per share rose to SKr4.90 from SKr4.20. The group expects both sales and profits to rise this year.</p>

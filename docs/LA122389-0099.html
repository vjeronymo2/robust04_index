			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> LATE GOAL GIVES CANADIENS A 2-2 TIE WITH THE SABRES  </P> <P> In recent years the Buffalo Sabres have looked great on paper, but not too  sharp on the ice.  </P> <P> However, under first-year Coach Rick Dudley, they are beginning to look good on  the ice, too.  </P> <P> Although they haven't played in many important games for sometime, they  responded willingly in a showdown with Montreal Friday night at Buffalo.  </P> <P> But they allowed Shayne Corson to get free and he scored with just two seconds  left in regulation to get the Canadiens a 2-2 tie.  </P> <P> The Canadiens had pulled goaltender Brian Hayward for an extra attacker when  the Sabres iced the puck with five seconds remaining. The puck just missed  going into the open net.  </P> <P> The Canadiens won the ensuing faceoff and defenseman Chris Chelios found Corson  open near the side of the net. Corson scored his 14th goal.  </P> <P> The Sabres, with Pierre Turgeon scoring his 18th goal, then setting up Rick  Vaive for his 14th, dominated the early play.  </P> <P> With a 22-9-5 record, the Sabres are nearing the midway point of the season  with a four-point lead in the Adams Division over the Canadiens. Buffalo has  the best record in the NHL.  </P> <P> "We just wanted to leave the message that we're still around," Canadien Coach  Pat Burns said. "The Sabres are the hot team."  </P> <P> New Jersey 5, Philadelphia 4 -- Kirk Muller scored at 1:18 of overtime at  Philadelphia to lift the surprising Devils.  </P> <P> The Devils, now 2-0-1 this season at the Spectrum, moved within one point of  the first-place Flyers and New York Rangers in the Patrick Division.  </P> <P> The loss was the third straight for the Flyers, who dropped to 16-16-4 in their  last home game until Jan. 11. They begin a seven-game road trip tonight in  Montreal. New Jersey also got back to the .500 mark with a 16-16-3 record.  </P> <P> "A win like this can give us a big lift," Coach John Cunniff said. "It would be  a nice Christmas present if we could win tomorrow night and move into first  place."  </P> <P> Toronto 5, Chicago 3 -- Tom Fergus and Ed Olczyk scored 18 seconds apart in the  third period at Chicago.  </P> <P> The Maple Leafs had just killed off a four-minute power-play when Fergus took a  pass from Daniel Marois, when around Dave Manson and beat Jacques Cloutier with  a 20-foot wrist shot at 5:34.  </P> <P> Olczyk, a former Blackhawk, then beat Cloutier from the left circle for a 4-2  lead. The loss ended Cloutier's eight-game winning streak at Chicago Stadium.  DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

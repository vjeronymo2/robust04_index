			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Travel: Busy doing nothing . . . ONE SHOULD not, as a rule, write articles about paradise hideaways, reports Alan Friedman from New York. Write about such a place and before long it will be no more, or will have lost the anonymity that made it so attractive in the first place. Never mind. One's sense of duty to Weekend FT readers calls for full disclosure of an unusual Caribbean retreat. The Sandcastle, as its Chicago-born proprietor, Darryl Sanderson, is quick to note, is not for everyone. It is a tiny hotel located on the pristine White Bay beach of Jost Van Dyke, a four-mile-long island that is part of the British Virgin Islands (BVI) and can be reached only by private yacht or by taking the 20-minute ferry ride from Tortola, the capital of the BVI. Arrival at Jost Van Dyke requires one to clamber into an inflatable dinghy that covers the 30-ft distance to shore, where, trousers rolled high, one leaps into the shallow water and ambles up the beach. From then on, formal attire ranges from swimwear to shorts and T-shirts. Shoes are optional. Sandcastle consists of four octangular wooden cottages, each with double-bed, an assortment of bad novels and a bathroom, set amid the hibiscus and palm trees that grow along a half-mile stretch of white coral beach. With only four cottages and a staff of five, the service is not bad. Nor is the food, which includes fresh flying fish, grouper and other local fare plus a wine list that is quite respectable. The cottages, which cost Dollars 295 (Pounds 168.50) a night for two, three meals a day included, do not have electricity. Instead, one learns to work propane burners and to make use of the sort of lavatory normally found on a boat. The principal activity at Sandcastle is - nothing. There are windsurfing boards and snorkeling gear available, and scuba diving or day-sailing can be arranged. But the best parts of this hideaway are the large hammocks strung between palm trees on the beach, and the Soggy Dollar Bar, a little beach area that is patronised by visiting yachtsmen who sail into the bay and drop anchor. The Soggy Dollar is a significant feature of Sandcastle, mainly because it claims to be the birthplace of The Painkiller, a concoction of Pusser's Rum, orange and pineapple juices, coconut cream and a smattering of grated nutmeg. It is advisable to wait at least an hour after breakfast before ordering your first Painkiller of the day. As the 85`F winter weather and a gentle breeze persist throughout the day, Painkillers tend to distract you from all manner of intended serious reading. Sandcastle is comfortable enough, but not recommended unless you are prepared for splendid isolation. If you want the ultimate in luxury, better investigate Richard Branson's Necker Island, a more expensive neighbouring member of the BVI chain. If you simply wish to get far away from newspapers filled with endless reports of BCCI, Boris Yeltsin and Robert Maxwell, try Sandcastle. It would be best, however, to visit it within the next 12-18 months. Darryl Sanderson says electricity may soon be installed, plus roads and telephones and all of that. Sandcastle has only one portable cellular phone, for emergencies. If you want information, leave a message with Darryl Sanderson's answering service on 0101-809-775-5262.</p>

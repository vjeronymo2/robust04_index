			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Bonds that bind a hemisphere: Latin America and the US are agreed on the importance of regional trade Former US President Jimmy Carter once said he understood why Latin Americans mistrusted the United States. 'The Mexican people know what Yankee imperialism means, and being from Georgia, I have also heard the same phrase used.' For nearly 50 years, Latin America was the backyard where Washington fought an often dirty war against the perceived Soviet threat. But tomorrow night, when President Bill Clinton, another southern Democrat, greets 33 heads of state and government gathering for the Summit of the Americas in Miami, he will deliver a message that US policy towards its neighbours in the hemisphere has changed. Things have certainly changed in Latin America itself. Over the past decade, a quiet revolution has sent military rulers back to the barracks and jettisoned an exhausted protectionist economic model. Latin economies are now more open to foreign trade and market forces than they have been since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The difficulty Mr Clinton faces is that, since he secured passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico through the US Congress late last year, the western hemisphere has appeared on his policy screen only twice. Both episodes - the US military intervention in Haiti and the Cuban refugee crisis - suggest that US attitudes to Latin America have not changed much. Unless Latin America manifests itself as a domestic US policy problem - related, for example, to immigration or drug trafficking - it seems Washington will not pay much attention. This impression has been reinforced by US officials' vigorous downplaying of what it might be possible to achieve at this week's summit, called by the US following Nafta's ratification. So successful have these efforts been that some Latin American leaders have wondered whether it will be worth the trip. All the more so after Mr Clinton was forced to put off until next year 'fast track' negotiating authority for talks on the expansion of Nafta from the US Congress. But the prospects for the Miami summit have been looking up lately - despite the blow dealt to the host by the Democrats' defeat in last month's mid-term Congressional elections. Latin American governments want to talk trade and, since he secured passage for the Uruguay Round world trade agreement last week in Congress, Mr Clinton has indicated he wants to talk trade too. 'There will be hemispheric concurrence that economic integration is a vital goal for this hemisphere, that there will be a call for the construction of the Americas Free Trade Area, or Afta, and that the process of integration should begin immediately,' said Ms Charlene Barshefsky, the deputy US trade representative. Mr Clinton and the leaders of Canada and Mexico are also expected to announce their intention to start negotiations soon on Chile's accession to Nafta. The opportunity for winning US congressional approval for bringing Chile into Nafta is narrow, ahead of the 1996 US presidential election campaign. 'To try to strike a deal in the middle of an election is impossible. We have a year and a half now,' said Mr John Biehl del Rio, Chile's ambassador to Washington. Nafta's extension to Chile is of little economic consequence to the US - Chile's economy is less than 1 per cent of the size of that of the US, and most of its exports to North America are already subject to low tariffs. It is, however, of symbolic importance. It would give impetus to the idea that Nafta could be the basis of hemispheric economic integration. 'It's like a bicycle; if we stop pedalling, everyone will fall off,' said one official involved in the participants' pre-summit deliberations. Brazil is one reason why the US cannot take it for granted that the whole region will queue up to sign up to Nafta. Now emerging from years in the economic doldrums, the largest economy in Latin America sees itself as the centre of a South American Free Trade Area - Safta. The core of this will be Mercosur, which from the start of 1995 will become a customs union tying Brazil with Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. Brazil's official attitude is that there is no antagonism between Safta and Nafta. But underlying this is a barely hidden suspicion of US motives in the region. Mr Rubens Barbosa, the Brazilian ambassador to London, argued that joining Nafta would mean South American countries 'would lose their capacity for adopting autonomous policies in sensitive areas such as investment, services and intellectual property'. Complicating matters, the European Union last month tossed a joker into the Miami deliberations, saying it would negotiate a free trade zone with the Mercosur countries, and indicating it would not stand by and watch its trading relationship with the southern cone countries eroded by the US. One official at the pre-summit talks said this announcement galvanised proceedings, making the North Americans more determined to push Nafta forward. If this were not complicated enough, Nafta and Mercosur are not the only trade agreements being forged in the region. The Andean Pact of Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia enter into a customs union of their own on January 1. The Central American Common Market, the Caribbean Economic Community and a plethora of other bilateral agreements and sub-regional free trade accords have also been put in place. For the first time Latin companies are seeking new markets regionally, boosting intra-regional trade to 21 per cent of regional exports in 1993, from 13 per cent in 1988. Mr Pedro Vallenilla, president of Venepal, Venezuela's largest pulp and paper company, said: 'We don't consider Colombia, where we have 10 per cent of our sales, as an export market.' While this represents a profound change, many trade experts are worried that a patchwork of accords could hinder free trade rather than help it. Mr Sidney Weintraub of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies decribes further proliferation of bilateral and sub-regional agreements in the western hemisphere as 'a hypothetical horror scenario'. With this in mind, the Miami summit will aim to freeze protectionism in the hemisphere, ensuring no increase in tariff or non-tariff barriers. Ms Barshefsky said the Organisation of American States would begin an immediate analysis of the compatibility of existing trade pacts in the region. A target date, perhaps 2015, is also being discussed for hemispheric free trade. The hope in Washington is that this would fix Latin America's political and economic revolution, the durability of which cannot be taken for granted. Political reforms remain vulnerable, because the military still plays an important role in many states, particularly in central America. And drug traffickers are still undermining and corrupting many governments. Doubt also still hangs over economic development, as growth has so far delivered little to the poor, whose lot worsened in the 1980s, with wealth in Latin America still more concentrated than in any other region. Also of concern are Mexico's and Argentina's large current account deficits, which underline their dependence on fickle foreign capital markets. Fears of another financial crisis in the region have not vanished. Another area of uncertainty is the ability of regional governments to oversee market economies. A recent paper by Mr Moises Naim, the former Venezuelan industry minister now at the Carnegie Endowment, the Washington think-tank, argues: 'Governments in Latin America are not up to the tasks of sustaining and deepening economic reforms, overseeing newly liberalised private sectors, dealing with the problems of poverty and inequality, or consolidating democratic politics.' Trade, however, remains the top priority for the Latin American participants in the Miami meeting. As Mr Kim Holmes, head of the foreign policy studies at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington think-tank, said: 'President Clinton needs to tell his Latin American colleagues that he will go to the mat for 'fast track'. Trade is the only issue in this hemisphere that the Latin Americans and the US can come together on across the board.'  -------------------------------------------------------------                LATIN AMERICA: OPEN FOR TRADE  ------------------------------------------------------------- Exports by destination (Dollars bn)  -------------------------------------------------------------                  North             European        Intra Latin         World   America     US      Union    Asia    America  ------------------------------------------------------------- 1993    159.2     77.2     72.3      25.5     14.1     33.2 1988    122.0     54.5     51.0      23.7     12.2     16.4  ------------------------------------------------------------- Imports by origin (Dollars bn)  -------------------------------------------------------------                  North             European        Intra Latin         World   America     US      Union    Asia    America  ------------------------------------------------------------- 1993    183.1     81.0     78.2      34.2     24.7     33.2 1988    113.8     46.5      na     19.7     11.9     16.4  ------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Gatt  -------------------------------------------------------------</p>

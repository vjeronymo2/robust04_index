			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Pilkington hopes for a clear recovery: The fitness regime of UK glassmaker THE flow of news from Pilkington has been almost unremittingly bad since the markets it supplies went into recession in 1990. For four years profits have fallen, and last week the dividend was cut for only the second time in the glassmaker's stock market history. But Pilkington, the world's leading glass producer, is not alone in its troubles. Mr Luc Willame, chief executive of Glaverbel, the Belgian glass group controlled by Asahi Glass of Japan, said last month that prospects for 1993 'are frankly bad' as he predicted first-half losses. Even so, the stock market has scented recovery at Pilkington. Its share price has almost doubled from a low of 70p last October to close at 128p yesterday. While last week's news of another profit fall and dividend cut dampened the price, some feel the turning point has come. One analyst said: 'It's all so awful, it can only improve.' But can Pilkington make the most of the upturn, having been handicapped in the downturn, many would argue, by excess fat, over-investment and unhappy diversification? Pilkington suffers the fate of any large, continuous process industry with a product that is traded internationally. Plant built at huge cost must run as near full capacity as possible. In the upswing of the business cycle volumes rise, capacity is filled, prices increase sharply and operators are tempted to build new plants. Then in the downswing, that new capacity comes on stream just as volumes weaken and a fight for market share leads to sharp price reductions. Pilkington has seen it all before. In the early 1980s it made losses in the UK as the European glass market fell into disarray, amid overcapacity created by newcomers from the US and Japan and a vicious price war. The market recovered and by the second half of the 1980s prices shot up. The industry responded by expanding, capacity rose again and prices are back to their 1982 level. Mr Roger Leverton, Pilkington's chief executive since last July, says: 'A significant part of the reduction in profits from over Pounds 300m is market driven. Given the overcapacity and price erosion, it's amazing we made a profit at all.' Pilkington would have fared better had it not spent Pounds 1bn on four new float glass lines between 1987 and 1992, and Pounds 361m on diversifying into the US contact lens market in 1987 - a deal done in the wake of BTR's failed Pounds 1.2bn bid. Shareholders who turned down BTR's bid, launched late in 1986 and equivalent to 180.6p a share, have seen the price fall from more than 350p before the October 1987 crash, and suffered a 60 per cent cut in the dividend over the last two years. Mr Leverton agrees that, in hindsight, the timing of its big investments was not propitious. They have yet to make anything like a proper return. Without them profits would be higher today, if only because the interest charge, a crippling Pounds 75.7m in 1992-93, would be lower. But the core business was not fighting fit on the way into the downturn. Costs were too high and working capital control lax. Those problems have been tackled, staff numbers cut, productivity increased and working capital squeezed. Mr Leverton says: 'When I arrived I did an exercise comparing Pilkington to the competition. Pilkington was fairly comparable at the prime margin level (after raw materials and labour, but before overheads) but it was clear there were too many overheads. We had to drive costs out.' After a year's work, he says: 'I believe that today we are more comparable to PPG Industries and St Gobain (leading US and French glassmakers) on overheads.' Pilkington might now look forward to economic recovery. The US market is beginning to pick up and the UK is seeing some revival with an 8 per cent price increase imposed in February. But mainland Europe is the black spot. Glass consumption and prices in Germany, Pilkington's biggest market, are falling fast. Pilkington's main customer there is the housing industry, still buoyed by German reunification, and it had hoped to avoid the worst of recession. That turned out to be another misjudgment. A reduction in the automotive sector's glass purchases this year is hitting hard. Price falls are spreading through continental Europe and could even reverse the better outlook in the UK. Of the hoped-for recovery, Mr Leverton says, 'a certain amount depends on the market, but a lot of things are in our hands'. There is one happy legacy of the late 1980s splurge of investment. 'Because of that high level of investment, we must have the most modern plants in the industry. We have the opportunity to be the lowest cost producer.' While continuing the drive to cut costs, Pilkington is also going on the offensive. In April it completed the Pounds 95m purchase of Heywood Williams glass distribution business, aiming to protect and expand its UK market share. Mr Leverton also means to tackle the balance sheet, aiming to cut gearing from near 90 per cent to 40 per cent. The sale of the Sola spectacle lens business is expected fairly soon, which might raise Pounds 200m. Other disposals are planned. While Pilkington has promised there will be no rights issue, speculation is that it could sell new shares to Nippon Sheet Glass, the Japanese group which owns 20 per cent of Libbey-Owens-Ford, Pilkington's North American subsidiary. Stockbrokers are forecasting profits recovering on a more gradual gradient than they fell. The hope is that Pilkington will cover its dividend again by 1995 - helped by a low tax charge once UK profits revive - and perhaps reach Pounds 200m pre-tax by 1996. Some think, though, that the Pounds 325m peak will never be regained. 'You will never get a combination of glass prices and volumes as crazy as that again,' says one broker.</p>

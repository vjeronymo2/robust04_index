			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Lofs shows improvement to Dollars 1.16m for first quarter LONDON &amp; Overseas Freighters, the Bermuda-based shipping group whose ultimate holding company is Iroquois Shipping Corporation of Liberia, reported pre-tax profits of Dollars 1.16m (Pounds 780,000) for the three months ended June 30 1993. The result marked an improvement on the Dollars 1m for the six months to September 30 and reflected increased freight rates on the London Spirit and London Victory. In the six-month period the London Spirit was being overhauled and was unavailable for hire. Operating costs were reduced following the acquisition of the London Enterprise. Directors said that on July 15 the newly built tanker, London Pride, was delivered and began trading under the five-year charter to Chevron. The benefits would show through in future results, they said, but would be tempered by the loans to finance her. Freight and hire revenue totalled Dollars 4.36m (Dollars 5.8m for six months). Earnings per share came through at 3.3p (4.4p) basic and 3.1p (4p) fully diluted. Pre-tax profits for the year to March 1993 were Dollars 1.86m.</p>

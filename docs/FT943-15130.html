			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Emerging Markets: Dollar's fate linked to G7 statement - Currency Markets If the general axiom that markets only respond to unexpected events holds true, foreign exchange traders will have a quiet morning today, reading a widely predicted G7 statement, devoid of any programme of dollar support. A stream of statements from senior G7 figures last week successfully doused expectations of anything more than the familiar blandishments against currency volatility emerging from the summit. Most analysts believe the market will respond by selling the dollar, though G7 leaders have probably been successful in en-suring that its decline is gradual, rather than precipitous. But this is not a unanimous view. SBC, for example, in its latest currency weekly, argues that the dollar may be the beneficiary of a short-term, G7 inspired bounce. Although standing by its long term bear view on the currency, SBC said a 'G7 deal on FX should not be dismissed'. Of similar mind is UBS which argues that 'the currency market's willingness to sell the dollar is unlikely to go uncorrected. We expect the central banks to undertake concerted and sustained intervention to prevent dollar weakness causing further volatility on bond and equity markets.' After last week's crowded agenda of policy meetings, market attention will this week revert to statistical releases. PPI, CPI and Retail sales figures will be released, and these should give the Fed a better picture of the US economy. Given the strong non-farm payroll figures released last Friday, some analysts are now arguing that the likelihood is of a 50 basis point rise in the federal funds rate, rather than 25 basis points. The key data release will probably be the retail sales figure on Thursday, which will shed light on the state of demand in the economy. Some analysts expect the Fed to move as early as this week. Others believe it will wait until its next meeting on August 16. Whether higher rates will help the dollar is a moot point. Four rate increases this year have done little for its fortunes, nor falling rates in Germany, but when rates in the two countries cross, probably towards the end of the third quarter, this may herald a turn in sentiment. Market attention will also focus on the currencies which have borne the brunt of dollar weakness (or D-Mark strength) such as sterling, the Italian lira, Belgian franc and Swedish krona. Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italian prime minister, has promised this week to announce details of a budget deficit reduction package.</p>

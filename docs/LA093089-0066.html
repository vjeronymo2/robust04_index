			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> JURY TOOK ZSA ZSA WITH 'GRAIN OF SALT';  </P> <P> GABOR FOUND GUILTY OF SLAPPING POLICE OFFICER  </P> <P> Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor was convicted Friday of slapping a motorcycle officer,  driving without a valid driver's license and having an open container of  alcohol in her $215,000 Rolls-Royce convertible when she was stopped while  driving in Beverly Hills on June 14.  </P> <P> The fiery former Miss Hungary, whose outspoken comments outside of court led to  a $500 fine for contempt of court, was found not guilty of disobeying Officer  Paul Kramer when she drove away from him after a traffic stop.  </P> <P> Jurors deliberated more than 10 hours over three days in reaching their  verdicts after a 15-day trial.  </P> <P> "I'd have been surprised if I wasn't found guilty," Gabor told reporters on the  courthouse steps. "I have expected it all along."  </P> <P> "I can't believe that in a country as great as ours that a 6-foot-4 policeman  can beat up a lady of 5-foot-4 and use dirty language as if she was a  streetwalker. I think Russia can't be worse or Communist Hungary, either. I  think it's ridiculous."  </P> <P> As for going to jail, she said, "That would be wonderful. I'd have time to  write my book."  </P> <P> "If I go to jail, Bistro Gardens (a restaurant) said they would serve me food  three times a day."  </P> <P> Municipal Judge Charles Rubin set sentencing for Oct. 17. Gabor faces a maximum  penalty of 18 months in jail and a $3,500 fine.  </P> <P> Jury foreman John Burke, 35, an accountant from Los Angeles, said he felt the  panel made the right decision.  </P> <P> "She got a message from us about how we feel about her driving about town  committing battery on a police officer," Burke said. "I feel good about our  decision. I'm glad that it's over."  </P> <P> Burke said the jurors decided to acquit the blonde actress on a charge of  driving away from Kramer because they believed she could have misinterpreted an  obscene comment he allegedly made to her.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Contradictory Testimony  </P> <P> Juror Kathy Hudson, 30, a bank teller who lives in Los Angeles, noted that  testimony presented during the trial was contradictory.  </P> <P> "Everybody (the jury) basically took everything with a grain a salt," said  Hudson, referring to Gabor's testimony. "There were an awful lot of  contradictions. She would say one thing and later something completely  contradictory."  </P> <P> Gabor was wearing an orange-and-black print dress and a diamond brooch when she  arrived at the courthouse shortly before 3 p.m. in her Rolls-Royce.  </P> <P> "Of course, I'm nervous, Jesus," she told a crush of TV cameras and reporters.  </P> <P> Inside the courtroom, she seemed excited and chatted with about 70 spectators,  likening the scene to "opening night on Broadway."  </P> <P> As the court clerk read the first guilty verdict, she sighed, "Ahhh."  </P> <P> Gabor's lawyer, William Graysen, said his client will decide whether to appeal  after she is sentenced.  </P> <P> Prosecutor Elden Fox commented that the judge had been "clearly deferential" to  Gabor during the trial.  </P> <P> "He was allowing her to walk in and out of the courtroom," Fox said. "If she  wanted to have a break, an aspirin, if she wanted a rest, these were allowed."  </P> <P> Fox said he offered Gabor a plea bargain before the trial, but she rejected it  through her attorney. The deal would have permitted the actress to plead guilty  to one count of disturbing the peace on condition that she publicly apologize  to the police.  </P> <P> The charges against Gabor grew out of an confrontation with Kramer after the  motorcycle officer stopped the actress for driving her car with expired  registration tags. While Kramer was checking for other violations, Gabor drove  off.  </P> <P> When Kramer pulled her over the second time, Gabor slapped the officer. She  claimed that she had acted in self-defense when Kramer pulled her out of her  car roughly. Kramer insisted that the slap was unprovoked.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gag Order Ignored  </P> <P> Rubin imposed a gag on comments by Gabor, her attorney and the prosecutor  during the trial, but Gabor repeatedly ignored the order, declaring that  prosecution witnesses were lying.  </P> <P> After the jury was dismissed, the judge fined Gabor $500 for one count of  contempt of court and dismissed a second contempt charge.  </P></p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Survey on Taiwan (11): Poor planning slows progress - The quality of life has fallen because of an overloaded infrastructure TAIWAN may be well be on the way to developed nation status in terms of per capita GNP, but a lack of government attention to the overburdened infrastructure has meant the quality of life on the island has deteriorated. Years of rapid economic growth with poor environmental controls and economic planning have left Taiwan with heavy pollution levels in soil, air and water, an unreliable power supply and an overloaded road and rail network. The six-year development plan, which runs until 1996 and has a total budget of TDollars 8,200bn, is an attempt to bring together more than 770 badly needed projects. The areas of most urgent need are transport, communications, utilities and environmental protection, which receive 49 per cent of the budget. As part of an attempt to even out economic development across regions, Taiwan is to be divided into 18 community hubs, each with its own transport network, shopping centres and industrial zone. Much of the land needed will be converted from agricultural use. Among the larger projects are a fourth nuclear power station, urban mass transit railway systems for Taiwan's main cities, a pumped water power project and a high-speed railway linking Taipei to the southern city of Kaohsiung. Taiwan's two international airports and container port facilities are also to be expanded. Some of the projects were not due for completion in six years and some projects have already been delayed due to poor planning. More than 30 projects were delayed in the first year of the plan alone. The government has held up bond issues related to current projects worth TDollars 156bn. Delayed funding will be incorporated into future budgets. The method of financing the various projects has also generated considerable controversy. The Council for Economic Planning and Development, which oversees the six-year plan, says that of the TDollars 8,200bn budget, TDollars 1,900bn will come from already approved government spending and TDollars 2,700bn will be financed by the public and private sectors. The remaining TDollars 3,600bn is to be raised from government capital accounts, including TDollars 1,100bn from the sale of bonds and government property. Some economists estimate, however, that the government will need to issue more than TDollars 5,000bn in bonds by the end of the century if the six-year plan is to be completed in full, and this is almost certain to lead to further inflation. Vice-finance minister Mr Lee Chung-ying says that his ministry has agreed in principle to support the financing of infrastructure projects from a government deficit. 'But government borrowing's proportion of GDP is expected to increase from 6 per cent to 40 or 50 per cent,' he adds. 'We think that is too much.' However, the finance ministry says it is not considering raising taxes. Since July 1991 the government has issued TDollars 102.5bn of bonds to finance current projects. The main opposition party is calling for large-scale cuts in projects, which it believes are too expensive, as part of its election platform. Meanwhile, there have been allegations that some companies with close government links have been favoured in the bidding process and awarding of contracts. Despite these setbacks, the size and scope of the six-year plan has attracted high-level trade missions from countries with companies interested in bidding for important contracts. Bilfinger and Berger of Germany and Matra of France, have each been awarded contracts to build lines for Taipei's urban mass transit railway (MRTS), worth USDollars 756m and USDollars 270m respectively. Siemens of Germany has been awarded the contract to build a new gas-fired power plant in southern Taiwan. An initial budget of TDollars 7.9bn for Taiwan's fourth nuclear power plant was approved this year, and Ebasco Engineering of the US has been contracted as consultant for the first phase of construction. However, projects for which Taiwan already possesses technology and experience, are likely to be awarded to Taiwan companies.</p>

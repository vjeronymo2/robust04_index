			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (21): Billed for business - Andrew Adonis looks at calling card operators and charges The business travel sector is one of the most lucrative and fastest growing markets for telecom operators. Calling cards are currently the main product on offer, but a growing array of facilities is in the making, geared particularly to the international traveller anxious to avoid language barriers, national telecoms bureaucracies and inflated international call charges. In the US, calling cards are a fact of life, with more than 100m in circulation. The three main long-distance operators - AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint - compete on price and service quality, and a host of other operators also offer the facility. Touch-tone or voice-response systems for inserting PIN numbers are the latest innovations, with a wide variety of billing arrangements on offer to suit personal and business needs. AT&amp;T even offers a translation service for travellers with language problems. In Europe, calling cards have been slower to catch on, even in the business market. This is perverse, given the relatively greater volume of international business travel in Europe, and with it the greater inconvenience involved in making calls - to say nothing of hefty telecoms tariffs, particularly after the mark-up charged by most European hotels. According to Eurodata, a tariff consultancy owned by 21 European telecoms operators, western Europe's 9m business travellers a year make nearly 700m telecoms transactions during cross-border business trips within Europe - 85 per cent are international. In total business travellers spend about Ecu3bn on telecoms services. About half of that sum goes to hotels, the rest to telecoms operators. Calling card tariffs are at a premium to standard tariffs, but are lower than the mark-up charged by the typical European hotel. So telecoms operators have a large vested interest in encouraging a shift to card calls: they stand to net a higher proportion of the existing Ecu3bn than they currently receive, and the lower tariffs ought significantly to increase the total size of the market. Yet only 51 per cent of the travellers surveyed by Eurodata carry a card - either a calling card or a credit card - with a telephone function, while awareness of services on offer was low. In line with US experience, the researchers found that 'when abroad, travellers will only use those telecom services that they know from their own country - it makes sense, therefore, to educate business travellers and promote services in their own country.' For most of Europe's national operators, the education and promotion is just beginning. In the US, where AT&amp;T in particular has been battling with hotel chains for a decade, the typical hotel charges 75 cents for access to calling card or freephone numbers, with no attempt to bar access. Indeed, many hotels advertise calling card access numbers in hotel bedrooms, aware that ease of access is now a significant factor in choice of hotel by business travellers. In Europe, by contrast, hotels typically charge a much higher connection fee, and sometimes bar access to calling card or freephone numbers altogether. Moreover, unlike the US there is no standard regime: a random FT survey of six large central London hotels found that two levied no calling card access charge, one charged Pounds 1 per call, one Pounds 1.50, one Pounds 2 and one Pounds 2.50. For any business traveller planning to make more than a few calls, it pays to check on the policy of each hotel - and travel equipped with a variety of cards. An invitation from the FT to business travellers earlier this year to tell their tales of telecoms woe brought a flood of responses. Tellingly, almost all came from consultants or executives in partnerships footing their own bills. Travellers whose bills are paid for them seem more indifferent to extortionate hotel charges, a fact company telecoms managers would do well to address. A typical complaint came from a reader charged Pounds 82 by a hotel in Nottingham, England, for a 22-minute off-peak call back home to Singapore. His concern was not just about the size of the bill, but at the hotel's failure to make clear the scale of the mark-up, which was disguised by a 'per unit' tariff. Another traveller in England, who used a BT calling card to avoid the mark-up, was caught by a 'facilities charge' of 20p a minute. ('What next? A charge for incoming calls - after all, they have to be handled by the operator . . .' he noted acidly.) Almost all calling cards come free, with calls billed either to a credit card statement or a separate account (which, in the case of national operators, can often be the home telephone bill). As a general rule, European cards are cheaper for intra-European calls, but US cards are cheaper for transatlantic calls. For example, the US carrier Sprint boasts a US-UK tariff on its 'Foncard' which is a fraction that of BT's 'Chargecard.' For UK travellers, Mercury is cheaper than BT for most long-distance calling-card calls, though BT has wider international coverage. However, just as the calling card is becoming as essential as a passport, it is being superseded. In May, AT&amp;T launched what it claimed was the first international mail box service for travellers wanting a 24-hour base for receiving and sending messages and faxes wherever they might be. Called 'WorldPlus', the new service gives subscribers a mail box and service centre accessed via touch-tone or voice-response.</p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Growth in retail sales levels off Growth in retail sales levelled off in May compared with April, though the underlying trend points to a steady if subdued rate of recovery. The Central Statistical Office said yesterday the retail sales volume in May was up by a seasonally adjusted 3.9 per cent on the previous May. This was slightly lower than April's year-on-year figure, which was revised down yesterday to 4.1 per cent from the 4.4 per cent published last month. But the index showed that the volume of sales was unchanged month-on-month, after growing by 0.5 per cent in February and March. The British Retail Consortium, the main industry body, yesterday made light of this flattening off and pointed out that the underlying trend remained positive. Mr James May, director-general of the consortium, said: 'This shows that consumers are still willing to spend in spite of the tax increases.' Measured on a three-month basis - an indicator economists believe is a better guide to the trend - retail sales grew by 0.9 per cent in the three months to May compared with the previous three months, and were up 3.9 per cent on the same period last year. This rise was spread fairly evenly across the sectors, with all the non-food sectors reporting rises of about 0.8 per cent in the three months to May, compared with the previous three months. Food retailers reported a slightly better rise of 1.3 per cent during this period. Within the last month, footwear and clothing was the most sluggish sector, with sales volumes falling by 1.7 per cent in May, after surging in April. Economists said this dip was partly due to poor weather at the start of the month. Household goods, by contrast, grew by 1.7 per cent last month, after falling back in April. In spite of this surge, the consortium said the furniture and carpets sector continued to be adversely affected by the uncertainty in the housing market. This was also undermining sales of DIY and electrical and electronic goods, the consortium added. Sales of televisions and hi-fi goods were up compared with last year, while white goods sold at the same level. Retailers continued to face intense cost competition, with consumers remaining very price-sensitive, the consortium added. This trend was most sharply indicated in the monthly household goods data, where the total value of sales fell by 3 per cent in spite of the growth in volumes. The figures were greeted with some relief in the City, where some analysts had feared sales might dip slightly after a Confederation of British Industry survey earlier this week reported retailers had become more pessimistic. Mr Ian Sheperdson, UK economist with Midland Global Markets, suggested that one reason for the discrepancy between the CBI survey and the CSO might be that the CBI survey gave more weight to smaller retailers. Since large retailers were performing better than small ones, according to the CBI, this might explain why the tone of the CBI survey was less optimistic, he said. However, Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist with Salomon Brothers, suggested that another reason might be the divergence between value and volumes. Heavy high-street discounting might be leaving retailers gloomy in spite of an overall rise in volumes, he said.</p>

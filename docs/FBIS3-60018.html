FAP [Peruvian  Air Force] fighters destroyed the plane because its crew refused  to obey the orders of the Peruvian military pilots. The  Colombian plane, a "Turbo Commander" with forged license  OB-2113, was destroyed at an illegal airstrip 20 km southeast of  `Palma Pampa' (Ayacucho), while loading bags of drugs.    The plane was spotted thanks to Colombian radar operating in  that country's jungle. Through a radio message Colombian  authorities passed the information on to their Peruvian peers.    It was established that the plane entered Peruvian territory  from Brazil, between Iquitos and Leticia, flying at 22,000 feet,  that is, at 7,000 m.    After the plane was spotted in Peruvian airspace, the FAP  high command in Huallaga immediately sent two fighters to  intercept it. The fighters took off from the Santa Lucia police  antinarcotics base and headed for Luisiana (Ayacucho). When the  plane was spotted it was loading bags of drugs and fuel for a  trip to Colombia.    The FAP planes fired machine-gun bursts, which caused the  plane to catch fire. The plane was destroyed. At the airstrip  there were at least 15 people supporting the crew.    This is the 11th small plane belonging to drug traffickers  that the FAP has destroyed over the past few months.</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Life insurance Yesterday's disappointing sales figures from the Prudential are a downbeat end to the season of new business announcements. Yet gloom has not been spread evenly across the sector. Legal &amp; General announced a healthy rise in new business on Wednesday, continuing its recovery from the dark days of the early 1990s. Black Horse, the bancassurance arm of Lloyd's Abbey Life, also fared well. This contrast in fortunes is partly a question of timing. While L&amp;G was weeding its UK sales force two years ago, the Pru is only now restructuring. The slide in sales at Jackson National, the Prudential's US subsidiary, is less easily explained away. If Jackson has been slow to match inducements offered to savers by its rivals, the revamped products promised yesterday might reverse the downward trend. But since low interest rates make Jackson's bond-based annuities look less attractive, a more radical overhaul of the product range may be required. Savers in the UK will remain reluctant to enter into annual premium contracts while recession lingers. The mis-selling of personal pensions uncovered last year is likely to make them wary in this area too. Full disclosure of commissions from next year will make the true costs of buying life assurance clear. Having underperformed the market by 15 per cent since commission disclosure was announced last summer, the sector has everything to prove.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May (YONHAP) -- South Korea and China have  decided to push with exchanges of military personnel, using the  momentum of military attaches having been installed at their  embassies, the office of the military attache at the Korean  Embassy here said Monday.    The agreement was reached Monday during a meeting between  visiting Lt. Gen. Yu Chong-kap, chief of the Defense  Intelligence Headquarters, and Lt. Gen. Xu Huizi, deputy chief  of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. This  was the first top- level military meeting ever held by the two  countries.    Accordingly, exchange visits by military personnel could  begin in the latter half of this year.    During the 40-minute meeting, the two sides traded views on  tensions on the Korean peninsula and military movements in North  Korea, as well as on wide-ranging and long-term military  cooperation.</p>

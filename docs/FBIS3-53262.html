PLO representative in France Layla Shahid said 'Arafat was  breaking out of his "personalised style" and taking account of  demands for democracy and greater accountability in nominations  being made in the runup to autonomy.    "I think that surely in the coming months all these requests  for more delegation of authority to others will have to be be  taken into consideration," Shahid told members of the  Anglo-American Press Association here.    She said this was already evident in nominations to the  Palestinian Economic Reconstruction and Development Agency  (PECDA) established to channel funds to the autonomous areas  when negotiations with the Israelis on autonomy have been  completed.    Donor countries have pledged two billion dollars in aid over  the next five years, 580 million of it this year, to Jericho and  Gaza, and accountability and openness were essential to avert  the threat of corruption, Shahid said.    She added that planned elections would bring "major changes  to the PLO's nature that will ultimately lead to a full  parliament" taking over from the Palestinian National Council.    Shahid said the democratic debate was taking place  world-wide  through petitions or in the Arab press because for the moment  the PLO had no institutions and no capital. It was vital to  "strengthen the beginning of this process of democratisation,"  she said. "All this part of the internal debate I find very  healthy."    She said PECDA, whose task will be to fund basic  infrastructure, would be able to start functioning on the ground  by next month.    A Palestinian delegation led by Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi went to  PLO headquarters in Tunis on January 2 to press for greater  democracy, but said they failed in their mission. 'Arafat had  agreed to meet the delegation after receiving petitions  demanding change.    Shahid said that economic autonomy talks being held here  between Israel and the PLO would resume on January 18 and would  be boosted by last week's monetary accord between the PLO and  Jordan. A new meeting of donor countries under World Bank  auspices would be held at the end of the month.    The PLO representative said she hoped U.S. President Bill  Clinton's meeting in Geneva next Sunday with Syrian head of  state Hafiz al-Asad would lead to an early resumption of  bilateral negotiations between Israel and Syria on the Golan  Heights.</p>

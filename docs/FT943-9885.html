			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Dismissals and new currency alter outlook for Brazil poll: Patrick McCurry on a fall in inflation and the dumping of running mates accused of fraud The removal of two of Brazil's vice presidential candidates after fraud allegations is being seen as further evidence that things might slowly be changing in a country where holding public office has long been regarded as a means to personal wealth creation. Last week Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, presidential candidate of the centrist Brazilian Social Democrats, took swift action to replace his running mate Mr Guilherme Palmeira of the conservative Liberal Front party, Mr Cardoso's main electoral ally. Mr Palmeira was accused of being linked with fraud involving public works contracts. A week earlier Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Workers' party dropped his deputy, Mr Jose Paulo Bisol of the Brazilian Socialist party, after allegations that Mr Bisol had submitted over-costed amendments to the budget for works that benefited property he owned. Although both Mr Bisol and Mr Palmeira, who are both senators, deny any wrongdoing the sackings were a response to the growing public demand for clean government. Mr Cardoso and Mr da Silva, who are tying in the opinion polls for the election in October, had little choice but to sacrifice their running-mates in the face of incessant, if often sensationalist, press investigations. The coverage has been feeding, and feeding off, the public's demand for higher standards of public morals, which stems largely from the resignation of former President Fernando Collor in December 1992 amid corruption allegations, and from a huge congressional investigation into federal budget fraud that ended earlier this year with the expulsion or resignation of several leading politicians. The public mood has reached the point where, according to a poll last month, Brazilians rate honesty as by far the most important personal quality for the next president. It was rated top with 38 per cent followed by character at 3 per cent and competence at 2 per cent. This trend has damaged the campaign of Mr Orestes Quercia, the controversial candidate of the Democratic Movement party, Brazil's biggest. Mr Quercia has been stuck at 7 per cent in the polls, largely because of an indictment on fraud charges relating to his term of office as Sao Paulo state governor. Last Friday Brazil's appeals court quashed the case. For Mr da Silva, known as 'Lula', the allegations levelled at his running-mate have been a blow to the Workers' party's image of clean government. Mr da Silva's delay of nearly a month in sacking Mr Bisol virtually paralysed his campaign. This coincided with the introduction by Mr Cordosa, when he was finance minister, of Brazil's new currency, the real, which has brought monthly inflation down from 50 per cent in June to 7 per cent last month and has helped Mr Cardoso draw level with Mr da Silva in the polls after trailing by 15 to 20 points. Mr da Silva's new running-mate, Mr Aloizio Mercadante, is an economist and is expected to spearhead the Workers' party's new approach to the anti-inflation plan. Given the widespread public approval for the plan, Mr da Silva is in a delicate position. If he criticises it he risks being labelled the 'candidate of inflation' by Mr Cardoso, while if he supports it he is, in effect, endorsing his opponent. Mr da Silva has toned down his criticism and is now committed to retaining the new currency but also to increasing wages, which he says have been eroded under the plan. Mr Cardoso's new running-mate, Mr Marco Maciel, is, like Mr Palmeira, a senator from the Liberal Front party and from the north east of Brazil, a region in which Mr Cardoso's party is weak. Mr da Silva is expected to try to exploit Mr Maciel's membership of military governments and the Collor administration by portraying Mr Cardoso's team as representing a return to the bad old days of corruption.</p>

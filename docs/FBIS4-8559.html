			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 14 (AFP) -- Serb forces seized 17  UN peacekeepers Thursday guarding a weapons stockpile at Cifluk,  19 kilometres (12 miles) northwest of Sarajevo, UN Protection  Force spokesman Rob Annink said.    The peacekeepers -- 14 Canadian peacekeeping troops and  three  UN military observers of unspecified nationality -- were taken  by the Serbs to a barracks at Ilijas, Annink said.    Cifluk lies just inside the heavy weapons exclusion zone  around Sarajevo ordered by the United Nations in February.</p>

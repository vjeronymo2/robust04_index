			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [All quotation marks as published] </F>   [Text] Madras, May 6.    The break away DMK [Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (Dravidian  Progressive Foundation)] led by Mr. V. Gopalsami today adopted  the name `Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam'.    For its flag too, the party has retained the twin colours of  black and red but in a way different from that of the DMK. The  flag will have three stripes, red at the top and the bottom and  black in the middle.    The party General Council which met here today endorsed the  new name and flag and within minutes of its disclosure by the  party's general secretary, Mr. Gopalsami, the flag sprung up in  multitudes in and around the venue. The party Executive which  practically sat through the whole of last night besides choosing  the name and flag deliberated on many other current issues.    Ever since Mr. Gopalsami and his group broke away from the  DMK in October last, they had been claiming that theirs was the  real DMK and they would not part with the DMK's flag.    They had to change their stand following the decision of the  Election Commission which recently gave its seal of approval to  the group led by Mr. M. Karunanidhi and Mr. K. Anbazhagan as the  DMK with the authority to use the `Rising Sun' symbol.    Mr. Gopalsami who announced the party's decisions at a news  conference and displayed the new flag said his party had not yet  decided on its election symbol. As the candidates of his party  in the May 26 bye-elections were `Independents' in the reckoning  of the Election Commission, they had to remain content for the  present with one of the free symbols allotted to them by the  Commission, he said.    The word `Marumalarchi' (Renaissance) had been appended to  the name DMK, Mr. Gopalsami explained, because his party would  like to take up in earnest the work left behind by the late C.N.  Annadurai, the founder of DMK and who ceaselessly crusaded to  bring about a renaissance in the social, cultural and literary  fields of Tamil Nadu. In the political arena too, his party  would like to usher in a renaissance by stamping out corruption  and putting an end to the practice of grooming family heirs for  political leadership, he said.    Mr. Gopalsami said that his group's earlier claim on the  name  and flag of the DMK party was a sequel to the strong sentiments  of those who walked out of the DMK with him and their intention  had never been to introduce `confrontationist politics' in the  State. In fact they were the victims of violence at several  places. With the Election Commission's pronouncement, a new name  and a new flag had been necessitated but `we are confident that  people will decide who represents the real DMK', he said and  added `we will prove in course of time that we are the real DMK'.    The General Council of the party decided that the  office-bearers elected at its earlier meeting held at Tiruchi in  December last would be retained ones for the Marumalarchi  Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) also and the rules and  regulations adopted at that meeting would govern it.    `Our first task in politics is to fight and throw away the  corrupt AIADMK [All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]  Government', said Mr. Gopalsami responding to questions.    Asked whether he would not be further splitting the  anti-AIADMK votes by his stand, Mr. Gopalsami said, that  practically all sections of the people had been disillusioned  with the performance of the AIADMK Government. The people wanted  a change of Government and his party firmly believed that it  could provide the alternative.    At the national level, he said, his party would team up with  anti-Congress(I) forces for bringing about a powerful  alternative to the Congress(I). He, however, excluded the BJP  [Bharatiya Janata Party] from the list as it was communal. The  Left parties and the Janata Dal could emerge as a strong force  against the Congress(I), he felt.    He had reservations about Bahujan Samai Party led by Mr.  Kanshi Ram, Mr. Gopalsami said. Their views on Gandhiji were not  acceptable to his party.    On his attitude towards the Sri Lankan militants, he said he  was not supporting any of these groups. His aim was that there  should not be any violence in Tamil Nadu and if there were any  violent acts, the law should take its course.    Answering a question on the revival of the sentence on the  News Editor of Dinakaran newspaper by the Assembly,  he said there was no magnanimity on the part of the State  Government. His party would launch an agitation whenever press  freedom was threatened, he said.    The General Council passed a number of resolutions,  including  one urging the State Government to revoke the sentence on the  News Editor of Dinakaran, expedite police  investigation and apprehend the culprits involved in the murder  of Elumalai, party activist, and an appeal to the electorate of  Mylapore and Perundurai to support the party's candidates in the  bye-election.</p>

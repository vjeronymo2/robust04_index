			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Marco Tavasani: "400-Billion-Lire Order for </F> Alenia"]    [Text] The minister of defense has solved the dilemma  about the modernization program for the air force whilst waiting  for the four-nation fighter plane, Eurofighter-2000, the  delivery of which is planned for 2005. It has been decided to  modernize 65 F-104S's and to lease 24 Tornado-ADV's (Air Defense  Variant) from the British government for 10 years. This gives  Alenia (Finmeccanica group) a deep breath of oxygen from the  industrial point of view, and also under a social profile, as  the modernization program for the F-104's will mean that no  additional personnel will be laid off from the Turin factories.    Let us look at the two operations in detail. The contract  was given to Alenia yesterday morning, and it is worth about 400  billion lire. It will ensure that the air force will have an  interceptor fighter that, although it has an average life of 15  years, could acceptably carry out the role of short range  interceptor fighter for another 10 years. The first renovated  Starfighters, that will carry the initials ASAM (Updated  Modified Avionics System) will be available for the four  designated air bases at Cameri, Grossetto, Istrana, and Cervia,  18 months after the placing of the contract. The interventions  of Alenia, and the other national subcontracting companies,  mainly regard rewiring and the substitution of other systems, as  well as the installation of a new and more potent inertia  platform to assure more precise navigation. The aircraft will  be armed with two Aim-9L Sidewinder missiles with infrared  guidance systems, and a couple of Aspide missiles with radar  guidance systems, built by Alenia. The 65 F-104's that are to  be modernized will be chosen by the air force from the 120  airplanes of this type in their possession, giving priority to  the airframes that have suffered less structural fatigue, and  the last one will be delivered three years after the start of  the program. Substantially it is an operation that tends to  increase the overall reliability of the aircraft, without  noticeably increasing its operational capacity, that remains the  same as that of a jet that is over 20 years old. The other  operation provides for the leasing of 24 Tornado-ADV's, that the  RAF [Royal Air Force] has grounded since the end of East-West  tensions. It is an aircraft that has 70 percent in common with  the attack version of the Tornado, that was used by Italy during  the Gulf War. The most notable differences are found in the  electronics system, which has been optimized for long range  interception, and amongst other things the ADV has a potent Fox  Hunter firing radar produced by GEC. In fact 173 aircraft of  this type were built. It was developed by British Aerospace to  meet the threat of the Soviet Backfire some distance away from  Britain. The contract is worth 700 billion lire spread out over  10 years, 270 billion lire will cover the leasing, and 430  billion lire will pay for spares, assistance, maintenance,  manuals, and training for the pilots, and intercept officers,  that are the mission commanders. The 24 Tornados will be  assigned to the bases at Gioia del Colle and Trapani, covering a  gap in our air defense in the Mediterranean area. Without doubt  this operation will have a decisive influence on the  British-Italian policy agreements for the Eurofighter-2000  program, as well as guaranteeing sufficient work for the  technicians of Alenia, avoiding the possible dismembering of the  company's work force, to cover the three years that still remain  before the European program starts at an industrial level.</p>

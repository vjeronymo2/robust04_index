			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: Oui campaign is one of them and us THE campaign for a Yes vote in France's referendum on European monetary and political union has brought together some odd allies, stretching across both sides of a normally warring political establishment. To optimists in the pro-Maastricht camp, their campaign shows a healthy diversity. To the pessimists, the Yes campaign is nearly as fragmented as the anti-treaty alliance, and is in danger of losing credibility by offering different audiences conflicting reasons for voting Yes on September 20. On the one hand, there is the mainstream of the Socialist party, which is taking up President Francois Mitterrand's theme that the treaty will protect the weak against the costs and dangers of European development. On the other, there are the Yes campaigners in the divided RPR and UDF right-wing opposition parties, which portray an economically liberal post-Maastricht Europe, likely to alarm working class Socialist voters. Also in the Yes army are most of France's leading industrialists; a 300-strong committee of artists - many heavily subsidised by the state  - intellectuals, sports personalities and assorted celebrities; and the Catholic bishops' conference. Mr Andre Billardon, the Socialist party's Maastricht campaign manager, and vice-president of the National Assembly, believes that the Yes camp's diversity could be an advantage. Accordingly, the Socialists, Gaullists and UDF have agreed to campaign separately to give them maximum freedom to appeal to their individual electorates' concerns, he explains. 'Maastricht is only a judicial framework, so we each have different explanations of the European policies our political parties will follow after the treaty is ratified,' says Mr Billardon. The Socialists have brought their full campaign machinery to play, as if it were a national political election - a FFr13m (Pounds 1.36m) budget and 15-hour working days for Mr Billardon and his colleagues. The party is campaigning separately from the government, though it naturally devotes the free television and radio time it and other parties are allowed in the final two weeks to Socialist ministers. Mr Billardon's main campaign worry is not that the Yes campaign might appear incoherent, but that it might not get through at all. Some polls indicate that the public has been taking very little notice of the deluge of propaganda put out by political leaders in both camps over the past month, he says. 'Things have improved since Mr Mitterrand made his television appearance . . . that at least made people better informed. But I don't think Mr Chirac is much followed by voters or even his own followers. Local politicians have also kept very quiet,' he complains. So just who do the Yes campaigners think they have to convince? Mr Billardon believes the Yes vote is strongest among the young and retired people and weakest among the 30 to 55 age group. 'It is the economically active who feel they have something to lose.' By class, he sees solid support for Maastricht among intellectuals, executives and in the public administration. Opposition is chiefly among the working class, hit by high unemployment, and farmers, suffering from European Community price cuts agreed by their government and its EC partners in the summer. These are the people the Yes campaign team needs to convince over the next 10 days. 'We need to appeal more to average citizens, to calm their fears,' says Mr Billardon. It will be a hard job because farmers tend to be loyal to the right-wing, where the anti-Maastricht lobby is strong, while the Socialist government's rigorous economic policies have lost it votes among the working class. Mr Billardon has no illusions that the final result on Sunday week will be a close run thing. Personally, he puts his money on a Yes majority of a mere 52 per cent.</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Generators poised to award contracts PowerGen, the electricity generators, and Associated British Ports are soon to announce the award of contracts to build Britain's largest coal import terminal, National Power confirmed yesterday. John Brown, the engineering company, is said to be a strong candidate for one of the two main contracts to build the jetty and coal-handling facilities. The Pounds 150m project at Immingham on the Humber, expected to open in 1994, will be a blow to British Coal. The new terminal would allow the generators to replace up to 10m tonnes of British coal with imports. That would be in addition to to the capacity of other import terminals planned by the generators. PowerGen announced last month that it was spending Pounds 40m on a new 5m-tonne coal terminal in Liverpool, while National Power is building a 5m-tonne terminal in Bristol as well as two 3m-tonne terminals at Hull and on the Tees. National Power and PowerGen are each expected to have 5m tonnes of capacity at Immingham. That would allow each to handle about enough imported coal there to supply a 2000MW power station for a year. The terminal will be well-placed to supply National Power's 4,000MW station at Drax, its 2,000MW station at Eggborough and its 1,000MW West Barton unit, all of which are in North Yorkshire. It would also be within easy reach of PowerGen's 2,000MW stations at Ferrybridge, West Yorkshire, and Cottam, Nottinghamshire, as well as its 1,000MW unit at High Marnham, Nottinghamshire. Immingham will be a deep-water port which can admit large ships, so the two generators expect to save on the cost of transferring coal to smaller vessels for landing.</p>

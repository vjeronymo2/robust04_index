			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Palestine Broadcast: "Talk of the Return" by Fayiz Qandil] </F>   [Text] Brother strugglers: Although the explosion at  Hadera, in the Zionist heartland, yesterday, was only powerful  enough to destroy just one Israeli military vehicle, it shook  the earth under the decaying Zionist ideology, and dented the  Zionists' arrogance and racism enough to make them understand  who they are and who we, the Palestinian Arab people, are.    We, the Arabs, will help the Zionists make sense out of what  happened at Hadera yesterday, provided they try to remember what  happened a week before that. On that occasion, the Palestinian  Arab struggle punished the wolves of the Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre in 'Afula, as called for by divine and temporal laws  and moral ethics. It would seem, though, that the Zionists have  not recognized the 'Afula attack as a limited Palestinian Arab  punishment for an indescribably savage Zionist massacre.  Indeed, the Zionists were so arrogant and racist as to bark  their infamous slogan, death to the Arabs.    True to their extremist and racist natures, they put their  abhorrent slogan into practice. That was in the intervening  week between the spectacular and wondrous 'Afula and Hadera  operations. The Israeli military, using anti-tank rockets,  flattened Palestinian Arab houses in the valiant city of  Ramallah under their usual pretext that they were after some  Palestinian Arabs on the run. That was an act of sheer terror  and piracy. What matters here is that not one Palestinian  Arab's body was found under the rubble. The houses and  properties of all the world are not equal in value to a single  Arab martyr's blood, even though martyrdom in itself is a gain  and a new lease on life. In any case, let us remind Zionist  injustice that by shelling Palestinian villages and camps with  antitank rockets, Israel has pushed the limits of terrorism.  Firing even a single rocket at an Arab house is the ultimate in  terror -- an action prohibited by the Hague and Geneva  conventions under which occupied territories and their  population must be protected against the evils and criminality  of the invading forces. Under these conventions, these forces  are guilty of a category of war crimes and mass killings that  came before special tribunals after World War II.    For the record, we will point out that Arab resistance in  the  occupied territories has warned the Israelis to expect Arab  rockets to be fired at Zionist houses, as tit for tat, unless  Israel refrains. After the Arab houses were blown up in  Ramallah, the Israeli occupation wolves shot and killed a young  pregnant Palestinian Arab woman who happened to be standing by a  window in her home. Yesterday, and before the Hadera  explosion, a Zionist settler, acting under the protection of the  occupation army, opened fire on Arab school children in Jericho,  wounding several of them. He was able to escape with the aid of  killers of the Israeli occupation army. Hours later, Arab  dynamite shook Hadera.    Will Israel now learn the lesson of 'Afula and Hadera, or  will the Israelis revert to their terrorist, arrogant, and  stupidly racist Zionist mentality? It is not for us to provide  the answer to this question. This is for Israel to answer. If  Israel learns the lesson and ends occupation and dismantles  settlements and disarms settlers the road for peace will open  wide. However, if Israel, as we think likely to happen, refuses  to see sense, and death to the Arabs continues to be barked by  the extremists, the Zionist state will be confronted by a great  Palestinian Arab people who will unsheath the Israeli sword with  one hand, staunch their noble wound with the other hand, and  then hurl the sword back at Israel's chest.    Israel must call a halt to its terror and atrocities against  the Palestinian Arab people. Otherwise, the muscular hand of  the Palestinian Arab people that struck at 'Affula and Hadera in  the Zionist heartland will reach to any place in Palestine that  the wolves of Israeli occupation imagine is out of reach of the  Palestinain resistance.    The only situation under which the Zionist invaders may have  security and peace is the departure of Zionist colonialism and  its weapons and institutions from the last inch of our sacred  Palestinian Arab land.</p>

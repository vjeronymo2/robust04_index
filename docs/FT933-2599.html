			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Survey of International Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (2): Bank financing is back - The New York scene is flourishing again IT may not compare with the frenzy of the late 1980s, but the mergers and acquisitions business in the US is flourishing this year. As of August 23, almost 4,000 mergers, acquisitions and purchases of minority stakes worth a total of Dollars 137.8bn had been completed in the US; a big improvement on last year. So big, in fact, that the total for the first eight months of 1993 has already surpassed the Dollars 137.5bn (5,500 deals) racked up in all of 1992. This is good news for Wall Street's M&amp;A bankers. For two and a half years they have watched their counterparts in booming securities underwriting, sales and trading businesses grab all the glory. Yet even if the hectic pace in M&amp;A is maintained for the rest of the year, 1993 will still fall short of 1988, when almost 4,000 deals worth Dollars 348.6bn were completed - the peak of the 1980s merger mania. To the delight of the investment banking community, there have been some very large transactions among this year's crop of US deals. They include the Dollars 12.6bn acquisition of McCaw Cellular Communications by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph; the Dollars 6bn acquisition of Medco Containment Services by the drugs giant Merck; the Dollars 4.3bn purchase of a 20 per cent stake in MCI Communications by UK telecoms group BT; and the Dollars 1.4bn stock-swap merger between Home Shopping Network and its rival the QVC channel. After four years of decline (see table), it looks as if the M&amp;A business has turned the corner. There are several reasons for the turnaround. By the end of the 1980s, companies were overburdened with debt, much of it raised at expensive rates during the M&amp;A boom. Since then, aided by the lowest interest rates in more than three decades and a recession that forced companies to take drastic action, US corporations have been cleaning up their balance sheets - paying off costly debt with cheaper funds raised through equity issues or sales of low-interest debt. With much of the debt restructuring out of the way, companies are in a better position to consider making deals again. As Mr Jack Levy, co-head of M&amp;A at Merrill Lynch in New York, puts it: 'Companies feel their balance sheets are in order, and more importantly, they feel that the current level of cash flows are robust. Hence, they believe if they were to assume new leverage, they've got a level of confidence in the underlying cash flow necessary to support an acquisition.' Similarly, the economic and business background has improved enough to spur corporations into action. At the start of this year there was a lot of pent-up demand for deals from companies which had lain low during the recession and the faltering recovery. Once it was clear that the economic recovery was established, interest rates were staying low, and business confidence was beginning to rebound, companies revived plans previously kept on the back burner. Also, changes within companies, such as the introduction of rigorous cost containment programmes and efficiency drives, are complete, leaving management ready to build through acquisitions. As one M&amp;A banker says: 'A lot of these strategic deals we've seen have been in the works for some time.' The strength of domestic stock markets (at record highs throughout the summer) has also helped. High stock prices means acquiring companies have been able to use their own equity as financing. This has a down side - high stock prices also mean that companies are more costly to acquire. The overall pool of financing capital, not just equity, has been growing. In particular, bank financing is back. Banks, coming off two of the most profitable years in their history, have put many of their troubles behind them, and are beginning to lend again. Investors and shareholders have played their part in providing liquidity for the M&amp;A recovery. Institutional investors hungry for decent returns on assets have been putting the money into deals and the once-shunned buyout funds. Shareholders have been forcing management to divest non-essential operations and focus attention and capital on core businesses. The result has been a growing number of mergers and de-mergers. The rally in the high-yield market has also made it easier for companies to raise funds for deal-based expansion, and helped breathe new life into leveraged buyouts - which at one point looked as if they had been killed off as a form of deal-financing by the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert and the junk bond market in the late 1980s. Specialist buyout firms have also returned, adding another source of liquidity. When British Petroleum recently sold its animal feed business, 30 financial firms joined in the bidding; the eventual winner was an investor group led by the Houston buyout firm the Sterling Group, which paid a hefty Dollars 425m for the BP unit. Despite the delight at the revival of M&amp;A business, no one compares today to the 1980s. Much has changed, not least the nature of the deals. The big theme this year has been companies making deals for solid, strategic and industry-specific reasons. Growth, market share, efficiency, and a need to be prepared for regulatory and structural changes have been the driving forces behind many deals. Many industries, for example, are undergoing or face radical change. This is most notable in the telecommunications and healthcare businesses, where many of the biggest deals have occurred. In the telecoms industry, AT&amp;T's acquisition of McCaw, US West's purchase of a 25 per cent stake in Time Warner's cable and film business for Dollars 2.5bn, and BT's purchase of a big stake in MCI, were all about companies readying themselves for technological and structural change. It has been a similar story in the healthcare industry. Columbia Hospital Corporation's Dollars 4.2bn acquisition of Galen Health Care, and Merck's purchase of Medco, were two deals concluded against the background of an impending revolution in the form of President Clinton's healthcare reform package. The chief feature of this year's crop of M&amp;A deals has been the absence of hostile takeover. This is partly a reflection of changing attitudes among corporate managers, and partly because the aggressive takeover advisers of the 1980s, like Wasserstein Perella and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, are lying low. The big question now is: how long can it last? A few factors are conspiring to keep the M&amp;A business in check. Chief among these is competition from the buoyant public market. Companies that might normally put themselves up for sale have been persuaded by the booming market in stock offerings to go public rather than resort to the private deal. The fragile state of the recovery is also acting as a restraint. Deal-makers and corporate managers are reluctant to move until they are completely sure that the economy has entered a phase of long-term solid growth. Yet, in spite of these reservations, bankers believe that the M&amp;A business hit bottom last year and is now embarking upon a course of steady expansion. Mr Levy of Merrill Lynch says: 'My view is that we are at a new level, and that it is likely to be a sustainable level. Business has been somewhat spasmodic for the last couple of years, and my sense is that today more companies want to talk, and are taking seriously the idea of doing something on the buy side or sell side. That's the best barometer we have. Our backlog is up dramatically in terms of the number of deals and the quality of deals.'  -------------------------------------------------- US M&amp;A  --------------------------------------------------                      Value           No of                  Dollars m           Deals  -------------------------------------------------- 1987             209,478.1            3327 1988             348,616.6            3970 1989             311,186.6            5539 1990             179,898.7            5680 1991             139,016.8            5305 1992             137,477.7            5579  -------------------------------------------------- Source: Securities Data  --------------------------------------------------</p>

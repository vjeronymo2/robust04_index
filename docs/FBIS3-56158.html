			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>   [Text] President Nursultan Nazarbayev believes that  Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have great possibilities for joint  economic development. He believes this could be achieved  through mutually advantageous integration, which excludes the  isolation of the two peoples who have common historical and  cultural roots and a common future.    Nazarbayev made the statement finishing his stay in  Uzbekistan. On Wednesday [12 January], the last day of his visit  to the neighboring republic, the president saw ancient Central  Asian towns of Khiva and Samarkand where he was accompanied by  Uzbek President Islam Karimov. Nazarbayev saw the architectural  sights, met representatives of regional authorities and ethnic  Kazakhs.    The presidents of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan signed in  Tashkent Monday night a treaty on creating a single economic  space between the two republics. The document provides the  removal of customs barriers on the border between the two  countries, free migration of people and movement of goods and  services and the creation of a legal basis for the joint  development of communications and transportation.    Addressing the news conference, Nazarbayev spoke about the  need to create a similar economic union. He said that  Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have always favored economic  integration and denounced self-isolation. In conditions of  circulation of equivalent national currencies, the idea should  become a reality, he said, and added that talking in private the  two presidents favored equal partnership excluding any forms of  dictate and hegemony.</p>

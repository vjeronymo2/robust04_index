			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Observer: Take in copy When it comes to economics Brazil has never been short of original thinkers, and Fernando Collor is no exception. On his first day as president he froze 80 per cent of the population's bank accounts. Hence, no surprise last week when he began publishing a series of articles entitled 'agenda for consensus', aimed at provoking debate on his ideas for modernising Brazil. Debate there has been - but not quite along the lines Collor had hoped. For by his fifth article, the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper had discovered that with the exception of a few paragraphs the text was copied from the manifesto of the Social Liberalism party of which Collor is not a member. Moreover, this manifesto, coincidentally also titled 'agenda for consensus', had been lifted from essays by a diplomat who died last year. Red faces all round. The initial explanation was that the late diplomat had in fact been inspired by the president. But then the president's aides thought better of this and issued a statement saying that their master's ideas were not intended to be original.</p>

			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> LEMIEUX TIES THREE RECORDS IN 10-7 VICTORY  </P> <P> For the first four games of their playoff series, the Philadelphia Flyers spent  much of the time roughing up Mario Lemieux, the star of the Pittsburgh  Penguins.  </P> <P> The tactic worked so well, with unexpected help from Lemieux's teammate, Randy  Cunneyworth, that Lemieux, battered and bruised, was a doubtful starter in Game  5 Tuesday night at Pittsburgh. His worst injury, caused by his teammate, was a  neck injury.  </P> <P> Lemieux, too big, at 6-4 and 200, to be intimidated, was ready for the opening  faceoff. Ready is an understatement.  </P> <P> He tied a playoff record by scoring four goals in the first period and, in a  wild scoring game, the Penguins outlasted Philadelphia, 10-7. The win gave the  Penguins a 3-2 lead in the series.  </P> <P> Showing no sign that he was ailing, Lemieux also matched two other playoff  records in addition to the four in a period set by Tim Kerr of the Flyers in  1985. He scored his fifth goal and eighth point when he scored into an empty  net with 37 seconds left. Maurice Richard (1944), Darryl Sittler (1976) and  Reggie Leach (1976) had five goals. Last spring, Patrik Sundstrom of New Jersey  had eight points.  </P> <P> The rough-house tactics had limited Lemieux to three goals in the first four  games. But in this one, he flexed a few muscles of his own, skating right in on  goalie Ron Hextall from the start.  </P> <P> Until a couple of hours before game time, Lemieux could not turn his head.  </P> <P> "I had played mediocre hockey and my teammates expect more of me," Lemieux, who  said treatment took the pain out of his neck. "I had to come out and start  putting the puck in the net."  </P> <P> That, he did. Lemieux, in one of the great games in Stanley Cup history, had a  natural (three goals in a row) hat trick in the first 6 minutes 50 seconds. He  scored on a breakaway at 2:15, from close range at 3:45, and on another  breakaway at 6:50.  </P> <P> The Penguins, who can clinch the series with a victory at Philadelphia Thursday  night, had a 9-3 lead, but two goals by Kerr helped the Flyers pull to within  two with almost three minutes left.  </P> <P> Montreal 3, Boston 2 -- One defeat is all the Canadiens were willing to put up  with in this series. They put Patrick Roy in the nets at Montreal and he was  too much for the Bruins once again.  </P> <P> Roy, unbeaten at the Forum all season, turned back 22 shots and ran his playoff  recors to 7-0 and the Canadiens eliminated Boston, 4-1. Last spring the Bruins  knocked out the Canadiens and reached the Stanley Cup final.  </P> <P> Defenseman Chris Chelios had a goal and an assist in the second period to send  the Canadiens into the lead for good. Bob Joyce scored both Boston goals.  </P> <P> The Canadiens are a heavy favorite to face Calgary in the final round. Next  they face the winner of the Philadelphia-Pittsburgh series.

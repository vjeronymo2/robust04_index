			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Fran Visnar: "NATO and the Serb `Smart' </F> Destructive Sub-Ammunition"]    [Text] The fuss about the NATO ultimatum to the Bosnian  Serbs to withdraw their artillery-missile equipment or place it  under control did not occur just because of the recent (drastic)  massacre in Sarajevo. Some time ago UNPROFOR and the NATO  information services responsible for monitoring the development  of military technology established that the Serbs had developed  and started serial production of "shells of the range and  destructiveness of missiles."    What the military magazines of the former JNA [Yugoslav  People's Army] wrote about in 1990 has become reality.  Belgrade, which continues to allocate 75 percent of the state  budget to the army, has sent artillery ammunition of increased  destructive power not to the testing ranges but directly to the  real war. The M-65 155-mm caliber Serb howitzers produced under  U.S. license fire shells that are made of new materials and  filled with better powders.    The Serbs have constructed an artillery shell "with an  extended range and increased destructive power." Its main  characteristic is ribbed embossment in the center part (the  Serbs call them "little ribs"). The "little ribs" prevent  undesired activity with the extended-length shell. They can  therefore be fired from common artillery pieces, and there is no  need to construct special gun and howitzer barrels or to  refashion existing ones. This means that the Serbs, at the time  of a difficult economic crisis, have no intention of writing off  their old artillery technology. Instead of replacing artillery  pieces, they simply change the ammunition for more modern and  effective ammunition.    For instance, the shells are filled with the so-called  progressive powder, which can increase velocity by 8 to 12  percent. During combustion, the progressive powder creates  constant pressure, which equals the highest pressure allowed.  Apart from the shells with the "little ribs," the Serbs have  been doing intensive work on creating 155-mm caliber  precision-guided missiles (they are also planning production of  the 203-mm caliber) by adding great precision in hitting very  small, moving, but significant targets to the existing  destructive power of the missile.  <H5>  Doctrine Tested in Bosnia-Herzegovina </H5>   The Serb military doctrine, which is also formed on the  basis  of experience at the fronts in Bosnia-Herzegovina, considers the  proportion of surface-to-surface missiles of short (tactical)  range, multiple rocket launchers, and long-range artillery  simply irreplaceable in the fighting against the opponent  echelons and in blocking city areas. The Serbs intend to change  the non-nuclear (common) warhead of the Luna surface-to-surface  missile into a cluster warhead with 830 bombs that are extremely  effective against low-resistance targets, such as missile  systems in position, radars, trucks, and all kinds of towed  artillery. However, the warhead cannot be used effectively to  destroy better protected armored vehicles, especially tanks with  active and reactive armor.    The 262-mm caliber Serb Orkan multiple rocket launcher has  similar effects; the Orkan's 12 truck-mounted barrels launch  missiles whose warheads have various kinds of subammunition.  The 12-missile salvo of the Orkan warhead covers the target  with 7,728 pellets (bombs), which have a destructive effect on  exposed infantry (as well as civilian population),  low-resistance technology and other low-resistance targets  (trucks, classical artillery, [samohotke] with thin armors). As  a rule, tanks survive Orkan missile strikes.    The Serbs have thus developed two additional items that they  have been testing in Bosnia-Herzegovina (Sarajevo):  precision-guided warheads and sensor-initiated self-guided  (antitank) ammunition. The first group consists of cluster-type  missile warheads with subammunition where the warhead is guided  to the target area, and after it "recognizes" the target, it  lowers the subammunition that guides itself to tanks and hits  them from above. That kind of filling has a cluster effect,  which pierces the armor, but so does the explosive-formed bullet  that is very close to the armor it pierces with its kinetic  energy. These weapons belong to the intelligent or smart  systems, and the important feature of them is that they consist  of microelectronic devices containing memory that should enable  them to distinguish between real and false targets. The cluster  warhead, launched by the missile, transfers from the ballistic  path to the planned one, and, under a very gentle angle, reaches  the target. The memory device recognizes targets, at which it  throws 16 to 24 self-guided bullets.  <H5>  Destructive Smart Subammunition </H5>   The microprocessor memory device distinguishes real from  false targets on the basis of an infrared image of the target.  The sensor-initiated artillery ammunition can also destroy  tanks. This is where 155- and 203-mm caliber artillery shells  are used. At a certain point in the trajectory, their bottom is  kicked out and the subammunition comes out of the missile body  (the 155-mm shell contains two, and the 203-mm three pieces of  such subammunition), which descends to the zone of marked  targets by parachute, where, with its sensor device, it locates  a particular target, and then the explosion creates a  drop-shaped missile that destroys the tank by hitting the roof  part of the armor, its thinnest part.    This subammunition has multispectral sensors (infrared,  radar, and radiometric), which are active while they descend to  the target by parachute. After the opening of the brake  parachute, a gentle rotation of sensor devices starts in the  searching phase, with a vertical descent velocity of 10 meters  per second. When it fixes on the target, the device uses the  memory to analyze it, combining sensor signals and determining  the optimal time for activating the explosive filling, which  shapes the drop-shaped body for piercing the armor. Detonation  occurs at a distance of 150 meters from the tank.   <H5>    Three Applications </H5>   With their new technology and enhanced accuracy, the Serbs  want to destroy the rapidly increased power of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. This mainly applies to: guided  missiles, command positions, and radio-electronic systems. They  also want to neutralize Muslim guns, howitzers, mortars, and  antiattack batteries. The new "smart" subammunition will serve  to protect flanks, interspaces, and engineering obstacles; it  will be used for preparation and counterpreparation, and for  neutralizing and decimating the Muslim units in the gathering  zones, during the time of approaching the front end of the  opponent's defense or on the line of development for attack.  There is also the destruction of tanks and infantry wedged into  the Serb defense, as well as support for the counterattacks and  counterstrikes of other echelons and reserves.    The ultimate scope of this undoubtedly important effort in  employing the "remodeled" and reinforced missile-artillery  potential of the Serb army in Bosnia-Herzegovina embraces the  three applications of the armed forces:    -- Regrouping, which means that hostilities of medium and  high intensity have broken out, and it is necessary to prevail  by maneuvering and having great arms power (precisely aimed);    -- Anticipation, which means maneuvering to prevent an  outbreak of hostilities, by developing all the available  "precision-guided ammunition";    -- Deterrence, which means making the enemy (without  starting  one's own forces from their stationary positions) refrain from  any war activities or combat activities of great intensity, as  they would be destroyed by the Serb artillery-missile equipment.    The ultimatum to the Serbs can therefore be viewed as having  several levels. By claiming to protect the Muslims, NATO is  actually thinking of its own skin -- and armor.</p>

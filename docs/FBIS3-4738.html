			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, February 27 (KCNA) -- The Central  Committee of the South Korean National Democratic Front  (Hanminjon) published a manifesto on February 23 calling upon  the South Korean people to check and frustrate the moves of the  U.S. imperialist aggressors and the Kim Yong-sam traitorous  group who are bringing dark clouds of nuclear war on the pretext  of the fictitious "nuclear problem of the North", the  Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation reported.    The manifesto branded Kim Yong-sam, a pro-American sycophant  traitor and warmaniac, as a war servant driving to the extremes  in the van the crisis of a war that might impose more hideous  national calamities than the tragedy of national division upon  the Korean nation which has been subjected to national  misfortunes and hardships, falling a victim to the games of  outside forces.    The basic target of the anti-war, anti-nuke struggle is the  U.S. aggression forces, it says, stressing the need to kindle  fiercer flames of the national-salvation struggle cross South  Korea for the withdrawal of the U.S. imperialist aggression  forces trying to force a nuclear war and their nuclear weapons  under the banner of anti-U.S. independence.    It also calls for further expanding the struggle against Kim  Yong-sam, a dyed-in-the-wool pro-American sycophant traitor and  heinous war fanatic.    The manifesto stresses:    The "suspected nuclear development of the North" is a  fiction  invented with the wicked intention of finding an excuse for  blocking a peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula,  increasing the tensions there and unleashing a war against the  North.    All the people who really love the country and the nation  and  want national reunification should reject the fiction of  "suspected nuclear development" of the North, oppose the  campaign for pressure on the North and decisively rise in  struggle to smash the scheme for "international cooperation  system", a treacherous act of dependence on outside forces,  transcending the difference in ideology, idea, system and  affiliation.    The anti-war, anti-nuke struggle with main stress on the  anti-U.S., anti-Kim Yong-sam struggle can be crowned with a  brilliant victory only when it is developed into a mass struggle  involving all the classes, strata and forces opposed to war and  aspiring after peace.</p>

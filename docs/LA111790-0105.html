			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS STAYING OFF EXPENSIVE FREE-AGENT TRACK;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: CLUB LOOKS WITHIN, IN AN ATTEMPT TO INCREASE PRODUCTION AND WIN  ONE-RUN GAMES.  </P> <P> The "glaring holes" found by Richard Brown in his two weeks as the Angels'  president and chief executive officer probably won't be filled by high-profile  free agents.  </P> <P> Brown said Friday the Angels have not initiated talks with any free agents, or  with players who might become new-look free agents and could be signed without  costing their new team a draft pick.  </P> <P> He acknowledged his interest is piqued by New York Yankee reliever Dave  Righetti and by Minnesota Twin third baseman Gary Gaetti -- who may be a  new-look free agent -- but said building from within is his goal, if possible.  </P> <P> "My philosophy is to build on scouting and the minor leagues, then trades and  then free agents," Brown said. "Signing new-look free agents is a matter of  money, and the list hasn't been finalized. . . . We're trying to fill holes as  well as we can and as expeditiously as we can. I can't wait until March to pull  the trigger on trades. Looking at all free agents, I'm loath to sign Type-A  players because that means giving up two first-round draft picks. Our first  approach is to look to the minor leagues to see who's coming."  </P> <P> The Angels' farm system isn't likely to come up with the power-hitting third  baseman or slick-fielding second baseman Brown would like to have. He said  Bobby Rose is "on the path" to becoming the club's regular second baseman but  might not be ready; he also said third baseman Jack Howell's declining offense  is a problem, especially with Brown's desire to increase Angel production.  </P> <P> "We scored a few more runs in 1990, but timely hitting and one-run games were  the keys," Brown said. "Teams that win pennants win one-run games. In 1989, we  were well above .500 (33-21 in one-run games), but this year, we were just  around .500 (23-21). By having Dave Winfield all year, that's going to help in  that department."  </P> <P> Brown said that only starting pitchers Mark Langston, Jim Abbott, Kirk  McCaskill, Chuck Finley and Bert Blyleven are not expendable, and that he is  trying to sign first baseman Wally Joyner to a long-term agreement. Brown  intends to re-sign free-agent infielder Donnie Hill and outfielder Max Venable  and hasn't precluded a return by designated hitter Brian Downing. Should Chili  Davis be granted new-look free agency and sign with another team, Brown said  Downing might be re-signed. If Davis stays, Downing's chances would decrease.  </P> <P> Brown confirmed that several clubs have expressed interest in Dante Bichette,  who faded in the second half of the season after he lost his starting job.  However, Brown said Bichette and center fielder Devon White have too much  promise to be easily surrendered.  </P> <P> "Some players I view as unexpendable would be expendable if the right deal came  along," Brown said. "Do I trade one of our promising outfielders to fill a hole  elsewhere? The answer has to be yes, but you have to look at the relative worth  of the deal. I've rarely seen a player with as much potential as Devon White.  Are we happy that he hit .217? No. Some people also realize their potential  elsewhere. I hope he realizes it here. But I can't sit on potential. Potential  doesn't win pennants."  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Former Angel Darrell Miller has been hired as the club's director of community  relations. . . . Richard Brown, the Angels' president and chief executive  officer, said that despite the sale of the triple-A franchise in Edmonton,  Canada, the Angels will almost certainly renew their affiliation with the  Trappers.  </P></p>

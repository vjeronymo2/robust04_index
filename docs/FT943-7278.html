			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Observer: Anchors away Rear-admiral Allison Madueke - just sacked as chief of staff of the Nigerian navy - will no doubt look back with nostalgia on his nine months in the job. An Ibo who once fought on the rebel side in the Biafran war, he probably relished his staff mansion in Lagos's exclusive Ikoyi suburb. Not that running Nigeria's navy is particularly demanding, aside from receiving visiting warships from Brazil. It might be the largest navy in west Africa but has never had to fire a shot in anger. Of the two frigates moored in Lagos, the Obuma is not in operation - except for an annual spin round the harbour - while the Iradu has been undergoing repairs for two years. Perhaps Madueke will get a consolation prize. Local press reports suggest the number two in the regime, General Oladipo Diya, may be the next victim of General Abacha's reshuffle - with Madueke tipped for the job. Lucky him.</p>

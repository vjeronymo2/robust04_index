			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A recent episode of "21 Jump Street" involved the issue of racism. It was so  brilliantly written and performed that I simply don't believe it can be  equaled. My reasons for giving this review are simple. Ever since I was old  enough to understand topics such as prejudice or racism (which unfortunately  for me was at a very young age), I have always tried to distance myself. To me,  the hate was a disease. Catch the disease and you're hooked. I just couldn't  understand how men could hate each other solely on the basis of looks and  beliefs. Even now at the age of 16, I still have problems coping with it. I  admit that I still have a long way to go and a lot to learn, but it helps to  know that I am not alone. My compliments to the cast and crew of "21 Jump  Street" and Fox Broadcasting for their efforts in bringing this issue to the  public's attention.  </P> <P> Parham Eshraghian, Huntington Beach  </P></p>

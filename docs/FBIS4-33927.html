			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ciro Ortega from the "RPC Television News" </F> newscast]    [Text] The issue of the budget cutbacks, which will  negatively affect all government institutions, is being studied  at the Palace of the Herons for the second consecutive day. A  special cabinet meeting to continue discussing the issue was  held this afternoon. Planning Minister Delia Cardenas said she  thought the situation was not so grim.    [Begin Cardenas recording] It amounts to a $198-million  budget cutback. This, however, is not a Greek tragedy. Do  recall that I told you we had invested $409 million last year  and the we still have $412 million. I hope the $412 million is  invested as budgeted. [end recording]    Delia Cardenas reported that every minister and his economic  analysts have evaluated the priorities in their work programs  and that the cutbacks would be made where they caused the least  damage to national interests. The special cabinet meeting is  basically studying the programs to be suspended and will approve  or disapprove them. Cardenas added that the National Economic  Council will meet with the National Assembly Budget Commission  members next week to evaluate the situation.    Education Minister Marco Alarcon commented on the situation  and said that several education programs will be negatively  affected by this action:    [Begin Alarcon recording] The [Education Ministry] cutback  will amount to approximately $7.5 million and will have a very  negative impact on the entire education sector. We will be  unable to meet the demands for new classrooms. The computer  education program will have to be brought to an almost complete  standstill and will not advance at the speed we wanted it to,  and we will not -- this is very important -- be able to repair  and maintain existing schools. Also, it will be very difficult  for us to cover the school furniture deficit. [end recording]    The budget cutbacks are the result of loan curtailments by  the International Financial Institutions. Those organizations  will implement this measure because Panama did not comply with  several conditions for the loans, such as the approval of laws  to deal with electricity pilfering at the IRHE [Institute of  Hydraulic Resources and Electrification], the elimination of  special retirements, the implementation of the privatization  process, and the reduction of government payrolls, among others.    As they arrived at the Palace of the Herons, all the  ministers pointed out that, although the budget cutbacks will  limit the government's projections, they will not be so decisive  that they tarnish the work carried out by the Endara  administration.</p>

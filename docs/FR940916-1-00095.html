			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The definition of ``train brake system monitoring'' also introduces a new concept. FRA proposes to require railroads to develop and implement procedures to be used by the engineer to monitor the en route performance and status of the train brake system. FRA believes that these procedures will encourage railroads to take advantage of new sensor technology that can both increase safety and reduce operating costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of ``power brake defect'' is critical to a railroad's ability to take advantage of the incentives allowing trains to travel greater distances between required train brake system tests. For purposes of &sect;232.311 ``power brake defect'' is intended to be any condition of equipment not in compliance with this Part that could cause the retarding force applied by the power brake system of the train to be reduced that is found by FRA or state inspectors on a train declared ready for departure by the operating railroad. Power brake defects include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Brake rigging that binds or fouls;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) A brake that does not apply or does not release;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Piston travel that is outside limits;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) A brake shoe or pad that is worn past limits;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) A brake shoe or pad that is damaged or missing;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) A brake shoe or pad that is over-ridden;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) An end-of-train device that is not installed or not functioning correctly;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) A car that is past due for a scheduled periodic freight brake test or single car test; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) A failure to perform a Class 1 or Class 2 brake test when required. One defect for each car on which the test was not performed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Understanding the way FRA defines ``power brake defect ratio'' for the purpose of these proposed rules is crucial to railroads wishing to take advantage of the proposed incentives to allow trains to travel greater distances between required train brake system tests. The testimony provided by the railroads reflected a strong plea to FRA to develop train brake system performance requirements. However, this appeal was invariably general. No railroad proposed specific performance requirements for train brake systems. The definition of ``power brake defect ratio'' forms the basis for a strong performance-related incentive to the railroads. If railroads can limit their power brake defect ratio to specified levels, they may be allowed to operate trains greater distances between required train brake system tests. FRA proposes that a movement of the train need not take place for the power brake defect to be counted against the power brake defect ratio used to qualify the railroad to operate trains longer distances between required brake system tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of ``mountain grade territory'' attempts to address the opinions of several commenters that mountain grade is a function of both grade percentage and grade distance. In addition, FRA believes that the definition of ``mountain grade territory'' should become more stringent as the speed of the train increases. Thus, FRA developed an empirical relationship to define mountain grade territory, which takes into account all three factors. An explanation of the formula to be used in determining mountain grade territory and a graph illustrating its application are contained in Appendix C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definitions of ``Class 1'' and ``Class 2 train brake system tests'' introduce new terminology. The FRA proposes the Class 1 test to fulfill the intent of the existing initial terminal test and the Class 2 test to fulfill the intent of the existing intermediate terminal test. See 49 CFR 232.12, 232.13. This proposed new terminology attempts to eliminate controversy over what is an initial or intermediate terminal. The new terminology allows the tests to be easily imposed at points other than terminal points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Minimum qualifications for supervisors, mechanical and electronic forces, and train crew members responsible for safe operation of train brake systems are another key feature of FRA's proposal. The definitions offered for qualified personnel introduce this important requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 232.7.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section sets forth the procedures for seeking waivers of compliance with the requirements of this rule. Requests for such waivers can be filed by any interested party. In reviewing such requests, FRA conducts investigations to determine if a deviation from the general criteria can be made without compromising or diminishing rail safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 232.9.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> General compliance and recordkeeping requirements are stated in this section. In accordance with the ``use or haul'' language contained in the Safety Appliance Acts and with FRA's general rulemaking authority under the FRSA, FRA proposes that a train, railroad car, or locomotive will be considered ``in use'' prior to departure but after it receives or should have received the necessary tests and inspections required for movement. FRA would no longer necessarily wait for a piece of equipment with a power brake defect to be hauled before issuing a violation, a practice frequently criticized by the railroads. FRA believes that this approach will increase FRA's ability to prevent the movement of defective equipment that creates a potential safety hazard to both the public and railroad employees. FRA does not feel that this approach increases the railroads' burden since equipment should not be operated if it is found in defective condition in the pre-departure tests and inspections, unless permitted by the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This section also clarifies FRA's position that the requirements contained in the proposed rules are applicable to any ``person,'' as broadly defined in &sect;232.11, that performs any function required by the proposed rules. Although various sections of the proposed rule address the duties of a railroad, FRA intends that any person who performs any action on behalf of a railroad or any person who performs any action covered by the proposed rule is required to perform that action in the same manner as required of a railroad or be subject to FRA enforcement action. For example, private car owners and contract shippers that perform duties covered by these proposed regulations would be required to perform those duties in the same manner as required by a railroad.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

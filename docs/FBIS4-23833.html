			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] It seems pressure is building up in Nigeria for  Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of last year's aborted  presidential elections, to make a public appearance. He's gone  into hiding since he declared himself a rightful president at  the weekend, in defiance of General Sani Abacha's military  government. He is now a wanted man with a price on his head,  and there are reports that he is also in bed, suffering from a  heavy cold. But according to the National Democratic Coalition,  Nadeco, which is backing Abiola's campaign, Moshood Abiola could  soon be sticking his neck out again. From Lagos, Sola Odunfa  reports:    [Begin Odunfa recording] There are strong indications that  Chief Moshood Abiola will come out of hiding soon to announce  his next political action and, consequently, give himself up to  the police. The National Democratic Coalition, Nadeco, which  has been actively promoting his cause, said in a statement in  Lagos today that Chief Abiola was, quote, now hail and hearty,  unquote. Nadeco said in the statement, which was signed by its  general secretary, Mr. (Ayo Kpadokun), that Chief Abiola was  currently holding meetings and consultations, and that he would  come out to announce his government and the arrangements for his  sovereign national conference. The statement addressed Chief  Abiola as president, and it called on the international  community to accord him and his government recognition.    Chief Abiola was declared a wanted person last weekend. The  police promised a reward of 50,000 naira, which is about 1,500  pounds sterling, to anyone who can give information on his  whereabouts. The fugitive political leader is believed to be in  Lagos, but the security forces have still not got a clue to his  trail. Political sources hint today that Chief Abiola may make  his public appearance at a rally late next week. The venue and  timing are being kept secret. The closest clue I was offered  was that it would be somewhere in western Nigeria. Chief Abiola  is from Abeokuta in Ogun State, which is next door to Lagos  State. Speculations are that he would like to make his arrest a  public drama, and probably maximize its political benefit to  himself. [end recording]</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M. Shkarban, President of of the Association of </F> Farmers of Ukraine: "`Inexpensive' Fuel"]    [Text] According to the decision of the Cabinet of  Ministers of 9 February 1994, the exchange of farm production  for material-technical resources is foreseen. The concern  "Ukragrotekhservis" will realize this in exchange for the funds  allotted for the financing of the state contract for the  purchase of agricultural production. In particular, it is  foreseen that 28.7 trillion karbovantsi will be used for the  purchase of petroleum products, including 13.3 trillion  karbovantsi for spring field work. From this sum, the Ministry  of Finance has already paid 630 billion karbovantsi to  "Ukragrotekhservis." This concern, which has great advantages in  transportation and tariffs, buying hard currency at a fixed rate  (12,610 karbovantsi per dollar), for the use of state resources  for wheat storage and processing enterprises, would have to do  this so that charges would not exceed 50 percent of the customs  cost of the fuel. Therefore "Ukragrotekhservis" raised the price  for petroleum products and gets 4.3 trillion karbovantsi for  this from the producers, including 2.5 trillion karbovantsi for  gasoline. This happened because the ratio of prices for so  called "inexpensive" fuel is worse than the ratio of prices on  the world market. For example, at the "inexpensive" wholesale  price for diesel fuel of 3.9 million karbovantsi per tonne and  the starting cost of grain at 1.29 million karbovantsi per  tonne, the ratio becomes approximately one to three, while on  the world market it is one to 1.5 (in the commercial structures  of Ukraine, one to 2.12).    Reference to the point that, supposedly, the ratio of one to  three will be lowered by future indexation is baseless, since  there is no guarantee that, with the change in the price for  grain as a result of indexation, the price for fuel will not  also change at the same time.    In our view, it would be better if the state paid in advance  with funds allotted in the budget (on the basis of a futures  agreement) for the full price, equivalent to the world price,  that part of the contract, which the producer transfers to the  state as a pledge for the future harvest.    The agricultural producers have to consider seriously  everything while making contracts for the sale of grain,  sunflower and sugarbeet, so that another robbery of the  villagers by state structures will not take place.</p>

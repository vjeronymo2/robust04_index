			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> A trade publication reports that Litton Industries Inc. is interested in buying  Norden Systems, the United Technologies Corp. division that makes military  radar systems. A report in the most recent issue of Electronics News said  Litton, based in Beverly Hills, is looking into buying Norden to improve  Litton's market position with the military. Officials at UTC, based in  Hartford, Conn., and Litton declined comment on the report. Norden, which has  been up for sale since April, has been unprofitable for more than two years.  </P></p>

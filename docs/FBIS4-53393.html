			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- Indonesia cannot hope to achieve  harmonious industrial relations unless it is willing to give its  workers more political power, a top union official says.    Bomer Pasaribu, the secretary-general of the All-Indonesia  Workers Union (SPSI), called for labor reforms that ensure  workers enough power to put them at a par with management.    The present labor system was developed with the purpose of  keeping worker wages low, a factor seen as a prerequisite to  attracting foreign investors, Bomer told a seminar on industrial  relations yesterday.    He implied that union power had been purposefully weakened  to  achieve that goal.    He proposed a new system that ensures industrial democracy  and in turn harmonious industrial relations.    "Democratization of the industrial sector should be  encouraged to put workers in an equal position at the  negotiating table with employers or capital owners" Bomer said.    He cited the lack of democracy as the prime cause of much of  the labor unrest in Indonesia in recent years, including the  workers' protest that turned riotous in Medan, North Sumatera,  last month    But while arguing for a system that guarantees workers  freedom to organize, Bomer insisted that workers should unite in  one union, the SPSI, to ensure its effectiveness and strength.    "To strengthen the workers position, they should be unified  in a single organization, SPSI," he said.    He emphasized that the single union concept was a comnitment  made by 23 separate labor organizations which merged into one  federation in 1973.    He claimed that almost all countries in the world have only  one labor union.    SPSI's existence has been widely questioned by many of its  members in recent years, with many expressing disappointment at  its failure in defending their interests.    The creation of the Indonesian Prosperous Labor Unior (SBSI)  two years ago was intended to address these concerns but the  government has refused to recognize it as a legal entity.    SBSI has been blamed for organizing the workers' protests  which disintegrated into rioting in Medan last month.    Bomer proposed that as part of the labor reforms workers  should be given training in effective bargaining strategies to  enable them to better deal with managements.    He said that while the first 25-year development program in  Indonesia produced many large business conglomerations, the  conditions of Indonesian workers have worsened. "It is an irony  that the labor situation is worsening amid the success of  economic development," he said.    Efforts to form unions are appallingly weak, with almost 70  percent of the 147,000 registered manufacturing companies in  Indonesia still without SPSI representatives.    Bomer also acknowledged that collusion between managements  and elected workers' representatives was rife, calling this  another detrimental factor to the progress of workers.</p>

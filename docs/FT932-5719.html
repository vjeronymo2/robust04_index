			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: Hanix files for protection of court HANIX Industry, a Japanese construction machinery manufacturer listed on the country's over-the-counter stock market, has been forced to file for court protection. The move reflects Japan's difficult business conditions and banks' cautious approach to lending to small companies. Hanix announced it had filed with the Tokyo district court for protection under the corporate rehabilitation law. According to Teikoku Data Bank, a private credit research company, the group's liabilities totalled Y170bn (Dollars 1.54bn). It is the largest group to file for court protection this year. Mr Sakae Hirokawa, president of Hanix, blamed 'malicious credit reports' and allegations of tax evasion for prompting financial institutions and banks to stop loans and financial assistance. Teikoku Data Bank said Hanix's financial balance was eroded by a sharp drop in sales due to the slump in construction market. However, Hanix officials, who had denied rumours of financial problems last week, blamed newspaper reports circulated earlier this month for the company's funding problems. Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), Japan's largest electricity utility, is to issue a three-year straight bond worth Y150bn. It will be the largest issue by a Japanese company on the domestic corporate bond market. The move comes as uncertainty over bond yields has heightened after a recent slump in the country's government bond market. A recent rush of corporate bond issues has also created an over-supply on the straight bond market. Tepco, however, said the size of the flotation would not be a problem due to the relatively short maturity. The issue, lead-managed by Nomura Securities, will carry a coupon rate of 4 per cent, and will be issued at 99.8 per cent of par.</p>

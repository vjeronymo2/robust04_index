			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Vickers There is no doubt that Rolls-Royce Motor Cars needs the sort of supply agreements being discussed with Mercedes-Benz in order to spread its costs and risk. The question is whether Vickers' strategy for the business needs a complete overhaul rather than a bit of tinkering. Because of the specialist nature of its limited model range, Rolls-Royce's sales are always likely to be more volatile than those of broader-based manufacturers. This nearly proved the group's undoing during the recession, when Rolls-Royce careered into the red. Since then Rolls-Royce's break even point has been halved to 1,300, which represents under 40 per cent of its peak sales in 1990. So the chance of the subsidiary once again threatening the life of the parent has been dramatically reduced, if not eliminated completely. Rolls-Royce is now back in profit and, once US sales recover, profits should ramp up rapidly - analysts estimate that every car sold above the break even point will generate up to Pounds 50,000 of profit. Yet this does not mean that Vickers is the best place for Rolls-Royce, which should be worth more to a larger luxury car group. After all the pain, Vickers has firmly declared its resolve to retain the business. Given its recovery prospects, most believe the group would find it hard to accept even the most generous offer now. But then, that is just what they thought about British Aerospace and Rover, until BMW drove by.</p>

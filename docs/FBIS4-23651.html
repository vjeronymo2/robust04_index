			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by De Wet Potgieter] </F>   [Text] Police are investigating a case involving more than  15,000 European tourists who have entered the country over the  past few months but have not yet left. They are apparently  illegally in the country. This has led to rumors of secret  plans to establish an underground "national army" of  international freedom fighters, with close links to neo-Nazis,  in South Africa. Concern has been expressed at the activities  of Dutch citizens, Germans, and Croats, as well as the notorious  far-right skinheads seen in the Transvaal rural areas.    A European organization Voorpost [Outpost], with its South  African branch Voorpos, allegedly plays a role in recruiting  members, as does the far-right Afrikaner Nasionaal-Sosialiste  [Afrikaner National-Socialists] (ANS), in which Mrs. Monica  Huggett is involved. The police have confirmed that Mrs.  Huggett, a former member of the Wit Kommando [White Commando]  and self-confessed member of the American Ku Klux Klan, met  three Germans at the Jan Smuts Airport in January after their  arrival from Europe and even gave them lodging for a while.    One of the Germans was later killed in a shoot-out with  police and the other two were arrested. The former Vlakplaas  commander, Lieutenant Colonel Eugene de Kock, currently in  detention on charges relating to alleged Third Force activities,  was present during the shoot-out outside Pretoria. He said in a  statement to the police that his presence in the vicinity was a  mere coincidence and thought at one stage that he was the one  under attack.    Two New Zealand mercenaries in AWB [Afrikaner Resistance  Movement] uniforms were also arrested in Johannesburg this week,  carrying illegal weapons.</p>

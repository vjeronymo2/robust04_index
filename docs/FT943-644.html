			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: GA loses life insurance 'tie' with North of England General Accident, the composite insurer, is to lose its ability to sell life insurance products through North of England Building Society from the end of this week. The ending of the 'tie' - by which North of England sold GA Life products through its branch network - is a result of the society's merger with Northern Rock Building Society, which will create the tenth largest society. Northern Rock is tied to Legal &amp; General for life insurance products, and financial services regulation means that the merged society is not allowed to maintain ties with both insurers. Though Northern Rock is keeping the relationship with L&amp;G at present, the move comes against a background of shifting patterns of alliances between life insurers and societies. Some of the very largest societies, including Halifax and Nationwide, have announced plans to set up their own life insurance subsidiaries. This should give them more control over the products sold, and should also be more profitable than merely taking commission from a life company. Some insurers also think the relationships must change. Mr Bill Jack, general manager of GA Life, said earlier this year that greater transparency should be introduced. Ties between life insurers and banks and societies had not sufficiently benefited customers in the past, he added. GA Life said yesterday that it was 'disappointing' to lose the relationship with North of England, but that it aimed to remain a significant force in terms of links with societies. It is tied to eight others, though most of them are smaller than North of England. Building societies produced about 10 per cent of its business, it said. GA Life's link with North of England goes back only a year. Before then, the society had acted as an independent financial adviser, able to sell life and pensions policies from any product provider.</p>

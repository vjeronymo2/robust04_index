			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Baghdad, 30 May (INA)--Two Iraqi newspapers  have asserted that the speech the agent King Fahd delivered to  the pilgrims revealed the stupidity and ignorance of this  humiliated servant and disclosed the extent of his enmity, his  persistence in following evil paths, and his departure from the  principles and directives of Islam.    In two articles published today, AL-THAWRAH and AL-QADISIYAH  explain that this man [King Fahd], who frequents brothels, bars,  and gambling lounges, drank too much wine before addressing the  delegations' heads and members.    AL-THAWRAH, the mouthpiece of the Arab Socialist Ba'th  Party,  says that Fahd not only lost his awareness and balance, but also  his memory, so he no longer recalls anything but his own dilemma  and his comprehensive political and financial difficulties.  [passage omitted]    The paper asserts that all the bribes and grants given by  the  rulers of Kuwait to continue the unfair blockade on Iraq will  not benefit them and will not prevent the fragmentation and  erosion of this blockade, at which time Fahd will only be left  with disgrace, shame, and history's curse.    AL-QADISIYAH says: It was not strange for the Saudi rulers  to take this position on the Arab nation's issues. This is  because Saudi Arabia's very existence is only a colonialist  creation whose duty is to place obstacles in the way of any  effort to pool the nation's resources and employ them in the  service of the Arab people's objectives. [passage omitted]    The paper is not surprised by the position of the agent Fahd  at the end of the pilgrimage season and by his abuses against  Iraq and its people. It says: It is not strange for this  regime to work for the internationalization of an internal  Yemeni affair and deny the legitimate Yemeni authorities their  right to fight the rebellious secessionists and those who  encroached upon legitimacy.</p>

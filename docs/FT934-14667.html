			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Basics for industrial strategy Sir, In their report, ('Minister agrees to study CBI demands on policy', October 13) Roland Rudd and Tim Burt referred to Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, saying he might consider issuing a white paper setting out the government's industrial objectives. As nobody in industry knows where the government is going, the sooner he gets on with it the better. The report also referred to Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, asking the government for a co-ordinated coherent policy for manufacturing and industry. May I suggest that Mr Davies reads the earlier published national strategy document of the UK Industrial Group, titled 'Manufacture or Die'. In this, the UK Industrial Group clearly sets out the fundamental economic requirement of Pounds 40bn of extra industrial output to resolve the problem. It would be more productive for the CBI to use its cosy relationship with the government to address that issue, rather than simply ask for more of what the government is already giving. David A Turnbull, director-general, The UK Industrial Group, 7th floor, Victoria House, Victoria Road, Aldershot, Hampshire GU11 1JJ</p>

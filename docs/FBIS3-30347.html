			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jagodina, Feb 1 (TANJUG) -- Assembly President of  the Serbian Republic (RS) Momcilo Krajisnik on Tuesday said  there was not a single soldier from the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia [FRY] on the territory of the state of the Bosnian  Serbs and the RS was not receiving any arms from the F.R.Y.    Krajisnik said on Radio Jagodina (central Serbia) that the  RS  leadership "most categorically denies the reports circulating in  U.S. circles that Army of Yugoslavia (VJ) units are crossing  into the RS armed or unarmed to fight on the Serb side in the  war in Bosnia-Herzegovina."    Co-chairman of the international conference on the former  Yugoslavia Thorvald Stoltenberg said in New York on Monday there  was no evidence that there were Army of Yugoslavia troops in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Krajisnik said it was true that the Muslim side had declared  a longlasting war on the Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats. He  said the Bosnian Serbs were preparing to defend their territory,  and the RS supreme command had proclaimed a (general)  mobilization on Monday to that end.    "Our mobilization should be understood as a preventive  response to the Muslim side's commitment to a longlasting war,"  Krajisnik said. He set out that the purpose of the mobilization  was, among other things, to distribute the burden of the war  among all RS citizens.    Krajisnik said he would meet again soon at Sarajevo airport  with Bosnian Muslim Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic.    "The purpose of our meeting will be to replace the war  option  with a negotiating one, and I hope the meeting will be  successful so that we could have concrete results in Geneva on  February 10 (in the resumption of the peace talks)," Krajisnik  said.</p>

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Letter: Horton's changes in the interests of BP Sir, In the examination of Robert Horton's resignation from BP, people may naturally focus on the reasons for his departure and not on his achievement. However it took great personal courage to set a radical course for the company towards a more productive workplace; one with dignity, meaning and community. Mr Horton was no doubt aware of the personal risk this involved, yet he accepted it willingly. Through his leadership, BP has set an example for a much needed change in western business. That the process of change has been reaffirmed after his departure is a tribute to his choice to act in the interest of BP, not of himself. We should remember that. Steb Fisher, (former BP employee and member of Project 1990 team), 15 Poplar Grove, London W6 7RF</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nguyen Ngoc Tuan, economic specialist at the Ho </F> Chi Minh City Center for Social Sciences and the Humanities]    [Excerpts] Socialism does not differ from capitalism in the  formulas used to operate or regulate the economy but in the  system of ownership of the basic means of production and the  distribution system appropriate to this. In Vietnam today, we  have just developed a commodity economy and so the production  forces have low standards and development is not balanced. But  the ownership model has certain special characteristics: a. The  capital concentrated in the hands of the state in the form of  state-owned enterprises [Footnote 1] is dispersed among the  sectors and regions. In reality, this is divided among the  sectors and regions. b. Ownership rights to the assets at the  state-owned enterprises are not clear. c. The asset ownership  rights of the state and the commercial rights of the enterprises  have been merged. Because of this, the ownership model has been  made single too soon, and it is not in accord with a commodity  economy or the standards of the production forces, with the  result that the state enterprises lack vitality. It is difficult  for them to respond promptly in the face of market changes.  Approximately 70 percent have encountered many difficulties  (they are operating at a loss, debts are piling up, assets are  depreciating, there is a lack of capital, and so on). It is  difficult for capital to move from sectors and regions with poor  results to sectors and regions with good results in order to  improve the economic results of all of society.    Given the specific conditions mentioned above, how should  the  state enterprise model be renovated? It can be said that this is  a key point in the theory of a socialist commodity economy and  the central element in the renovation of our country's economy  system. In this article, I want to contribute ideas on this  issue.  The ineffectiveness of the traditional state enterprise  model and the historical roots of this. [passage omitted]  <H5>  The contract enterprise model--strengths and weaknesses. </H5>   In this historical search, many countries have vacillated to  the point of forgetting the principles, jumping from one side to  the other and from "nationalization" to privatization, with the  result that they have suffered economic defeats and political  collapse. Some countries, however, have resolutely adhered to  the basic guiding principles and "tied the eternal to the  ephemeral." As a result, they have scored major victories in  renovation and gained international recognition.    In our country, renovation of the state enterprise model got  underway later, but in recent years, this model has undergone  notable changes. The state has given up some of its powers,  strengthened the rights of the state enterprises, greatly  reduced the legal plans and norms and expanded the use of  guiding plans and norms, and started collecting taxes instead of  appropriating enterprise profits. Today, the state has switched  to a "contract enterprise" model on a broad scale. The  commercial assets of the enterprises are being evaluated based  on the actual assets of the enterprise, rational profit levels  are being determined, and norms to increase the assets,  bonus-fine norms for the use of the assets, and profit-sharing  norms in capital business are being established. At the same  time, tests are being conducted in decentralizing state  ownership at a number of state enterprises based on the "public  enterprise" model.    As compared with previously improved state enterprise  models,  the "contract enterprise" model has several positive effects.  Above all, this gives the enterprises greater independence with  respect to managing and using the assets in accord with the  laws. This encourages the laborers to pay attention to the  results of the labor of both individuals and the collective  (because their interests and income are tied to fulfilling or  exceeding the contract norms). This encourages the enterprises  to make production and the internal structure more efficient,  provides a stable source of revenues for the state, and so on.  However, this also has basic weaknesses:    This does not separate ownership functions from commercial  functions, and because of this it does not eliminate direct  interference by the administrative apparatus in the commercial  production activities of the enterprises (in many cases, a  number of localities and sectors even include their own tasks  and contracts, which generates even greater interference). As  Marx pointed out more than 100 years ago, capitalist commodity  production will give rise to a wide gap between private  ownership rights and command labor. Thus, capitalists do not  have to be responsible for command labor. The person who owns  the musical instruments of an orchestra, for example, does not  have to be the conductor of that orchestra. The realities of our  country show that the reason why enterprises outside the state  sector are thriving is not because they have the "favor" of the  state but because they have adequate commercial independence and  are rarely subject to direct administrative interference.    This does not solve the problem of enterprises taking  responsibility for profits and losses. To make up the losses, an  enterprise must either use some of its existing capital or  increase the price of its products. But no enterprise has  sufficient existing capital to do this. And if an enterprise  raises prices, how can it sell its goods, particularly at a time  when cheap imports are being smuggled into the country in huge  quantities?    The contracts cannot be met when outside factors (such as  exchange rates, profit margins, prices, transportation  conditions, the supply of raw materials, and energy) change.    This makes it difficult for the production factors to  change,  because the contract factors in the contract period do not  change, it is difficult to change the payments, and the  dependent relationship does not change. Furthermore, if a number  of enterprises are achieving little or even suffering losses,  all that needs to be done is to improve the situation a little  and they can survive and keep from being disbanded. Clearly,  this will block improving the results of all of society.    Because of the above weaknesses, even though the "contract  enterprise" model is still attractive, in my view, in the future  it will not be the best enterprise model in socialist ownership  conditions.  <H5>  Switch to an equity enterprise model </H5>   For a long time prior to the sixth party congress, we  mistakenly thought that the equity enterprise model was a  separate sphere of capitalism and that this served capitalism.  We thought that developing an equity economy would lead to  privatization and smash the public ownership system, the  foundation of socialism. Actually, the seed of an equity economy  has existed since Roman times. By the first half of the 17th  century, particularly after equity companies in England were  legally recognized as independent legal persons, the first  relatively stable equity corporations appeared consisting of  shareholders and long-term investors. They could not withdraw  their capital, but they had the right to transfer and trade  shares. During the period 1820-1830, because of the requirements  of the industrial revolution and the needs in building national  markets, much capital was needed to build an infrastructure  (relying just on the capital of individual capitalists would not  have provided sufficient capital). Because of this, a number of  equity corporations (such as railroad, mining, and power  corporations) came into being and expanded quickly in Europe and  America. Now, equity enterprises have become a widespread  organizational model in many countries, particularly in the  economically developed countries. In England, in 1862 there were  only 165 equity corporations. By 1890, the number had risen to  4,066 and by 1962 the number was 428,000, of which the majority  were limited equity corporations. In the United States, in 1904  only 23.6 percent of the enterprises were equity corporations.  By 1947, this percentage had risen to 69 percent, and by 1962  the percentage had risen to 78 percent. Today, the United States  has more than 1.2 million equity corporations.    When studying the equity enterprise model under the  capitalist system, Marx said that in an equity corporation,  private ownership rights are separate from asset control rights,  and these control rights are turned over to the "united  laborers," that is, society. Through the equity enterprise  system, the assets of the private capitalists invested in the  corporation are transformed into direct social assets. From  that, Marx concluded that the equity system will do away with  private capital. As the equity economy expands and penetrates  deeper and deeper into new production sectors, it will eliminate  private capital more and more. This is a purely transitional  point leading to a new form of production (meaning socialist  production).    Viewed in this way, the equity enterprise model is not the  product of capitalism. It is both the product of a commodity  economy and the condition for expanding the commodity economy  and expanding large-scale production and socialization. The  striking characteristic--and also a strength--of the equity  enterprise model is that it separates ownership rights from  commercial rights, it separates administrative management from  commercial management, and it really transforms the enterprises  into relatively independent producers who are commercially  independent, who are responsible for the profits and losses, and  who are responsible for their own development. Under the equity  system, the production rights of the enterprise are determined  by the enterprise, and the share rights of the state and other  shareholders are all equal. As the manager of society, the state  collects taxes, and as an owner, it shares in the profits. Thus,  the state will not have to concern itself with managing the  enterprises as it did in the past. Because of this, it can  concentrate its efforts on such things as formulating projects,  setting guidelines for the growth of the sectors, monitoring and  inspecting things, gathering information, and so on. Enterprise  managers will be selected by the shareholders. They will form a  management board to control the use, preservation, and growth of  the capital and to ensure that better and better use is made of  the capital. Implementing the equity enterprise model is an  effective way to improve the isolated state enterprise model,  create a competitive market system, encourage adequate  competition, put an end to dividing state-owned assets by sector  and region, and create channels for easily transferring  production factors. With the equity enterprise model, the  profitable enterprises will be able to issue and sell shares in  order to expand production. As for those enterprises that are  operating at a loss, because share prices will be low, they will  go bankrupt or be taken over by other enterprises. This means  that the sources of social strength will be integrated in an  optimum way, and the results of the entire economy will improve.    Based on the above analysis, I think that the equity  enterprise model should be the main guideline for renovating the  ineffective state enterprise model in our country. Naturally,  this model cannot reject the necessary existence of the state  economic sector consisting of non-competitive state enterprises  and enterprises that have a decisive effect on the national  welfare and the people's livelihood and that maintain production  stability and stabilize the markets. With respect to these  enterprises, the state has a monopoly on investment for  expansion and on control of production and markets.    The path of equitization in our country today is not one of  turning private capital into social capital as under capitalism  but one of restructuring the state enterprise model based on  switching from absolute ownership by the state in which there is  no competition to pluralistic ownership by society in which  there is competition. At the same time, this will solve the  problem of separating the ownership rights of the state from the  commercial rights of the enterprises, eliminate direct  administrative interference by authorities in commercial  production, and eliminate domination and division of state-owned  assets among the sectors and regions. At the microcosmic level,  this will improve the production structure of the enterprises,  accumulate capital, and strengthen vitality for production, and  at the macrocosmic level, this will improve the traditional  production system throughout society and effectively integrate  national assets in order to improve economic results in general.    If we are to solve these two fundamental problems, we must  not follow the privatization path of Western economists, who say  that to develop a commodity economy, you must carry on  privatization, develop a private economy, and then, when the  private economy has accumulated capital, sell the state-owned  enterprises to them and then equitize them. And we can't follow  the path of shared-ownership enterprises, in which the  state-owned assets are divided between the state and the  enterprises. That would be unfair (because the assets of an  enterprise are not created just by the labor of the workers and  civil servants at that enterprise), and it would actually be  harmful. In my view, the acceptable path is:    1. A state-owned asset management system must be built from  the central central echelon to the localities. This must be  independent of the state administrative management system.  State-owned asset management rights must be separated from  social administrative management rights, and the economic  functions of the state must be directed toward the main tasks  mentioned above. Only in this way will it be possible to  maintain the independence and vitality of the enterprises, and  thanks to this, the socialist system of public ownership will be  solidified.    2. Under the unified control of the various-echelon  state-owned asset management system, state-owned asset  commercial corporations having a competitive nature must be  built. These commercial corporations will not directly control  or use the assets, but as owners, their function will be to  monitor the use of the assets by the enterprises within the  corporation.    3. After separating the two rights, pluralizing the  ownership  of the assets of the state enterprises, and building competitive  markets, the large corporations and equity groups must actively  be expanded and tied to each other with respect to occupations  or products without regard to administrative boundaries in order  to gradually establish social equity groups that are capable of  carrying on commercial activities effectively and that have  competitive strength on the markets. At the same time, an effort  must be made to spread propaganda and guide people having  capital (including cadres and workers) or social mass  organizations in buying shares of the enterprise in order to  attract the idle capital among the masses, reduce currency  pressures on the markets, transform the idle capital into useful  capital, and encourage the formation of a socialized investment  mechanism and a pluralistic production structure.    The widespread implementation of the equity enterprise model  requires that the necessary conditions be prepared:    There must be a fundamental change in viewpoint concerning  socialist ownership, an equity economy, and the equity  enterprise model. In guiding equitization, by sticking to 51  percent equity ownership in an enterprise, not only will the  state control the assets of that enterprise but it will also  control other assets, which will enable the socialist ownership  system to be solidified and expanded. Even if private  individuals own a majority of the shares in a number of state  enterprises, that will not be a problem, because even though the  state-owned assets may have changed with respect to material  form, they will not decline in value, and the state will recover  capital for investment in other enterprises. This will improve  the investment structure and benefit the expansion of the  country's important projects.    The state-owned assets must be evaluated, and there must be  rational measures to allocate these assets by ownership level in  order to transform the absolute ownership rights of the state  into the plural ownership rights of society.    The market system and market mechanisms must be improved.  This includes the various production factors (such as capital,  labor strength, technical materials, and information). Steps  must be taken to enable input factors to move easily throughout  society.    Prices and profit margins among the sectors must gradually  be  "marketized," and prices must be regarded as a function of  market supply and demand in order to ensure fair competition  between enterprises.    The financial and national tax systems must be improved, and  budget revenues and expenditures must be tied closely to each  other. Tax measures that will benefit fair competition and  stimulate production must be implemented. The tax collection and  after-tax profit laws used by the ownership echelons must be  relied on. Smuggling must be dealt with appropriately.    Ranks of equity enterprise and corporation leaders who know  how to manage business and who have a thorough knowledge of  markets, particularly bond markets and international markets,  and the business principles of equity enterprises must be built.    Unemployment and unemployment insurance measures managed by  the state and housing measures managed by the cadres and workers  must be implemented in order to simplify the targets of the  enterprises and help the enterprises reach the markets.</p>

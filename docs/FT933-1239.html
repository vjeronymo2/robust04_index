			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities resilient to new uncertainties NEW uncertainties in Russia, together with discouraging corporate developments at home, made for an erratic trading session in a London market which barely managed to hold on to the Footsie 3,000 mark yesterday. Firmness in the US dollar continued to help international stocks, where the pharmaceuticals sector held steady following the announcement of the Clinton administration's health care proposals. But among domestic stocks, both food retailers and brewery issues fell back sharply. It was a day of rumour and counter-rumour of developments in Russia. Share prices opened in good form on overnight reports that President Yeltsin appeared to be consolidating his position, but early gains were reversed as unconfirmed rumours of clashes in Moscow reached London, usually to be as swiftly rejected. At best, soon after the opening, the FT-SE 100 Index was nearly 11 points ahead at 3,018.4. However, the shine was quickly taken off the market by disappointing results from the domestic consumer sector, which realerted the stock market's concern over the uncertain recovery in trading per-formance by leading British companies. The 3,000 level was briefly lost again, and it was left to firmness in UK bonds to help the equity market to a steadier tone at the close. Falling yields in the domestic bond markets have provided a base for the latest advance in share prices. The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 at 3,001.3 for a net loss of 6.2. The damage to the consumer sector came largely from disappointing interim profits news from Guinness, which added to the market's unhappiness with discomforting comments at its meeting with City analysts. Food retailers suffered similar misfortunes after Wm Morrison Supermarkets confirmed pressures on the sector's profit margins. Share prices were rapidly marked down across the board, although traders said selling of the brewery issues was not heavy. The market's confidence in the recovery in the domestic economy was challenged from other business sources in the UK. Halifax, a leading building society, described the housing market rally as 'very delicately poised', and United Newspapers said economic recovery remained 'patchy'. However, UK market analysts remained confident that the London stock market was showing great resilience, and succeeding in holding on to the Footsie 3,000 mark. Selling pressure was moderate, according to several leading securities traders, and bargain hunters always appeared ready to enter the market at its daily low points. Lending support to such confidence was an upturn in equity dealing in the final hour of trading, when share prices rallied from earlier losses. Seaq volume finally totalled 713.3m shares, a satisfactory level from the point of view of market profitability. On Wednesday, 670.7m shares were traded through the Seaq network, for a highly satisfactory retail worth of Pounds 1.56bn. The London stock market is now about 3.7 per cent below its trading peak and has this week resisted further losses which would take it to important testing levels. Good levels of retail, or customer, business have indicated that the investment institutions appear to be rebalancing portfolios rather than selling equities.</p>

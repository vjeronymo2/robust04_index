			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: MONROVIA;  </P> <P> ALCOHOL PERMIT REJECTED  </P> <P> The City Council on Tuesday turned down a request for an alcohol sales permit  from a drive-through dairy located 600 feet from an elementary school.  </P> <P> Bob's Dairy had been granted the permit by the city's Planning Commission, but  that decision was appealed by the Monrovia School District, which opposed the  permit because the dairy, at 448 W. Foothill Blvd., is in the neighborhood of  Mayflower Elementary School.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Mary Wilcox said she could not in good conscience approve the  alcohol permit so close to a school. The council voted 4 to 1 to deny the  permit, with Mayor Robert Bartlett dissenting.  </P></p>

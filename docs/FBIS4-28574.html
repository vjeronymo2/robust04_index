			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- President Suharto yesterday spoke in  defense of the big businesses which dominate Indonesian  industry, saying that their critics overlook the major benefits  they bring to the country.    Speaking to about 140 students of cooperative ownership at  his Tapos ranch near here, Suharto said Indonesian big business  provides the capital and management which neither the government  nor the cooperatives can muster, to build some of the giant  projects necessary for development.    "You didn't expect us to wait until we're capable to carry  out the projects did you?" he asked his visitors during a dialog.    He said critics tend to look at the ownerships of these  businesses but completely ignore the benefits they bring, in  terms of products, employment and taxes.    "Surely they must have been beneficial. I can't believe that  they have not," he said citing the examples of textiles and  cement industries in which Indonesia has become self sufficient.    "Let's not look at who owns these corporations. Without them  we'd still be dependent on imports," he said. "The plants  create job opportunities and if they are profitable, then they  are paying taxes."    He gave assurances that the government will make sure that  big corporations will not be allowed to hold monopolies. "We  have ways of doing this," he said.    Suharto cautioned against people demanding the enactment of  an anti-monopoly law, because the constitution acknowledges that  monopolies are permissible if controlled by the government with  the intention of bringing benefits "to as many people as  possible."    The President however stressed that the government remains  committed to the development of cooperatives, which the  constitution regards as one of the country's three economic  pillars along with public and private enterprises.    It is the task of the cooperative's managers to strengthen  their positions before they can be entrusted with big projects,  he said.    He said while the constitution allows for the government to  acquire anything in the name of the people, there is no plan for  the government to attempt to control everything the way  communist countries do.    The group of cooperatives students were the latest guests to  Suharto's ranch, itself often the subject of criticism and  gossip, as the President himself acknowledges.    He said critics often portrayed the ranch as a luxury place  with a palace, helipad, a swimming pool and a golf course.    He said the pool is actually a pond where the cattle drink,  the golf course is grazing land and the helipad is actually a  place where the ranch operators dry coffee and cocoa seeds.    The palace is actually a Joglo (traditional Javanese house)  which he said he bought at an auction after an exhibition in  Jakarta.    The President was accompanied during the tour of the ranch  by  Minister of Cooperatives Subiakto Tjakrawerdaya, Minister of  Youth Affairs and Sports Hayono Isman and acting rector of the  Pajajaran University Tanwir Mukawi.    During the question and answer session, a manager of a  student cooperative in East Kalimantan queried the President's  initiative to compel companies to hand over up to a fifth of  their equity to cooperatives, saying that after the initial  massive publicity, the plan has stopped dead in its tracks.    Suharto responded that the initiative was still much alive  but that there are problems.    "It needs more time," he said.</p>

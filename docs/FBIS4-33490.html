			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Caracas Governor Asdrubal Aguiar has threatened to  use the Armed Forces if a transportation stoppage leaves Caracas  without this public service. He has said if the service is  interrupted, the executive will have no other recourse but to  implement measures to deal with such a contingency. The  transportation sector cannot be permitted to defend its own  rights by harming the community, which has already shown  considerable tolerance to the increase in the cost of living.    Aguiar has said his office has been monitoring the situation  between the mayor's office and Simon Lavera, president of the  Central Federation of Roving and Terminal-Based Passenger  Vehicles, regarding fares. Aguiar has announced that willingly  or unwillingly, the government will prevent the strike with the  resources as provided by the de jure state so the rest of the  community will not be harmed.    [Begin Aguiar recording] We do not have to come up with  emergency measures, which already exist, as do plans utilizing  the Armed Forces and National Guard to tend to these situations.  It will also be necessary to devise complementary measures to  prevent any provocation or pressure. We will study these  measures and be prepared to implement them. [end recording]    Mentioning the high crime rate, Aguiar expressed favor over  organizational measures and announced the National Guard's  cooperation to act in the so-called security areas, while the  police would protect the people with squad cars and motorcycles.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin </F> by Arkadiy Melkonyan at the airport in Sochi "prior to leaving"  on 22 March -- from the "Novosti" newscast--recorded]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Melkonyan] Tell us: You  discussed the budget; what is the ruble's fate, this year at  least?    [Chernomyrdin] I must tell you that we are not supporters of  holding the ruble exchange rate, it -- I mean the dollar rate --  it must be realistic so that we do not crush our exporters.  This we will not do. So, with regard to the budget, we have  just submitted it.    [Melkonyan] But this year...    [Chernomyrdin, interrupting] We have submitted it to the  Duma. We agreed it and worked on it before this. The talks  today and yesterday were, I think my sixth set of talks with the  president during which we stipulated everything: what is in the  budget, what should be given the main emphasis, what we should  not omit, where our main priorities lie. And so we finished  such a budget today, submitted it, and I think that we will work  with this Duma, with this Federation Assembly. We will work and  not just wait for someone to do something or other. We will  work.</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Arts: History brought home - Television Aside from its obvious functions as babysitter to the nation and chewing gum for the eyes, television, it becomes increasingly clear, is a remarkably good purveyor of history. We know from the work of Norma Percy, who has made memorable programmes about the Reykjavik arms talks and the collapse of Soviet communism, and from David Ash's programmes Fall Of The Wall on BBC2 earlier this month, that it is particularly effective with very recent history. We know from Steve Humphries' startling 1991 series A Secret World Of Sex and from his current Thursday night series on BBC2, Forbidden Britain, both dealing with the early decades of this century, that, even when there is awfully little archive film available (as with any social subject around 1900) impressive programmes can still be made. Following the classic example of The World At War, Humphries marries together what picture material he can find with latterday interviews with those who can remember the period. The results can be enthrallingly evocative. But among the most fascinating periods for any of us, surely, is the one that coincides with our birth, so those in their late 40s or early 50s may be particularly drawn to What Has Become Of Us? which covers the middle of the 20th century and begins on Channel 4 tomorrow evening. Presenter Peter Hennessy and producer Rob Shepherd have made a four-part series investigating the attitudes and politics and, most important of all, the feelings which, in the 1940s and 1950s, led to the creation of a British society which was then methodically dismantled in the 1980s and 90s. This opening programme shows that however talented the presenter (and Hennessy has proved himself an excellent television performer, especially in studio discussions) nothing conveys the spirit of a time so vividly as a combination of personal witness and contemporary archive. When Hennessy encapsulates the swing to Labour in 1945 by saying that the bombs had not discriminated between the classes so why should politics, it seems trite. But when those who lived through the war talk about the sense of levelling which arose from such matters as the shared experience of rationing it seems all too credible. The sense of how it felt to be living through that war comes across most strongly from some of Hennessy's older neighbours in Walthamstow. Charmingly  -and sensibly, given that he was born in 1947 - Hennessy goes back to them repeatedly to check on their memories. Like my father who, one night in 1941, ran to the top of Parliament Hill to gaze, mesmerised, at what appeared to be the entire London docks on fire, Marie Creighton describes going up to a high point to watch the blitz: 'There was ships in there and our grub was in 'em'. The idealism fired by the national experience of the war strikes you like a flash of lightning when Jill Craigie shows the opening caption on a film about new towns such as Stevenage made in the late 1940s saying 'This film is made for the peoples of the blitz in the hope that their newly built cities will be worthy of their fortitude'. It is an indication of the degree of cynicism today that such a high moral tone now seems almost comical. Yet such sentiments seemed unremarkable in 1948 because, as Lord Hailsham points out in next week's programme, 'We had ended the war at the top of the world'. The dismantling of the empire had scarcely begun and it seemed only right that the top nation should set about creating a brave new world with a national health service, nationalised industries, universal education, and millions of new homes in new towns to replace those bombed or torn down as slums. If, having evoked the atmosphere of the 1940s and 50s so powerfully, this series really can sling a bridge across the intervening years to bring us into the latter part of the century and show us how and why we have become what we are, it will have done a remarkable job.</p>

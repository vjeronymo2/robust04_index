			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Babangida calls for backing on economy NIGERIAN President Ibrahim Babangida yesterday asked the country's private sector leaders to help the government improve the climate for investment and economic growth before the handover to elected civilian rule, scheduled for August. The appeal comes as rising wage demands in the public sector threaten the government's 1993 targets for spending, further fuelling inflation and money supply growth which are already running at more than 50 per cent annually. Addressing a two-day economic summit in the federal capital, Abuja, Gen Babangida said: 'It would be a rare feat to make a successful transition of democracy with a declining economy.' The summit is seen as a chance to breathe new life into a structural adjustment programme begun in 1986. Gen Babangida has called on Chief Ernest Shonekan, formerly head of Nigeria's largest trading company UAC, to define a mid-term strategy for the economy to open the way to an Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility from the IMF and for rescheduling of Nigeria's large external debts. Chief Shonekan invited business executives to advise the government on the reforms, incentives and policies necessary to attract private sector investment which he said was needed to fund economic growth in real terms of over 5 per cent a year. He said the summit should address ways of improving competition - domestic savings levels, training and technology, a strong financial system, and an adaptable bureaucracy for responsible citizens under the rule of law.</p>

			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Tokyo haggles on economy: Finance Ministry questions figures in stimulatory package JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic party and Finance Ministry officials were last night haggling over the final figures for a stimulatory economic package due to be delivered today, which the LDP insists will total more than Y12,000bn (Pounds 69.7bn). Negotiations have been complicated by recent political scandals which have sidelined Mr Shin Kanemaru and Mr Noboru Takeshita, the LDP powerbrokers who played influential roles in securing the ministry's approval for a Y10,700bn emergency package announced last August. The contents of the fresh package were renegotiated in the light of a recent surge in Tokyo stock prices and after advice from the Economic Planning Agency that a heavy weighting towards infrastructure investment could lead to overheating in some sectors of the economy. But the need for a package was reaffirmed yesterday by the publication of EPA data showing a 15.9 per cent fall year-on-year in private machinery orders during February, the 11th consecutive month of decline. The figures reflect cuts in capital spending by most Japanese manufacturers. Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, head of the LDP panel preparing the new measures, promised yesterday that the total would exceed last year's package. However, Finance Ministry officials say privately that the economy appears to have bottomed out and may not need another large injection of public funds. The ministry concedes the package will be closely watched in Washington. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, prime minister, leaves for the US later this week and will want to bring evidence that the Japanese government is attempting to meet its optimistic forecast of 3.3 per cent growth for the current fiscal year. Mr Miyazawa also plans to tell President Bill Clinton that the two countries should establish a new forum to replace the Structural Impediments Initiative, designed to reduce Japan's current account surplus. The US argues that the slowing of Japanese growth weakened demand for imports and encouraged exports, pushing the trade surplus to a record Dollars 107bn last year. About Y1,000bn in special 'infrastructure' spending in the package will be devoted to the purchase of computers by Japanese educational and medical institutions, and Mr Miyazawa is expected to suggest to Mr Clinton that US companies could win a large share of these contracts. The LDP had debated the introduction of income tax cuts to stimulate consumer demand, particularly weak in recent months, but the Finance Ministry, concerned by declining corporate tax revenue, has argued against the cuts. Instead, special deductions are likely to be announced for education expenses and housing purchases. It is expected that the limit for tax deductions on housing loans will be raised by 20 per cent, which is not enough to satisfy Mr Tetsuro Aki, president of Tokyu Real Estate, who said the housing industry wanted larger concessions to ensure the recovery of a still weak market. The Finance Ministry's concerns about flagging tax income were reflected in its announcement yesterday that gold coins would be minted to commemorate the June wedding of Prince Naruhito, heir to the throne. Ministry officials say Y50bn-Y60bn raised through the issue will go towards paying for a small portion of today's package.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has said that it will  be possible very soon to pump out the oil in the  Karkuk-Yumurtalik for restoration purposes.    Answering reporters' questions at the prime minister's  residence, Ciller said they have been trying to explain to the  world why it is necessary to pump the oil out of the  Karkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline in spite of the embargo imposed  on Iraq, and added: A unity of understanding has been  developing in world public opinion in recent months.    Stressing that the oil pipeline should be considered one of  Turkey's investments, Ciller said: The embargo is not imposed  on Turkey. There is oil in the pipeline and some of that oil  belongs to us. We have to pump out this oil in order to repair,  restore, and conduct maintenance work, and we are explaining  this to the world. In my last visit to the United States, I  discussed this issue. In the past, the issue was being assessed  within the framework of the embargo. I see a slightly different  approach developing now. I am very hopeful on this issue, and I  believe it will be possible to conduct repair work in the near  future.    In answer to a question, Ciller said discussions on the oil  pipeline are being conducted in various circles, including with  the UN secretary general, and added: The world has become a  smaller place. Turkey has led the world in certain issues. We  sided with the human rights issue when Iraq was the aggressor.  That decision was right then, but the decision on the oil  pipeline is the right one for now. The embargo is not imposed  on us, but it is destroying our investments -- millions of  dollars of investments. We cannot allow these investments to be  wasted. The world also should not allow this. I think we have  explained our situation satisfactorily.</p>

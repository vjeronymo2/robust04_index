			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 28 (CNS) -- The financial bonds  valued at RMB 65 billion by the State Development Bank are being  issued smoothly. As of April 25, various financial institutions  have deposited RMB 20 billion specially for subscription of the  first batch of bonds into the bank.    The Development Bank founded last March with a registered  capital of RMB 50 billion is directly under the State Council  and is a policy-oriented bank for the raising of funds and for  the directing of capital for the construction of basic industry,  infrastructural facilities and pillar industries.    President of the bank Mr. Yao Zhenyan said that capital  raised from the bonds would go totally on basic items and  technological renovation under state planning. Of the funds  collected, RMB 60 billion will be for basic construction while  the remaining RMB 5 billion will be used for technological  renovation. The bonds are divided into two kinds with one for a  three-year term bonds are valued at RMB 45.5 billion with an  annual yield of 12.5 percent and the five-year term bonds at RMB  19.5 billion with an annual yield of 14 percent. The  Development Bank will pay principal and interest calculated on  simple interest rate on maturity.    The funds raised on this occasion will mainly be for state  key items such as the Three Gorges Project and the  Beijing-Kowloon railway line. Subscribers are restricted to  state-owned commercial banks and non-banking financial  institutions, all of which have been selected by the People's  Bank of China. They receive an invoice issued by the  Development Bank for the subscription of bonds instead of bonds  themselves.    Mr. Yao said that as the subscription was only confined to  financial institutions, it would have no impact on the financial  market. He noted that the Development Bank would also issue  bonds overseas to raise foreign funds in a bid to broaden the  source and channels of capital to serve the economic build-up at  home.</p>

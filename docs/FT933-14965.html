			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / US-Cuba phone links could mean softer line: Congress is starting to listen to more moderate Cuban voices AT first glance, relations between Cuba and the US have rarely been icier: Cuba's devastated economy is driving more people to flee the country, leading to more shootings by Cuban border guards and a flurry of diplomatic protests from the US. 'Because things are so desperate in Cuba and more people think the end is at hand, there have been more incidents that could provoke tension,' comments Mr Ernest Preeg, former chief economist at the US Agency for International Development and author of a recent study on Cuba's economic prospects once the US trade embargo is lifted. A State Department spokesman last week criticised Cuba's 'barbaric' attacks both on US-registered boats trying to pick up refugees and on swimmers trying to reach asylum in the US Guantanamo naval base, on the island's southeastern coast. This drew a sharp rebuttal from Mr Roberto Robaina, Cuba's foreign minister, who called the US complaint 'an infamy, a provocation and, at the very least, a shameful lack of seriousness'. Telecommunications between Cuba and the US are also at one of their worst levels in years: last year's Hurricane Andrew destroyed AT&amp;T's microwave links from south Florida and Cuba has now sharply cut the volume of US calls it will allow to be routed through Italy. However, the US State Department is preparing new guidelines that could greatly ease telephone links with Cuba and mark a step along what some Cuba experts believe might turn out to be a path towards warmer relations. Significantly, some AT&amp;T officials expect the new guidelines to allow Cuba to take some of the revenue from the telephone calls, instead of freezing it all in an escrow, as happens today. Also indicative of a thaw has been President Fidel Castro's recent decision to allow some prominent dissidents to travel abroad, while last month, in a move that could have far-reaching economic consequences, he asked the national assembly to consider legalising use of the dollar in Cuba. US Cuban policy has always been dominated by an argument over whether to use threats to finish the work of the trade embargo and topple the Castro government, or incentives to bring about change more quickly. In political terms, the former school of thought, expounded by the Cuban-American National Foundation, a well-financed Miami exile group led by Mr Jorge Mas Canosa, has always dominated. It still commands a clear majority in Congress, but has lost some of its strongest supporters, such as Mr Dante Fascell, the Florida congressman who chaired the House of Representatives foreign affairs committee until his retirement this year. Members of Congress have started to listen to some of the more moderate voices in the Cuban exile community. The House recently voted to kill funding for TV Marti, the US-financed propaganda station beamed to Cuba and closely aligned with Mr Canosa. The new administration does not appear to have developed a clear Cuba policy yet. During the election campaign, Mr Bill Clinton took an even tougher line on Cuba than President George Bush, but his appointees include some who have in the past favoured more dialogue with Cuba. Telephone links are one area where the two camps agree. The Cuban-American National Foundation, which in general opposes any easing of the embargo, backs easier and cheaper telecommunications, and this measure was included in a bill passed last year which otherwise sought to tighten the economic noose on Cuba. Demand for phone links among the Cuban exile community is high. Even before the limited AT&amp;T microwave link was destroyed by the hurricane, the company was able to connect only around 500,000 calls out of 60m attempted each year. The cost of getting through to Cuba has risen sharply. AT&amp;T says that if it could serve the island directly, its charges would average Dollars 1.55 (Pounds 1) a minute; with the service via Italy cut to a trickle, many exiles now dial pirate services in Canada, at prices ranging from Dollars 3.50 to Dollars 7.50 a minute. Cuba prefers the Canadian links, because it receives a share of the revenue in the form of desperately needed hard currency. The restriction on AT&amp;T's Italian traffic is seen as a bargaining ploy to weaken US insistance that all revenue go into the escrow account, which has an estimated Dollars 60m already.</p>

			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / International Company News: AGF profits steady at FFr1.4bn for first half ASSURANCES Generales de France (AGF), the French insurance company which is on the government's privatisation list, saw net profits stabilise at FFr1.41bn (Dollars 246m) in the first half of 1993, against FFr1.40bn a year earlier. The static performance stemmed partly from the inclusion of a share of the losses at Comptoir des Entrepreneurs, the troubled finance group, which totalled FFr297m. Mr Michel Albert, chairman, declined to forecast full-year earnings, but said he was confident in spite of the 'difficult state' of the insurance market. He said he was 'even more' confident about 1994. AGF, the third-largest insurer in France behind Union des Assurances de Paris and Axa, saw turnover from insurance activities rise by 7.9 per cent to FFr32.6bn in the first six months of this year, from FFr30.2bn in the same period of 1992. French accident insurance business recovered, doubling net profits to FFr325m from FFr126m, and the reinsurance side made modest progress to FFr48m from FFr44m. AGF's insurance interests outside France moved out of the red with net profits of FFr212m against a loss of FFr89m. The group said it had benefited from a slight improvement in conditions and from tighter cost control. However, net profits from French life insurance business fell sharply to FFr858m from FFr1.05bn. Losses on financial interests deepened to FFr163m from FFr60m mainly due to the losses on its 29.7 per cent stake in Comptoir des Entrepreneurs. The finance group is implementing a recovery plan. Losses totalled FFr900m in the first half of this year, against net profits of FFr23.7m at the interim stage last year. The company said yesterday that the outlook for the full year was uncertain, but it was convinced that the worst of its problems were over and that the second half would show an improvement on the first.</p>

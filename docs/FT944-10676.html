			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (1): Economic growth is the key - Despite a bleak background, or in part perhaps because of it, there is now a strong sense of change in many parts of the country It is the poorest country in the western hemisphere after Haiti. Seventy per cent of the population live in poverty; average life expectancy is 60 years; 86 out of every 1,000 babies die before they are a year old. Bolivia is still suffering the legacy of four centuries of plunder capitalism. Its 1952 revolution nationalised the mines, the centrepiece of the Bolivian economy, and opened the countryside to land reform. But in driving out the mine owners and landowners, the revolution drove away capital too. The state, beset by corruption, proved an inefficient investor and little better at improving the lot of the population. In a country of more than 7m people, fewer than 1m have formal jobs and only 350,000 have bank accounts. The indigenous majority of Bolivians does not speak Spanish, suffers the racism of the European-descended minority and still ekes subsistence from the land or from petty commerce. Landlocked, with prices for its main commodity exports plunging in the 1980s, Bolivia's survival without continued foreign aid in a competitive world market remains in doubt. Yet, despite this bleak background, or in part perhaps because of it, there is now a strong sense of change in many parts of the country. Some regions - in particular, the plains to the east around the city of Santa Cruz - are enjoying growth led by agricultural exports. The caricature image of a country beset by military dictatorships and political instability - Bolivia has experienced 78 governments in 169 years of independence - is losing its relevance now that elected governments have been in place for 12 years. There have been nine years of economic stability since 1985, when inflation topped 23,000 per cent. This year, inflation should fall to 7.5 per cent or less - only Argentina's will be lower in Latin America. Once heavily protectionist, the country now has a maximum tariff of 10 per cent and allows free inflow and outflow of capital. Yet, economic stability has not been followed by sufficient overall growth to improve the lives of the poor majority. Slow growth, the present government believes, is an inevitable consequence of low investment over many years. Sharply increasing the investment rate is therefore its prime objective. The architect of the successful 1985 economic stabilisation plan is now Mr Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, the president. The cornerstone of his policy to increase private investment - he hopes it will reach more than 20 per cent of gross domestic product by 1996 compared with about 14 per cent at present  -is a plan to transfer six state companies responsible for one-eighth of the country's economic activity to the private sector. The process is being called capitalisation. It aims to entice foreign private operators to make a significant equity investment in the businesses, typically 50 per cent, and to distribute the remaining portion to Bolivians through newly created pension fund accounts. The process is expected to start with the capitalisation of the state electricity generator. The single most important capitalisation will be that of the state oil company, YPFB, which, despite its poor investment record, still accounts for about 9 per cent of GDP. Mr Edgar Saravia, the senior official responsible for guiding through the process, says that by next year the first stage of capitalisation - transferring the companies to the management control of the new foreign shareholders - should be completed by July next year. Already though, he admits capitalisation is running six weeks behind schedule. The completion of the process - let alone its ultimate success - cannot be taken for granted. It requires a heavy legislative programme and although the government coalition has with difficulty retained majorities in both houses of Congress, they may not be reliable or durable. Furthermore, because the Bolivian market is small, the amount that foreign investors are willing to plough into the companies will depend significantly on the extent to which they can use the companies to penetrate foreign markets. Bolivia is therefore depicting itself as an entrepot - particularly for energy and transport - for South America's southern cone. And with regional economic integration proceeding apace, both at the governmental and entrepreneurial level, the idea of Bolivia as a hub is no longer the pipe-dream it would have been a decade ago. But, while capitalisation may be a necessary condition for accelerating economic growth, nobody sees it as sufficient. If potential foreign investors are less worried about the country's political stability than they were, they have significant concerns about other obstacles to business. One big obstacle, particularly to investment in agriculture, is land titling. The country's competing titling authorities have now more or less ceased to function and the present law allows for different owners of the land, the underground resources beneath it, and the forest above. Mr Jose Guillermo Justiniano, the minister of sustainable development and the environment, says 'complete chaos' surrounds the titling issue, but that the government is drafting a law to address the problem. Corruption remains another pressing problem - and the aim of reducing it provides a further reason for ending state ownership of productive enterprises. Congress is wrangling over whether to lift the diplomatic immunity of the previous president, Mr Jaime Paz Zamora, who has been accused along with other members of his party of ties with drug traffickers. The company running La Paz's cable television channel, for example, has complained it is being targeted for bribes by city officials. There is a price for not paying: the frequency with which the company's cables get damaged by municipal and other vehicles. Other obstacles cited by foreign investors include poor infrastructure, the continued strong influence of the trade unions, and the legal system. Mr Guido Antesana, a former head of Bolivia's banking association, describes the legal system as 'morally bankrupt and technically obsolete'. For business, it presents 'a big roadblock. There is no certainty that any contract will be enforced,' he says. The government has already begun to move on this, although the task is enormous. Constitutional reform has, among other things, established a new tribunal aimed at cleaning up the judiciary. In another unprecedented development, two supreme court justices were impeached for corruption. It is not only in the economic domain that the government has directed its reform efforts. It has overhauled the executive branch, the drawback being that getting accustomed to this new structure has delayed other aspects of the government's programme. It has passed a law aimed at decentralising political decision-making. Called popular participation, it is designed to devolve power and finance to local municipalities and community groups in all parts of the country, many parts of which have never had local government. Education reform has for the first time permitted instruction in languages spoken by the country's indigenous majority. By any standards, this is an ambitious reform programme, and unlike some leaders, the US-educated Mr Sanchez de Lozada does not lack the 'vision thing'. What is in question, however, is application. The president, a philosophy graduate from the University of Chicago, loves 'brainstorming' sessions. He follows opinion polls closely - too closely, say some of his supporters. And, partly as a result, he makes decisions and then often reverses them days later. Because of the country's heavy dependence on foreign aid - which he hopes his economic programme will end - his decision-making has to take into account the often conflicting opinions of the international financial institutions, the more than 400 non-governmental organisations operating in the country, and the US and other donor governments. The president has no love either for Bolivia's pork-barrel political culture, or the cut-and-thrust of politics, which he is widely said to see as an obstacle to his reform ideas. Another subject he is said to despise is the controversy over the growing of coca leaf, the raw material for cocaine. The importance of coca to the Bolivian economy has declined over the past five years - the area under cultivation has remained more or less stable, while it has quintupled in Peru - but it remains a thorn in the government's side. He has been caught in the middle of Washington's policy of repressing coca cultivation and the Bolivian population's romantic, if possibly misguided, attachment to the growers of the plant. Already, 15 months has passed of a short four-year presidential term. The president makes no bones about the enormity of the task he is undertaking. But he says he has a consolation: 'There's one thing that makes me see the light - there's no way I can do it worse than the others have done.'</p>

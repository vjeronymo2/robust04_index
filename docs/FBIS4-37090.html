			<p>BFN     [Text] The trial of Layada Abdelhak [member of the Armed  Islamic Group -- GIA] began at Algiers special court today. The  trial was due to start yesterday but had to be postponed until  today at the request of the defense lawyers to enable them to  examine the bill of indictment. The request was granted by the  presiding judge who gave the defense 24 hours to examine the  file. Over to Bachir Hedibel who attended the opening of the  trial:    [Hedibel] The prosecutor general has just required the  maximum sentence, namely the death penalty, for the defendant  Layada Abdelhak who is appearing before the Algiers special  judicial court. The trial of Layada Abdelhak began this morning  after it was postponed for 24 hours at the request of his four  lawyers. The presiding judge opened the session by reading the  bill of indictment. The main charges brought against the  defendant include harming the integrity of the national  territory and the security of the state with a view to  overthrowing the regime, leading armed groups, carrying out acts  of sabotage against public interests, stealing weapons and  ammunition, using violence, and committing premeditated murders  and aggravated thefts.    The bill of indictment includes 21 crimes. The defendant has  confessed to all the crimes, according to the bill of  indictment. He also knew about the other crimes committed at the  time he belonged to the Armed [Islamic] Group and before he went  to Morocco on 23 September 1993. He denied all this before the  court today repeating every time that he was only the personal  driver of Moh Leveilley [alias for Mohamed Allal, GIA member  killed in clash with security forces in September 1992 in  Tamezguida] and that he never took part in any assassination  operation against members of the national security forces. He  added that if operations were carried out when he was the  driver, he had no prior knowledge of these operations. He  further said that his orders were to drive the armed groups in  his capacity as a driver.    The defense lawyers concentrated on the bill of indictment  which they regarded as being to the advantage of their client  since there was no mention of Layada being commander [emir] of  the group. Using this line of defense, the lawyers asked for a  lighter sentence, especially as Layada did not deny his  affiliation to the group.    The trial is continuing at this very moment and given the  long list of charges brought against the defendant and the  numerous cases and names mentioned during the session, we will  limit ourselves to this for the time being and promise our  listeners further details in later reports.</p>

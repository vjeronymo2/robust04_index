The three sides were unable to break their  months-long impasse, but the Freedom Alliance agreed to consider  a written submission on the ANC's position on Thursday. A  government spokesman confirmed another trilateral meeting could  take place on Thursday if the Freedom Alliance Executive  responded favourably to the ANC position paper.    Government chief negotiator Roelf Meyer remained optimistic  a  negotiated settlement was still possible. "The door should  always remain open," Mr Meyer told SAPA afterwards. He said  there were two options facing the three parties. They could  conclude a deal by Thursday night, only hours before President F  W de Klerk proclaimed the April 27-29 election dates on Friday.    Political parties have 10 days from proclamation to register  their participation in the election.    Mr Meyer explained once the election had been proclaimed it  would be virtually impossible to call a special parliamentray  session to amend the constitution.    The other option was that the parties could reach a kind of  "gentlemen's agreement" in terms of which the government of  national unity would make certain changes to the constitution  immediately after it assumed power. However, Freedom Alliance  adviser Mario Ambrossini on Tuesday night said he doubted  whether the ANC would produce anything which warranted optimism.  "The talking is over," he said.    ANC negotiator Thabo Mbeki, who gave the undertaking to  provide the Freedom Alliance with the ANC's position in writing,  denied Tuesday's talks suffered a "complete breakdown". There  was still room to build on what had transpired at the talks.    According to the Freedom Alliance, the change in fortunes  during the latest round of negotiations occurred late on Monday  night. The ANC made a "complete backward somersault" 20 minutes  before the end of seven hours of talks, Alliance Chairman Rowan  Cronje told a press conference at the Bophuthatswana Embassy on  Tuesday night. He was flanked by Inkatha Freedom Party  President Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Bophuthatswana President Lucas  Mangope, Conservative Party [CP] leader Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg,  and Generals Constand Viljoen and Tienie Groenewald of the  Afrikaner Volksfront. Mr Cronje said little or no progress had  been made on a number of their demands, including for one  instead of two ballot papers; more exclusive powers for the  provinces; and, greater provincial constitution- making powers.  Some progress had been made on the right of provinces to impose  and collect their own taxes. He didn't mention the Freedom  Alliance demand for a Volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland].    "At the end we came to the conclusion we have come to the  end  of the road as far as negotiations are concerned," Mr Cronje  said. "There has been very little give on the part of the other  side."    CP negotiator Tom Langley said the government and the ANC  were "conniving" against the Freedom Alliance. "It can be very,  very bad for the country," he told SAPA. "I think they have a  secret agenda, which is part of their (1992) record of  understanding." Part of the alleged agenda was to drive a wedge  between Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and Mr Buthelezi, and to  break up the Freedom Alliance, according to Mr Langley.    Mr Buthelezi told the media he had been put in a difficult  position by the fact King Zwelithini had recently met with Mr De  Klerk, who had given the king "certain undertakings". The IFP  leader did not elaborate.    Gen Viljoen said he remained committed to negotiations  despite the latest talks outcome. "One must keep on negotiating  until all the options are exhausted. The alternative is too  ghastly too contemplate."    The CP's Dr Corne Mulder told SAPA those at the negotiating  table "are the moderates". "We've pushed this process to try to  get an inclusive settlement. "If there's not a settlement the  moderates will be swept aside and the radicals will move in."</p>

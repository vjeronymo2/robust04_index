			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Romy Tangbawan] </F>   [Text] Jose Maria Sison, exiled leader of the Communist  Party of the Philippines (CPP) yesterday accused the Ramos  administration of "coddling (party) renegades" and threatened to  pull out of the peace talks unless such "reprehensible" act is  stopped.    "There are glaring indications that they (renegades) are  being manipulated for a scheme of bloody intrigue," Sison said  in a statement faxed to media outfits in Manila from the  National Democratic Front (NDF) International Office in Utrecht,  The Netherlands.    The statement named the renegades as Romulo Kintanar, Arturo  Tabara, Filemon Lagman, and Ricardo Reyes, who are all facing  criminal charges before the party for allegedly committing acts  inimical to the interest of the movement.    Sison claimed that the NDF international office has received  information that the four "renegades" use firearms and  bodyguards provided by the government.    It said the four, under the supervision of military  intelligence officers, have been holding caucuses and other  activities in Metro Manila since September 1992 with the goal of  "decapitating, discrediting, disintegrating and destroying" the  movement.    Kintanar, alias Daniel Bagani or Dan, was the former chief  of  the New People's Army; Tabara, alias Victor del Mar, Pol, and  Piloy, used to head the CPP Central Visayas Commission; Lagman  also known as Carlos Forte and Popoy, heads the breakaway CPP  Manila-Rizal Regional Committee; Reyes was former deputy  secretary-general of the CPP-Mindanao Commission.    Kintanar, in particular, is being blamed by the CPP-NPA of  introducing "gangsterism" in the movement in Davao City in 1984,  "abuse of authority," and corruption within some party units.    Sison expressed concern that the four ex-rebel chiefs have  been "openly and freely" operating in Metro Manila and  "misrepresenting" themselves as CPP leaders despite the fact  their expulsion from the party had been made public.    Sison hinted that Malacanang may not have sanctioned such  scheme, pointing out that there are military and police  officials who have been overruled by their superiors but who  continue to disagree with the policy of "condoning, arming and  funding criminal elements who have committed random killing of  military and police officers, mass murders [sentence as  published]."    But he said the "U.S.-Ramos regime cannot escape  responsibility for any crime of intrigue committed by its  military personnel and its Balweg-type assets against the  patriotic and progressive forces in the Philippines."    Sison reminded the president, whom he addressed by his  former  military title "General Ramos," that similar tactics were  applied by past administrations using the "Lava revisionists,"  "Kumander [Comrade] Melody," "Kumander Pusa," and rebel priest  Conrado Balweg against the movement but all have failed.    Sison first threatened to withdraw his group from the peace  talks after assassins killed Vicente Martinez, another former  NPA chief, at his house in Antipolo, Rizal last week. The CPP  described the slaying as an attempt to spark killings within the  movement.    Partisans loyal to Lagman's group have blamed Sison's  faction  for the killing but sources from the mainstream movement said  there is no reason for them to want Martinez killed since he is  not among the renegades.    Sison suspected that government forces were behind the  killing.</p>

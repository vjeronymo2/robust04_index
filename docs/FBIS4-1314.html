			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Johannesburg April 26 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom  Party [IFP] Transvaal Chairman Themba Khoza on Tuesday [26  April] claimed wide-spread abuse in Soweto, South Africa's  biggest black township, on the first day of the country's first  all-race election. Speaking at a press conference in  Johannesburg, Mr Khoza said IFP stickers had not arrived on time  at a number of polling stations in Soweto and African National  Congress agents had marked ballot papers on behalf of some  voters.    Voters at the polling booth at Chiawelo, Soweto, were given  second ballot papers if they filled their first ones in  "wrongly", he said.    Mr Khoza said voters at Bhukalani primary school in Zondi  section and at a polling station in Mzimhlope were given  "aggressive answers" by Independent Electoral Commission [IEC]  agents when they complained there were no IFP stickers on their  ballot papers. Because of this the voters had also been forced  to expose their political affiliation. "It makes the election  not private anymore."    When IFP agents at Mzimhlope tried to intervene "they were  chased away by ANC agents", Mr Khoza claimed.    IFP stickers also failed to arrive on time at the voting  station in Dube, and similar problems were experienced at  Baragwanath Hospital and in Zola section.    "And this is only Soweto I've talked about. There are  absolutely no secrets in this election," said Mr Khoza. He said  IFP representatives had already complained to the IEC. He would  consult Ulundi about taking the matter further.    Mr Khoza's comments followed complaints by IFP Thokoza  Chairman Abraham Mzizi, who said the elections had to be  extended if necessary to allow thousands of East Rand hostel  residents, isolated by violence, to acquire identity documents  and to cast their votes.    Speaking at Thokoza hostel on Tuesday afternoon, Mr Mzizi  said thousands of East Rand hostel residents still had no IDs.  He would send a message to IFP leader Mangosutho Buthelezi, he  said.    East Rand defence force commander Col Chris du Toit had  already agreed he would take the matter "to the highest levels  of government", said Mr Mzizi. [passage omitted]</p>

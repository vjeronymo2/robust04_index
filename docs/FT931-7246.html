			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / German bank travels beyond its heartland: Thomas Cook decides about owners Abroad / Its unorthodox shareholder They ran into it again last week when WestLB agreed, after months of negotiations, to buy a 40 per cent stake in the Landesbank Schleswig-Holstein, the Kiel-based public sector bank. This is believed to have cost between DM260m and DM300m (Pounds 127m). The move came several months after WestLB, acting in tandem with the Stuttgart-based SudwestLB, paid DM750m to acquire a 50 per cent stake in Landesbank Rheinland Pfalz in Mainz. The two transactions consolidate WestLB's position as Germany's dominant public sector bank, its interests extending far beyond its North-Rhine Westphalia heartland. The bank today reports its 1992 figures. Group operating profits are likely to be more than the DM970m made in 1991. With a balance sheet of DM260bn at the end of last year, the house-bank to the state of North-Rhine Westphalia is Germany's third biggest bank. With about a third of earnings coming from 31 offices abroad, its ability to compete with the likes of Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank extends beyond the domestic market. While other Landesbanken stick to looking after state governments' finances and providing central banking services to local savings associations, Dusseldorf-based WestLB has been pursuing more colourful activities. It is thought to have spent at least DM1.6bn on buying stakes in industrial companies since 1991. Last year it and its LTU travel associate - Germany's largest airline charter group in which WestLB has a 34.3 per cent stake - bought an 86 per cent stake in Thomas Cook, the UK travel company, for Pounds 172m. WestLB later bought the whole stake on its own account and fused it with other travel interests in a newly formed subsidiary, TCT Touristik Beteiligungs. WestLB also had a 10 per cent stake in Hoesch, the steel group which recently fell victim to an unwelcome takeover from Krupp, its Ruhr-based rival. WestLB claims that it played a neutral role in the affair but Frankfurt financiers are convinced that Mr Neuber helped Krupp plot and execute the takeover. The bank also has a 10 per cent stake in Asko Deutsche Kaufhaus, the large German retailer acquired last year by Metro, the privately-owned Swiss retail group. It is thought to have helped Metro with the purchase of its majority stake in Asko. 'Wild-west capitalism,' is how Mr Peter Fischer, economics minister of the state of Lower Saxony, describes the bank's stake-building in German companies. It is believed to have stakes in up to 150 companies, the biggest of which is a 32 per cent holding in Preussag, the large German steel and engineering group. Critics such as Mr Fischer raise a number of questions: First, what is a bank doing straying so far away from financial services, building an empire in the travel business and helping to shape the future of the German steel and retail sectors? Second, is this sort of activity not especially inappropriate for a public sector institution? Third, could it not all go disastrously wrong with the onset of recession on Germany? As one former WestLB executive puts it: 'It is all very well building an empire when times are good . . . but can it hold together in a slowdown?' Mr Neuber, who began his working life as an apprentice at the Krupp steel firm, brushes critics aside. 'I hear them complaining but I don't listen. 'We do not pursue industrial policy, we help companies develop their strategies. And what we do, we do in order to make money. 'The buying and selling of corporate shareholdings is part and parcel of our normal banking business, as it is for the large private sector banks. This form of investment banking has been highly profitable for West LB for many years.' Mr Neuber adds that WestLB's industrial participations are only modest compared with other banks' industrial participations - Deutsche Bank's 28 per cent holding in Daimler-Benz alone eclipses WestLB's entire portfolio. The difference is that while the Deutsche Bank has adopted a deliberately low profile in the three years since Mr Hilmar Kopper has been chief executive, WestLB has hardly ever been out of the headlines. 'There has been a lot of publicity,' he concedes. It is unlikely to cease. To the fury of the private banks, WestLB's war chest received a substantial increase last month when the German banking authorities allowed WestLB to consolidate its subsidised housing finance subsidiary, recently acquired from the government of North-Rhine Westphalia. That gave it DM4bn of 'free' equity just as tough new capital adequacy requirements came into force. The private sector banks, which had to hold expensive rights issues to meet the new requirements, cried foul, complaining that WestLB was getting an unfair advantage. 'They would say that,' says Mr Neuber. 'They are the competition.'</p>

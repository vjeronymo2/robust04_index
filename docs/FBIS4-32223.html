			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Doboj, June 21 (TANJUG) -- Thirteen civilians,  including five children, were seriously wounded, and many more  received light injuries in a Moslem artillery attack on the Serb  towns of Doboj and Teslic in northern Bosnia on Tuesday [21  June], Bosnian Serb military sources said. The tank and rocket  shells severely damaged civilian objects in these two  neighbouring towns, the sources said. Moslems started shelling  the two towns several weeks ago.    Continuing to violate the Geneva Accord on a cessation of  hostilities which was reached on June 8, the Moslems heavily  attacked also some other Serb towns, villages and positions in  the wider area of Doboj. Southeast of Doboj, on Mt. Ozren,  Moslems opened mortar fire on the Serb villages of Boljanic,  Karanovac and Petrovo on the left bank of the River Spreca.  There were no casualties, but the shell explosions caused  severe material damage to buildings.    On the Vozuca front, Moslems are firing at and shelling Serb  positions and villages along all lines of separation. A Moslem  troop build-up has also been observed. Moslems are also  attacking Serb positions east and west of Doboj, but Serbs are  abiding by the Geneva Accord and open fire only when the lives  of their troops and civilians are threatened, the Bosnian Serb  military sources said.</p>

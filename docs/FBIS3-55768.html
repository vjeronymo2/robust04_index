Several  Ukrainian mass media sources, referring to a statement by Viktor  Yushchenko, chairman of the board of the Ukrainian National  Bank, even named specific deadlines: The noncash hryvnya should  have been brought into circulation 6 January, and the cash  hryvnya 10 January. So far, however, this has not come about.    The proposed exchange rate for the hryvnya in respect of the  karbovanets is one to 10,000. It is possible that this will be  the main achievement of the financial operation, insofar as the  number of zeros on price lists at regular food stores right now  simply shocks the purchaser. In other respects, only at a  stretch can the aforementioned action be considered necessary  and well-timed. It is impossible to keep track of the names of  authoritative economists, politicians, scientists, and  financiers who warned: If it is necessary to introduce the  hryvnya, only do it once the karbovanets has stabilized, and,  most importantly, once the economy stabilizes. Otherwise, the  entire inflationary squall of what went before will rain down on  the new national currency, and the hryvnya's image will be  undermined even faster than that of its predecessor, the  karbovanets.    But it is difficult to link the temporary fall just prior to  the New Year of the dollar and Russian ruble rate in respect of  the karbovanets with any kind of major positive progress on the  part of the Ukrainian economy. It is simply that, following the  colossal November price hikes against a background of a natural  increase of the activeness of purchasers before the holidays,  there were too few banknotes in circulation, and monetary  turnover slowed sharply. Therefore, savings accrued by citizens  in the form of foreign currency came into play...    Of course, this has not altered the essence of what is going  on in the economy. Suffice it to cite facts expounded in the  latest interview by Ukraine's Power Engineering and  Electrification Minister Vilen Semenyuk: "Enough coal remains  in our depots to last roughly one month.... Fuel oil is now  coming into our stations in quantities representing 15-20  percent of what is needed.... Only emergency reserves are left  in the depots...."    Of course, people feel the effects of this in terms of cold  radiators in their apartments, the regular disconnection of hot  water and light, and television sets which remain lifeless until  evening (by limiting television operating time, the country  saves 3.6 million kW-hours of electricity every day.) However,  few expect the new currency to change any aspect of life  drastically, or to warm people up....</p>

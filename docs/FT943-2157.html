			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / World Trade News: EU backs Ruggiero to head WTO - Former Italian trade minister to challenge Mexican president for top trade job The race for the top job at the World Trade Organisation, due to be created next January, hotted up yesterday when Mr Renato Ruggiero, a former Italian trade minister, was formally nominated as the European Union candidate. Unless others enter the race, the contest now seems likely to be between Mr Ruggiero and Mr Carlos Salinas, outgoing president of Mexico. Though Mr Salinas has been widely billed as the front-runner, many trade diplomats in Geneva believe Mr Ruggiero has a better chance of securing the necessary consensus of Gatt's 123 members. Mr Ruggiero's nomination, agreed by EU foreign ministers when they met in Usedom, Germany, this month, was yesterday handed to Mr Andras Szepesi, Hungary's ambassador to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and chairman of the contracting parties (members), who is in charge of the selection process. EU officials said yesterday that the full weight of European diplomacy would now be turned on winning the WTO post for Mr Ruggiero, who was nominated by his own government last June. Mr Ruggiero himself, a senior executive with Fiat, the Italian motor manufacturer, will be touring world capitals to garner support. His main objective is to convince doubters that Brussels' backing will not make him a champion of narrow EU interests. Mr Szepesi has called an informal meeting of Gatt members tomorrow morning at which he is expected to announce that Brazil is withdrawing its nomination of Mr Rubens Ricupero, the former finance minister. Mr Ricupero was forced to resign suddenly this month after the accidental broadcast of remarks implying he was using an anti-inflation plan to boost the election campaign of Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the government's presidential candidate. Mr Ricupero's discomfiture has clearly strengthened the chances of President Salinas, who may now hope to win the backing of all Latin American states as well as Washington. However, Mr Salinas has also attracted strong opposition. This is based partly on fears, especially among Asian nations, that he will have too cosy a relationship with the US, Mexico's partner in the North American Free Trade Agreement, and partly on worries by some that his 'presidential' style may not be what the WTO needs. The only other declared candidate, Mr Kim Chul-su, Korea's trade and industry minister, is said to have Asian and Australian support but is generally considered to have little chance of success. EU officials are hopeful that Mr Kim's backers will subsequently line up behind Mr Ruggiero. The appointment is a more complicated choice than last year's selection of Mr Peter Sutherland as Gatt's director-general, a post he is vacating for personal reasons. Mr Sutherland's candidacy swiftly gathered support because he was widely perceived as the right man to tackle the completion of the protracted Uruguay Round negotiations.</p>

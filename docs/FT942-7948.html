			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / International Company News: Advance by Rothmans Malaysia Rothmans (Malaysia) has announced pre-tax profits of MDollars 402m (USDollars 155m) for the year ending March 31 1994. The figure represents a 15.7 per cent rise over the previous year. Rothmans' Malaysian unit is the most profitable segment of the British tobacco group's operations in the east Asia region. Earlier this year Rothmans announced plans to merge its units in the region to give the group the financial muscle to launch a strong sales push in China and Japan. However the plans were abandoned after shareholders in the unit, dominated by the Malaysian government's investment company, said that a merger could siphon funds out of Malaysia and dilute local control of the company's operations. Turnover at Rothmans (Malaysia) in 1993 - 94 increased by 18.3 per cent to MDollars 1.33bn. The company has recommended a final gross dividend of 40 cents per share.</p>

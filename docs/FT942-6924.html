			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Macdonald Martin rises 14% - Second half recovery cheers market but company remains cautious Macdonald Martin Distilleries, best known for Glenmorangie single malt whisky, staged a smart recovery in its second half, helped by a strong performance in international markets. After recording a 20 per cent decline in profits before tax at the interim stage, the Edinburgh-based group rallied to show a net 14 per cent improvement, from Pounds 4.35m to Pounds 4.97m, during the 12 months to March 31. The A shares rose by 35p to 480p. Despite the improvement, Mr Neil McKerrow, managing director, remained circumspect on prospects: 'We are expecting another tough, difficult year with surplus stocks and no improvement in prices.' He was hopeful, however, of further growth in the malt market. Overseas sales of Glenmorangie increased by 30 per cent in value last year, with North America and northern Europe showing good growth. The smaller Glen Moray brand also improved in most European markets and in the UK duty-free sector. Sales of blended products were particularly strong during the fourth quarter, with the US and Venezuela performing well, he added. Increased bulk contract sales made a sizeable contribution to a 22 per cent expansion in group turnover, up from Pounds 24.2m to Pounds 29.5m, albeit at reduced margins. The effect at the pre-tax line, however, was offset by a Pounds 632,000 write-off for unutilised capacity, reflecting continuing lower production levels at the malt distilleries. Capacity was running at 44 per cent, but should improve to 66 per cent during the current year, Mr McKerrow said. Crabbie's, the green ginger wine brand acquired in October from United Distillers for some Pounds 2.1m, increased sales by 6 per cent in a stable market and made a small contribution to profits. The year finished with reduced gearing of 27 per cent, down from 30 per cent at end-March 1993. Helped by a more normal tax charge, earnings per A share improved by 20 per cent to 24.47p (20.38p). The total distribution goes up 10 per cent, from 8.8p to 9.68p, via a proposed final of 7.414p.</p>

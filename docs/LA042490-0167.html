			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. MARIACHI BAND JOINS FESTIVAL  </P> <P> Mariachi Uclatlan, a mariachi band based in Orange, has been added to the  growing list of groups and artists from Orange County to participate in  September's Los Angeles Festival of the arts.  </P> <P> The 12-member band, which regularly performs at El Mariachi restaurant in  Orange, is scheduled to play at a gathering "of the best mariachi in the  greater Los Angeles area," said Judy Mitoma, festival co-curator.  </P> <P> Other recently confirmed festival participants from Orange County are San Juan  Capistrano photographer Mihoko Yamagata, to be featured in a solo exhibit, and  Florinda Mintz, a writer from Santa Ana who is co-organizing a mini-festival of  poets from Latin America and Canada. Mintz said Pablo Antonio Cuadra, one of  Nicaragua's leading poets and director of the newspaper La Prensa, will be  among those reading their work.  </P> <P> The mariachi gathering, the Yamagata exhibit and the poetry mini-festival all  will be subsidized by the festival. An "open" segment of the festival will  feature other artists, including several from Orange County, who will pay to  present their work. All events will take place throughout Los Angeles County.

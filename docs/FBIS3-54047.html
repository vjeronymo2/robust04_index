			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and PLO  Chairman Yasir 'Arafat will meet again next Sunday [30 January]  in Switzerland in a further attempt to break the deadlock over  the implementation of Palestinian autonomy. There was no  breakthrough after two rounds of talks over the weekend in Oslo,  but significant progress was reportedly made on the questions of  the border crossings and security arrangements in Gaza. Mark  Weiss reports:    [Begin Weiss recording] Both Foreign Minister Peres and  Yasir 'Arafat made significant concessions at the Oslo talks.  According to Qol Yisra'el's diplomatic reporter Shlomo Raz, the  PLO has now reportedly dropped its insistence that Palestinian  policemen be present at the border crossings. In return, Israel  will reportedly allow people crossing to enter directly to  Jericho, and Israel will also allow the Palestinians to set up  their own holiday resort on the Dead Sea. However,  disagreements remain over the size of the autonomous Jericho  area. Peres and 'Arafat also reached agreement on security  arrangements for roads in the Gaza Strip leading to the Gush  Qatif settlement bloc.    The Foreign Ministry's legal adviser Yo'el Singer and senior  PLO official Abu-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'] will meet this week in an  attempt to put into writing the points of agreement before Peres  and 'Arafat meet again a week from today in Switzerland.    Speaking in Oslo last night, Peres said there is a chance  that agreement can be reached in Switzerland on most of the  points and there is a proper climate for such an agreement.  'Arafat told reporters that some bridges have been overcome,  but more time is needed. He said if there is a will there is a  way, and both sides have this will. Peres and 'Arafat held  their second round of talks after attending the funeral of  Norwegian Foreign Minister Johan Jorgen Holst, who brokered last  year's Oslo agreement. U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher said the strain of the peace process had contributed  to his death, and said a peace agreement would do justice to his  memory. [end recording]    [Announcer] In all, Israeli and Palestinian representatives  will be meeting this week at several locations in talks to  further the peace process. The Yo'el Singer-Abu-'Ala' meetings  Mark Weiss reported on, the Taba talks on autonomy for Gaza and  Jericho resume in Taba tomorrow, and in Washington discussions  will start in the framework of the bilateral talks between  Israel and the Arab states. The U.S. Administration is at the  same time reported to be working to set up a summit meeting  between Prime Minister Rabin and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad.    [Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 22 January on page A1  carries  an item by political correspondent Aluf Ben that reports Peres  presented 'Arafat with a proposal to overcome the dispute over  control of the border crossings. "Under the proposal, use would  be made of advanced technology development in Israel to form `an  unseen presence' of Israeli security officers in the Palestinian  area of the crossings. The plan, in which several military  industries are participating, has been approved by security  elements and received Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's OK Thursday  in his meeting with Peres. The PLO demanded in the negotiations  that the Palestinian residents of the self-government in Gaza  and Jericho `will not see Israelis' when they enter the  crossings points, and agreed that Israel supervise the crossings  from a distance through electronic means."    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0505 GMT on 22 January,  in a report by Gil Sedan in Oslo, says that "at Peres'  initiative, a $25-million international fund, the initial budget  for funding the Palestinian self-government, was set up. The  United States will contribute $10 million and the rest will be  divided evenly between the Scandinavian countries and Japan."]</p>

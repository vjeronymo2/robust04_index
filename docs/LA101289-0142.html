			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Minnesota Viking General Manager Mike Lynn visited Herschel Walker's home in  Irving, Tex., to try to persuade the Dallas Cowboy running back to join the  Vikings.  </P> <P> "I told him all the reasons why he should go to Minnesota, but we still don't  have a deal," Lynn said. "I'm not disappointed, and the clock is ticking and it  will continue to tick until Tuesday at 4 p.m. (the NFL trading deadline). There  is no urgency in the situation."  </P> <P> The winless Cowboys will play the San Francisco 49ers Sunday. Asked about his  chances of still being with Dallas, Walker said: "Good, I reckon. Nothing's  happened."  </P> <P> Lynn talked about a trade with Cowboy officials and Walker's agents Tuesday,  but Walker showed up for practice Wednesday morning. He was excused from the  afternoon session and met with Lynn.  </P></p>

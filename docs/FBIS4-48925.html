			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, 26 Apr (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice  Minister of Finance Jin Renqing 26 April said in Washington:  The solution to the population problem of developing countries  must depend on the incessant efforts of governments and people  of developing countries themselves, but strengthening  international cooperation is also an important part in solving  the problem.    Jin Renqing made the above remarks when he attended the 1994  spring meeting of the World Bank Development Committee. He  hoped that the developed countries would proceed from the view  of helping the joint development of all mankind and adopt some  effective measures to solve the world population problem, such  as providing money and technical assistance to and improving the  outside environment for developing countries. He also hoped  that international organizations, including the World Bank,  would adopt more positive policies on the population issue.    Jin Renqing said: There is a close relationship between  population and development. To the many developing countries,  rapid population growth will certainly limit their economic  development, obstruct their efforts to raise people's standard  of living, and put heavy pressure on their natural resources and  ecological environment. The cheering thing is that more and  more countries and people have realized this and are making  positive efforts in this respect.    Touching on the issue of international trade, Jin Renqing  pointed out: The implementation of GATT's Uruguay Round  agreement still needs to be solved. He hoped that all concerned  parties, especially the developed countries, would keep their  promises and make due contributions to promoting the developing  countries' economic development as well as promoting  international trade and world economy.    Jin Renqing emphatically pointed out that the international  community should closely watch the continuous fall of prices of  primary products, which account for the major part of the  developing countries' income. This situation will not only  cause the unreasonable shift of the deserved income of poor  countries to rich ones but also will adversely affect some  developing countries' efforts to adjust their economic  development policies.</p>

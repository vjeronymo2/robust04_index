			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / World Trade News: India sees software export rise India's software exports soared 51 per cent in the year to March to Rs10.2bn (Pounds 215.5m), as the industry successfully maintained the fast pace of growth of recent years. Total turnover also expanded rapidly by 47 per cent to Rs17.1bn, according to figures released yesterday by the National Association of Software and Service Companies. Indian producers believe they are now reaping the benefits of establishing themselves in international markets. Export sales are dominated by a handful of larger companies, notably Tata Consultancy Services, a member of the Tata industrial grouping, which had overseas sales of Rs2bn. Altogether 100 companies exported software worth Rs10m or more, compared with only five five years ago. Indian companies often used to send engineers to the US and other countries to work on projects on-site. Recently, however, Indian companies have been carrying out more of their work in India, transmitting the results to clients by data communications lines.</p>

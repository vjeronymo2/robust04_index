			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Ekofisk tax concessions wanted Phillips Petroleum Norway is to seek substantial tax concessions before it invests Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) in new petroleum production and processing facilities at the ageing North Sea Ekofisk field, hub of the world's largest petroleum transportation system, Karen Fossli writes from Oslo. Phillips has unveiled a plan to avert closure of the 20-year-old field by Norwegian authorities, who are concerned over its safety. The US-based oil company has spent an estimated NKr70bn (Pounds 6.5bn) on the 10-platform field since it came on stream in 1972. Last October the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD), the oil industry watchdog, warned it would close the main processing and transportation facilities on the Ekofisk storage tank, through which 40 per cent of Norway's petroleum production passes, by the winter of 1995-96, for safety reasons.</p>

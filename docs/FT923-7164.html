			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Despatch of jets gesture to US BRITAIN'S decision last night to contribute six Tornado aircraft to the multinational forces ranged against President Saddam Hussein in the Gulf is a political gesture appreciated in Washington but one which makes little difference to the balance of forces in the region. The Royal Air Force performed bravely during the Gulf war and suffered relatively heavy losses as the Tornados initially pressed home low-level attacks on well-defended Iraqi targets. The six aircraft being sent this week will probably be again based in Bahrain, although on this occasion their primary role appears more likely to be surveillance and interdiction. The US military presence in the Gulf is massive and it will be on American forces and equipment that the overwhelming burden of the operation will fall. According to latest Pentagon statistics the US has 19 ships in the Gulf, headed by the aircraft carrier Independence, the command vessel LaSalle, three cruisers, one destroyer, two frigates, six support ships and five amphibious craft. No precise figures are provided for aircraft but those based in Saudi Arabia and on the Independence are known to exceed 200. They provide a range of options for military commanders and include the F-117 Stealth fighters, which are supposed to be almost invisible to radar, the F-14 and F-15e, Awacs surveillance aircraft and the A-10 'tank-busters' that inflicted such heavy damage on Iraqi armoured concentrations during the final days of the Gulf war. In addition the US has ground forces exercising in Kuwait with the 2,800 marines already there due to be augmented soon by 2,400 regular troops. The Pentagon said yesterday that its military personnel in the Gulf totalled 23,800. Mr Pete Williams, the Pentagon spokesman, added he did not believe there were any immediate plans to augment those forces. Once the exclusion zone is officially announced  - probably via a letter from the US, Britain and France to Iraq's ambassador at the UN - any of Saddam Hussein's fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters flying south of the 32nd parallel can expect to be attacked. Iraq's pilots have not in the past been anxious to risk their aircraft in combat and there is even less reason this time to believe that they will challenge the allies. During the eight-year war with Iran, Mr Saddam made relatively little use of his overwhelming air superiority, reserving it mainly to attack shipping in the Gulf and fly the occasional high-level mission over Tehran. Soon after the outbreak of the Gulf war last year the Iraqi leader ordered dozens of his front-line aircraft to flee to Iran, where many of them remain. However, in recent weeks it has been evident to the US that Iraqi training flights have been increasing, although probably fewer than 100 aircraft are serviceable. While they would be no match for US and British aircraft, it is their potential role in attacking Shia rebels that the exclusion zone is meant to prevent. There have been recent, if limited, cases of helicopter gunships and the occasional fixed-wing aircraft attacking rebel positions in the marshes area north of Basra. US officials believe that without a firm western response, the number of sorties flown by Mr Saddam's air force would have steadily increased. However military analysts acknowledge that there is a limited scope for aircraft to protect the Shia insurgents, without extending the exclusion zone to include movements of armour and troops. President George Bush remains anxious to avoid being sucked in further to the Iraqi quagmire, but the collapse of the Iraqi regime remains the US objective. Mr Paul Ride, 33, a Briton who disappeared in the Kuwaiti desert in unexplained circumstances seven weeks ago, was understood to be 'well' in a Baghdad jail, the Foreign Office said yesterday, writes David Owen in London. He vanished in June while travelling between two of his employer's offices in northern Kuwait.</p>

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Bahamas poll hinges on economy SIR Lynden Pindling, prime minister of the Bahamas, faces a strong challenge over his handling of the economy as he seeks a seventh consecutive term in a general election tomorrow, Canute James reports from Kingston. Sir Lynden's Progressive Liberal party, which took 32 of the 49 seats in the 1987 election, is being opposed by the Free National Movement led by Mr Hubert Ingraham, a former minister in the PLP government. The administration in the archipelago of 250,000 people has been troubled by a deteriorating economy. Tourism and offshore financial services, pillars of the economy, have suffered from the international recession; the national debt has grown; and increasing taxation has been used to stem a widening fiscal deficit.</p>

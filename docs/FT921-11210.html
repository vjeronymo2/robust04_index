			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Heaven and Hell: Teeth will be provided - Nigel Spivey bares his tormented soul in the first article of a new series HE WAS thundering from the pulpit, as only he can thunder: on the destination of sinners, and the beating of breasts, the tearing of hair, the gnashing of teeth. An old lady in the front pew had the spirit to pipe up: 'Reverend Paisley - I don't have any teeth]' Other preachers might have faltered, but not he. 'Teeth,' he roared, 'will be provided]' The provision of teeth is an essential detail of the picture of Hell that I owe to my Non-conformist upbringing. No one could say that my father delivers hellfire every Sunday; and I remember nothing but mellow homilies from my grandfather; but I perfectly understand Ian Paisley's fierce pedantry with regard to teeth. Church-goers, and cathedral-goers, may hold out for some last-minute mitigation: chapel-goers know that there is none, and have been properly trained in the exercise of gnawing their own innards. The Hell that is yielded by the culture of hard seats and soft drinks can be mapped out largely in terms of guilt, remorse, and self-loathing. Those of us who spent thousands of hours of our youth being instructed in the cultivation of guilt will need no issue of teeth. We have, so to speak, our own jaws of Hell. We looked closely at that oak-framed print depicting the Straight and Narrow path to Heaven, and the broad, meandering highway to Hell; examined the pious industry of those who were on the one road, and the drunken, brutish, carnal physiognomies of those reeling along on the other. We know very well what Hell will be like: here, for those who have never wriggled on chapel pews, are its salient features. The Non-conformist Hell involves a revision of the stock tortures of damnation. After all, Sisyphus, rolling his stone up the hill, up the hill, and up the hill again, is no punishment; rather, an exemplar of work for the sake of work, which to some Non-conformists is perfect Heaven. And Tantalus, ever stretching out for the ever close but ever mobile banquet - to be thus tantalised is not the height of pain for a Nonconformist. No: Hell for us will be forcible attendance at an absolutely slap-up meal, being obliged to partake of a prodigal spread, with the costliest, daintiest foods, and the rarest of wines. We shall be gorging ourselves: and at our elbows, all around the table, not getting a scrap, will be starving children, with the elephant eyes and corrugated ribs of utter impoverishment. We diners will watch helpless as what we fail to eat is swept away, to be thrown into bins of sheer wastage; while the children silently, incredulously, watch us. There will not be a tea-urn in sight; nor even the simplest slice of bread-and-butter. We shall be tormented to the extremes of torment. Needless to say, this Hell will be packed with the blaggards, the wastrels, the hustlers and the sots we saw on the low road. Their punishment consists in the endowment of a conscience, a Non-conformist conscience. And everything about this Hell will stink of moral shoddiness. From the prohibitions imposed upon my television viewing when I was a boy, I would expect to be entertained round-the-clock in this Hell by Monty Python and Benny Hill; as an older man, I think I shall be less astringent than my father, and allow those lewd comics some indulgence. Nevertheless, Hell will be awful. It will have a library whose catalogue index begins and ends with Cooper, Jilly. It will accommodate all those experiences that leave one with a residue of feeling done down, sold short, or self-demeaned. The only newspaper will be the Sunday Sport. Sex will be terrible: the gratification of lust with a brief fritter of cash, every act a betrayal of loved ones and family togetherness. Not a single opportunity for martyrdom or self-improvement will ever arise. Each Sunday morning will be spent in polishing a massive, highly-polished limousine; while from very far away drift snatches of those hymns that stand for comfort, generosity and cleanliness of spirit. In short, there will be no grace to one's existence. I could go on. But it is enough to say that in this Hell, no vultures will come to peck at your bowels. You will do it alone. And if you have none, then teeth will be provided.</p>

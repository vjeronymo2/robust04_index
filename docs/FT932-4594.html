			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (1): The worst may be over - Defence cuts and the slump in civil aviation have inflicted a severe downturn on the industry over the past two years. Now there are signs of slow recovery The aerospace industry would probably have preferred to gather in Lourdes rather than Paris this week for the world's biggest airshow. Barring a miracle, the industry, crippled by the worst cyclical downturn in its postwar history, still faces a few more years of heavy turbulence. But there are now signs that the worst is perhaps over. With the recent rescue by General Electric of the US of GPA, the world's biggest aircraft leasing company, which has been mired in a growing financial crisis over the past 12 months, the industry believes it has probably seen the end of the bad news. 'The entire industry has undergone open heart surgery and is now in intensive care waiting to recover slowly,' says a senior executive of the European Airbus consortium. Aerospace companies and airlines have had to adapt to three years of brutal recession - which unlike previous slumps has combined a sharp fall in activity in both the civil and the military sides of the business - by cutting production, restructuring and reducing staff on a huge scale, and intensifying their efforts to collaborate with other groups in mergers, partnerships and other strategic alliances. The traditional optimism of the industry has been replaced by a new sense of realism. Although the bottom has probably been reached in the current cycle, no one is yet prepared to forecast when the recovery will gather steam. The best estimates are late 1994 or early 1995. But even when the market does pick up again, it is unlikely to roar ahead as in previous cycles. Airlines, which have lost more than Dollars 10bn in the past three years, are still struggling to return to the black. Fierce fare wars, which reflect the continuing overcapacity in the market at a time of increasing liberalisation, will keep airline balance sheets under pressure. With no alternative but to reduce their overall costs, airlines have had to cancel or defer orders for new aircraft placed during the unprecedented buying binge of the late 1980s. In turn, manufacturers have had to accommodate these cancellations and deferrals by cutting production sharply. Boeing, the world's largest commercial aircraft manufac- turer, is reducing production by as much as a third from 32 to 21 airliners a month by 1994. Both Airbus and McDonnell Douglas have also been cutting output. Total deliveries of new airliners are now expected to drop to around 500 aircraft a year from a peak of 844 in 1991 and 790 last year. The ripple effect has been felt throughout the industry as suppliers and subcontractors, as well as manufacturers of smaller commuter and regional aircraft and aero-engine makers, have had to bite the bullet. Growth in air traffic is at last improving again and showing a real increase over 1990, the year before the Gulf conflict. This coupled with economic recession, sent traffic falling in 1991 for the first time since annual records started to be kept in 1929. But the growth has remained far lower than airlines had expected, leading to overcapacity throughout the industry. The restructurings, expenditure cuts, and aircraft order cancellations and deferrals are likely to start bringing capacity back to balance with travel demand by the end of this year. The retirement rate of older jets is also expected to bolster demand for new aircraft. Already, about 1,000 aircraft in the world airline fleet are 25 years old - the average life cycle of modern jets. The number is likely to rise to around 2,500 by the beginning of 1995. A robust recovery in the rate of new aircraft orders, in the short-term is unlikely, however, even though the industry continues to expect strong long-term demand for new aircraft, with deliveries worth more than Dollars 800bn forecast over the next 18 years. Until airline finances improve, the industry will face the challenge of financing the high cost of new equipment and aircraft. Most of the recent cost-cutting measures, according to Moody's, the US rating agency, will only partially offset the industry's weak financial position. 'We don't know what kind of airline industry will emerge from this recession, which has already taken some large airlines out of the game,' says Sir Ralph Robins, the chairman of Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine manufacturer. He expects little improvement in underlying trading conditions over the next two years. Manufacturers have also had to maintain a high rate of research and development spending on new products with long lead times in order to secure their longer-term future. With non-recurring research and development costs growing far more rapidly than inflation, manufacturers in all sectors of the civil aerospace industry, including airframes, aero-engines and components, have been scrambling to forge partnerships or, in some cases, combine their operations in mergers to reduce the high risks of new project development and to compete more strongly in an increasingly global and concentrated industry. Deutsche Aerospace has just taken over control of Fokker, the Dutch aircraft manufacturer, while McDonnell Douglas is seeking investors to acquire up to 49 per cent of its commercial aircraft activities based in Long Beach, California. Bombardier of Canada has absorbed Shorts, the Belfast manufacturer, Learjet, the US corporate aircraft maker, and De Havilland of Canada. British Aerospace has formed a joint company with Taiwan Aerospace for its regional jet business and is now looking for partners to invest in its turbopropeller aircraft activities. A similar trend of consolidation is now spreading through the defence sector. Since the end of the cold war, the defence market has been shrinking as governments have cut their defence spending and reduced the number of new programmes. The decline is expected to last several more years. By the turn of the century, the defence business could be half what it was in the 1980s. The consolidation of the industry has seen some companies opting to pull out of some businesses, while others have either sought to merge their activities with partners or expand by acquiring the defence businesses of rival companies. In the guided weapons sector, for example, the cold war spawned more companies in Europe and in the US making missiles or systems for missiles than could survive in an age of diminishing government defence budgets. This has led to a significant shake-up in the US with Loral's takeover of the former LTV group's guided weapons activities and the sale of General Dynamics' missiles division to Hughes Aircraft, part of General Motors. In Europe, British Aerospace is now considering the merger of its missiles business with those of the French Matra group, while other European manufacturers are also in active merger discussions. 'A process of natural selection is now taking place in the defence sector,' says Mr Keith Hodgkinson, aerospace analyst at Shearson Lehman. As the number of big new defence contracts declines, every deal has turned into a matter of 'life and death' for many companies, he explains. Under the circumstances, it is not surprising that trade tensions have continued to simmer on both sides of the Atlantic. Several US companies have decided not to exhibit at Paris because they claim French companies have used air shows to spy on them, a charge rejected with derision by France's aerospace industry. Although the US has finally reached a compromise with the European Commission on the long-running dispute over aircraft subsidies, accusations have continued to fly between Washington and Brussels over unfair government support for their respective industries. And while Airbus partners have agreed this year to collaborate with Boeing on joint studies to develop a new generation super jumbo, capable of seating up to 800 passengers, and marking what could perhaps be the beginning of a new realignment in the world aircraft industry, an atmosphere of suspicion and mutual distrust continues to prevail. This was eloquently reflected by the response of a senior Airbus executive to suggestions that the Europeans had attempted to spy on Boeing to gain information on its 747-400 jumbo. 'It's as if the famous French chef, Paul Bocuse, was caught spying at McDonald's to steal their cooking secrets,' he said.</p>

			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / GRE warns on bonuses and quits 'with-profits' sector GUARDIAN Royal Exchange, the insurance company, said yesterday it would stop selling 'with-profits' policies. The move intensifies speculation that investors in with-profits pensions and endowment policies - which support the majority of British mortgages - will face heavy cuts in the pay-outs they receive. Mr James Morley, GRE's finance director, said it was possible that some insurers' current with-profits policies would not be able to pay the bonuses needed to cover mortgages. He added: 'Membership of the (European) ERM means low inflation and low returns from equities. Paying out bonuses requires a high rate of return. If you are getting a low rate of return from your assets you have a mismatch which can only be addressed by reducing bonus rates.' GRE said the days of the traditional with-profits policy were numbered. Such policies now accounted for less than 30 per cent of its new business. It will now follow several other companies, including Standard Life, Scottish Amicable and Sun Life by offering only unit-linked and unitised with-profits policies, which put less strain on reserves in the early years of a policy, because bonuses only need to be added to premiums already paid, and not to a notional, much larger 'sum assured'. GRE said: 'We believe that the returns that are being declared by other companies simply cannot be sustained. They may well be buying their way into the various league tables of endowment performance. The historical returns we got in the 1980s cannot be maintained in the 1990s.' GRE itself cut both its reversionary bonus, paid annually, and its terminal bonus, paid only when a contract matures, at the beginning of this year. This badly affected its competitive position compared with other life offices. It finished bottom in this year's survey of pay-outs for 10-year policies by Money Management magazine, generally accepted as the industry standard. GRE's views on future bonuses were echoed by independent actuaries. Mr Charles Cannon, actuary with Mercer Fraser, said: 'Looking at the last five years it is clear that the bonuses being paid out by some companies are greater than could have been earned by the funds over those five years.' He said bonuses could not be supported from reserves forever, and predicted that pay-outs would be cut. Mr Nick Dumbreck, actuary with R. Watson, agreed. He said: 'There's no doubt that the with-profits life offices are feeling the pinch this year. We've seen a number of offices switching out of equities and into fixed interest, not necessarily because they believe fixed interest is going to perform better, but because they need it to maintain cover for their solvency margins.'

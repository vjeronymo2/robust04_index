			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tories accused of double standards on company links LABOUR Research Department, the union-funded research organisation, yesterday accused the government of double standards in dealing with breaches of company law by companies with links to the Conservative party. Focusing on the case of Hartley Investment Trust, an investment company which has a senior Conservative MP on its board of directors, the organisation asked whether there was 'one law for Tory MPs and another for other company directors'. The authorities had failed over several years to prosecute Hartley's directors in spite of the company's 'chequered' history in breaking company law, it said. According to the organisation, Hartley is so far 14 months late in filing its accounts for the year to March 1991 at Companies House and five months late in filing its 1992 accounts. Hartley filed its first three sets of accounts on time but since 1987 accounts had been 'consistently' filed late, the organisation said. It said Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the powerful 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers, had been a Hartley director since January 1989. Noting that Hartley gave more than Pounds 266,000 to the Conservatives or Scottish Conservatives in the six years to 1990, the organisation reprinted a direct-mailed letter from Mr Alan Lewis, the Hartley chairman, soliciting donations for the 1987 election campaign. 'My purpose in writing to you is to seek your assistance . . . to raise substantial funds to meet a special requirement of the Conservative party,' the letter said. 'The funds raised will be directed at specific aspects of election organisation and political campaigning by providing the constituencies with modern technology and advanced management systems.' Sir Marcus said yesterday he was satisfied Companies House was aware there was 'a very good reason' for the delay in filing the accounts. The company did not dispute it had filed the accounts late but said it had acted 'in all propriety'. Mr Lewis said the company had asked Peat Marwick, its auditor, to 'move forward as quickly as possible to resolve these accounts'. MPs last night approved new rules which will require them from next year to make more detailed declarations of their outside interests such as company directorships and membership of the Lloyd's of London insurance market. Among the extra information MPs will now be expected to provide are details of the Lloyd's syndicates to which they belong. In addition, MPs paid by consultants will in future be required to list all clients to which they have given services or advice, as well as the name of the consultancy. In a short debate in the Commons Mr Tony Newton, leader of the House, said he believed it would be right for MPs to accept the 'useful' improvements proposed by the Commons committee on members' interests. Mrs Margaret Beckett, the Labour party deputy leader, said she took the 'very strong' view that MPs owed the public its 'right of scrutiny' of information on outside interests that ought properly to be available to them.</p>

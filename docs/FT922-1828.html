			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Bearish factors overwhelm equities CONFIDENCE cracked on the London stock market yesterday in the face of a wave of alarming developments at home and abroad. Equities suffered their worst trading session of the year as the FT-SE Index fell nearly 40 points by mid-afternoon and large lines of blue chip stocks came on to the market. Most of the damage to share prices came early. London had already reacted strongly to the falls overnight of 400.24 on the Nikkei Index and 41.73 on the Dow Average when it was dealt a further and, in immediate terms, more serious blow. GPA, the world's largest aircraft leasing group, withdrew its planned Dollars 1bn global share offering, barely four hours before it was due to announce the pricing details. Not even this unprecedented development, however, proved to be the end of the day's woes. ICI's share price began to crumble as the first reports trickled back to the City from the company's meeting with analysts, who then began to cut profits forecasts for Britain's blue chip chemical group. The ICI meeting caused fresh doubts over the progress of UK companies. The Footsie dropped to a day's low of 2,558.6, abandoning an important support level as large blocks of stock in such well-known names as British Gas, Midland Bank and Hanson came on to the market. An attempted rally was unsuccessful and, although Wall Street was only 5 Dow points off in London trading hours, the UK market closed in a mood of gloom. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,562.7 for a day's loss of 35.7. The GPA decision, prompted by a lack of institutional support in London and the US, cast a chill over the rest of the aerospace sector and also discouraged stocks such as Wellcome and Lasmo where prospective share placings were threatened. The depressed state of the market yesterday masked a relatively favourable reception for the day's statistics on UK employment, unit costs and money supply. The increase in May's unemployment total was smaller than expected, and buttressed the view that 'economic recovery is in place rather than in doubt', according to Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull. Some of the pressures came from basket trading between stock and stock index futures. Today brings Triple Witching Hour on Wall Street and also expiry in London of the June contract on the Footsie. A very large seller of the September Footsie future appeared in London yesterday afternoon, and several leading trading houses were struggling to square up open positions between futures and the underlying blue chip stocks. Seaq-reported volume increased sharply to 517.9m shares from the 423.7m of the previous session. But these figures include both customer and intra-market business. Customer, or retail, activity in UK equities has remained light this week, and was worth only Pounds 868.7m on Wednesday. The low level of genuine customer investment business has left some traders with exposed positions in both the June contract on the Footsie and also in the blue chip stocks.</p>

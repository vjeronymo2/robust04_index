			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Armen Khanbabayan: "A Light Has Appeared at the </F> End of the Tunnel"]    [Text] In negotiations in Moscow the speaker of the  Azerbaijan parliament, R. Gulnev, announced to the minister of  defense of Russia, P. Grachev: "Azerbaijan is prepared to  cease-fire on the night of 28 April if Armenia will follow its  example." The leader of the Russian war department promised to  notify Yerevan of Baku's decision immediately, adding that "I am  convinced that the answer will be affirmative." Commenting on  this information, the radio station Mayak noted that, judging  from everything, Azerbaijan is prepared to join the Russian  peace initiative, which, as we know, "envisions the release of  all seized Azerbaijani territory and the return of the Karabakh  formations to within the confines of Nagorno Karabakh itself.  Along with them, Russian separation subdivisions will be  brought into these regions."    If all this is true, it would be difficult to overestimate  what has occurred. G. Aliyev's stubborn unwillingness to give  his consent to the introduction of Russian peace keepers into  Azerbaijan has finally been broken. And this happened because  of two circumstances. Armenia's latest successes in defending  the Nagorno Karabakh Republic in the southeastern section of  resistance created a very real threat both to Gyandzha and the  Yevlakh transportation and energy center. Practically all of  the right bank of the Kura ended up extremely vulnerable in  military terms. Further success of the Karabakh Army in these  areas would mean unconditional defeat for Azerbaijan.  Obviously, this scenario inevitably involves serious domestic  political collisions with an easily predictable result: New,  pro-Russian leaders will take over power in Baku. There is no  doubt that, for example, this was understood in Ankara, which  explains the advice from Hikmet Cetin to the Azerbaijan leader  to accept the Russian peace plan. Seeing that the war was lost  de facto and his closest ally was washing his hands of it, G.  Aliyev probably decided to try to save what still might be saved  -- his power.    Time will tell whether he will succeed in the end; only the  winners will not be judged, and the losers always will be. One  thing is clear today: Russia will gain one more (after Abkhazia)  large military-political victory in the Transcaucasus. And  again -- with no effort on its part -- but that is not the main  thing. The main thing is that it is above all our common  Armenian victory-- military and political and diplomatic and  moral.    But is it not too soon to speak about that? After all,  anything could happen, and even Russia's position, as we know,  can very quickly undergo remarkable metamorphoses.    Still one wants to hope that today will be the turning point  in the situation. There will undoubtedly be new, quite  justified misgivings and concerns related to the fact that the  people of Karabakh will apparently have to gradually begin to  deploy troops closer to their borders, but there is also the  hope for peace, the hope for termination of the blockade, that  during the course of very lengthy and complicated negotiations  the diplomats will find a new status for Karabakh, which will be  acceptable primarily to the people of Karabakh themselves.    There is no doubt that the process of transition from a  state  of war to a state of peace will be long, hard, and fraught with  numerous complications, snags, and various kinds of surprises.  We must be prepared for this. Ultimately we were able to prove  to ourselves and to the entire world that we are worth something  as a nation, that force, and war, and a blockade could not break  us and could not provoke us to internecine strife. Therefore,  the time will definitely come when the crown of thorns on the  head of the people will be replaced by a wreath of laurels.    In the cruel winter cold, under conditions of the  large-scale  Azerbaijan offensives in Karabakh, when there was no light in  the homes for weeks and the front was caving in and it seemed  that defeat was around the corner, the president of the Republic  firmly, confidently, and solemnly promised: This year we will  start up the nuclear power plant, we will adopt a constitution  suitable for a free, democratic country, and we will achieve  peace with dignity. Did many of our compatriots at that time  believe our president without reservations?</p>

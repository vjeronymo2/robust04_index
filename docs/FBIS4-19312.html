			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 15 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu, currently on a European tour, met his  British counterpart Douglas Hurd in London Friday [15 April] to  discuss the North Korean nuclear dispute and other issues of  mutual interest. Hurd invited President Kim Yong-sam to visit  London during his one-hour talk with Han.    Han explained recent developments after the UN Security  Council issued a statement calling on North Korea to permit  nuclear inspections, including Kim's summits in Japan and China  and his own trip to the two countries, the United States and  Russia, and his meeting with Hans Blix, director-general of the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    The foreign minister elaborated on Seoul's decisions to  withdraw its demand for an inter-Korean exchange of envoys as a  precondition to further high-level Pyongyang-Washington talks  and to accommodate North Korean loggers fleeing from Siberian  camps.    London expressed "a full understanding" of Seoul's new  measures as well as hope that the nuclear issue would now be  resolved.    Han thanked Hurd for Britain's support in handling the  nuclear problem on the international stage, to which Hurd  responded with a promise of continued cooperation.    The British secretary said his government welcomes a visit  by  President Kim anytime.    Han met British strategy experts later in the evening to  further discuss the nuclear issue and is scheduled to speak at a  lunch Saturday sponsored by a non-governmental body, the  Korea-Britain Forum.</p>

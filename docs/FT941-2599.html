			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Legal &amp; General bonus rate cuts - At a glance Legal &amp; General has cut all its with-profits reversionary bonus rates but those on terminal bonuses are mixed, with some being held, others cut and some increased compared to 1993 rates. The maturity value of a 25-year with-profits endowment policy, taken out by a man aged 29 paying Pounds 30 a month, will be Pounds 62,043 on April 1, a slight rise from Pounds 60,112 last year. Maturity values for 10-year endowments are virtually unchanged while the value of a 15-year endowment on the same assumptions will be lower at Pounds 14,237 compared with Pounds 14,742 last year.</p>

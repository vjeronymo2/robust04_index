			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Yeutter anxious on the sidelines ANXIOUSLY awaiting the outcome of yesterday's US-EC farm trade talks in Washington was Mr Clayton Yeutter, former US trade representative, and one of the midwives at the birth of the trade talks in Uruguay in 1986. Mr Yeutter brought the case against EC oilseeds subsidies to Geneva in 1987, against the urging of Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, who told him the EC would soon alter its subsidy programme. 'I told MacSharry that with the size of the subsidies offered, I'd grow oilseeds on the top of the Alps,' Mr Yeutter says. 'At leisure' since President Bush lost the presidential election on November 3, Mr Yeutter went on to become agriculture secretary, Republican party chairman, and a White House adviser. 'MacSharry wanted to change the programme. He just didn't get it done,' he says.' This is no minor dispute that can be held on the backburner for years.' With no breakthrough soon, time will run out on the Uruguay Round. The US president loses his 'fast-track' authority to negotiate after March 1. Mr Yeutter believes the Democratic Congress could well extend President Clinton's negotiating authority, but waiting entails risks. Congress is likely to attach protectionist constraints to the legislation. In his first appearance on the international trade stage, President Clinton would be under pressure, Mr Yeutter said, not to 'give away the store'. Because he is likely to 'take on' his labour supporters to get approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement, 'he will have to give them something in the Uruguay Round context'. That is likely to be labour rights. There would be months of delays while a new US negotiating team is prepared to continue Uruguay Round negotiations.</p>

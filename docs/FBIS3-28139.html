Premier Kiet recalled the Vietnamese people's tradition of  industry and thrift. He stressed that to practise thrift and  fight against public property embezzlement and wastefulness have  become ever more urgent in Vietnam, a poor country which is  fighting against the danger of lagging behind others in the  region, and which needs economic accumulation for its own  industrialization and modernization.    The prime minister said he himself and many others worried  about the situation such as capital construction whose wasteful  expenditures and losses accounted for at least 10-20 per cent of  its capital. He called for stepping up the on-going nationwide  a campaign for practising economy and fight against public  property embezzlement.    He also recalled the government's responsibility in working  out, and guiding the implementation of policies encouraging  thrift practice and embezzlement prevention. The authorities at  all levels should work out concrete and practical plans of  action for thrift practice and embezzlement prevention in state  institutions, enterprises and in society as a whole, the prime  minister stressed.</p>

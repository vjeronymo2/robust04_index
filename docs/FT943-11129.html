			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / International Company News: Mobil slips into deficit after Dollars 680m charge Mobil, the US oil group, plans to take a Dollars 680m charge against first-quarter earnings to reflect an inventory accounting change, Reuter reports from Fairfax, Virginia. The change was in the method of applying the lower of cost or market test for crude oil and product inventories, the company said. It will push Mobel into the red for the period. Mobil said the restatement would result in a loss of Dollars 145m for the first quarter, against a previously reported profit of Dollars 535m. For the first six months net profit would be Dollars 53m, or 60 cents a share, against Dollars 733m, or Dollars 1.77. Mobil uses last-in, first-out costing to account for the book value of inventories. In prior years, book value was compared with current market prices on a worldwide basis when determining the value to be recorded.</p>

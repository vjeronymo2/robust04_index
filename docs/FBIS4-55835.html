			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ondrej Dostal: "`Pro-Government' Versus </F> `Opposition' Parties: 35.8 Percent to 25.1 Percent"]    [Text] Yesterday we published the results of a  representative survey of public opinion that was conducted by  Slovak Radio's Methodological Research Department at the  beginning of May. It transpires that, at the time of the  survey, only three political entities -- the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], the Party of the Democratic Left  [SDL], and the Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] -- managed to  cross on their own the threshold of 5 percent of votes needed to  enter the parliament. However, apart from them, there exist  another nine political entities that are preferred by more than  2 percent of voters (after subtracting those who do not want to  go to the polls or who did not give a reply). From the total  number of respondents, 50 percent supported one of the  parliamentary parties and 16.8 percent one of the  extraparliamentary parties. Parliamentary parties supporting  the government gained 26.2 percent, opposition parliamentary  parties 23.8 percent, extraparliamentary parties cooperating  with the government parties 9.6 percent, and extraparliamentary  parties cooperating with the opposition parties 1.3 percent.  Hence, the overall ratio of preferences of "pro-government"  versus "opposition" parties is 35.8 percent to 25.1 percent.    If the election results coincided with the results of the  survey and if no pre-election coalitions were formed, the  National Council of the Slovak Republic would be composed as  follows: HZDS -- 84 deputies; SDL -- 35 deputies; KDH -- 31  deputies. If we took into consideration also the actually  functioning Hungarian parliamentary coalition, the HZDS would  have 72 deputies, SDL 30 deputies, KDH 27 deputies, and the  Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH]- Coexistence  coalition 21 deputies.    The electoral preferences of coalitions made up of entities  with a similar orientation were also ascertained during the  survey. The following composition of the parliament would arise  from replies to this question: Coalition of nationally oriented  parties (HZDS, Slovak National Party, Christian Social Union) --  54 deputies; coalition of left-wing and social democratic  parties (SDL, Social Democratic Party in Slovakia, Green Party  in Slovakia, Farmers Movement) -- 41 deputies; coalition of  right-wing and liberal parties (KDH, Democratic Party, National  Democratic Party-New Alternative, Democratic Union, Party of  Entrepreneurs and Tradesmen) -- 35 deputies; and coalition of  Hungarian parties (Coexistence, MKDH, Hungarian Civic Party) --  20 deputies.</p>

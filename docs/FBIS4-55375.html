			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, May 12 -- President Lech Walesa received the  Chief of Staff of the Chinese Army General Zhang Wannian on  Thursday and said "It would be beautiful for Poland" if there  was a Polish-Chinese alliance. "I am very pleased that I will  become acquainted with the point of view of a great state, a  great army on what is happening in Europe," Walesa said. The  chief of staff of the Polish army, General Tadeusz Wilecki  attended the meeting.    "After these great changes, attempted changes, we are in a  quite strange and unclear situation," Walesa said, commenting on  the feeling of insecurity among the countries of central and  eastern Europe. "It is true that the Soviet Union no longer  exists but there are other countries which have nuclear weapons  at their disposal. We are searching for security. We are  searching for an alliance which could guarantee this security,"  Walesa explained adding that it would be beautiful if there were  such an alliance with China.</p>

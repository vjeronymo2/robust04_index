			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> AS LAKE DRIES UP, THE REMAINS OF SUBMERGED TOWN APPEAR  </P> <P> An old bridge has risen and foundations are peeking up from the water as the  town of Monticello -- destroyed and flooded more than 30 years ago -- reemerges  from a drought-shrunken lake.  </P> <P> With each dry day, receding Lake Berryessa reveals more remains of the town,  once a thriving farming community before the government claimed it for a dam  and reservoir in the 1950s.  </P> <P> "There was almost nothing left when they got through," remembered Harold  Moskowitz, 64. "They paid us off, gave buildings away, tore some down and  burned some. What they couldn't burn they buried."  </P> <P> Now hundreds of tourists and former town residents are trekking to the lake,  about 50 miles northeast of San Francisco, to glimpse the past and remember the  town's century of life.  </P> <P> "I think people are coming back because they are still distressed and remember  being uprooted," said Ronnie McGuinnis, a maintenance worker for the U.S.  Bureau of Reclamation, which manages the lake and recreational area.  </P> <P> About 500 people lived in the valley around the turn of the century but the  population dwindled to about 125 by the 1950s when water was getting scarce as  Northern California grew. The federal government formed a plan with Solano  County to dam Putah River to create a reservoir in the valley, which sits  mostly in adjacent Napa County.  </P> <P> The 1,000-foot-long, 304-foot-high Monticello Dam created a reservoir that  supplies Solano County.  </P> <P> Berryessa normally is three miles across at its widest point and 26 miles long,  but is about one-third that size after losing 60% of its water. Last week, the  lake surface fell to 377 feet above sea level -- nearly one dozen feet lower  than during the drought of 1976-77 and 63 feet below normal.  </P> <P> "If it doesn't rain, this lake could dry up in a few years, then you'll really  get to see the whole town," said Jim Peterson, maintenance foreman for the  reclamation bureau.  </P></p>

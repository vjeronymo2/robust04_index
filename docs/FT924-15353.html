			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Abolition of wages councils urged ABOLITION of the remaining wages councils and privatisation of the government conciliation service Acas are being urged on the eve of the Conservative Party conference by the Institute of Direct-ors. The government said earlier this year it saw no 'permanent place' for wages councils, which at present set minimum rates for about 10 per cent of the working population. There has been speculation that their abolition would be included in this autumn's employment bill. Some campaigners against abolition believe that Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, will announce the winding up of the councils at the Conservative conference this week. The belief is based partly on a hostile response from the Department of Employment to a recent letter from the Equal Opportunities Commission urging retention of the councils in the interests of women, who make up nearly 2m of the 2.5m people covered by the councils. The department pointed out that most of the low-paid live in households with other incomes and are not poor. The Trades Union Congress will be lobbying delegates to the Conservative conference in Brighton today. The TUC argues that abolition of the wages councils will push thousands of people below the poverty line and points to a recent NOP survey which found that nine out of 10 people support protection for people on low pay. Supporting abolition of the 26 remaining wages councils - mainly covering service industries such as hotels and restaurants - the IoD argues that the councils, far from protecting workers, constitute a bureaucratic intervention in the labour market that is especially onerous on businesses employing fewer than 50 people. The IoD is also calling for the abolition of the licensing of employment agencies and for measures to ensure equal tax treatment of employees and the self-employed. The present system of licensing employment agencies, the IoD says, does not appear to provide any genuine protection for those using them, but the cost of compliance imposes an excessive burden on business. 'These measures will encourage labour market flexibility and contribute to British industry's recovery from recession,' said Dr Ann Robinson, head of the IoD policy unit.</p>

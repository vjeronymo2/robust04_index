			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Florida Gov. Bob Martinez, who favors calling a special session of the state's  Legislature to enact new restrictions on abortions, said he expects "very  aggressive" lobbying by both sides but hopes there will be no use of violent  tactics. The Republican governor, appearing on ABC's "This Week With David  Brinkley," said areas of possible compromise "between the rights of the unborn  and the rights of women" include permitting abortions in cases of rape, incest  or where the mother's health is threatened. Also interviewed was Vermont's  Democratic Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin, who criticized the Supreme Court's decision  upholding a Missouri statute restricting abortions.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Eduard Ergartovich Rossel by Lyubov </F> Tsukanova; place and date not given: "Good Laws Are Our Field,  Deputy Eduard Rossel Believes"]    [Text] [Tsukanova] The removal of a "good" governor came  as a surprise to many people. What about you?    [Rossel] We foresaw this turn of events. Although, in  campaigning for a real regional policy, we acted strictly within  the framework of the then-Constitution and were aware that this  would meet with opposition from certain people and political  structures at the center. What is the result? A quite  successful Oblast Soviet was dissolved. The population was  disappointed. And this disappointment resulted in just 49  percent of the oblast's inhabitants turning up at polling  stations in December.    [Tsukanova] How do you explain the president's decision?    [Rossel] I think that the president has not hitherto been  given any logical and complete information about our initiatives  and actions. We have even encountered a situation where  officials who came along to investigate acted in accordance with  the well-known principle: "We have not read your constitution,  but we condemn it." But, to be serious, I am convinced that  there are people who were very interested in capturing  Sverdlovsk Oblast from the president. And they attained their  objective....    [Tsukanova] Why did you decide to stand for the Federation  Council?    [Rossel] I supported the idea that leaders of the executive  should not be part of the legislature. We have already endured  that situation and nothing good came of it. And, after I was  removed, I decided to take part in the elections in order to  bring the idea of regional autonomy to its conclusion via the  Federation Council. It is not only a matter of our oblast, it  is a question of all 68 Russian oblasts, which still have even  fewer rights than the republics. That must not be, just as  there should not be loved and unloved children in a family.    [Tsukanova] For various reasons public opinion is now more  occupied with the situation in the State Duma. The Federation  Council is somewhat in the background. How do you see the work  of the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly?    [Rossel] The Federation Council is not politicized and that  really counterbalances the Duma. It includes people from the  localities who are not so much skilled speakers as responsible  for the fate of the regions. People confronted with the  territories' specific problems. They come face to face with  all manner of obstacles and lack of laws, making it impossible  to organize normal activity. I think that the Federation  Council will have a sobering effect on the Duma deputies if the  laws they formulate are adopted to suit the short-term political  situation or if they fail to take regional interests into  consideration.    The Federation Council's standing orders and the  organization  of its apparatus are important (the apparatus does not now make  provision for a structure tackling regional policy), what we  need is a scheme for cooperating with the Duma, the president,  and the government. All this has to be worked out. Standing  orders should envisage total autonomy for the Federation  Council. I am opposed to the Federation Council forming a bloc  with the Duma, the government, etc.    I think that everything that the Supreme Soviet did must be  analyzed as a matter of urgency and the priorities determined --  which draft laws should be tackled first. The question of the  Constitution, adopted in breach of the existing law on the  referendum, will inevitably come up. It will either be  necessary to adopt amendments to the law or seek another  solution to the situation. Other matters of urgency include the  laws on the fight against crime and precisely targeted social  security for the population. These are laws necessary to ensure  tranquillity in the country and stability in the state.    [Tsukanova] You mentioned the autonomy of the Federation  Council. However, many State Duma deputies think differently;  they want to cooperate as actively as possible with their  colleagues in the Federation Council or seek a common field of  activity. In particular, as far as regional interests are  concerned. Especially since a considerable proportion of Duma  deputies have been elected by the territories. Do you intend,  say, to cooperate with your Duma colleagues who were elected by  Sverdlovsk Oblast?    [Rossel] I don't see any difficulties or conflict in doing  this. Not only do I intend to do so, but we have already begun  to cooperate: We have founded the Ural deputies' assembly and  intend to register it with the Ministry of Justice. This  assembly is to comprise both Federation Council and State Duma  deputies. We will have our parliamentary center equipped with  its own computer system: Given that each deputy may have one or  two assistants, we will select specialists. And the entire Ural  region will know that that it can submit proposals and plans in  need of legislative confirmation. This will be a center for  public discussion of the draft laws being prepared by the  parliament, a feedback mechanism. This kind of work is far more  effective than hovering around microphones. There is sufficient  intellectual potential in the Urals to provide legislators with  effective aid.    [Tsukanova] Moscow is always -- particularly now -- accused  of focusing on elitist political problems and showing little  interest in provincial life. What is life like now for the  "rest" of Russia? What does it expect from deputies first and  foremost?    [Rossel] I would say that in terms of its political behavior  Moscow has itself become a province. In terms of their view of  economic reform and reform of the political authority the  regions are now ahead. Not to mention their understanding of  the crux of regional policy. There are simply not the people in  Moscow to tackle this. Incidentally, Boris Yeltsin said this at  an enlarged session of the Council of Ministers in November.  There is nothing surprising in components of the Federation  trying to change their status -- that is the result of  government omissions in the regional sphere.    What is life like for the provinces? As a candidate deputy I  met a lot of people. The number-one question was social  security. The weakest people -- and there are plenty of them in  our country -- must not feel abandoned. Question number-two is  how are we going to escape from the economic crisis. I am  certain that we initially adopted the wrong way of reforming the  economy. We took the political rather than the economic road,  across the board. But I also know that we cannot interfere now  and make any drastic changes. The worst thing would be for us  to now start sharply twitching to the left, right, and  backwards. Because we have taken this route, we must see it  through to the end. Privatization cannot be halted. The  efforts to stabilize the ruble must continue. The economy must  be demonopolized and small and middling business developed: The  steps now being taken to do this are patently inadequate. As  for stabilizing decisions, I repeat, the first thing is to  provide precisely targeted social security and then invest in  individual capital construction, i.e., in housing. This must be  done immediately. We must undoubtedly think over the state  program for food safety. And the state security program as a  whole: It is necessary to have it out with the Army and all the  relevant structures.    [Tsukanova] Do you think that society can count on the  parliament's working fruitfully? If you had a chance to appeal  to your deputy colleagues, what would you say to them?    [Rossel] I would urge them to abandon politics and tackle  the real problems facing society today. I would urge that there  be no confrontations. We now have a legislative vacuum. We  must tackle in earnest laws that would make it possible to  advance economic and political reforms. It is this legislative  work that will bear real fruit. [Rossel ends]    Our Information: The Oblast Soviet was disbanded 10 November  1993 by edict of President Yeltsin shortly after the Oblast  Soviet adopted the constitution of the Ural Republic, the  constitution was revoked, and the governor of the nonexistent  republic -- officially head of the Sverdlovsk Oblast  administration -- Eduard Rossel, removed from his post. A  routine planning session of the economic association of the Ural  region that met the following day elected Rossel its president.  He was previously the voluntary head of the association. And on  12 December, 61 percent of the oblast's population who turned  out to vote elected the former head of the administration as  their representative to the upper chamber of the Federal  Assembly -- the Federation Council.</p>

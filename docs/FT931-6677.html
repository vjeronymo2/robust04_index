			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Books: Israel's Cicero PERSONAL WITNESS: ISRAEL THROUGH MY EYES by Abba Eban Jonathan Cape Pounds 25, 671 pages TEMPERAMENTALLY, Abba Eban never quite fitted into Israeli politics, although he was at its centre from the country's birth. Donnish, remote, supremely articulate, his precise grandiloquent style jarred against the untidy, reflexive mode characteristic of Israelis. He here recalls how Harold Wilson once suggested that he lacked a killer's instinct in politics - surely an unfair judgment, since in the arena of international diplomacy, where he excelled, Eban frequently demonstrated that instinct to telling effect. His problem was not a deficiency in ruthlessness so much as a lack of suitable armoury for the rough and tumble of Israeli politics, which favours the bludgeon above the rapier. He seems to be seduced by the cadence of language and intellectual symmetry to the point of being oblivious to the gut sensibilities of his public. This book describes a long, distinguished career in Israeli public life, from initiation into the high echelons of pre-state Zionist politics at the precocious age of 22, to the retired eminence that he has been enjoying for a number of years now. Born in South Africa and raised in this country, he gave up a promising academic life in Cambridge to live in and serve the emerging Jewish state. He was Israel's first ambassador to the United Nations and Washington, Foreign Minister, Minister of Education, and Deputy Prime Minister. As might be expected, his elevated view of the country's evolution allied to meticulous recall guarantees that his account is authoritative and comprehensive. Yet something about the assured flow of his narrative suggests a selective retrospection, with an element of score-settling and self-vindication in mind. Mr Eban's invaluable contribution to Israel's struggle has been in diplomacy, and the parts of the book which deal with his years as Israel's envoy to the UN and to Washington are the most exciting. It is here that the eloquence of his prose complements his incisive sense of irony. Few of his contemporaries on the diplomatic circuit could show such an assured grasp of world affairs. Fewer still had the gift of summing up a complex situation as lucidly and concisely as he could. The Suez crisis tested his abilities to the full. He came through, as in subsequent crises, with flying colours. The esteem in which he was held by statesmen who were not renowned for their affection for Israel is illustrated by one of his encounters with the then American Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles. In early November 1956 Eban made a crucial speech to the UN General Assembly: 'It was past 2.00 in the morning when the vote came . . . As I walked down to the lobby, Dulles was waiting there . . . he began to speak with typically forensic professionalism: 'Listen, you didn't seem to be reading. Did you have a manuscript?' I told him that, owing to pressure of time, I had not prepared my speech at all . . . He looked at me hard and offered a memorable tribute: 'Jesus Christ,' he said, as he stalked away. I was later told that this was the only occasion on which that austere churchman had been heard to utter the familiar but irreverent expletive.' Unfortunately, Eban was never fully appreciated in Israel. Perhaps the reason is that his moderation flowed from an alien rationality. His book, rich in insights, resonant in language, is the story of the Jewish state told by a Cicero, not a Thucydides.</p>

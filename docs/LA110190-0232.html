			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEPUTIES START PATROLS IN LONG BEACH  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies begin patrolling the north end of Long Beach today to help  the city's beleaguered, understaffed police tackle skyrocketing crime.  </P> <P> The sheriff's patrols will cover 20% of the city, freeing 42 Long Beach police  officers to work other parts of town or handle other assignments. Ten officers  will be reassigned to the detective division by the end of the year to work on  a huge backlog of unsolved crimes, police officials said.  </P> <P> The four-year, $19.9-million sheriff's contract makes Long Beach the first city  in the state to have two law enforcement agencies within its boundaries.  </P> <P> Forty-three deputies will patrol the north part of town in cars bearing both  the sheriff's six-pointed star and the city's logo, a modern depiction of a  skyline and ocean.  </P> <P> Starting today, emergency 911 calls from residents in areas north of Market  Street and north of Spring Street, east of Lakewood Boulevard, are being routed  to the Lakewood sheriff's station.  </P> <P> Police Chief Lawrence Binkley and other officials said the city department will  still be understaffed.  </P> <P> In the detective division, for example, an extra 10 detectives "will help" but  will not be sufficient to clear hundreds of backlogged cases, Assistant Police  Chief Eugene Brizzolara said.  </P> <P> Long Beach had the worst record of any major California city in 1989 for  solving serious and violent crimes, according to the state Department of  Justice. Police failed to solve 74% of the rapes, 87% of the robberies and 93%  of the burglaries reported in 1989.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, Binkley ordered the city's 157 detectives to work six-day  weeks; the mandatory overtime will continue despite the additional detectives,  Brizzolara said this week. "We'll still be short," he said.  </P> <P> Binkley said: "The problem is the same old thing. I need people everywhere. I  need them in patrol, traffic, metro, gang unit and detectives -- just  everywhere."  </P> <P> Although the department budget calls for 691 officers, there are 45 vacancies.  Another 40 officers are off and 25 are working light duty because of injuries,  Brizzolara said. In addition, 43 officers are eligible to retire in December.  </P> <P> The department has been unable to recruit enough new officers to fill the void.  Twelve recruits are in training, Brizzolara said. Sheriff's deputies are  expected to help fill the gap while the city recruits more officers.  </P> <P> Fifteen of the deputies will patrol the northeast; 25 will be based in the  northern section, which has a higher crime rate, Sheriff's Lt. Bob Mirabella  said.  </P> <P> In addition, the Sheriff's Department will provide a team leader to coordinate  enforcement policies, a community relations deputy and a lieutenant who will be  a liaison between the two agencies, according to Deputy City Manager John  Williams.  </P> <P> The contract also calls for the Sheriff's Department to provide three community  service officers, who are uniformed civilians, and follow-up detective service  for cases generated by the deputies.  </P> <P> The deputies assigned to Long Beach this week underwent two days of training,  including meetings with community leaders and a tour of north and northeast  Long Beach. All the deputies volunteered for the Long Beach assignment.  </P> <P> "Everything is in place," said Sheriff's Division Chief Ray Morris, who  oversees Southeast Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> Mirabella, the sheriff's lieutenant who will be the liaison between the two  agencies, said the only problem so far has been switching 911 calls.  </P> <P> "We had some technical problems with the phone," Mirabella said. "(But) we put  in a lot of extra hours, and we're now in a posture where everything that had  to be done has been done."  </P> <P> Long Beach police will continue to oversee some services in the areas to be  patrolled by deputies. Police, for example, will still be responsible for the  anti-drug program in the schools, helicopter patrols and special event permits.  </P> <P> During a meeting Monday night with 25 North Long Beach residents -- one in a  series of community meetings -- representatives from the Police Department, the  city and the Sheriff's Department expressed optimism about the deputy patrols.  </P> <P> "You're going to see law enforcement you haven't seen in a long time," Mayor  Ernie Kell said.  </P> <P> Councilman Warren Harwood, who represents the area to be patrolled, told the  group that he expects the deputies to "do quality police work and suppress the  troublemakers. We're tired of the thugs running our streets."  </P> <P> For resident Larry Wright, it's too late. The father of three said he plans to  sell his home and move to Orange County.  </P> <P> "I've been a North Long Beach resident for six years, and I've just had it,"  Wright told the officials. "I don't think the Long Beach Police Department did  a good job at all."  </P> <P> Wright complained after the meeting that police were rarely seen patrolling the  neighborhood, despite a growing number of shootings in the area.  </P> <P> Others, however, defended the department. One resident said: "It seems to me  that we've given up on the Long Beach Police Department."  </P> <P> The resident echoed the concerns of many officers, who fear that the department  will eventually be dismantled.  </P> <P> Some city officials said they are open to that idea, while others vehemently  deny the possibility.  </P> <P> "This is not intended to be a long-term contract," Williams, the city's  assistant city manager, told the resident.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Cmdr. John Hammargren said earlier in the week: "We're not here to do  anything more than our job. We don't see our roles as threatening."  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> Faced with a burgeoning crime problem and an understaffed Police Department,  the Long Beach City Council approved a four-year contract with the Los Angeles  County Sheriff's Department on Sept. 4. But the decision to hire 43 deputies to  patrol the north parts of town met with overwhelming opposition from several  community organizations. The local branch of the National Assn. for the  Advancement of Colored People, among others, argued that the actions of  deputies, who are county employees, would not be under review by the newly  created Long Beach Citizen Police Complaint Commission. City leaders and  sheriff's representatives said complaints can be filed with the Sheriff's  Department and other agencies.  </P></p>

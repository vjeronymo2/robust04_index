			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLIPPERS SEND TIMBERWOLVES PACKING;  </P> <P> PRO BASKETBALL: THEY END FIVE-GAME LOSING STREAK, 101-96 IN OVERTIME, AND GET  EVEN FOR LOSS TO EXPANSION TEAM EARLIER THIS MONTH.  </P> <P> After losing to the expansion Minnesota Timberwolves earlier this month, and  after a 33-point loss Saturday to the Utah Jazz, the Clippers needed a victory  over Minnesota Monday night to regain some confidence.  </P> <P> Game 70, Charles Smith said, was crucial.  </P> <P> "With the losses and the bad display against Utah, when nothing went right," he  said after the Clippers ended a five-game losing streak, 101-96 in overtime at  the Sports Arena, "this was a definite boost for us."  </P> <P> The Clippers (27-43) earned it. They made all three field-goal attempts and  seven of nine free throws in overtime, Danny Manning getting six of his 26  points then.  </P> <P> With the Timberwolves supplying their usual solid defense, the score was 88-88  with 53 seconds remaining. The Clippers picked this as their time to waste  opportunities.  </P> <P> First, Ken Norman cut to the basket as Manning threw him a pass. The ball  sailed untouched into the Minnesota bench.  </P> <P> The Timberwolves couldn't capitalize, Tyrone Corbin's attempt from the right  side missing with two seconds left on the shot clock and about 17 left overall.  The Clippers rebounded and brought the ball upcourt and didn't notice Coach Don  Casey standing at mid-court screaming for a timeout.  </P> <P> "Next time, we're planning to shoot flares up for timeout calls," Casey said  later.  </P> <P> Instead, Winston Garland launched a straight-away three-point attempt. That  missed, and when Sam Mitchell grabbed the rebound, Minnesota called a timeout  with 4 seconds left.  </P> <P> The Timberwolves' final try to avoid overtime was a turnaround jumper by Tony  Campbell as the buzzer sounded.  </P> <P> That shot missed, too, as neither team scored in the final 2:05 of regulation.  </P> <P> Minnesota, which beat the Clippers by 18 points in their last meeting, March 8  at Minneapolis, warmed up for the rematch by shocking Portland Sunday night.  Twenty-four hours later, in the final stop of a six-game trip, the Timberwolves  led almost from the start.  </P> <P> En route to a 50-46 advantage at halftime, they never trailed by more than one  point, and that was in the opening quarter. From 17-16, the Timberwolves set  the pace, helped, of course, by 67% shooting (10 of 15) in the first quarter.  </P> <P> Minnesota's lead went to eight points, 58-50, midway through the third quarter,  but the Clippers cut that down within minutes. They tied the score several  times and finally went ahead, 69-67, when Smith made two free throws with 30  seconds to play.  </P> <P> The Timberwolves got a free throw from Scott Roth with 23 seconds left to make  it a one-point game. That's where it stayed until the end of the quarter.  </P> <P> Clipper Notes  </P> <P> Ron Harper will return the final week of the season, even if only to watch. The  Clipper guard, who has been rehabilitating his injured right knee close to home  in Cleveland since undergoing reconstructive surgery Jan. 23, is expected at  the Sports Arena for the April 21 season finale against the Lakers and might  also make it to Golden State or Seattle on the trip that precedes the Laker  game.  </P> <P> "He's much more mobile now," agent Mark Termini said. "Everything is going real  good, and Ron said he wanted to be part of the team again."  </P> <P> The trip will also have business overtones -- Termini plans to meet with  Clipper officials to begin formal negotiations on a new contract. Harper will  become a restricted free agent after this season.  </P> <P> Winston Garland suffered bruises on his left hip, neck and head after a fall  with 2:02 to play in overtime. He reported soreness after the game and will be  checked again today.  </P> <P> Benoit Benjamin did not start after missing the morning shoot-around. Charles  Smith opened at center, giving the Clippers their 20th starting lineup in 70  games. Benjamin said he had personal business. . . . The Clippers and the  Lakers will play Wednesday at the Sports Arena.  </P></p>

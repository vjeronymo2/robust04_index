			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> BRADBURY TO ASSIST IN NEPOTISM INQUIRY;  </P> <P> PERSONNEL: THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ORDERS AN INVESTIGATION INTO ALLEGATIONS  INVOLVING THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S CHILD SUPPORT DIVISION.  </P> <P> A showdown between Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury and the county Board of  Supervisors was averted late Tuesday when Bradbury agreed to cooperate with an  investigation into charges of nepotism within his Child Support Division.  </P> <P> The supervisors on Tuesday ordered an inquiry into employee union allegations  that the district attorney has violated county work rules by allowing C.  Stanley Trom to keep his new wife, Margaret, on his staff and that Trom has  favored her over co-workers.  </P> <P> Bradbury, adamant that no rule has been broken and angry that the issue was not  resolved Tuesday, said after the hearing that the supervisors have no authority  over his office and that he may not cooperate with a probe by the county  Personnel Department.  </P> <P> The veteran district attorney said that if he allowed the inquiry he would  insist that workers complaining about the Troms "sit across the table" from him  and state their concerns, rather than voicing them anonymously as has often  been the case so far.  </P> <P> But late in the day, after a lengthy conversation with board Chairwoman Madge  L. Schaefer, Bradbury said he had decided to assist Personnel Director Ronald  Komers in his probe. He said that he would not insist on participating in the  interviews nor that Komers identify complainants by name.  </P> <P> Schaefer, who had called Bradbury after being asked by The Times about his  earlier comments on the board's lack of authority, said: "I just called him and  said, 'What is this?' We ended the conversation by agreeing that the board did  share his concern about the personal effects of this on everybody."  </P> <P> Schaefer said: "I think Mike Bradbury does a fantastic job, but he is not  unlike any other human being. There are times when he feels very passionately  about an issue, and he feels very strongly about this issue."  </P> <P> Indeed, even upon reflection, Bradbury said Tuesday evening that regardless of  the new probe's findings, he will transfer neither Trom nor his wife to new  jobs.  </P> <P> "I can guarantee you that the Troms' employment status will not change as long  as I'm district attorney, period," Bradbury had said earlier. "I'm fed up with  the Troms getting knocked from pillar to post on this issue."  </P> <P> Tuesday's developments follow months of unrest that have forced the internal  workings of the Child Support Division into the public eye.  </P> <P> At issue legally is whether Bradbury can allow Trom to keep ombudsperson  Escobar Trom on his 135-worker child-support staff.  </P> <P> The couple married in October, sparking protests from the Public Employees  Assn. of Ventura County. The union insisted that Trom indirectly supervised his  wife and branded Bradbury's reassignment of Escobar Trom to another supervisor  a sham.  </P> <P> The county Civil Service Commission, responding to the union complaint, last  week found Bradbury in violation of an anti-nepotism rule and recommended that  the Board of Supervisors arrange the transfer of Escobar Trom to a new county  job of equal pay.  </P> <P> Commission staff adviser Ray Charles said there are morale problems in the  division because of the Troms' situation. He said he based those conclusions on  conversations with about 20 family-support officers, half of the 40 workers in  that section. Nearly all complained, for example, that Escobar Trom "did not  carry a workload comparable" to other supervising officers, he said.  </P> <P> At Tuesday's hearing, supervisors expressed concern and sadness over how the  Trom complaints have been handled so far.  </P> <P> "Are we really going to let the county be substantially influenced, even run,  by anonymous phone calls and unsigned letters," Supervisor James R. Dougherty  demanded. "I'm sorry that this has happened to two people whose only crime has  been that they had the bad taste to fall in love and get married."  </P> <P> But the board rejected on a 4 to 1 vote Dougherty's motion that the county's  anti-nepotism rule be waived in the Trom case.  </P> <P> "The district attorney has not resolved the problem" of alleged favored  treatment of Escobar Trom, Supervisor Maggie Erickson said in moving for an  inquiry by Komers.  </P> <P> "This has been in front of us too often," Supervisor Susan K. Lacey said. "At  this point all of the people involved deserve a reasoned, well-thought-out"  decision to clear the air.  </P> <P> Yet, Erickson, Schaefer and Lacey all said they were bothered that none of the  workers who have complained about the Troms have yet identified themselves  publicly and that many of the complaints to supervisors have been made  anonymously over the telephone.  </P> <P> Only one of the several workers who contacted Schaefer or Erickson identified  herself, the supervisors said. Lacey said that at least four workers had  identified themselves to her or her staff.  </P> <P> The supervisors said the purpose of Komers' inquiry is to address specific  allegations against the Troms. The motion was vague as to how Komers should  conduct the probe and whether he should identify complaining workers by name to  Bradbury.  </P> <P> But Schaefer said that if no employee is willing to be named as a complainant  then her understanding is that the investigation will end quickly.  </P> <P> Barry L. Hammitt, executive director of the employees' union, said the message  of the supervisors was clear:  </P> <P> "If the employees are concerned, they must come forward and be counted. It puts  a lot of people in a very tough situation. People fear for their jobs."  </P> <P> Bradbury said that "whistle-blowers" are protected by laws and grievance  procedures and that no employee will be punished for coming forward.  </P> <P> But one family-support worker who called The Times said she is concerned that  she will be harassed if she tells Komers of her complaints against Escobar  Trom.  </P> <P> "It's a very real concern," she said. "I can't say one way or another whether  people are going to come forward."  </P> <P> For their part, the Troms said, they wanted the situation resolved Tuesday.  </P> <P> Escobar Trom said she never heard a complaint about her five-year relationship  with Trom before they were married seven months ago.  </P> <P> "Never once," she said. "That's why it's so bizarre this has gone so far."  </P></p>

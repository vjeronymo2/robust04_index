			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup": "Controls on Fixed Assets Investment Achieve </F> Preliminary Success"]    [Text] Beijing, May 30 (XINHUA) -- China's efforts to  control over-investment in fixed assets have scored preliminary  success so far but the pressure for fixed asset investment is  still heavy.    Since the beginning of this year the rate of investment  increase has declined. During the first four months of the  year, investments by state-owned enterprises grew by 38.4  percent, a 30.5 percent slow-down from the same period last year.    The investment structure is becoming more balanced. More  money is being spent on projects involving raw materials,  transportation and telecommunications. The investment fever in  development zones, holiday resorts, villas and real estate has  been lowered.    In addition, loans to key state projects increased by more  than 10 billion yuan in the first four months compared to the  same period of last year, and some 20 percent of the capital has  been delivered. Typically, about 15 percent of planned  capitalization is fulfilled in the first quarter.    As a result of the controls, the marketing of materials for  production has become stable.    The State Council ruled in January this year to continue the  efforts to control investment in fixed assets as the government  aims to maintain its gross national product (GNP) growth rate at  9 percent and the growth of prices within 10 percent this year.    The investment growth rate of state-owned enterprises has  been estimated at about 30 percent for the first half of this  year, said Wei Liqun, a spokesman for the State Planning  Commission.    Qiu Xiaohua, a young economist with the state statistics  bureau, said that if the 30 percent growth rate target can be  achieved nationwide in the first half of the year, inflationary  pressure will be greatly eased and China's economy will grow at  a steady rate. China's reforms and opening to the outside world  will go more smoothly, he said.    If the growth rate for investment in fixed assets can be  kept  at 30 percent for the whole year, he added, the total investment  in fixed assets for the year will marginally surpass the 13  trillion yuan target set by the central government, but it will  still be a factor conducive to China's overall economic growth.    He stressed that although certain achievements have been  made, controls are still not powerful enough since the  investment mechanism reform is yet to make a significant impact.  Local investment fever is still high and many localities are  eager to construct more projects without paying attention to the  overall economic situation.    "Investments might increase rapidly if the controls are not  carried out strictly," he said, "because the investment  mechanism in which the local government has the final say in  investment has not changed completely."    The economist said that reform of the investment mechanism  should be carried out in such aspects as making certain laws and  regulations to safeguard the interests of investors and to  guarantee a scientific and standardized investment procedure.    In addition, he said, investment decision-making rights  should be transferred from the government to enterprises  themselves. And more overseas investment should be exploited.</p>

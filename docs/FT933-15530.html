			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Losses in US mar Dixons' UK gains GROWING losses and closure costs at the Silo chain in the US pushed down annual pre-tax profits at Dixons, the UK's largest electrical retailer, to Pounds 33.5m from a restated Pounds 50.1m. The losses, which overshadowed an encouraging performance by Dixons' UK chains, will increase pressure on the group to find a way of turning Silo around or make further closures. Dixons' share price fell 15p to 195p. Operating losses at Silo increased from Pounds 16.9m to Pounds 22.4m. Dixons shut five more stores on top of the 45 closures announced in January, and will close a further 11 this year, leading to an exceptional provision of Pounds 36.2m. Without the provision for Silo, a Pounds 6m write-down on UK properties  - a business discontinued last year - and a Pounds 1m loss on disposals, the profit before tax in the year to May 1 would have been Pounds 76.7m, broadly in line with analysts' forecasts. Group turnover increased to Pounds 1.93bn from Pounds 1.81bn. Mr John Clare, managing director, said sales at Silo had risen 2 per cent in the second half, after a 3 per cent fall in the first half, and sales had increased year-on-year in many areas of the US. However, those increases were outweighed by a decline in its biggest markets, especially in California. 'Success in the UK chains has been hidden and frittered away by the US losses,' one analyst said yesterday. In the UK retail business, operating profits rose to Pounds 77.6m from Pounds 71.9m. Stripping out a Pounds 10m warranty fund surplus from last year's figure, profits improved 25 per cent. UK turnover rose 10 per cent to Pounds 1.32bn, while the electrical market grew 4 per cent. Like-for-like sales jumped 15 per cent in Currys out-of-town superstores, 8 per cent in Currys high street stores, and 6 per cent in Dixons. But Dixons warned that while gross margins had been maintained for the third year running, increasing price competition had led to pressure on margins in the current year, although like-for-like sales continued to be ahead. The European property division also increased its operating profit from Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 11.4m, after selling several properties, mainly in Belgium, and letting out the Beaulieu office development in Brussels to the European Commission. Dixons ended up with a post-tax loss, after an exceptional taxation charge of Pounds 20.6m, relating to a liability to pay US retirement medical benefits - a hangover from the acquisition of Cyclops, Silo's parent company, in 1987. That led to a loss per share of 6.5p, compared with 6.5p earnings last year. A slightly increased final dividend of 4.6p, paid out of reserves, makes a total of 6.2p, up from 6p.

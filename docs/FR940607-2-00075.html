Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> NNECO has reviewed the proposed change in accordance with 10CFR50.92 and concluded that the change does not involve a significant hazards consideration (SHC). The basis for this conclusion is that the three criteria of 10CFR50.92(c) are not compromised. The proposed change does not involve an SHC because the changes would not: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change does not affect the probability of any previously evaluated accidents because the proposed change only affects postaccident operation. The consequences of an accident are possibly affected by the change since LPCI/torus fluid could enter the ESW system, and ultimately Long Island Sound, if a positive differential pressure is not maintained in the LPCI heat exchangers. There is not a significant increase in the probability of adverse consequences however, since a passive failure of the LPCI heat exchangers tubes would be required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, at Millstone Unit No. 1, the heat exchangers are only used for occasional torus cooling during the warmer months of the year. As such, they experience very little use. In addition, eddy current testing and shall side pressurization demonstrate tube integrity each refueling outage. During operation, quarterly surveillance testing of the LPCI system will identify if any leakage occurs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Monitoring of the ESW discharge will allow timely detection of any radiological leakage. If a release is detected, the appropriate actions will be taken as the situation requires. Actions could include the isolation of one heat exchanger, the throttling of ESW to restore the positive differential pressure with LPCI, or continued operation with the leakage monitored. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequence of a previously analyzed accident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

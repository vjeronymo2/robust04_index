			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Sweden may conclude EC negotiations this year: Stockholm plans a referendum SWEDEN may be able to conclude its negotiations for membership of the European Community by the end of the year, Ms Anne Wibble. Swedish finance minister, said yesterday, Reuter reports from London. 'There are of course a number of important issues to discuss but neither we nor the Commission can see any serious problems,' she said. 'The negotiations are now well under way and we hope to make substantial progress during the Belgian presidency, possibly even conclude the negotiations.' Belgium will hold the six-month rotating EC presidency for the second half of 1993. Ms Wibble said the issues to be discussed included Sweden's financial contributions, regional and agricultural policy and trade relations with third countries. Negotiations are also taking place on EC membership for Sweden's Nordic neighbours, Finland and Norway. Sweden plans to hold a referendum on the question next year. Ms Wibble said Sweden would plan to join the European single currency proposed in the Maastricht treaty on European union. But she and Mr Thomas Franzen, the Swedish central bank deputy governor, said the Swedish crown, whose link with the European Currency Unit was severed during last year's upheaval in the European currency markets, would continue to float for now. Mr Franzen said the crown's 17 per cent devaluation since the break was 'excessive' and could lead to economic imbalance as exports grew while the home market stagnated. 'We must have a more balanced situation in our economy and a more stable international environment before we can return to a fixed exchange rate regime,' he said.</p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Arts: Nicholson in perspective / Review of the exhibition at the Tate Ben Nicholson, who died early in 1982 at the age of 87, was by then the Grand Old Man of British modernism, the painter Tweedle-dum to Henry Moore's sculptor Tweedle-dee, and had long enjoyed an international reputation. He was loaded with honours, Order of Merit (1968), Rembrandt Prize (1974), Ulisse Prize (Venice Biennale 1954), and could have had more had he accepted all that were offered him, for he was, notoriously, as tricky a man in his professional as in his personal life. The centenary of his birth falls next April and it has been suggested that this retrospective at the Tate is something of an exercise in rehabilitation. Well, one can never answer for the young, but for anyone a little older, it can hardly be so. For my now-fiftyish generation, he was always there or thereabouts, still in the centre of the cultural stage he had commanded since at least the 1930s. He surely was the acceptable arbiter of English modernism, holding the ring between figuration and abstraction, between romanticism and constructivism, between a seductive native sensibility, founded in the experience of landscape and still-life, and the harder currency of the international avant garde. For most of the cultivated, educated yet unspecialised British gallery public, he still is. Ben Nicholson is indeed a significant figure in the history of British painting in the 20th century, but significance takes many forms and not always those that the apologist would wish. Coming as it does with so conventional a timeliness, and being so well chosen and displayed, what this retrospective offers is not rehabilitation but rather a proper reassessment. He was born to the purple of British art, son of the painter, William Nicholson and his wife Mabel, an artist herself and sister to another, Nicholson's friend and sometime colleague, James Pryde. His father was his first serious influence, and was always to remain an informing if unacknowledged presence in the work. From him came the strength and clarity of design, the sharpness of silhouette and contour, above all the ease and elegance of brush and paint across the surface of the canvas. Nicholson pere was ever the dandy and the aesthete in his work, as in himself, and it would always be so with the son. But it is not a simple case of the son looking to the father to make a start, and then moving on in his own way. Having decided upon a career as a painter, nothing but conspicuous success would do. And if Ben would never willingly accept second place among his peers, how much more difficult it was for him openly to allow the precedence that was his father's due. The extent of the creative debt he owed his father has yet to be examined, but it is of the first importance to any understanding of the work. If paternal influence is so crucial, what of that of succeeding professional associations. To walk round this show is to find oneself ticking off the particular references, one by one. Here are Winifred Nicholson, Ben's first wife, his old Slade friend, Paul Nash, Christopher Wood who died so young, and the old Cornish primitive, Alfred Wallis. And here are his second wife, Barbara Hepworth, and her old rival, Henry Moore, and all the Parisian artists to whom his father's contacts gave him access - Braque, Picasso, Mondrian, Gabo. The questions ask themselves: Whose, quite, were the ideas, whose the originality? Was Ben just another clever, well-placed young man who wanted to be an artist, and made himself one not by talent and inner necessity, but by sheer force of will? Was it simply his luck to be not only who he was, but where, surrounded by artists, and when? For it was modernism that gave him his chance, with its technical simplicities, and its essential. rarified self-consciousness. Anything more difficult would have found him out, as it never found out his father. What, in short, we have in Ben Nicholson is an artist who inherited not his father's intuitive talent and instinctive visual originality, but rather an infinite sophistication and intellectual resource. What were passed on to him were critical antennae of the utmost sensitivity, that could tell him just what was significant, original, useful in the work of his friends, to take and make his own. He never did anything truly original in his life, his originality, such as it is, lying only in the discrimination of his interest, his judgment, his taste. Who would then say he was a cynic? These things may work at the deepest level, and his ambition, at least, was sincere enough. Do we set too much store, perhaps, on originality for its own sake? The show is studded with paintings of a delicacy and visual wit that are entirely convincing and captivating as they are. That they tend to be the smaller works, and the less self-conscious, as though the artist for once has forgotten himself in his interest in the work and its relation to the visible world, only makes the point. The window-sill still-lifes of the 1940s, with the hills and harbours of west Cornwall beyond, are especially fine in just this way. And when, later, they are amplified onto a more public scale, their imagery abstracted, so the emptier and more evidently formulaic they become. The irony is that it was by these larger works of the 1950s that the international reputation was finally confirmed. The carved reliefs in the last room are still large enough, but much more simple and physical in their imagery and the working of the surface. And they seem to bring him back to himself, by now a little old-fashioned in the context of the time, and perhaps at last indifferent to the exigencies of the career, and the better for it. It is as strong, and original, a set of work as any. Ben Nicholson: The Tate Gallery, Millbank SW1, until January 9: sponsored by The British Land Company</p>

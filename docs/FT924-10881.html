			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Industrial czar puts Russia's leader on spot MR Arkady Volsky, leader of Russia's industrialists and considered the most influential figure on the political scene after Mr Boris Yeltsin, yesterday laid down his conditions for supporting the Russian president and economic reform. In an interview, the chairman of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs said he believed that during November the cabinet 'must be reconstructed', probably round a new prime minister; economic policy 'corrected' along the lines of a new programme which the union has just produced; and a round table of political groups convened under the chairmanship of the Russian president. This should be done before the scheduled Congress of People's Deputies on December 1, but after Mr Yeltsin's trip to the UK in early November. If it were not done 'decisively and calmly', political chaos and a turn towards an authoritarian system would be inevitable. If these conditions were not fulfilled, M Volsky said his organisation,  - which claims a membership of two thirds of Russia's enterprises and the associated membership of unions of joint ventures and co-operatives  - would 'go into opposition' against the government. Since it also has the support of the main trade unions and of many deputies in the parliament this is in effect a threat to paralyse the government. He said Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, should remain in the cabinet but should no longer retain his current position because of his lack of authority. Mr Volsky said that Mr Yeltsin still fulfilled many of the functions of a premier - and said: 'I tell him (Yeltsin) and I tell you, a prime minister must have elementary power, not just ideas. If half of the decisions of the president are not carried out, then you have to call in those responsible and sack them. You can't have the village elder repealing the decisions of the president.' He refused to specify other changes, but said those who were 'incompetent or dishonest' must go. He said: 'British bankers come and tell me they can't continue with their ventures if such people stay.' Mr Volsky insisted he was for the introduction of a market system on social democratic lines - 'somewhere between socialism (not understood as communism) and capitalism'. He rejected all descriptions of him in domestic and foreign newspapers, including the Financial Times, as one who wanted to introduce elements of the old system. He claimed he had no political ambitions, though he admitted he had powerful influence. This was underlined during the interview when he took a lengthy phone call from Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister, and when he said his next meeting was with General Alexander Rutskoi, the vice president. The main elements in his new programme, which would be presented to the Russian president today and to Mr Gaidar at the weekend, are to prioritise state spending on the provision of foodstuffs by, for example, taking measures to stop the wastage of up to 50 per cent of the harvest; on the provision of medicines, of which only 60 per cent of the needed amount was available; and on funding military conversion.</p>

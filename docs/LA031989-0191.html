			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> RADIATION STUDIES MAY BE INCONCLUSIVE;  </P> <P> SCIENTISTS PROBING HEALTH RISKS FROM ATMOSPHERIC NUCLEAR TESTS  </P> <P> Three major studies to be released within a year may be inconclusive on whether  atmospheric nuclear blasts in the 1950s and 1960s in Nevada caused health  problems such as cancer, scientists said Saturday.  </P> <P> The first results from two studies sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy  and the National Cancer Institute focusing on radiation problems in Western  states are due by the end of this year, and results from a nationwide study by  the National Cancer Institute should be released within a year.  </P> <P> Officials of the three studies met Saturday to discuss their efforts with  scientists conducting a fourth study on radiation releases during the last four  decades from the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington State.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Extremely Difficult'  </P> <P> "I think the overall result of the study is going to be that while there has  been some harm done by these tests, finding that harm is going to be extremely  difficult to do," said Lynn Anspaugh, director of environmental sciences at  Livermore National Laboratory.  </P> <P> Anspaugh is scientific director for the Offsite Radiation Review Project, which  the Energy Department started in 1979 in the hope of determining the radiation  doses people received in Western states from the Nevada atmospheric weapons  tests that were conducted mainly in the 1950s and that ended in 1963.  </P> <P> Anspaugh said the study has confirmed previous reports that people in St.  George, Utah, received doses of radiation much higher than what normally occurs  in the environment -- particularly children who drank milk contaminated because  cows ate radioactive feed.  </P> <P> "Within the other locations throughout the area we think the doses were quite a  bit smaller than that, although at some isolated locations like ranches and so  forth the doses might have been somewhat larger," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Principal Investigator  </P> <P> Walter Stevens, dean of the University of Utah Medical School, is principal  investigator for a National Cancer Institute study on whether residents of  southern Utah, western Nevada and northern Arizona suffered higher rates of  leukemia and thyroid disease because of the tests.  </P> <P> Asked whether the study has found a direct link between the tests and cancer,  he said, "We're dealing with a small number of people so it may be difficult to  give an absolute answer of yes, no or maybe."  </P> <P> "There's nothing that is alarming," he said of the results so far.  </P> <P> Andre Bouville, lead scientist for the National Cancer Institute study trying  to determine radiation doses nationwide from the Nevada fallout, also said  there is considerable uncertainty.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Milk Contamination  </P> <P> That study focuses on how milk became contaminated because cows ingested  radioactive iodine 131, and has found great differences among how much milk  individual people drank at the time.  </P> <P> "You find evidence -- at least indirect evidence -- of contamination all  throughout the United States. Generally speaking, the people living in the  eastern United States were more exposed than people living in the West because  of prevailing winds from west to east.  </P></p>

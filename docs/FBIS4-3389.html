			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Keith Wallis] </F>   [Text] Construction firms and the Provisional Airport  Authority remain deadlocked over contract conditions despite  three days of negotiations. Talks broke up yesterday afternoon  without the expected agreement which would have ended the  10-week row. This was despite concessions by the authority  which resulted in provisional agreements on four of the five  issues raised by the Hong Kong Construction Association and  agreement on 20 minor amendments. The remaining point  outstanding is how contractual disputes should be handled.    Contractors said that without an agreement on this point a  deal on the rest was meaningless. The four tentative agreements  clarify the duties and powers of the project manager, limit  contractors' responsibility for extra work to structures it has  also designed, limits the amount of general damages authority  can impose, and restricts the work needed to make good ground  settlement. No new date for further discussions has been fixed  but the two groups are likely to be in contact over the next few  days to set a timetable for the next meetings.    "There has been a substantial measure of agreement and a  substantial measure of flexibility," said an authority  spokesman. "I think both sides need to have time to reflect on  the progress which has been achieved and consider their future  options accordingly." After talks with the authority ended, the  association's negotiating team held a meeting with  representatives from more than 25 contracting firms who have  boycotted four airport advance works contracts. Held behind  closed doors, the meeting enabled association negotiators,  including legal and contract specialists, to give contractors a  progress report. The contractors decided to continue the  boycott until there is an agreement to include similar dispute  resolution measures to those on government- funded airport core  projects. These allow for mediation and adjudication while  construction continues and arbitration at the end of the  contract if the dispute is still unresolved. The authority  originally refused to accept these measures because "they were  not in the public interest". Called ADR (alternative disputes  resolution), they were proposed by the association.    "Without ADR agreements about the rest of the conditions are  meaningless because it allows the authority to slip all the  onerous conditions back into the contract again once work is  underway. Under the present dispute procedure there is no  redress until the end of the contract and that is unacceptable,"  commented one contractor. "Contractors and consultants mistrust  the authority so much that there is a solid feeling that if we  do not take steps to protect our interests now then this will be  the last chance we get," added another. Consequently no bids  will be submitted on Friday for any of the four contracts for  passenger terminal foundations, temporary roads, water pipelines  and site accommodation. Nevertheless the authority is hoping  there can be a quick settlement to the row. This will permit it  to announce a revised tender date.</p>

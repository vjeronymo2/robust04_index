			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Strategy to win a sea battle: How a civilian shipyard helped VSEL cut costs and gain a Royal Navy order When two of the UK's biggest shipbuilders competed for the same Royal Navy contract recently, one of them had to emerge the winner. But for Tyneside's Swan Hunter and VSEL of Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, there was more at stake than one helicopter carrier. After the Ministry of Defence rejected Swan Hunter's Pounds 220m bid in May, the receiver was called in and 2,200 workers face unemployment. The MoD's acceptance of VSEL's bid, cheaper by about Pounds 50m, gave the UK's specialist submarine builder a re-entry into surface ships after a decade's absence. Now the National Audit Office, the government spending watchdog, has been asked by the House of Commons defence committee to check if the competition was fair. It is expected to report next week on how the two companies, with more than two centuries of shipbuilding experience between them, came to offer bids of such disparity. The answer is likely to stem from the different approach each company took to meeting the navy's needs. Swan Hunter wanted to do all the work itself, and estimated that building the ship would consume 7,000 man years (the amount of work done by one worker in one year). VSEL, by contrast, divided the work into navy and civilian parts, and gave the merchant parts to a civilian shipbuilder, Kvaerner Govan. VSEL and Kvaerner Govan say they need fewer than 2,500 man years to build virtually the same ship. Although the rival bids were for similar ships, the thinking behind each design differed. While Swan Hunter believed the ship was entirely military, VSEL thought the design was basically a merchant ship with military hardware bolted on. The difference between a warship and a merchant ship is more than a matter of guns and engines. Military ships are more technologically demanding. Their reliability must be higher, with vital components protected from the shock of battle. They need computerised fire management and back-up electronics to make it more likely that control and communications systems would survive attack. In a warship, this equipment is packed in hulls made from ultra-thin metal plating to reduce weight, even though welding thin metal is slow and difficult work. Not surprisingly, navy ships are expensive: a small frigate costs between Pounds 100m and Pounds 150m, more than twice the price of the costliest of merchant ships. Unusually, the MoD's specification for the helicopter carrier did not call for a normal warship, but was a hybrid of military and civilian components. The hull is to be of merchant standard, but many of the fittings are military. This combination posed a problem for VSEL and Swan Hunter, both essentially navy suppliers, although Swan Hunter has in recent years tried to broaden its skills. The Swan Hunter yard has a long and illustrious history in the commercial sector: in 1907 it built the Mauretania liner, one of the largest liners of its time, and merchant ships were big business in the 1960s. This ended when the yard was consigned to making warships as part of the nationalised British Shipbuilders in 1977-86. But it had recently returned to building some merchant ships after almost two decades devoted to warships. Since privatisation seven years ago, it has won contracts to build cranes for the offshore oil industry, a River Tyne ferry and a ship designed to work in the Antarctic. The number of its merchant contracts peaked at one-quarter of its workload in the early 1990s. Last year, management felt able to say it had the UK's only design team with the experience and expertise to build both warships and merchant vessels. VSEL, by contrast, has concentrated on defence work, largely Trident submarines. So it decided that the merchant ship aspects of the helicopter carrier - at least half the work of building the ship - could be done by a yard with no navy experience. The result was a plan to build a hull, helicopter platform and engines. This structure would qualify as a merchant ship and be built to merchant standards set by Lloyd's Register, the ship classification society. It would then sail to Barrow-in-Furness to have military kit fitted. As prime contractor, VSEL picked its subcontractor carefully. Kvaerner Govan has been owned by one of Europe's most successful merchant shipbuilders, Norway's Kvaerner Industrier, since 1988. The yard, on Clydeside, has for several years been building gas carriers, which are among the more advanced merchant ships on the seas. The safety standards needed in gas carriers mean that Kvaerner Govan is more experienced than some other merchant yards at the specialised welding and automated disaster management systems that would be useful for the helicopter carrier. The MoD specifications for the helicopter carrier are, in some areas, less exacting than Kvaerner Govan's standards for gas carriers. The helicopter carrier's welds need be checked with X-rays only at random points, according to Kvaerner Govan. The welds on gas tanker hulls, however, must pass a comprehensive X-ray examination. With the help of its parent, Kvaerner Govan has invested Pounds 35m in equipment to cut costs. This is on top of the public money that went into the yard before 1988 when it was owned by the nationalised British Shipbuilders. It hopes to break even this year for the first time under Kvaerner Industrier's control. This investment is underlined by equipment differences between Swan Hunter and Kvaerner Govan. Both build sections of ships under cover to improve productivity: work can continue during bad weather, and workers perform better in the warm and dry. But Kvaerner Govan can build much more under shelter than Swan Hunter. Most of the Pounds 35m went on covered units for ship sections weighing up to 1,500 tonnes, more than seven times the size possible in Swan Hunter's covered units. These differences alone could account for a substantial difference in costs between the yards. But beyond them, there are long-standing structural differences between merchant ship and warship builders in general that could widen the gap further. Warship yards acknowledge that they cost more to run. 'If you gave a merchant shipyard a warship contract, it would be cheaper than if you gave the same contract to a navy yard,' says Mr Bob Mulligan, technical director at Vosper Thornycroft, a Southampton-based naval shipyard. The reason is that a navy yard has higher overheads than civilian rivals, says GEC, which owns the Yarrow navy yard, on the River Clyde. Extra staff are needed to oversee the development, construction and installation of each part of a warship, such as hull, early warning systems and weapons, and report to opposite numbers in the MoD. 'Across all defence production there is a much greater requirement for liaison between the manufacturer and the customer. They (the military) want a detailed breakdown of overheads and work done in regular progress reports,' says GEC. 'A commercial yard does not need to have those people in place.' In the past, the impact of such structural differences on costs has not been tested, because merchant and warship yards have not competed for the same contracts. Now the helicopter carrier experiment may have set a precedent for future MoD contracts. Indeed, the MoD is determined to press ahead with further contracts mixing defence and civil components, whatever the National Audit office report says. 'This was not a one-off,' says the MoD. 'The result is that there will be rewards for industry, but there will be increased risk too.' Deals combining military and civilian contractors are part, it says, of its policy to pass on the risk from taxpayers to suppliers.</p>

			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Industrialists back Maastricht, says poll A POLL indicates that 75 per cent of British industry and local authorities would vote in favour of the Maastricht treaty if the UK held a referendum, Gary Mead writes. But it also shows that 37 per cent believe they receive unfair treatment from Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, and his office. The poll was conducted by the UK-based political consultancy Decision Makers among the UK's top 1,000 companies and 500 local authorities as well as the top 1,000 companies elsewhere in the EC and in the Efta group of nations. Among all types of the UK respondents, 59 per cent said they favoured staying outside the European exchange rate mechanism until a closer and more stable alignment of currencies was achieved. The survey indicated that only 26 per cent of UK industry believes it receives fair treatment from Brussels Attitudes of UK Local Authorities and the top 2,000 EC companies.

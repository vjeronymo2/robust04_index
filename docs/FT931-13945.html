			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Israel gets UN warning A United Nations envoy yesterday delivered the sharpest warning to date of Security Council anger over Israel's refusal to reverse the expulsion of 415 Palestinians to Lebanon, saying it would not wait longer for a positive Israeli response. However, Mr Chinmaya Gharekhan, sent by UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali on the third UN mission since the expulsions on December 17, said he could not give a deadline for Israeli compliance with Security Council resolution 799 condemning the action as illegal and demanding it be overturned. Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign minister, said Israel was waiting for a High Court ruling on the legality of the expulsions, due within days, before deciding its next step. The government is concerned that the US, which usually vetoes hostile UN moves against it, could allow further Security Council action on the issue because of strong international feeling that Israel has benfited from double standards in the Security Council in the light of attacks on Iraq.</p>

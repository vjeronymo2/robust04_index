			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The day before yesterday there were reports of a  murder attempt on Liberal Party [PL] Chairman Justin Mugenzi.  Certain people said it had a political motive and that it was  connected to divergences within the PL.    To competent observers however, the alleged murder attempt  on  Justin Mugenzi was just for show. After a close examination of  the facts, one is hardly convinced that a real murder attempt  took place. First of all, the news was announced that very  evening by RTLM radio [FM station in Rwanda]. One is left to  wonder how it was that the radio station was the first to  broadcast the news in such a short period of time--the very  evening of the murder attempt.    Secondly, it was said that the would-be criminal used a  pistol in the murder attempt on Mugenzi's well-protected life.  However, it is difficult to understand how one could lay an  ambush with a pistol, especially against someone flanked by a  bodyguard and inside a vehicle.    Finally, Radio Kigali said that there had been heavy  shooting, whereas Mr. Justin Mugenzi's bodyguard said the  criminal had fired three or four bullets after the vehicle left.    It is clear that it was just a performance to make the  public  believe that someone wanted to kill Justin Mugenzi for political  reasons and to discredit his opponents.    It is worth recalling that Mr. Mugenzi is being manipulated  by the president of the Republic, Juvenal Habyarimana, to delay  the establishment of the broad-based transitional institutions.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Boyka Bashlieva: "The SDS Is Again Pretending </F> That It Is Toppling Berov"]    [Text] For the fifth time since Berov's government was  elected, the parliamentary faction of the Union of Democratic  Forces [SDS], instructed by the SDS National Coordinating  Council, has decided to bring down the government through a  no-confidence vote. Nevertheless, despite the fact that this was  reported on the front pages of all the newspapers, it failed to  impress anyone and the chances of success are very close to zero.    The most frequent explanation of the no-confidence vote  proposal, which could be heard last week in political circles,  was that this is an attempt to delay the adoption of the 1994  budget. Two sessions will certainly be wasted, which still does  not mean that the budget debate could not start as soon as this  week.    Some of the SDS deputies did not tire of repeating that the  purpose of the proposal was to topple the cabinet and bring  forward the elections. However, when asked about the real  reason, another section of deputies only shrug their shoulders  and develop a great interest in their shoelaces. This is so  because, if anyone really wanted to topple Berov, the SDS  leadership would have proposed the no-confidence vote after  rather than prior to adopting the budget. Perhaps then the  chances would not have been so close to zero as they are now.    Unlike previous reasons that prompted no-confidence votes,  such as the "beating" of Stefan Savov, the sidewalk taxes, and  other such lunacies, this time things are more serious.  Burgeoning crime and the police shoot-out could easily generate  enough votes against the government. However, this will not  happen when the country is without a budget. Even a child could  understand the economic consequences of such a situation.    If we assume that this is, nevertheless, unclear to some SDS  deputies (which is highly questionable), then we would have to  believe the thesis that they repeat ad nauseam, namely, that the  government, only the government, and no one but the government  is responsible for the crime rate, and if the government is  brought down and new elections emerge on the horizon, the sticks  and the firearms on our streets will disappear, and the same  will happen to the vicious fight between economic groups and to  corruption. In other words, life will become as pretty as a  picture.    This is more than absurd. There is no more fertile soil for  the crime, corruption, and anarchy than the absence of laws, a  legislating institution, and an executive institution  responsible for implementing the laws. It is a completely  different question as to how the cabinet and parliament cope  with their obligations.    In addition, if the Socialists boycott the voting, something  that was mentioned over the weekend, the no-confidence motion  will not gain the 121 votes required by the Constitution, and  the thesis that "by supporting the government the Bulgarian  Socialist Party is supporting crime," will vanish into thin air.    Thus, regardless of which direction the no-confidence vote  is  viewed, it always looks like total lunacy.</p>

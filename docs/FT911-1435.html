			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Everything is still to play for: Winners and losers in the council elections It is some weeks since anyone seriously thought John Major would call a June election. But that assumption was turned into a certainty by Thursday's voting. The 6 per cent swing from Conservative to Labour would, if repeated in a general election, be more than enough to eliminate the Conservatives' clear majority even though it would not put Labour in full power: it would get just over 300 seats, a shade ahead of the Conservatives but below the magic 326 needed for an absolute majority. However, the shock of the night was the Liberal Democrats' performance. Everyone, Mr Paddy Ashdown included, expected them to fall away from their 1987 peak. In fact, they not only gained seats but gained more than Labour. Even though they lost votes in most of the areas where they were a poor third, they advanced wherever they were the main challenger. Their share of the overall vote was near their 1987 general election level - and 8 points above the current opinion poll rating. It was a three-cornered fight. The Independents continued their long, slow decline: the Greens elected only nine of their 1,300 candidates; Plaid Cymru won 36 and lost 14 seats; and a few Ratepayers cocked a successful snook at the party system. There are several ways in which the results can be judged: council seats gained or lost; changes in party shares of the vote; councils controlled by each party; the outcome in marginal constituencies if this had been a general election. The seats fought on Thursday were last contested in 1987 when the polls showed Conservatives at 41 per cent, Labour at 31 per cent and the Alliance at 27 per cent. Yesterday, an Evening Standard poll of polls found Conservatives and Labour at 41 per cent each, and Liberal Democrats at 14 per cent. The result in seats does not quite match that trend. The Conservatives' loss was greater than in any year since the Second World War. But Labour's gains, though impressive, did not justify the triumphalism expressed by the party leadership yesterday. The May 1987 votes can be contrasted with an estimate of those recorded on Thursday (see the accompanying table on share of votes). These figures are based on a limited sample and are somewhat at variance with Labour's optimistic calculations from its selection of marginals. When the final figures become available in the next week, we shall know where the truth lies. Labour made an appreciable advance in control of local councils. With remarkable victories in the long-term Tory strongholds of Blackpool and Plymouth, as well as in the more volatile Nottingham, Darlington and Luton, the party controls every large city in England and Wales, except Derby (where there is a tie), Bournemouth and Portsmouth. Mr Heseltine may find local government even less co-operative after this week. The Liberal Democrats' achievement in adding to its local power base was notable. On Wednesday they had clear control of only three of the 369 councils that went to the polls. Today they have an absolute majority in 20, including such Tory resorts as Cheltenham, Torbay, Poole and Eastbourne. They lost the balance of power in a dozen councils; they gained it in 30 others. The voters showed some discrimination, for example, in ousting the Conservatives in Blackpool, or the Labour party in Barrow and Wear Valley. But the success of five out of the six Militant rebels in Liverpool should be recorded. The swing to Labour was far stronger in the south than elsewhere; it was notably lower in the Black Country. But even within regions, individual constituencies produced contrasting results. On Thursday's figures, Labour would gain Elmet in west Yorkshire (with a swing of 8 1/2 per cent) but would fail in nearby Keighley (3 per cent swing). Labour would gain the Basildon constituency (6 per cent swing) although it lost control of the Basildon council. There were swings to the Conservatives in Wallasey (+2 1/2 per cent) and Birmingham Northfield (+4 per cent), and the Liberal Democrats would win Hazel Grove (on a 10 per cent swing from the Conservatives) and defeat Chris Patten in Bath on a 2 per cent swing. Past years offer ample warning against projecting Thursday's votes, national or locally, on to what may happen in a general election in October or next June. Harold Wilson, for one, was lured by the local results of May 1970 into the disaster of June 1970. Liberals seem to fare better at the council than at the parliamentary level. And the poll tax and health fiascos may not favour Labour so much six months or a year hence. Thursday's votes gave substantial pleasure to Labour and perhaps even more to the Liberal Democrats. The Conservatives had little to be pleased about. But there is still everything to play for in the months ahead.</p>

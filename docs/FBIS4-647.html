			<p>BFN     [Text] Violent clashes are still taking place in Cuanza  Norte Province where Popular Movement for the Liberation of  Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] troops are involved in an offensive  against the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola  [UNITA] for the control of N'Dalatando. The military offensive  has already met its most difficult test near the Lucala 2 River  bridge on the Dondo- N'Dalatando road. Sources from the Cuanza  Norte Command [word indistinct] say that between 7 and 11 April  our courageous soldiers destroyed an enemy military convoy and  successfully blocked the repressive forces who were trying to  advance toward the (Bimba) highlands. As a result, Armed Forces  for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] combatants killed 57 MPLA  elements, burned eight vehicles, including [words indistinct]  tankers containing 6,000 liters of diesel, and captured four  communication radios, 13 R-4 weapons, three PKM machine guns,  countless rounds ammunitions of different calibers, as well as  an assortment of war materiel. Seeing their plans to storm  N'Dalatando thwarted, over the past few days the MPLA air force  and artillery units stepped up attacks on civilian targets,  killing innocent women, elderly people, and children. The  gallant FALA combatants will continue to defend the people and  their property [words indistinct].</p>

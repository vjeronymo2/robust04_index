			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Contra rebels release all their hostages CARDINAL Miguel Obando y Bravo of Managua arrives at the northern Nicaraguan town of Quilal yesterday in what appears to be a successful bid to end the hostage crisis, AP reports. Late last night the cardinal had helped to secure the release of the last five hostages held by right-wing Contra rebels. In the capital Managua, a rival gang of leftist gunmen said they were also releasing the final five hostages they have been holding, including Vice President Virgilio Godoy. The Contras had released 11 other captives earlier in the day as the dual hostage crisis moved sporadically toward resolution. The releases came after the former Sandinista gunmen holding hostages in Managua had freed three conservative politicians late on Tuesday. The Contra group had been demanding that army chief Humberto Ortega, brother of former Nicaraguan president Daniel Ortega and a member of the former ruling Sandinista party, and other top Sandinistas resign from the government.</p>

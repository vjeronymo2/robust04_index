			<p>BFN     [Text] Fifteen UN soldiers from the Nordic peacekeeping  battalion in Bosnia since Sunday [10 April] have been detained  by Serbian soldiers at a roadblock northwest of Sarajevo. The  group, made up of 13 Swedes and two Norwegians, was stopped  after refusing to hand over explosives that form part of the  supplies being carried to their colleagues in Tuzla. Sweden's  Defense Minister Anders Bjorck says he doesn't regard this as a  hostage situation, adding that the Nordic soldiers will be free  to leave the area as soon as a relief group arrives on the scene.    Sweden is to withdraw the two Air Force transport planes  that  have been taking part in relief flights to the Bosnian capital  Sarajevo when the agreement with the UN High Commissioner for  Refugees expires next week. This is despite a UN request for  continued assistance. Military sources in Stockholm cite  technical reasons, saying the aircraft need overhaul after  flying two to three times daily to Sarajevo. The planes are the  only two of Sweden's eight giant Hercules transport planes with  special protection against heat-seeking missiles and thus  suitable for the task. Foreign Aid Minister Alf Svensson said  Sweden is prepared to resume relief flights at a later date.</p>

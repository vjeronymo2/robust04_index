			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tianjin, January 27 (XINHUA) -- The 211 project, an  ambitious national education reform project, has sparked a wave  of quicker development through bolder reforms among the higher  education institutions in this coastal city of north China.    The 211 project, pinpointing the spirit with which the  country's education must face the 21st century, spells out the  build-up of 100 key higher education institutions and key  specialist subject centers throughout the country in some ten  years. Hence the figure 211.    Authorities said the project is a strategic educational  reform move for China designed to get the country's universities  and colleges soundly prepared for the upcoming challenges in the  next century so as to well serve the country's accelerated  modernization drive.    The project aims to help the 100 universities and scientific  centers, to be selected in stages over the next ten or more  years, train more world-class professionals faster and,  meanwhile, raise their academic level to above the national  average and close to that of the world. Universities and  colleges nationwide have been responding to the project. They  will be granted special government funds and preferential  treatment once chosen to be among the 100.    The 30 Tianjin-based institutions of higher learning are  making all-out efforts to reform their educational structure and  upgrade their academic levels in a bid to get into the group of  the chosen 100.    Li Guangquan, president of Tianjin University, said the 211  project is a precious development opportunity as well as a tough  challenge for his university. He said his university is a  strong and hopeful contender but improvements are still wanted  in one way or another.    Du Buying, president of the Tianjin Institute of Finance and  Economics, said his institute has readjusted development  strategy so as to be more competitive.    All the other universities in the city have been  concentrating on building up their teaching staff and improving  their campus environment as well as on raising academic levels.    Some universities and colleges in the city have merged to  improve their competitive edge.    Education officials said that though there will be only 100  chosen universities and institutions across the country, the 211  project will turn out to be a golden chance both for those  selected and those not selected to push their education and  management to a higher level.</p>

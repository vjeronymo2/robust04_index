			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / The Markets: Japan attracts the dollars - Global Investor For once, US equity investors seem to have got their timing at least partly right on Japan. In a report last week, the US Securities Industry Associa-tion put purchases of Japanese shares by American invest-ors at a net Dollars 9.5bn in the first three months of this year - nearly double the last quarterly record, struck in the opening period of 1991. Remember the end of the 1980s, when foreigners stayed away in droves and missed out on the last leg of the great Japanese bull market? (It's not much consolation to say that the warnings of an asset-price bubble turned out to be right in the end.) And then there was 1991, when outsiders tried (unsuccess-fully) to call the bottom for the Nikkei. This time around, dollar-based investors have been rewarded with some instant paper gains. Thanks to the US currency's slide, the Japanese market showed returns of 17 per cent in the first quarter in dollar terms, and about 6 per cent in the second (having recorded a 24 per cent gain during 1993 at a time when US stocks were up only 7 per cent.) There is an irony - as well as a warning - in this. Part of the reason for the dollar's weakness in the first place has been the country's huge capital outflows. Last year, a Dollars 40bn outflow combined with a Dollars 110bn current account deficit to leave the dollar severely weakened. This year, the jump in US portfolio investment in Japan has helped explain the dollar's dip below 100 yen. It is also noteworthy that Japanese investors actually sold Dollars 3.5bn of US securities in the first quarter, the first time for three years that they had been net sellers - and this despite the fact that the yield gap between long-dated US and Japanese bonds widened during the period. The dollar's bounce back to 100 yen could herald a sea-change. The fundamentals of the Japanese market may still look great to a US investor, but it remains the case that Japanese industry has yet to produce the rebound its fans have been predicting. The currency gains which have bailed out US investors this far seem unlikely to continue. Slowing capital flows from the US could, in their turn, weaken the yen against the dollar, further reducing portfolio investment from the US. The latest stirrings of a trade war with Japan could help the cause by keeping the dollar under pressure. But sooner or later, those pension fund managers in the mid West will have to stop speculating on currencies and start earning returns from their investments in Japanese shares. Gold It is now precisely a year since the gold market (with a little help from Mr George Soros) worked itself into a fever over another bout of world inflation. The price of the metal jumped to over Dollars 400 an ounce in the opening days of August a year ago as Europe's currency system threatened to fall apart. The gold bulls had their day, only to see the market sink back towards Dollars 340 an ounce by the end of the summer as the crisis passed. But the accelerating US economy and sustained interest from the investment community  -something which, before last year, had not been seen for a decade - have had their effect since then. Despite a bout of US interest rate rises, and a widespread view that the dollar will (finally) rebound, the gold price stands at nearly Dollars 390 an ounce, close to the top of the range in which it has traded for most of this year. If the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee opts not to raise interest rates again at its meeting on August 16 (and the bond market clearly feels confident, given the two-point jump in long-dated US bonds on Friday), then the gold price seems likely at least to hold its own. Mr Wayne Angell, the hawkish former governor of the Federal Reserve, is one of those who claims a close correlation between the precious metal and future inflation: to be precise, 83 per cent of the changes in the US inflation rate are foreshadowed by a move in the gold price, he says (the view is not shared by many gold market analysts, who these days tend increasingly to view the metal as just another commodity, rather than the be all and end all of monetary policy). According to Mr Angell, the current gold price points to US inflation next year of 3.5 per cent or more. For a stable price environment, the Federal Reserve would have to target a price of Dollars 220 an ounce, he adds. Barometer The Fed chairman himself pinpointed gold earlier this year as one of the inflation barometers he intended to watch carefully. But in his most recent testimony to Congress a fortnight ago, Mr Greenspan showed little interest in the commodity. There are some big swing factors in the supply/demand equation which makes up the gold price: whether any central banks decide to liquidate part of its holdings to meet a passing fiscal emergency, for instance. But leaving these aside, the market seems likely to keep bouncing against the Dollars 390 ceiling. Whether it can find a new excuse to leap back past Dollars 400 is quite another matter.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                TOTAL RETURN IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 28/7/94  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               --------------- % change over period ---------------------                  US    Japan    Germany    France    Italy       UK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash Week           0.08     0.04       0.09      0.10     0.16     0.09 Month          0.38     0.18       0.42      0.46     0.68     0.42 Year           3.75     3.03       6.19      6.69     9.13     5.69  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year Week          -0.06     0.13      -0.36      0.04    -0.65    -1.06 Month          0.45     0.25       0.95      0.62    -0.36     0.51 Year           0.06     4.49       5.18      4.54     7.58     2.08  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year Week          -0.02    -0.42      -0.98     -0.20    -1.96    -1.63 Month          0.46    -0.17       0.68      0.83    -1.96     0.54 Year          -2.49     3.69       3.05      2.50     7.04     0.48  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities Week            0.5     -1.7        0.5       0.3     -3.9      0.3 Month           2.3     -3.2        4.6       6.9      0.7      6.9 Year            4.3      1.0       15.1      11.9     22.5     11.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cash &amp; Bonds - Lehman Brothers.

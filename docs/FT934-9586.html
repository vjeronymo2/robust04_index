			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Jobs and prices warning over VAT on food BIG job losses and price rises in many consumer products would result if value added tax were extended to all food and drink, the industry warned yesterday. The Food and Drink Federation, which represents manufacturers, said that if VAT were applied at the standard 17.5 per cent rate to the 80 per cent of food and drink products now zero-rated, retail prices would rise by more than 2 per cent and 31,000 manufacturing jobs would go. Its members would suffer a 0.9 percentage-point drop in their average profit margins, and retailers' profitability would be depressed. The federation's warning is part of its campaign to persuade Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, not to extend VAT in the Budget. If VAT were extended to all food and drink at an 8 per cent rate, 8,000 jobs would be lost and profit margins would be reduced by 0.8 percentage points, the federation said. It added that estimates by accountants Price Waterhouse showed that, in the event of a 17.5 per cent extension, about 40 per cent of the higher costs due to a change in VAT treatment would feed through into higher prices, and the remainder would be absorbed by manufacturers and retailers. Half the impact on manufacturers would be absorbed by shedding jobs, one third through gains in general efficiency and 17 per cent in a 0.9 percentage-point fall in average profit margins. About 380,000 people are employed in food manufacturing. Tax incentives for investment in training and manufacturing are among the measures businesses in north-east England most want to see in the Budget, says a Price Waterhouse survey.</p>

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Emerging Markets: Africa's stock markets aim high - The Emerging Investor As with so much else on the continent, Africa's stock exchanges tend to be bypassed by international investors who are convinced that anything preceded by the word African must be a hopeless economic basket case. Indeed, even among emerging markets specialists, few are aware of the existence of any African stock markets outside of South Africa - and even in that country genuine international interest is a relatively recent occurrence. Last week, however, at the annual general meeting of the African Stock Exchanges Association (ASEA) in Johannesburg, representatives from bourses across the region served notice that Africa is determined to put itself back on the international investment map. In particular, now that a politically rehabilitated South Africa is rapidly becoming integrated with the rest of the continent and is poised to act as its economic leader, hopes are running high that the continent's various exchanges are about to embark on an unprecedented growth path. 'The situation is looking better now for Africa than at any time in the past 30 years, and there's real potential for growth,' observes one analyst who recently started assessing African stocks. While such glib predictions litter Africa's modern economic history, ASEA officials are adamant that this is no longer a pipe-dream, pointing out that there are currently no fewer than 14 operative African stock markets, with a combined market capitalisation of Dollars 256bn (Pounds 162bn). Of these, South Africa is by far the most important player, accounting for Dollars 240bn compared with Dollars 7bn in North Africa (Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco); Dollars 8bn in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa (Ghana, Nigeria, Namibia, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Ivory Coast, Swaziland and Uganda) and a further Dollars 1bn coming from the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius. Even more striking is the fact that many exchanges already offer impressive returns. As a group the African markets rose by an average 30 per cent last year and only two exchanges, Botswana and Nigeria, fell. Zimbabwe, meanwhile, had the fourth best performing market in the world, rising by an astonishing 123 per cent in dollar terms (albeit off a low base) and the Mauritian index rose 51 per cent. Taking note of these figures, some of the bigger investment banks and securities houses have started to investigate African markets more seriously. Morgan Stanley, for example, has included several non-South African stocks in its Africa Fund and is distinctly upbeat on the continent's prospects. 'In spite of past problems, Africa's potential is unmistakeable. The world's second largest continent, with 11m square miles, is three times the size of the US and has twice the population, 600m strong, and is rich in natural resources and agriculture,' its assessment concludes. Similarly, in another recent report, Barings predicts that African exchanges should be able to expand from their current 2.2 per cent share of world market capitalisation to 3 per cent by 2010 on the back of anticipated cross-border equity flows of between Dollars 1bn and Dollars 1.6bn. The sub-Saharan markets on their own, the report predicts, could expand by a factor of five or six times. Nevertheless, if the continent is to achieve this, analysts agree that further structural reforms are desperately needed. In particular, the markets need to boost liquidity substantially: South Africa, with annual turnover amounting to only 7.4 per cent of market capitalisation, is currently the most liquid of all sub-Saharan markets and even in the north, only Morocco's 21.7 per cent exceeds it. In large part, this is due to currency controls, which are still in place in nearly all African countries and need to be removed to allow the free movement of capital. At the same time, however, the markets need to launch some international stock offerings to help raise the continent's profile. These points are largely accepted by the markets, which have started actively lobbying their respective governments for action on both fronts. 'Only by removing the major stumbling block of exchange controls and by providing new shares through privatisation issues can we attract the foreign capital we so dearly need to develop our countries,' observes Mr Jimnah Mbaru, ASEA chairman. The first leg of this process has already begun. Several countries have implemented currency reforms as part of IMF-imposed structural adjustment programmes. South Africa is also likely to jettison its own confusing financial rand system for foreign investors some time early next year, which should provide further impetus for the deregulation process. At the same time, moreover, many states are considering privatising companies in sectors such as mining, telecommunications and transport. As Ghana's highly successful recent Dollars 450m flotation of its Ashanti gold mine, of which 87 per cent was sold internationally, indicates, given the proper conditions global investors are more than willing to take a chance on Africa. In the meantime, the continent's stockbroking fraternity is continuing to grow: two more markets, in Tanzania and Malawi, are expected to open over the coming year.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                             Friday  Week on week change Stock                             Country  28/10/94   Dollars      %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bagfas                             Turkey   0.2106    0.0422     25.07 Shinhan Bank                     S.

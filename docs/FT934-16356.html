			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Fighting flares on Bosnia fronts A RENEWED United Nations peacekeeping mandate for former Yugoslavia began on a bleak note yesterday, with Moslems, Serbs and Croats renewing their struggle for territory in Bosnia, Reuter reports from Sarajevo. As Serbs and Croats said they would make no more territorial concessions to the Moslems, all three sides reported flare-ups on several fronts across Bosnia. Sarajevo radio reported that Croat forces had used Moslem prisoners as 'human shields' in an attempt to break through government positions in central Bosnia, killing a number of people. The Moslem-controlled radio claimed the Croats wired explosives to the Moslems, who had been held at a Croat-run internment camp, and marched them towards the frontline at Isakovici, near Novi Travnik. Fighting was also reported around Maglaj in north-central Bosnia, and in eastern Bosnia in the Zvornik region and Olovo, Bosnian radio said. The UN said Maglaj, a mainly Moslem town, was under its 100th day of siege by Croat and Serb forces, and Mostar's Moslem quarter was under increased Croat shelling. All sides reported some sniping and shelling in Sarajevo, and sniper fire could be heard during the morning.</p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POMONA OUSTS WILSON AS CITY ADMINISTRATOR  </P> <P> During his 13-month tenure as city administrator, A. J. Wilson was billed as  either a managerial messiah or a marauder. Supporters and detractors now agree  he was the victim of that split opinion.  </P> <P> In an unexpected move, one of the first actions taken by a newly reconstituted  City Council Monday was to fire Wilson in closed session. He had lost favor  with a new council majority led by C. L. (Clay) Bryant. Bryant had made  previous attempts to oust Wilson but lacked the required votes until this week.  </P> <P> Bryant was joined by colleagues Nell Soto and Tomas Ursua -- who was sworn into  office last week -- in voting to fire Wilson. Mayor Donna Smith supported  Wilson, while Councilman Mark Nymeyer walked out of the council's executive  session in protest.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Not a Messiah'  </P> <P> In making the motion to fire Wilson, Bryant said it became clear in recent  months that Wilson could not fulfill expectations. "You could tell he was just  a bureaucrat, not a messiah," Bryant said.  </P> <P> But Smith and Nymeyer said the high-powered administrator had lived up to the  hype that surrounded his hiring in April, 1988.  </P> <P> "I think that Mr. Wilson was one of the best things that happened to this  city," Smith said. "I feel Pomona's future is in serious jeopardy.  </P> <P> "Anyone with any brains is not going to apply for the manager's job in Pomona,"  she said.  </P> <P> Nymeyer concurred, saying: "Mr. Wilson had a vision for what this town could  become."  </P> <P> Wilson, 47, whose personal residence is in Fallbrook, could not be reached for  comment. As part of a buyout clause in his contract, Wilson will receive five  months of his annual salary and benefits for a total of about $125,000. City  Atty. Patrick J. Sampson was named as interim city administrator.  </P> <P> Before coming to Pomona, Wilson had been out of city government for three  years, working as a management consultant for corporations. Wilson's reputation  was that of a forceful leader who found novel solutions for longstanding  problems of urban decay and economic stagnation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Collision Course  </P> <P> It may have been this same forceful personality and drive -- which supporters  say are among Wilson's greatest attributes -- that set him on a collision  course with the new council majority.  </P> <P> Wilson had spent 20 years in government, including largely successful stints  overseeing Santa Ana, Portland, Me., and his hometown of St. Louis. But  Wilson's last city manager's job ended in controversy in 1984, when he resigned  under pressure in Kansas City, Mo., after 14 troubled months.  </P> <P> Some of the same criticisms leveled at Wilson in Kansas City -- that he usurped  elected officials' authority and prestige -- were cited as reasons for his  firing in Pomona.  </P> <P> "He had the same problems in St. Louis, Santa Ana and Kansas City," Bryant  said. "I'd hate to feel that the council is working for him, instead of vice  versa."  </P> <P> Bryant and Soto accused Wilson of being largely unaccountable to the council.  </P> <P> Meetings were cancelled and times changed without notifying council members and  often official requests were answered with empty promises for action, Bryant  said.  </P> <P> "It's a hell of a way to do business," Bryant said, citing an instance when the  council directed Wilson to seek assistance from the Los Angeles County  Sheriff's Department to deal with gangs in the city. "He was told to make an  immediate request for assistance; he asked for a study instead," Bryant said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Favoritism Cited  </P> <P> On another occasion, Bryant charged, Wilson filled a city position with an  acquaintance instead of advertising the post as dictated by council policy.  </P> <P> Smith and Nymeyer, however, denied that Wilson was implementing his own agenda.  </P> <P> "The Pomona City Council sat down with Mr. Wilson and we set the goals," Smith  said. "Every program or project that was carried out was in line with those  goals."  </P> <P> Smith said Bryant was jealous of Wilson and seeking to show his new political  muscle.  </P> <P> "Mr. Bryant has stated on more than one occasion that he is jealous of the  power the city administrator has," she said. "He wants a city administrator  that only he alone can control. This was more for personal reasons; Mr. Bryant  could not control Mr. Wilson and that's why he got rid of him."  </P> <P> Ursua, although admittedly a novice on the council, said he was qualified to  vote for Wilson's ouster because he knew Pomona under the old political guard  -- the same group that hired Wilson.  </P> <P> </P> <P> First to Go  </P> <P> Likening the new council majority to a corporate takeover, Ursua noted that the  old chief executive officer is always the first to go.  </P> <P> "The rest of the administration has to know who's in charge now, and that's the  best way to get it across," Ursua said. "You get rid of the CEO."  </P> <P> Ursua said he objected to Wilson wanting to push Pomona into more commercial  development even though the city has a critical need for affordable housing.  </P> <P> Although she voted for hiring Wilson, Soto said she always objected to his  large salary and his condition that he be allowed to continue to run his  consulting company. "I thought his demands on salary and concessions we had to  make were a little bit too much for Pomona."  </P> <P> Richard E. Yochum, president of the Pomona Chamber of Commerce, said: "We're  disappointed and dismayed," by the dismissal.  </P> <P> While many of Wilson's plans had not come to fruition, Yochum said, the chamber  liked the direction the administrator had pursued.  </P> <P> "With A. J.'s termination, we'll just have to wait to see what the city brings  in new management and if they can continue the movement," he said.  </P> <P> Nymeyer charged that Wilson was fired for not bowing to Bryant's whims.  </P> <P> "If we want to pay someone to tell us what we already think, why waste the  public's money," Nymeyer said. "Frankly, I'm just disgusted."  </P> <P> A central issue in Wilson's firing appears to be the city's ongoing plans to  develop a regional shopping mall. The mall, which would cover 74 acres near the  intersection of the Pomona Freeway and Corona Expressway, would require a  complicated funding scheme requiring county assistance.  </P> <P> The county has agreed to contribute $31.3 million for the shopping center in  return for more than $61 million in increased revenue through the city issuing  bonds and from increased revenues of various city redevelopment projects over  the next 30 years.  </P> <P> Bryant said he was alarmed by the long-term monetary commitment and thought the  city was doing too much to placate the project developers.  </P> <P> But Nymeyer said the mall project, and the creative financing structure, were  exactly what the council wanted from Wilson.  </P> <P> "This particular move by the City Council could seriously jeopardize that,"  Nymeyer said.  </P> <P> Soto, however, said that "nothing will happen to the (project) without having  A. J. around. He doesn't walk on water."  </P> <P> Bryant also charged that Wilson had been derelict in not effectively combatting  the city's spiraling problems with street gangs and drug dealers. As the city's  top administrator, Wilson should have overseen the allocation of resources,  Bryant asserted.  </P> <P> Nymeyer said that was never Wilson's job.  </P></p>

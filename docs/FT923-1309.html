			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Poor hit back at structural adjustments STRUCTURAL adjustment programmes imposed by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund have brought disaster to the working poor of as many as 100 countries, according to representatives of non-governmental organisations in Washington at a forum this week. Part of the difficulty is that the stalled Uruguay Round has changed the rules of trade for the poor countries, which have been forced under structural adjustment to open their markets to a flood of cheap imports, while the US, EC and other industrialised countries have refused to abandon their subsidies, quotas and high tariffs. This has produced trade distortions and a 'brutal' suppression of wages and living standards, while governments have been forced by the bank to cut their social programmes, according to Mr Doug Hellinger, executive director of the Development Gap organisation. 'The markets aren't there for the poor countries,' he said, noting the continued barriers to textiles and third world commodities. The Development Gap, Friends of the Earth and three other groups brought the NGOs to Washington this week to make their case against structural adjustment during a forum which has been carried on cable television. The NGO representatives described a growing gap between the rich and poor in their countries, and rising bitterness and violence. They attributed the fall in commodity prices to the farm export subsidy battle under way between the US and the EC. 'It does not take a genius to see what has happened,' said Mr Martin Khor, research director of the Consumers' Association of Penang and a co-ordinator of the World Rainforest Movement. The favourite prescription for sick economies - more exports - has spurred over-production, cut-throat competition, a collapse of prices and exploitation of workers and natural resources. 'Small enterprises, which can't compete against imported goods, are closing, and the aid given them by the development banks is a drop in the bucket,' Mr Hellinger said. Ms Peggy Antrobus of Barbados, founder of the Women and Development Institute, said that, after 13 years of economic adjustment, one-third of the population in her country lives below the poverty line. Social services have been cut by 40 per cent, health care has badly deteriorated and such basic necessities as soap and bandages are often unavailable. Ms Narda Melendez, co-ordinator of Asociacion Andar, a private development group in Honduras, said 73 per cent of the population there was in poverty. 'We work in sweatshops outside the law,' she said. Children were receiving less than half of their needed daily intake of calories. The World Bank has yet to release its third report on structural adjustment lending, presented to its board early this summer. The report recommended that 'more attention' be paid to 'protecting the poor during adjustment'.</p>

			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TANKER SPILL THREAT IN GULF GENERATES POLITICAL FALLOUT;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: THERE ARE RENEWED CALLS FOR SAFER ENERGY ALTERNATIVES. THE  PRESIDENT MAY DELAY A DECISION ON OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS DRILLING.  </P> <P> For three tense days, many feared that the crippled Norwegian tanker Mega Borg  could leave a wake of oil three times larger than last year's 11-million-gallon  Exxon Valdez spill. Now those fears are easing, but the political fallout is  just beginning.  </P> <P> From the Galveston City Council to environmentalists in Washington, the Mega  Borg explosion has added yet more fuel to the controversy over offshore oil  operations and development.  </P> <P> In the 16 months since the Exxon Valdez ran aground on Bligh Reef in Alaska's  Prince William Sound, there have been an estimated 10,000 oil spills on land  and water, including major spills off Huntington Beach, Calif., and in New York  harbor, and now the spectacular blaze in the Gulf of Mexico.  </P> <P> In Austin, the capital of this state traditionally friendly to oil, there were  renewed calls for increased liability limits on oil spills and far greater  readiness to quickly respond to spills. At this point, powers taken for granted  by California state officials, such as conducting oil spill response drills,  have hardly been exercised here.  </P> <P> In the last 10 years, the state has joined in only one spill response drill and  that was two months ago.  </P> <P> The Galveston City Council later this week is scheduled to take up a resolution  urging the federal government to step up regulation of offshore oil transfer  operations, known as lightering. County commissioners are expected to take up  the issue next week. The explosion last Saturday occurred during such an  operation.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in Washington, environmentalists renewed their calls for switching  to what they say are safer energy alternatives.  </P> <P> There was also speculation that the spill may have caused yet another delay by  President Bush in announcing his decision on whether to push ahead with new oil  and gas drilling off the coasts of California and Florida.  </P> <P> The President on Tuesday said he would announce his decision "very soon now."  </P> <P> "The political process always responds to emergencies. It's amazing how things  are raised on the radar screen much more quickly," said Thomas Henderson,  executive assistant to Texas Land Commissioner Garry Mauro, an elected official  who oversees management of 4.5 million acres of state submerged lands, bays,  beaches and estuaries.  </P> <P> While local and state officials here are not calling for an end to offshore oil  operations and development, as have some in California, they are nonetheless  calling for new restrictions and safeguards.  </P> <P> The threat from the spill appeared to have diminished on Tuesday, but concern  remained that any reversal in the ship's condition resulting in a catastrophic  spill would threaten sensitive bird estuaries as well as the fishing, shrimp  and tourist industries.  </P> <P> Galveston Bay includes the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge and Matagorda  Island, both the homes of waterbirds that are currently breeding. There were  also concerns for two endangered species, the Ridley sea turtle and brown  pelican.  </P> <P> "This is the second-worst time of the year for oil to hit the beaches," said  William Reffalt of the Wilderness Society. A worse time, he said, would have  been during the winter and spring migrations.  </P> <P> Galveston Mayor Barbara Crews said the message to the oil industry is clear.  </P> <P> "Our community is very concerned. We would like better coordination, quicker  response and more regulation so this kind of potential disaster does not occur  without extraordinary precautions and preparations being taken before hand,"  Crews said.  </P> <P> As modest as the resolution may seem to some, she said it is the kind of  council action that might not have come up before. The four counties around  Galveston Bay comprise a major refining and and petrochemical center.  </P> <P> Terry Whitledge, a senior research scientist with the University of Texas  Marine Science Institute who helped win national estuary status for Galveston  Bay, said the public is beginning to take notice.  </P> <P> "There's a certain public apathy that has been in the system. I think we're  starting to realize that kind of apathy catches up with us. I think the public  is tending to pay more attention to the accidents they are hearing about and  kind of wondering if there is something we should be doing about it," Whitledge  said.  </P> <P> In the year since the Exxon Valdez accident, oil spill liability legislation  has remained stalled in Congress, tied up in a joint House-Senate conference  committee.  </P> <P> The impasse, in turn, has resulted in the oil industry postponing the  operational date for its promised five regional oil spill response teams first  announced last year.  </P> <P> Some hope the Texas spill will spur action.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEX HARASSMENT COMPLAINTS BY FEMALE CITY WORKERS DROP  </P> <P> The number of female Los Angeles city employees being sexually harassed has  declined slightly in the last three years, and the perpetrators have more often  been co-workers than superiors, according to a city survey presented to a City  Council committee Wednesday.  </P> <P> The number of women reporting harassment dropped from 36% in a 1987 study to  31% in a 1989 follow-up survey, with the majority of respondents saying they  were harassed by co-workers, said Susan J. Rose, executive director of the  city's Commission on the Status of Women, which conducted the surveys.  </P> <P> Addressing the City Council's Human Resources and Labor Relations Committee,  Rose said the decrease in the incidence of sexual harassment, along with the  decline in harassment by supervisors, indicated steps taken after the 1987  study succeeded in educating employees about sexual harassment.  </P> <P> The July, 1989, survey was a follow-up to a 1987 survey. That study found that  70% of all women who did not report sexual harassment refused to do so because  they thought it would do no good. More than 60% did not report the harassment  out of fear of retaliation.  </P></p>

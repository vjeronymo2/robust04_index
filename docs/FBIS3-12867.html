Since the early moments of the massacre, Jordan -- king and  government -- acted in a manner showing that it is the major  party concerned with this affairs. The language used by King  Husayn indicated that he is the person most directly concerned  with what happened at the Ibrahimi Mosque. The Royal Court thus  declared a three-day mourning period and his majesty donated  100,000 dinars to the victims of the massacre. The king also  immediately instructed the Jordanian delegation in Washington to  inform the U.S. Administration of the suspension of the  negotiations -- without consulting the PLO. His majesty also  received appeals from Hebron residents asking him to come to  their rescue. These appeals are a political yardstick showing  that Jordan is the party to which the people inside the  territories turn in times of hardship.    The Jordanian Government, led by Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam  al-Majali,  has translated the political significance of the steps taken by  King Husayn into concrete action. It has asserted, through a  show of mourning and by sponsoring licensed demonstrations and  marches, that it was deeply affected by what happened in Hebron.  For the first time in its history, the Jordanian Government has  been the leader in a state of "protest" against what is  happening inside the occupied territories.    These "panoramic" steps raised controversy among Palestinian  community leaders. Some observers even went as far as to say  that Jordan has reopened the traditional competition between  Amman and the PLO over Palestinian representation. This war of  representation did not end with the decision issued by the 1974  Rabat summit, which asserted that the PLO is the sole,  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. On many  occasions, King Husayn voiced reservations about this decision  when it has not facilitated the mission of the Palestinians to  acquire their legitimate rights as the Arabs had thought.</p>

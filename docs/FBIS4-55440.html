			<p>BFN     [Text] Brcko, May 13 (TANJUG) -- Serbian Radical Party  leader Vojislav Seselj said on Friday [13 May] that the crucial  battle in the Bosnian civil war would be fought in the area of  Brcko in the north, because Brcko was crucial to the Bosnian  Serb republic and its loss would jeopardise the Serbs' very  survival. Brcko is situated in the neck of a corridor in the  Sava river valley. The corridor, which is only 5 km wide at  this point, links the western and eastern parts of the Bosnian  Serb republic, as well as the Republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.)  in the west and Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) in the east.    The R.S.K. was formed in [word indistinct] by the local  Serbs  in those parts within the arbitrary communist-era borders of  Croatia where they are the majority population, in response to  Croatia's violent secession from Yugoslavia and trampling on  their rights. Speaking at a press conference at the close of a  visit to Brcko, Seselj said that Croats and Moslems had no leg  to stand on in the Sava river valley, 'even with the support of  NATO, which can do little else except kill innocent civilians.'    Seselj, whose Radical Party is in opposition in the  parliaments of both Yugoslavia and its constituent republics of  Serbia and Montenegro, insists the Serbs must give no quarter in  this battle for the survival of the western Serb states.  Commenting on a map which the Croats and Moslems agreed on as  the basis for their binational federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  Seselj said that `this is something the Americans can do in  Nevada, or Arizona, where they have lots of space and can do  what they please, but here, they cannot reckon without their  host.'    Bosnian Moslems and Croats, who have been fighting pitched  battles for territories in central Bosnia and Herzegovina for  over a year, met in Washington on March 18 and, acting under  strong U.S. pressure signed an accord to form a binational  federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which would subsequently form  a confederation with neighbouring Croatia.    At their U.S.-sponsored talks in Vienna earlier this week,  they laid claim to 58 percent of Bosnian territory. Bosnian  Serbs currently control 70 percent of the territory.</p>

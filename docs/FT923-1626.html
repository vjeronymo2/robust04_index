			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Maastricht - After the French Vote: Uruguay Round negotiators take a downbeat view TRADE negotiators involved in the stalled Uruguay Round of global trade talks in Geneva were yesterday downbeat in assessing post-referendum prospects. 'I'm not sure the French vote is going to be all that helpful,' said one European official, pointing to continuing political uncertainties on both sides of the Atlantic. The six-year-old multilateral negotiations have been moribund for months because of failure by the US and the European Community to resolve differences over farm trade reform. EC farm ministers meeting in Brussels also saw little prospect of an early breakthrough. France's Mr Louis Mermaz was quoted as saying only that 'the US must change its position'. Senior trade officials from the 'quad' countries - US, EC, Japan and Canada - meet in Geneva tomorrow to assess prospects for the round. Earlier this month, US and EC negotiators agreed to give their bilateral negotiations a 'final push' immediately after the Maastricht vote in France, in the hope of reaching accord by mid-October. Washington officials have said they want a deal ahead of the US presidential election on November 3. This would pave the way for conclusion of a Uruguay Round package in Geneva before the end of February 1993, when the US administration's 'fast track' negotiating authority expires. Failure to reach agreement by then would almost certainly sink the 108-nation round. But senior trade diplomats in Geneva worry that politicians may still be unready to make the often painful compromises needed for a settlement. 'I see no evidence the EC will be ready to deal,' said one. Continued anti-Maastricht feeling in Europe, including Britain which holds the EC presidency, along with currency turmoil and domestic difficulties affecting Germany, France, Britain and Italy will continue to paralyse trade decision-making, some negotiators believe. There is also a question mark over US credibility as a negotiating partner, since President George Bush is trailing Democratic challenger Bill Clinton in the polls. Mr Clinton has been silent on the Uruguay Round but the assumption is that he would want to put his own stamp on the outcome if he wins. This risks upsetting the delicately balanced package, much of which has already been drafted.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 1 (YONHAP) -- Seoul and Washington are  reportedly out of step over the timing of deploying U.S. Patriot  missiles in South Korea, with the Americans wanting to execute  the plan as soon as possible while the Koreans are in no hurry.  The two governments, currently discussing deployment of Patriot  missiles on the Korean peninsula, are considering some time in  March or April, a senior Seoul official said Tuesday.    Korea is in no hurry to deploy the missiles as there are no  clear signs of a threat to the Korean peninsula, while the  United States wants deployment to take place as soon as  possible, producing the difference of opinion, the official said.    Seoul, fearing that the missile deployment may provoke  Pyongyang and sidetrack the process of resolving the North  Korean nuclear problem, wants to watch the progress of the  nuclear talks before making a decision, he said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Somali </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A spokesman for the United Somali Congress [USC]  said today that the killing of nine Somali bandits by Indian  troops serving with UN forces as reported by the BBC Somali  Service on 15 March was a complete and malicious fabrication  that is far from the actual truth. There was no confrontation  between the Indian forces and Somali criminals who allegedly  intended to attack the food convoy.    The spokesman said the area where the incident occurred is  near the experimental station of [word indistinct] in Wanlaweyn  District, Shabeellaha Hoose. He said no criminals attacked the  Indian soldiers, but there was fighting going on between two  communities who live in the area. It was at this point that the  Indian troops, who were passing through, came across the  fighting and, without ascertaining what was happening, opened  fire, causing deaths and injuries.    Investigations into the incident are currently under way.  The USC spokesman called on the communities living in the area  and involved in the conflict to end the shameful fighting  immediately and assured them that the USC leadership would  consult Indian military officials over the shooting incident,  with a view to identifying those who committed the criminal act.</p>

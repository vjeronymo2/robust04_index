			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, </F> referred to as the "President of the State of Palestine," in  Tunis, by Muhammad al-Ashwaf, in Cairo, from the "Dialogue From  Afar" program; date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Al-Ashwaf] President 'Arafat, we welcome you to the  Voice of the Arabs.    ['Arafat] Thank you.    [Al-Ashwaf] Mr. President, what is the Palestinian position  on the consequences of the terrible massacre perpetrated by the  Jewish settlers against our Palestinian people in the Ibrahimi  Mosque in Hebron last Friday? What new political and security  revelations has this event provided?    ['Arafat] We must first point out that we were expecting  such  tragedies and wished to implement the Washington and Cairo  Agreements quickly. But it is clear that the Israeli leaders  are determined to continue their ploys of not implementing the  agreement and evading commitment to the agreed deadlines. I  wish now to refer to a grave issue, which we have discussed very  frankly with the Israeli officials. This is connected with the  involvement of some Israeli army units in the Hebron crime, a  crime that recalls an earlier massacre in the al-Aqsa Mosque and  another in Rishon LeZiyyon, that is, the 'Ayn Qarah. These army  units were also involved in other tragedies and clashes  following the Hebron massacre. Over 29 martyrs and 280 wounded  have fallen in addition to the large number of victims who fell  in Hebron: Some 65 martyrs and 256 wounded. One massacre  followed another: First, the catastrophic massacre in Hebron  and another perpetrated by the army in which 29 martyrs fell and  280 were wounded. What does this mean? This means that, as we  have noted, some Israeli army units are in collusion with the  armed settlers. I said this to Rabin when he telephoned me to  express his condolences. I told him: I have such and such  information. Under 20 minutes after the massacre, they--my  brothers Mustafa al-Natshah, 'Aziz 'Amr, 'Ali al-Qawasimah, and  the doctors at the hospital--telephoned me from al-Ahli Hospital  in Hebron and told me that an attack was waged against the  people who had gathered in the hospital to see the victims.  What does this mean? The Israeli Army is colluding with the  settlers. Are we confronting the same thing that our Algerian  brothers faced at the hands of the secret army? Our Algerian  brothers faced the same thing after they concluded the Evian  Treaty.    [Al-Ashwaf] President 'Arafat, the ugly crime against the  worshippers in the Ibrahimi Mosque has brought the issue of  Palestinian security strongly to the fore and showed that undue  emphasis on Israeli security involves a major falsehood. What  are your views about providing security for the Palestinians in  light of the Hebron massacre?    ['Arafat] It is clear now how hollow the Israeli ploy was.  Whenever we made any proposal, they used the settlers' security  as an excuse. What must now be provided is security for the  Palestinian people. This is why we insisted on submitting the  issue to the Security Council. We had a lot of trouble before  we could convene a meeting of the Security Council. We really  had a lot of trouble. Our Egyptian brothers, as the current  chairmen of the Arab group at the United Nations, are working  directly with us and know how much trouble we had at the  Security Council before we could convene the current session.  We are asking the Security Council to do two things: First, to  disarm the settlers, because there must be no power other than  the Israeli occupying army, and second, to provide an  international force to protect the Palestinian people, our  children, women, men, and masses and our Islamic and Christian  sanctities. Do you follow me? We are trying at the Security  Council and we hope to get a resolution adopted. We hope to do  this despite the difficulty of the discussions and the  maneuvering. We are waging a fierce battle at the Security  Council.    [Al-Ashwaf] Mr. President, you have demanded international  protection for the Palestinian people in the occupied  territories. What is the extent of that protection? Or, what  measures do you consider sufficient to meet the requirements of  that protection?    ['Arafat] We want protection like that established for our  brothers in Bosnia-Herzegovina, like the international  protection in Cambodia or that in Somalia. Why should the  Palestinian people alone be deprived of international protection?    [Al-Ashwaf] Speaking about an international force, Israel  has  announced its acceptance of a civilian international presence in  Gaza and Jericho alone. Do you think this is sufficient?    ['Arafat] Of course, it is not sufficient. Should we also  get guards to protect international observers? Where could we  obtain such protection, for God's sake? Is it a joke? This  shows their carelessness; it shows that the crime and the  massacre moved nothing in the Israeli mentality.    [Al-Ashwaf] We move to another point: The repercussions of  the crime have led the Arab-Israeli negotiations, particularly  on the Palestinian-Israeli track, to a real impasse. What is  the scale of that impasse?    ['Arafat] As we announced, we and the brother Arabs who  suspended the talks are not against negotiations. We have  particular terms to be fulfilled before we can resume these  talks.    [Al-Ashwaf] What are these terms?    ['Arafat] We should at least see what will happen, whether  in  the UN Security Council or in the Israeli Government; we should  see whether the Israeli Government will take particular measures  against the settlers and their weapons. I would like to remind  everyone, near and far, of what Rabin said. Didn't he say there  were political and security settlements? Some of these  settlements belong to those extremists. What measures will  Israel take against the settlements that belong to extremist  groups like Kakh, Barukh, and God knows who else? What can I  tell you? There are varying groups. Our people are required to  offer all these sacrifices on every level. I would like to say  that these massacres have not enfeebled us. We are the people  of martyrs, liberals, revolutionaries, and strugglers. We are a  formidable people. Massacres will not make us kneel down, epics  will not weaken us, and conspiracies will not lower our morals.  "So lose not heart nor fall into despair, for ye must gain  mastery" [Koranic verse]. This must be clear to everyone, near  and far. Tragedies and massacres will only make us stronger and  firmer. We are the servants of this holy land; each one of us  is willing to sacrifice his life. "On that day shall the  believers rejoice with the help of God. He helps whom he will  and he is exalted in might, most merciful" [Koranic verse].    [Al-Ashwaf] You earlier noted that Israel promoted weapons  in  the occupied territories. What is the truth in this?    ['Arafat] I am saying that these [settlers] are units of the  Israeli army. This means that we are up against the same  situation our brother Algerians encountered. A secret  organization within the army is distributing weapons so that  when they withdraw, an inter-Palestinian massacre will ensue.  No inter-Palestinian massacre will take place. We differ in  our views. [Second Muslim Caliph] 'Umar Ibn-al-Khattab said:  May God have mercy on a man who corrects 'Umar's mistakes. We  welcome counterviews. But this will neither dissuade us nor  weaken our determination.    [Al-Ashwaf] Mr. President, before we conclude this dialogue,  would you say a word to the sons of the steadfast Palestinian  people in the occupied territories?    ['Arafat] I tell them that this is an opportunity to enhance  the unity of our ranks and to stand up in one line against our  enemy. "Truly God loves those who fight in his cause in battle  array as if they were a solid cemented structure" [Koranic  verse]. I say to them: Have patience and rely on God's help. I  know the road is difficult and long but our determination is  stronger and we are more patient. "Our Lord, pour out constancy  on us and make our steps firm and help us against those that  reject faith." "Blot out our sins and grant us forgiveness and  have mercy on us. Thou art our protector. Help us against  those who stand against faith" [Koranic verse]. God willing, we  will get together soon to pray in the blessed al-Aqsa Mosque and  the Ibrahimi Mosque. We will also pray at the Church of the  Sepulcher and in Bethlehem as one people with one firm will.  "That even the apostle and those of faith who were with him  cried: When will come the help of God? Ah! Verily, the help  of God is always near," [Koranic verse]. We will stick together  until victory, victory, victory with the help of God.    [Al-Ashwaf] Would you like to emphasize anything else?    ['Arafat] I would like to thank my brothers in Egypt and  President Mubarak for the effort they are making with us. I  thank the custodian of the two holy mosques, my brothers in the  Arab Maghreb, all our Arab brothers, and the Islamic and  Christian powers that have stood firmly with us on the incident.  I thank them for their support. We will stick together until  we get to Jerusalem, God willing.    [Al-Ashwaf] We thank you deeply and welcome you always on  the  Voice of the Arabs.    ['Arafat] God willing, we will pray together in Jerusalem.    [Al-Ashwaf] God willing.</p>

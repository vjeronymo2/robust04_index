			<p>BFN     [Text] The Palestinian police force is not in control of  the situation in the Gaza Strip and has even ceased trying to  handle traffic. Our correspondent Nisim Qeynan has learned from  Arab sources that armed and unmasked Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement] members have been roaming around the Gaza Strip  undisturbed since yesterday.    Nabil Sha'th, head of the PLO delegation, arrived in the  strip from Egypt last night for a 24-hour visit. He is holding  talks with Palestinian police commanders and others on the  functioning of the police force in the autonomy, as well as on  different matters.</p>

			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Travel agencies extend price-cut campaign The three largest travel agency chains are to continue their price-cutting campaign for a further week amid signs that the surge in holiday bookings has ended. Lunn Poly, Going Places and Thomas Cook all said yesterday that they would extend their 11 per cent discounts on summer 1994 holidays until January 8. The three chains launched their 11 per cent discounts immediately after Christmas. Travel agents said yesterday, however, that the level of bookings last week had been no higher than in the equivalent period a year ago. Thomas Cook said it estimated that 200,000 holidays for this summer were sold last week by travel agents, about the same level as in the post-Christmas period last year. Mr Kevin Welch, marketing director of Going Places, consisting of the former Hogg Robinson and Pickfords Travel chains, said: 'Last week's trading has been excellent, exceeding our expectations. Most branches have also seen an exceptionally high brochure pick-up, which augurs well for future bookings.' In contrast, Thomas Cook said: 'The reality is we don't think there's been a dramatic increase on last year. We're seeing the market levelling off.' Lunn Poly confirmed that booking levels since Christmas had been about the same as a year ago. The slowdown in bookings follows a highly successful campaign last autumn to persuade people to buy their summer 1994 holidays early. Thomson, the largest tour operator, said it had sold 1m summer holidays by Christmas - double the number sold by Christmas 1992. Airtours, the second biggest operator said last month that its summer 1994 sales were up 53 per cent. The travel industry accepted that the rate of increase in sales was unsustainable. Most expect the final tally for summer 1994 sales to be between 5 per cent and 10 per cent up on 1993. The travel agents' decision to extend discounting is largely an attempt to win market share. As an 11 per cent discount cancels out the average commission most chains do not expect price-cutting to continue for more than a week.</p>

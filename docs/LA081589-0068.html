			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEVERAL AIRLINES TO REDUCE FARES FOR FALL SEASON  </P> <P> Most of the largest U.S. airlines slashed their round-trip discount fares by as  much as $160 on Monday to build traffic during the historically weak fall  season.  </P> <P> The round of fare cutting was led by Trans World Airlines, which cut its fares  to 85 U.S. cities and 15 overseas destinations Sunday. On Monday, Northwest  Airlines, Continental Airlines, United Airlines, American Airlines and USAir  said they would match TWA's domestic reductions. Delta Air Lines said Monday  that it was studying the situation.  </P> <P> Northwest, Continental and USAir said they would drop their prices only on  routes where they compete with TWA. But American and United, the nation's two  largest air carriers, said they would reduce round-trip fares to all U.S.  destinations except those in Alaska and Hawaii.  </P> <P> </P> <P> One Change Allowed  </P> <P> The airlines that announced the fare cuts are imposing identical restrictions:  </P> <P> The reduced fares apply to travel between Sept. 9 and Dec. 15, except over the  Thanksgiving holiday. Tickets must be purchased by Sept. 1, are non-refundable  and require a Saturday night stay. However, in a change from previous discount  fare offers, travelers are allowed to change their travel dates once without  penalty.  </P> <P> The reduced round-trip fare on Continental Airlines, for example, from New York  to Los Angeles is $198 on Tuesday and Wednesday and $298 Thursday through  Monday. That is a reduction from $356 round trip on Tuesday and Wednesday and  $398 round trip Thursday through Monday.  </P> <P> A round of fare cuts aimed at leisure travelers had been expected. "This is not  unusual to see," said Robert Gibbons, a spokesman for Northwest Airlines. "With  summer over and the kids back in school, vacation travel falls off some."  </P></p>

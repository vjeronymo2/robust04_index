			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HANDYMAN Q&amp;A: HANDYMAN: WORK TIPS;  </P> <P> INSTALLING WOODEN FLOOR ON TOP OF CONCRETE BASE  </P> <P> QUESTION: I know a wood floor can be installed over concrete because I have  seen it on two occasions. In neither case was the owner of the house able to  tell me how it had been done, since it was there when the houses were  purchased. My plan is to put tongue-and-groove flooring over a concrete floor  in what once was a garage. Can you at least give me a hint on how it is done?  </P> <P> ANSWER: A wood floor can be placed over concrete by first setting 2-by-4s into  mastic spread on the concrete. There are two ways to do this. One is to place  the mastic over the entire floor, in which case only about one-eighth of an  inch is required. Or you can put mastic on the floor only where the 2-by-4s or  screeds will be placed. The mastic then should be twice as thick. You will need  2-by-6s and 2-by-8s along the walls. The flooring is attached to the screeds  after it has set thoroughly.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shellac Stick Available for Fixing Furniture  </P> <P> Q: I read somewhere about a product called a shellac stick. If I recall  rightly, it could be used for repairing scratches or other small furniture  mars. Do you know if this is still available? My local hardware store says if  there was such an item it probably isn't made any more. He says I must be  thinking of wax sticks. Is he right?  </P> <P> A: No. There was -- and is -- such a thing as a shellac stick. It must be  melted very carefully and requires a certain amount of expertise. Many  professional wood finishers still use this shellac stick, but the wax stick is  somewhat similar and easier to use.  </P> <P> Pros say the shellac stick is superior. Try the wax stick and see how you make  out. If you are dissatisfied, try the shellac stick, being sure you get the  alcohol lamp and whatever else is required to get good results. You probably  can use a wax stick easily the first time out, whereas the shellac stick is  something you have to learn how to use. Both come in a variety of colors to  match the wood you are repairing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ripsaw Leaves Rough Edge, Needs Sanding  </P> <P> Q: I have worked with handsaws for many years but have never used a ripsaw,  which I will have to do on an upcoming project. Anything I should know about  using a ripsaw?  </P> <P> A: The technique is very much the same, except a ripsaw should be held at about  a 60-degree angle, whereas a crosscut saw is held at a 45-degree angle.  Remember to do the same thing you do with a crosscut saw, cut on the waste side  of the cutting line. One thing you will notice. The cut with a ripsaw usually  is a lot rougher than with a crosscut saw, so you will have to smooth the edges  with sandpaper when you complete the cutting.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Avoid Extremes in Weather in Caulking  </P> <P> Q: We want to caulk the outside of our house. Is spring a good time to do this?  </P> <P> A: When caulking is required, any time is a good time to do it. When you have a  choice, the fall is considered the proper time in areas where winter places a  burden of some sort on the house. Proper caulking, for instance, can cut down  on heating bills as well as permit air conditioning to work more efficiently.  No matter when you do the caulking, it is best to avoid extremes of  temperature.  </P> <P> Wants to Know Size of Drill to Purchase  </P> <P> Q: I am about to purchase an electric drill. My home center carries three  sizes. Is there any special one I should buy?  </P> <P> A: The 1/4-inch drill usually is the starting tool, but the 3/8-inch drill has  become very popular in recent years because it handles heavier work a bit more  easily, whereas a 1/2-inch drill is more in the commercial line or at least for  serious, heavy-duty workers. Remember the size designates the size of the chuck  into which the bit fits. A 1/4-inch drill, for instance, can handle bits that  cut into wood and make 1/2-inch holes, providing the chuck of the bit is no  larger than 1/4-inch. The same goes for the other sizes.  </P> <P> The techniques of using varnish, shellac, lacquer, stain, sealer, bleach,  remover, etc., are detailed in Andy Lang's booklet, "Wood Finishing in the  Home," which can be obtained by sending $1 to Know-How, P.0. Box 477,  Huntington, N.Y. 11743. Questions of general interest will be answered in the  column.  </P> <P> </P></p>

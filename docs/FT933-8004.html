			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Hanson Even by Hanson's legendary standards of opacity, its third-quarter results are particularly murky as it finalises the acquisition of Quantum. What little can be gleaned suggests the Peabody strike is now inflicting real pain while the UK and US recoveries are proving largely joyless. The market, though, seems prepared to look through the dull outlook for this year and next towards the sunnier uplands that may lie beyond. If Hanson's early cycle businesses are sparking by then and its late cycle activities can take up the slack, Hanson could again produce faster earnings growth than the market.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to Seoul radio, the nation-selling Kim  Yong-sam traitorous clique proclaimed [kongpo] on 6 May that the  puppet Army, Navy, and Air Force will stage a joint tactical  exercise for the first half of the year, a new large-scale war  exercise, from 9 through 14 May.    The puppet clique is planning to carry out operations on the  ground, in the air, and in the sea -- including a battle  exercise; a chemical, biological, and radiological war exercise;  an exercise on transporting troops and equipment; and a takeoff  and landing exercise on emergency airstrips -- in the north of  Kyonggi Province near the Military Demarcation Line [MDL], South  Kyongsang Province, and the West Sea of South Korea. The puppet  clique is also planning to mobilize many domestic reserve troops  for this war exercise.    The U.S. imperialists and South Korean puppets should think  deeply about the grave consequences as a result of their  criminal act of driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to  the brink of war by repeating armed reinforcement and war  exercises.</p>

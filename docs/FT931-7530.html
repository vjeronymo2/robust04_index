			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Attack on PM over long-term jobless MR JOHN Smith accused Mr John Major of failing to understand the country's deep concern about unemployment, as he launched a fierce attack over yesterday's long-term jobless figures, David Owen writes. The Labour leader marked the day when the number of people who had been out of work for longer than one year officially crossed the 1m threshold by reminding Mr Major that overall unemployment had risen 'every single month since you took office'. Taunting the prime minister that a problem had to reach 'crisis proportions' before it appeared on the government's agenda, Mr Smith said it was 'appalling' that one in five of Britain's long-term unemployed were aged between 18 and 24. Mr Major retorted that the Labour leader had nothing but 'sound-bite politics' to offer. The government had put in place 'the most varied, comprehensive programme ever' to help the long-term jobless, he said.</p>

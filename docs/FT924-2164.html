			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Russians agree on new PM after switch by Yeltsin: Reform programme may slow as energy minister replaces Gaidar THE FUTURE of Russian reform was thrown into doubt last night after Mr Yegor Gaidar, one of President Boris Yeltsin's closest allies and the architect of radical economic policies, was thrown out of office. 'I don't believe all we did was in vain,' Mr Gaidar said after hearing Mr Yeltsin had failed in his bid to have him appointed as prime minister. Mr Gaidar, who had been acting prime minister, was replaced by Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, 54, formerly deputy prime minister responsible for energy. 'Of course I will resign and not return,' said Mr Gaidar, 36, immediately on learning that Mr Yeltsin, formerly his proclaimed supporter, had chosen to put Mr Chernomyrdin in his place. Mr Sergei Shakrai, deputy prime minister in charge of ethnic affairs, was said last night to be preparing a mass resignation of ministers closely associated with Mr Gaidar - including Mr Anatoly Chubias, deputy prime minister in charge of privatisation; Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister for foreign economic relations; Mr Andrei Nechayev, economics minister; and Mr Pyotr Aven, trade minister. Both Mr Yeltsin and Mr Chernomyrdin are likely to try to persuade them to stay but indications last night were that they would go with Mr Gaidar. Mr Gaidar's aides confirmed his ousting was a surprise, running against the string of promises made by Mr Yeltsin to do everything he could to keep him. Mr Chernomyrdin, in a speech to the Congress, promised to continue reforms 'but not through the impoverishment of the people' - a remark which won him applause. In a later interview with the news agency Itar Tass, he said that he would proceed 'to reforms, to a market economy but not to a bazaar'. Russia should concentrate on halting a steep fall in output, Mr Chernomyrdin told reporters after chairing his first government meeting. 'I think the reforms should now take on a somewhat different tone, move on to another stage,' he added. The new prime minister, with a final vote of 721, succeeded in uniting all but the radical democratic part of the Congress behind his candidature. Mr Yeltsin's radical supporters were furious and bewildered by his action. Mr Mikhail Schneider, a senior official of the Democratic Russia movement, said: 'Every step we made in the past few days was based on the assumption that Yeltsin would nominate Gaidar. Now that he has acted otherwise we don't know what to do.' One minister, who asked not to be identified, said Mr Yeltsin had decided not to support Mr Gaidar after gathering only 400 of the deputies' votes. Mr Gaidar, he said, refused to resign but was removed by Mr Yeltsin. Over the weekend Mr Gaidar had been prepared to step down to give the president freedom to act in the best interests of the country, one of his advisers said. However, he was also prepared to continue to work as head of an economic reform team, if the alternative choice as prime minister had been to his liking - for example, Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister. Mr Gaidar had also thought of taking another post, including that of head of the president's council of advisers, vacant after the sacking of Mr Gennady Burbulis at the weekend. However, according to his advisers last night, he has decided against it. Though Mr Chernomyrdin topped the vote of the deputies, Mr Gaidar did well enough to stay in the first three. He could thus have been nominated by Mr Yeltsin and made acting prime minister for three months, if not confirmed by the Congress.

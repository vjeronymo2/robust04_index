			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN VOWED TO BECOME PRIEST IF WIFE'S SUFFERING STOPPED;  </P> <P> ORDINATION AT 80 FULFILLED PLEDGE TO GOD  </P> <P> Bill Schumacher knew his wife was dying.  </P> <P> Genevieve, the first woman he ever kissed, the mother of his six children, his  wife of 52 years, was in a coma. Only a respirator sustained what life remained  in her frail body.  </P> <P> So Schumacher made his pact with God. He prayed that Genevieve would go  quickly. And, in return, Schumacher made a promise -- he would become a priest.  </P> <P> On that day in 1984, Bill Schumacher was 75 years old.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'I Am Ready Now'  </P> <P> God kept his end of the bargain. Genevieve died four days later in a Chicago  hospital. And Schumacher recalls thinking then: "Lord, I am ready now."  </P> <P> Thus began an odyssey of religious commitment that would eventually lead to  Schumacher's ordination into the priesthood last year, only a few days shy of  his 80th birthday. It would lead him to St. Patrick's Church in Dallas, where a  bishop believed Schumacher could make a contribution despite advancing years.  It would, in fact, bring him a certain amount of fame, for only one man has  been ordained in the United States at a more advanced age.  </P> <P> At the start, though, his quest had the look of failure. Not many seminaries  are eager to take a man who is at the outer edge of the actuarial charts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Told He Was Too Old  </P> <P> Schumacher sent out dozens of letters to seminaries asking for admission. Some  didn't bother to reply. Others wrote but said he was far too old. Some wrote  back asking for donations. Finally, Schumacher found Holy Apostle Seminary near  Hartford, Conn., one of the few places that admit older men.  </P> <P> Being older was one thing and being Schumacher's age was quite another. The  seminary said that it would accept Schumacher, but only if he found a bishop to  sponsor him, to guarantee, in effect, that there was a job waiting for the  aging aspirant.  </P> <P> The search began anew. Schumacher wrote letters to 39 dioceses and got back 32  replies, most of them negative. But one man called him. It was Bishop Thomas  Tschoepe of Dallas, who agreed to sponsor him.  </P> <P> "He looked like a good prospect, so we took him," the bishop said.  </P> <P> The deal was done. Schumacher called a meeting of all his children to tell them  he planned to enter the seminary. They only smiled, having long since figured  out what their father was up to.  </P> <P> The study for the priesthood began in earnest. Schumacher's dorm room was the  worst in the seminary, one directly under the stairwell, and he was often  awakened by footsteps in the late night.  </P> <P> Schumacher tacked a portrait of Jesus to his door, as well as a sign that said:  "Old age ain't for sissies." Each day, he walked 102 steps up a hill from  classroom to dorm room.  </P> <P> Three years of this, and his studies were complete. Schumacher chose his home  parish in Chicago for the ordination. Bishop Tschoepe performed the ceremony.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Television Cameras Roll  </P> <P> The television cameras rolled on that day, for word had gotten around that  Schumacher was the oldest man ever to be ordained in the United States.  (Subsequently, a priest was found in rural North Carolina who had been ordained  shortly after his 80th birthday.)  </P> <P> Friends on vacation in the Soviet Union saw the ordination on the evening news  in Leningrad.  </P> <P> "I have reached my goal," a tearful Schumacher said that day.  </P> <P> Father Schumacher's new chalice was adorned with the ring he gave Genevieve on  their 50th wedding anniversary.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Son Presents Plaque  </P> <P> His son, Richard, presented him with a plaque that said: "You're never too old  to start something," words of advice the father had given the son years  earlier.  </P> <P> Now Schumacher says Mass daily at St. Patrick's. He visits the sick and the  aged and hears the confessions of parishioners.  </P> <P> "He has added a new dimension to the parish," said Msgr. Richard Johnson, St.  Patrick's pastor.  </P> <P> Schumacher has baptized his great-grandson and performed the wedding ceremony  for one of his 12 grandchildren. He has adjusted well to the priestly life.  </P> <P> "I feel great that the opportunity has been given to me to serve other people,"  Schumacher said in his office the other day. "I've got a useful life ahead of  me."  </P></p>

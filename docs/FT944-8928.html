			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: Tough times for Telmex as Mexico prepares to open market - Dominant position threatened as telecoms company faces increasing competition without a big partner Telmex, the Mexican telecommunications monopoly, faces some big questions about its competitive position following last week's announcement by AT&amp;T, the US long-distance communications group, that it would form a joint venture in Mexico with the industrial conglomerate Grupo Alfa. The AT&amp;T-Alfa venture will offer telecommunications services when the Mexican market is opened to full competition in 1997. AT&amp;T, the largest US long-distance carrier, had been widely expected to form an alliance with Telmex, creating an extremely powerful team. Instead, the Alfa deal leaves Telmex without a big international long-distance partner. The two other leading US long-distance carriers - MCI and Sprint - already have Mexican partners: MCI has a deal with Mexico's largest bank, Banamex, and Sprint is allied to the cellular telephone group Iusacell. Telmex's dominant position in Mexico - where the long-distance market is expected to produce revenues of Dollars 20bn by the end of the decade - means its ability to generate profits in future years is not in doubt. Yet analysts believe competition will cut Telmex's market share and operating margins. The group's profits are almost entirely derived from long-distance charges, which are among the highest in the world. Its loss-making local service is subsidised by the long-distance side - even though Telmex has made great strides since its late-1990 privatisation to rebalance rates. Competition will cut into Telmex's long-distance market share - by as much as 20 per cent in the first year alone, according to Baring Securities. The impact of that loss will be softened by the growth of the long-distance market, which is expected to expand by at least 12 per cent and perhaps as much as 22 per cent annually for several years. In addition, Telmex should be helped by a gateway agreement between Mexico and the US, its biggest international calling destination, governing the distribution of calls among carriers. Under the agreement, if Telmex is able to retain 75 per cent of northbound traffic it will be guaranteed 75 per cent of southbound traffic as well, no matter which carrier generates the call in the US. Of more concern to Telmex is the expected fall in long-distance rates that competition will bring. Rates in the US have fallen by about 50 per cent since competition was introduced over a decade ago and many are predicting a similar drop in Mexico. Mitigating this loss will be revenues Telmex will be able generate from charging third-party long-distance companies a fee for connecting their traffic with the basic local telephone network. The details of the fee schedule governing interconnection are still being debated by the Mexican government and are unlikely to be announced until next year, making it impossible to estimate the earnings impact of increased competition. 'The regulatory scheme will resubsidise Telmex to some extent . . . probably through an interconnection or access charge,' says Ms Bette Massick, a telecommunications analyst at SG Warburg. 'We just don't know how big that subsidy will be, which adds to the uncertainty about exactly how profitable the company will be.' Ms Massick predicts that, unless there is some big regulatory surprise, Telmex's operating margin will fall from the high 40s to somewhere between the low teens to the low 30s. This prospect scares some Mexican officials who worry that a fall in Telmex's share price could depress the Mexican stock market as a whole. Telmex accounts for approximately half of the Mexican market's entire capitalisation. Telmex's new long-distance rivals are likely to focus much of their attention on developing customised services for both business and residential users. Sprint-Iusacell and AT&amp;T-Alfa are expected to target residential customers, while MCI-Banamex and a fourth big alliance, GTE-GF Bancomer, will initially focus on high-volume business customers. It is in these specialised services where Telmex stands to lose by failing to link with a big long-distance partner. Neither Telmex nor its two existing international partners, Southwestern Bell of the US and France Telecom, have much experience in developing the sophisticated software platforms that support the customised billing services which help boost market share. Indeed, analysts say that Telmex failed to strike a deal with AT&amp;T because the US company felt Telmex was not well equipped to to deal effectively with the rash of new competition. AT&amp;T would have found it difficult to be in charge of a joint venture with a company as entrenched at Telmex, but it is expected to run the alliance with Alfa, a company that has numerous ventures with other foreign companies, including Du Pont, Ford, BASF and Kawasaki. Nevertheless, once the Mexican government defines the rules of telecommunications competition, Telmex will have considerable time to gear up for the challenge ahead. If Telmex decides that it still needs to move defensively, it could make a takeover run at Alfa. GF Inbursa, the financial group of Telmex's controlling shareholder Mr Carlos Slim, has become Alfa's largest minority shareholder, collecting at least 15 per cent of Alfa stock over the past two years.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MEXICAN TELECOM DEALS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mexican                       Overseas                  Value company                        partner           (Dollars bn) Grupo Alfa                        AT&amp;T                   1.00 Banacci (Banamex)                  MCI                   1.45 Iusacell                        Sprint                      * GF Bancomer                        GTE                      * Protexa                       Motorola                   6.00 Telmex              Southwestern Bell/                Ongoing                         France Telecom  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * not announced  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

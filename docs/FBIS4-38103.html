			<p>BFN     [Text] The amphibious Zafar-1 joint military exercise,  which started in Persian Gulf waters and the strategic Strait of  Hormoz on 30 Khordad [20 June], was concluded successfully today.    Light and heavy vessels, fast assault boats, rangers, and  commandoes of the Armed Forces and the Islamic Revolution Guard  Corps, and a number of fighter-bombers of the Islamic Republic  Air Force took part in the exercise.    Operations were carried out in six phases, involving the  control of communication routes and navy equipment; dispatching  units of light vessels; air and surface bombardment of  communication routes, vital positions, and installations of an  imaginary enemy; reconnaissance and mine-sweeping operations by  special teams; and capturing the positions and sea rescue  operations of the vessels of the imaginary enemy.    The Zafar-1 maneuver is one of a series of joint annual  exercises of the Armed Forces and the Guards Corps, aimed at  raising defensive capabilities and exchanging experience and  military know-how.</p>

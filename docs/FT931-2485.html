			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Arts: The Comedy of Errors - Theatre Like it or loathe it, director Gerard Stembridge's attack on Shakespeare on the stage of Ireland's National Theatre is too savage to be ignored. I loathed it. The Abbey has not had a shot at Shakespeare since 1984. In Stembridge they have chosen a director who is best known for television satire and recently produced a witty and polished version of Haydn's La vera costanza. His Comedy of Errors is set in country-and-western mode, the women sub-Dolly Partons in sequins and diamante, the male leads in cheap singing-cowboy suits. The set, by Monica Frawley (who also designed the costumes) and Joanna Taylor is a sickly shade of deep pink, and features a clapped-out Mini. The alley of small shops, brothel and hotel would be ideal for one of Tennessee Williams's seedier plays. This is one of Shakespeare's early and lesser comedies, featuring two sets of twins, the gentlemen Antipholus and their servants Dromio, and a convoluted series of mistaken identities. The verse is not Shakespeare's best, but it does occasionally sparkle, and there is more to the play in terms of intellectual content than is sometimes acknowledged. Because the plot is so far-fatched it must be played at a cracking pace, and this at least the Abbey cast achieve. It is a play that lends itself to exuberant expressions of fun. A Stratford production as far back as 1938 used song and ballet to fend off tedium, and costumes from a mixture of periods. So when the Abbey actors reach for a microphone and croon their couplets to a country music waltz they are within a recognisable tradition. The trouble is that whether spoken or sung, the lines are garbled, delivered in such strangulated tones that they are well nigh incomprehensible. The blame does not lie in the mix of Irish and American accents. The problem is that, with the shining exception of Aidan McArdle's Dromio, nobody seems to have the faintest idea how to speak blank verse. Not surprisingly then, with this disregarded for words, the higher concerns of the play, its exploration of identity, are lost, and what remains is slapstick and farce. The servant twins, Dromio, steal the play from their masters, Mikael Murfi showing himself as a consummate clown, with Aidan McArdle keeping pace. The problem with the production is one of pitch. It is not necessary to have recourse to the vulgarity of the country music scene and crude visual jokes (chain saws in place of drawn swords for example) to prove that Shakespeare is not stuffy and boring. To choose the tattiest culture available as a way of making Shakespeare palatable to a new audience is ultimately condescending and insulting. He is not that difficult, but anyone unlucky enough to be introduced to Shakespeare by this production will be baffled as to how he got his reputation. At the Abbey Theatre, Dublin</p>

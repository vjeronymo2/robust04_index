			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Arts: Buoyant Bhuller - Contemporary Dance Ever since he joined London Contemporary Dance Theatre a decade ago, Darshan Singh Bhuller has been identified with dancing that is mercurial, brilliant and varied in dynamics. In Richard Alston's The Perilous Night, his solo helps point to the future of London Contemporary Dance, as Alston will become director of the troupe when it mutates next year. The piece shows why there is much to hope for from him. Of the five new works seen on Rosebery Avenue thus far in this LDC season - one more to come next week - The Perilous Night is the most important. The piece uses John Cage's exercise for prepared piano of the same name. Alston's response to the nervous drive and gamelan clangours of Cage's score is a study in nocturnal alarms. Bhuller, in pyjama bottoms, vest, dark glasses (not a modish accessory but a symbol of night itself), is impelled through a sequence of dream - and possibly waking - states that convey, with unfailing resource, the physical imprint of unease. His body opens out, turns in on itself, builds long phrases of action that reach their culmination in a pose which seems to reverberate in response to the piano's sounds. The variety and imaginative richness of the dance is very fine, and no less finely exposed by Bhuller, who can shape a span of movement, or fragment it through a vivid shifts of timing and accent. The solo is as memorable as Alston's earlier Soda Lake. It is excellently lit by Peter Mumford. Cage's score is grandly performed by Nicolas Mojsiejenko. Let it please be filmed. Nothing else in this programme can stand close examination. Bhuller's choreography for Fall Like Rain is a tease. There are three couples, not radiantly happy, and a glutinous jazz score by John Martyn. Bhuller appears, on wires, as Yadahpati, king of the sky and of rain in the Hindu pantheon, who can foresee destiny. His interventions, swinging over the stage, swimming through the air to touch the mortals, are visually fascinating: there is a dance-piece to be made from the contrast between aerialism and earth-bound movement, but this is not it. For reasons I fail to grasp, monsoon rain falls - real water, in torrents. Everyone gets very wet, and the dance, such as it is, looks bedraggled. Gene Kelly never had that problem. Christopher Bruce's Waiting has to do with the release of Nelson Mandela from prison. The corrugated iron walls of a township serve as drums for the cast, who also roll motorcar tyres over the stage. The ever-admirable Kenneth Tharp dances magnificently, giving the pieties of the choreography real urgency. Mandela, in the person of the singer Kwame Kwei-Armah, appears. Never mind the dance; feel the predictabilities. London Contemporary Dance season continues at Sadler's Wells until Saturday. Programming varies. No performance today.</p>

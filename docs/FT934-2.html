			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / International Company News: Three brokers chosen for Dutch sale abroad The Dutch government yesterday named a troika comprised of brokerage houses Morgan Stanley International, SG Warburg and Credit Suisse First Boston to lead the first tranche of the privatisation of the Dutch postal and telecommunications monopoly abroad, AP-DJ reports from Amsterdam. The Dutch transport and finance ministries said the latest step has completed the basic structure needed for the flotation of the state-owned telecom company, Koninklijke PTT Nederland (KPN). The flotation of the first tranche, likely to be 25-30 per cent of the total share capital, is expected in the first half of next year and is by some analysts estimated to gross around Fl 4bn (Dollars 2bn) to Fl 5bn. Morgan Stanley has been appointed as regional lead manager for the flotation in the US, while SG Warburg will act as lead manager in the UK, the government said. CSFB will manage the flotation in the rest of the world, the government added. The names of other banks to be appointed to the syndicate that will finally carry out the flotation will be announced in March. At a later, as yet unspecified date, the government will also make known the number of shares available and terms under which US investors can participate in the offering. The announcement follows the appointment of a trio of Dutch banks in October, led by ABN-Amro, as global co-ordinator and chief manager.</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / OECD raps Poland's knuckles POLAND will be unable to reap the successes of its radical economic reform programme of 1990 unless it controls the budget deficit, defines property rights, and attracts savings and investment in order to create a viable capital base, according to the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. In its first report on Poland the OECD praises the Polish authorities for pushing through several far-reaching reforms in 1990. These had the effect of eliminating shortages, converting the zloty, liberalising trade, opening up the private sector, and bringing inflation down from 600 per cent in 1989 to an annual rate of around 40 per cent in 1991-1992. Yet despite this ambitious and courageous programme - the first to be implemented in eastern Europe - the OECD says successive governments have failed to build on it. They have failed to introduce reforms to contain the budget deficit, which was 3.8 per cent of gross domestic product last year and will be about 5 per cent in 1992. Attempts to reduce the deficit, the OECD says, have been hindered by delays in reforming the tax system, as well as overhauling public expenditure. 'Certain expenditure programmes - pensions and housing in particular - contain within them powerful expansionary pressures. . . Further strong measures on both expenditures and revenues are likely to be necessary in 1992 and beyond.' The report also criticises current legislation on property rights for creating 'considerable uncertainty'. It cites the existence of at least 50 different laws, ranging from legislation governing agricultural land transfer, to urban land taxation. Foreign investors will continue to shy away from Poland until they are assured of ownership, use, and transfer rights in property, it warns. The issue of property rights - and restitution - has affected the pace of privatisation. The OECD praises the mass privatisation programme, which seeks to transfer ownership of 400 enterprises to investment funds whose ownership will subsequently be vested in the population through a share distribution. But delays and interference by the bureaucracy are hindering its implementation. The Polish government is also taken to task for failing to tackle the problem of enterprises obtaining soft loans from other enterprises, or from banks. The persistence of this trend, typical of post-communist economies, coupled with a failure to adapt to market conditions, has meant that a third of Poland's 8,200 state-owned enterprises have reported pre- and post-tax losses in late 1991. The failure to apply bankruptcy proceedings, and shortcomings in banking supervision, have hindered enforcing financial discipline on state-owned companies. If the Polish authorities tackle these problems, foreign investment is likely to start flowing into the country. But the OECD warns Warsaw about the need to reassure investors on another level. 'What is needed, above all, is the confidence of the investors, which is fostered by stable 'rules of the game', consistency in carrying through stabilisation policies, and a minimum of bureaucratic intervention in investment decisions.'</p>

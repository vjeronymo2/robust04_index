			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Indonesia (2): Protectionism does not help - A growth economy faces some serious challenges While the international community is full of praise for the Indonesian government's consistency in sustaining average annual economic growth of 6 per cent over the past 25 years, the cabinet's economic team, which took over the reins of power in April 1993, faces some serious challenges. In order to maintain this momentum, the government estimates that it will need Dollars 305bn in its new five-year development plan, Repelita VI. Some 73 per cent of that must come from the private sector. It is needed to maintain thecountry's growth momentum. The economic team must tackle jealously guarded protectionist measures in some sectors, together with growing concern among some high-ranking officials that deregulation does little to alleviate the level of poverty. The economy appeared to be teetering on the edge of a crisis at the beginning of this year. Foreign debt had reached the worrying Dollars 90bn mark; inflation was climbing; growth in non-oil exports was slowing down; the oil price plummeted on international markets and foreign investment appeared to be levelling out. At the same time, the government reported a budget deficit of Dollars 8bn for the fiscal year 1994 . It had been hit hard by the worldwide slump in oil prices, which sparked off fears of a sharp one-off devaluation of the Indonesian rupiah, reminiscent of the 45 per cent devaluation that occurred in 1986. Oil prices have since climbed back from their year-long lows, so that the government's Dollars 16/barrel oil price assumption for its fiscal 1995 budget appears to be realistic. Meanwhile, foreign investment has also picked up. Analysts point to steady improvements in consumer demand and economic recovery in the developed countries as factors which could lift Indonesia's economic growth as high as 7 per cent this year, after expanding by 6.7 per cent last year. The looming crises did, however, bring home Indonesia's sensitivity to external economic factors. The country's oil exports may only account for a third of total exports, compared with two thirds at the beginning of the 1980s, but oil revenue is still an important part of the budget. That will remain the case as long as non-oil exports rely to a large extent on wood products and textiles. Textile prices slumped by about 25 per cent last year, accounting for much of 1993's sudden slowdown in growth of non-oil exports. What is needed to reduce the country's sensitivity to fluctuating oil prices is diversification of the non-oil export sector - a difficult feat to accomplish. Many of the country's most important economic figures are politically well-connected and have assumed monopolistic roles, protected by high tariffs. There is also growing friction at the unequal distribution of wealth in the country, an issue which economists say is being used as a back door way of getting at deregulation. The discrepancies between rich and poor are most striking in the cities, where luxury shopping malls, selling the latest western fashions at extravagant prices, tower over beggars and street vendors ekeing out a miserable existence. President Suharto is credited with reducing by two-thirds the number of people living in poverty since he took power in 1967. 'There is great sensitivity to distribution of wealth in many very high quarters,' says a Jakarta-based economist. The Indonesian government has been introducing deregulation packages regularly since the mid-1980s, but while deregulation of foreign investment has been relatively easy to push through, deregulating trade has been troublesome. 'A lot of export potential remains untapped,' the Jakarta-based economist says. 'There needs to be further deregulation but this has been met with a lot of resistance in the government, particularly deregulation of the agricultural sector, because this area of the economy delivers huge sources of rent to key economic players.' The latest deregulation package on foreign investment, introduced on June 2, was welcomed by economists and analysts who predict that it will significantly improve Indonesia's investment climate relative to competitors for foreign funds such as China, India and Vietnam. The move was well-timed. The minimum wage was raised by 46 per cent at the beginning of this year and it would be unwise to scare off labour-intensive industries while there are 2.5m people entering the work force every year. Easing restrictions on exports is proving more difficult, although economists estimate that high tariffs and protectionist measures could be costing the economy as much as 2 per cent in annual economic growth. These high rates of protection raise the costs of raw materials, and therefore production costs, for many local producers. Competing on international markets under these conditions is impossible. The problem is deep-rooted - some of the industries in question are controlled by President Suharto's family and friends. Economists point to the petrochemical sector, where last year the government introduced a 25 per cent import tariff on polypropylene resin accompanied by a 30-40 per cent import tariff on the plastic films with which resin is made. In the agricultural sector, import tariffs help maintain an artificially high price for sugar, which in turn hampers the development of an export-oriented food processing sector. The problem extends to the pulp and paper industry, where frustrated paper users formed an association to lobby the government. Despite dire warnings about the consequences of high levels of protectionism, the lobby - which includes publishers and printing companies  -has had little success so far. Mr Fauzi Lubis, chairman of the Indonesian Printing Company Association, was quoted recently in the national press as saying: 'Out of the country's 100 notebook manufacturers, only nine are still operating.' Donors and government technocrats are equally concerned at the high cost of heavy industry projects being undertaken by Mr B J Habibie, the minister of technology and research, at a time when the government is struggling to balance its fiscal 1995 budget. Mr Habibie's eagerness to develop aircraft manufacturing, car and nuclear power industries has caused a storm of controversy, reflecting the policy struggles taking place between technologists and technocrats in government. Although analysts recognise Mr Habibie's efforts in fostering a highly-trained work force, they argue that it is impossible to leap-frog to development through technical wizardry. If the growth of non-oil exports does not pick up and the current account deficit continues to grow hand in hand with foreign debt, the government's technocrats will certainly gain the upper hand. In the meantime they face the unenviable task of battling with well-connected business monopolies and cash-hungry state enterprises.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Balance of Payments (Dollars m)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Current account                               1992/93*     1993/94*  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Oil (net)                        1,327          759 Gas (net)                        2,188        1,990 Non-oil exports (fob)         24,823       28,169 Non-oil imports (cif)       (23,751)     (25,904) Non-oil services (net)         (7,148)      (7,888)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  2,561        2,888  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Capital account  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Donor aid                        5,755        5,894 Debt repayments                (4,840)      (5,146) Direct investments               1,705        2,048 Other capital flows              2,579        3,535  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  5,199          633  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                            2,638        3,443  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Fiscal year, ending March 31 Source: Bank Indonesia  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

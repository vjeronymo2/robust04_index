			<p>BFN     [Text] Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, says  the recent crackdown on press freedom in Indonesia has not  signalled a move away from liberalization by Jakarta. Senator  Evans says he believes Prime Minister Paul Keating will raise  the banning of three Indonesian news magazines with President  Suharto during his visit to indonesia. Mr. Keating leaves for  Jakarta tomorrow.    Speaking on commercial television, Senator Evans said that  Indonesian society was undergoing profound change and setbacks  were unavoidable.    [Begin Evans recording] This is part and parcel of the  bumps, and grinds and advances and retreats that are associated  with a major society in the process of major transition. I  think the underlying movement is clear and upward and onward and  all those fronts but there is bound, I fear, to be some retreat  along the way. [end recording]</p>

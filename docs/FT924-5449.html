			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average extends winning streak to fifth day REMARKS by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, that the government could undertake further public works projects for fiscal 1993 sent the Nikkei average higher for the fifth consecutive trading day, the longest winning streak since October last year, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei rose 205.92 to 17,302.01. After a day's low of 17,025.98 in the morning on arbitrage selling, buying by public funds and institutional investors lifted the index to a high of 17,303.01 in the afternoon. Volume was little changed at 200m shares against 194m. Advances led declines by 656 to 321 with 153 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 12.25 to 1,294.14 and the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 1.95 to 1,041.38. Public funds and domestic institutional investors were seen buying actively. Traders said that some investors had bought on the assumption that the active trading by public funds was prompted by financial authorities. Banks were higher on buying by public funds. Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y10 to Y2,420 and Mitsubishi Bank gained Y60 to Y2,260. Banks had been weak on fears that US-based hedge funds were looking to sell the shares short. Ms Kathy Matsui, strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said thatforeign hedge fund traders were moving away from the Tokyo market due to the recent lack of volatility in share prices. Dealers traded Aids-related shares actively. Hitachi Chemical, the most active issue of the day, rose Y6 to Y956. However, SS Pharmaceutical fell Y40 to Y1,200 on profit-taking. Gajoen Kanko, the hotel operator, was the largest gainer of the day and jumped Y33 to Y180. Traders said the rise was technical since the share had been heavily sold after the company's auditor accused the company of window-dressing its interim earnings. The company amended its earnings report last week. NEC recovered Y16 to Y650 on buying by public funds. However, other leading electricals were weak on profit-taking, with Hitachi down Y1 to Y703 and Fujitsu retreating Y8 to Y527. Nomura Securities fell Y10 to Y1,420 on reports of credit downgrades by Moody's, the credit rating agency. However, Nikko Securities remained unchanged at Y640 and Daiwa Securities gained Y1 to Y840. In Osaka, the OSE average gained 105.39 to 18,481.46 in volume of 20m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, rose Y300 to Y10,500. Roundup AUSTRALIA and New Zealand continued their recent run against a background of mixed performance elsewhere. AUSTRALIA was pulled off the day's high on profit-taking in the afternoon. After climbing to a high of 1,463.8, the All Ordinaries index fell back to close 9.1 higher at 1,459.2 in turnover of ADollars 291m. Westpac closed 8 cents higher at ADollars 2.98 amid ongoing speculation that a mystery buyer is attempting to purchase a large stake. Coles Myer fell 9 cents to ADollars 4.52 after it adjourned its annual meeting on Tuesday, pending clarification of the group's accounts. NEW ZEALAND finished a bullish session fractionally short of the day's high as the NZSE-40 index rose 25.59 or 1.7 per cent to end at 1,499.64 in high turnover of NZDollars 57m. BANGKOK closed broadly lower in low volume as a Bt10bn rescue fund pooled by brokers failed to start support buying. The SET Index lost 12.10 or 1.4 per cent to 847.33 in low turnover of Bt3.4bn. Bangkok Bank fell Bt1 to Bt91, Thai Farmers Bank Bt8 to Bt668 and Bangkok Land Bt3 to Bt100. HONG KONG ended lower in volatile but light trading.

The Straits Times Industrial index closed 0.45 higher at 1,419.79 in volume of 129.3m shares, up from 93.5m. SEOUL slid in lethargic trade mainly due to a persistent sell-off in Kepco, the market's most heavily weighted issue.

The composite index shed 2.58 to 652.47 in turnover of Won460.45bn after Won755.99bn. Kepco lost Won600 to Won22,800 as foreigners showed only modest buying interest after the government's decision on Tuesday to allow direct but limited foreign investment in the company.

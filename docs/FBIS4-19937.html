			<p>BFN     [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- The situation has improved for the  Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU].  It is benefiting from increasingly positive expectations for  economic development, in particular among voters in western  Germany, as the latest poll of the ZDF [Second German Television  Channel] Political Barometer shows. In April the CDU/CSU  reached its highest popularity in a year (west: 39 percent,  east: 24 percent), ZDF reported on Friday [22 April].    However, a majority of 54 percent still believe that the  Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] will win the Bundestag  elections in October; 30 percent believe that the government of  the CDU/CSU and Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] will win.  In the March poll, however, 61 percent had predicted an SPD  election victory, and only 23 percent saw the government in the  lead.    In contrast to the CDU/CSU coalition partners, the FDP was  not able to achieve an increase in popularity. In the so-called  Political Barometers projection, which also includes the  longer-term behavior of the voters, the FDP was at the critical  5 percent threshold in April. If Bundestag elections were held  next Sunday, the CDU/CSU would get 37 percent (plus 1 percentage  point,) the FDP 5 percent (minus 1 percentage point). The  results for the other parties would remain unchanged: SPD--39  percent; Greens--9 percent; Republikaner--4 percent; and Party  of Democratic Socialism--3 percent.    The proportion of German citizens who expect an economic  upswing has almost doubled over the past half year, according to  the Political Barometer. In October there were 23 percent, in  April 43 percent (west: 46 percent, east: 34 percent). Parallel  to this development, for the first time since last autumn the  CDU regained its competence for economic policy in the west  Germans' view and was once again ahead of the SPD (CDU/CSU: 27  percent, SPD: 22 percent). In eastern Germany the CDU/CSU and  the SPD are attributed an approximately equal share in their  ability to solve economic problems (CDU/CSU: 19 percent, SPD: 21  percent).    For the Political Barometer in April the Mannheim Election  Research group polled about 1,000 representatively chosen voters  in western and eastern Germany respectively.</p>

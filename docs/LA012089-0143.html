			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OFFICIALS DISAGREE ON SHRUB REMOVAL: IS IT A DIG AT THE HOMELESS?  </P> <P> Santa Ana city officials said shrubs and trees were uprooted as part the  maintenance plan for the Civic Center Plaza, but critics say the action is just  another effort to make life more inconvenient for the city's homeless.  </P> <P> Citing an earlier city policy of discarding the possessions of the homeless  stashed behind the same shrubbery, Robert Cohen, director of the Orange County  Legal Aid Society, said he sees the new action as "part of the package of  dealing with the homeless as a negative instead of dealing with them as people  who have problems."  </P> <P> "It just seems like an incredible coincidence," Cohen said.  </P> <P> Allen Doby, the city's recreation director, said the landscaping changes were  part of the city's annual maintenance plan and had nothing to do with the  homeless. "Our consideration is revamping the area every 5 years," he said.  </P> <P> Doby said the junipers and other shrubs, which often are used as shelter by the  homeless, were uprooted from around Civic Center buildings as part of the  revamping and to redo the irrigation system. The older shrubbery is being  replaced with flower beds that are more colorful and require less maintenance,  he said.  </P> <P> Last August, the Legal Aid Society sued the city on behalf of two homeless men  to discontinue a policy of discarding the bedrolls of the homeless. As a  result, the city now stores found bedrolls at Centennial Park, where they may  be claimed.  </P> <P> Doby said city workers send any bedrolls or personal items that are labeled  with names to the park, which is about 4 miles from the Civic Center.  </P> <P> But Cohen said Thursday that the homeless are only allowed to claim their  belongings 2 hours each week on Tuesdays and Fridays. He said the Legal Aid  Society filed an amended complaint to the original lawsuit over the access  issue.  </P> <P> "It seems they've gone out of their way to make things inconvenient for the  homeless," Cohen said. "You wonder what they're going to do next."  </P></p>

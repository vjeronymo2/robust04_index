			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Survey of Jamaica (5): System seems short on credibility - A look at a political scene ripe for revision and reform The ties that have bound Jamaicans to their political parties over half a century are loosening and the bitter ideological debates that divided the parties are now past. What is left is a battle for the new floating voters, and a widespread sense that Jamaica's political system and its politicians have not served it well. While the antipathy towards politics is not unique to Jamaica, it is recognised even by politicians themselves and has driven forward a proposed revision of the country's 1962 constitution. 'The way parliament is structured and the system of voting together mean that our system lacks credibility completely,' says Mr Edward Seaga of the opposition Jamaica Labour Party (JLP). The collapse of the socialist economies has been followed in Jamaica by a migration by the governing People's National Party (PNP) across the ideological spectrum - a shift led by Mr Michael Manley, who as prime minister in the 1970s tried to move the country towards socialism. After winning power in 1989, Mr Manley handed over power to his successor, Mr Percival Patterson, who himself won a landslide victory against the JLP last March. The PNP took 52 of the 60 seats in Jamaica's lower house, the margin of victory exaggerated by the Westminster style first-past-the-post voting system. In the election, some 11 people were killed in the political violence that has marred Jamaican elections for 30 years or more. In the worst year of election violence, 1980, some 800 people were killed as rival party supporters battled each other. Many voters' entrenched positions have softened over the years as a result of social and economic changes. In one sense, government has become less important. Deregulation and liberalisation have reduced the government's role in the economy. Budget stringency has meant that the powers of political patronage which tied many voters to parties have weakened. Mr Brian Meeks, lecturer in government at the University of the West Indies, says that other factors include the weakening of the family, through which party loyalty was traditionally passed. The growth of remittances from Jamaicans living abroad has reduced the importance of the local economy to some voters. To others living in some areas of the capital, loyalty to a politician has been replaced by loyalties to a local gang leader or Don. 'Politicians can't afford to finance criminals . . . Criminal elements are now linked to drugs and no longer hold on to the coat-tails of politicians,' says Mr Bruce Golding, chairman of the JLP. The prime minister says: 'The analysis of the available evidence establishes clearly that politics is a decreasing factor in the present level of crime and violence.' However, the perception that some politicians and criminals are closely linked - or were linked in the past - has led to questions about whether the political will exists to tackle the issue. Crime is not the only concern of voters, who have seen successive governments fail to raise living standards beyond the levels of 15 years ago and who are frightened by inflation. The constitutional revision is part of an effort to reassure voters that things can work better, although it is far from clear that the electorate is engaged in what some see as an arcane debate among politicians. The Jamaican system is even more centralised than the Westminster system on which is was modelled. The prospect of a revolt by the government's backbenchers' revolt is so remote there is no need for party whips - although a rebellion in the opposition JLP tried to unseat Mr Seaga as its leader. The prime minister has enormous power of patronage (far exceeding his counterpart in London). There are therefore few, if any, effective checks and balances on the power of the prime minister. 'There is absolutely no gridlock in our system. We have a smooth highway that leads straight to an authoritarian prime minister. We need a bit more gridlock,' says Mr Meeks of the University of the West Indies. Nonetheless, Mr Golding is among a number of politicians who believe that fear of a legislative gridlock will leave the system still modelled on Westminster even after the constitution is revised. A revision will probably establish a charter of rights for citizens. Among likely changes is the appointment of an advocate general who will seek to uphold citizens' rights against the government, on the assumption that the current position of attorney general is too beholden to the government of the day. It may also change the size and composition of the Senate. The Upper House is currently appointed: 13 members by the governing party; eight by the leader of the opposition - a split meant to ensure that the two-thirds majority needed for important constitutional changes requires a measure of cross-party support. The most likely change will enlarge the Senate to 31 members and provide for it to be directly elected through proportional representation. Some provisions - such as the replacement of the Queen as head of state - must be backed by a referendum, as well as a two-thirds majority of both houses. Mr Patterson says that constitutional change would not have to be voted upon in one block. A joint committee of both houses will first have to decide on what changes should be proposed: it could issue a set of interim proposals before the final recommendation are issued. Some provisions would only require a simple majority in parliament to be changed, while others - so-called entrenched provisions - require a bill to be laid before the house for six months before votes requiring two-thirds majorities in both houses. The so-called deeply entrenched provisions - which includes changing the head of state - would additionally require a referendum. Getting agreement between the two parties on constitutional reform is complicated by a controversy over election procedures. The government has promised there will be no further national elections until the electoral system - including a clean up of electoral lists and better checks on double voting - is improved. Local government elections due last year have already been postponed and may have to be put back further. However, the JLP says it wants such changes in place before by-elections are held and is boycotting elections until changes are made. As an illustration of some of the problems, in the last by-election - for a seat vacated to allow the new finance minister Mr Omar Davies to take up his cabinet position - 99.8 per cent of votes counted were cast for the ruling party. At some polling stations, the vote for the PNP was over 100 per cent. Whatever happens, when the next election comes around - it can be held as late as March 1997 but is more likely to be in 1995 or 1996 - Mr Seaga is likely to be competing as leader of the opposition. He says the struggle for the leadership of the party by the so-called Gang of Five did hurt the JLP, but has 'now purged' the system. Asked if it will be he who leads the party to the next election, he said: 'It looks like it.' Observers of the Jamaican political scene believe Mr Seaga has his eye on history. Like his rival Michael Manley, he would like to bow out of a long political career as prime minister, bequeathing leadership of the party and government to an anointed successor, probably Mr Golding.</p>

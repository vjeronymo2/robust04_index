The main goal of  today is to prevent another aggravation of the situation in  Bosnia, Russian Special Presidential Representative, Deputy  Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin told a press conference in the  Moscow airport "Sheremetievo-2" after his arrival from Germany  today.    Churkin said the main outcome of a meeting between  representatives of the UN, EU [European Union], Russia, the US  and Canada in Bonn is the creation of "a political coalition for  the settlement of the conflict in Bosnia." He added that  meetings of this kind will be continued. "The experience  demonstrates that such a meeting can be convoked within 24  hours," he said.    The diplomat put a special emphasis on the fact that the  Bosnian crisis was attended on the highest level both in Russia  and other countries. "This creates pre-conditions for pushing  the peoples of Bosnia-Herzegovina to a peaceful settlement.  However, the last word rests with them," he said.    Speaking on the transfer of the Russian battalion within the  UN peacekeeping forces in the former Yugoslavia to Sarajevo, the  deputy minister said "their security cannot be guaranteed by  100% as they serve in the most dangerous area, on the line  separating Serb and Moslem armed formations."    "Security of Russian servicemen is our priority. We have  done our best to politically guarantee their security," Churkin  said.    In his opinion, there is no need for a stronger Russian  contingent in the region so far. "However, we need to prepare  an additional contingent. As soon as a ceasefire is established  in Bosnia, Russia will need to reinforce its peacekeepers," he  was quoted as saying.    Churkin said he was satisfied with the contacts with the  Serb  political leadership and military command. "Russia lays no  claims to the Serb side which solved issues of deblockading  Sarajevo very flexibly," the diplomat stated.    Churkin said Russia's relations with the NATO "may change  only for the better." "The present crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina  has been a lesson for all of us. It must be evident for the  Western partners that Russia's positions in Europe are highly  influential," he said.    In his speech, Churkin warned against euphoria. "The  situation in Bosnia remains tense. There are many dangers.  However, it is important not to slow down the pace and achieve  a peaceful settlement. If no settlement follows, the present  psychologically favorable moment may be missed," he said.    Asked whether Yeltsin's initiative to convoke a summit of  five world's leading nations interested in settlement in Bosnia  could come off, Churkin pointed out that "it is too early to  speak of this seriously." "There are many variants of meetings  with the participation of Russia and other states involved in  the peaceful settlement, including those on the highest level,"  he said. However, no specific proposals have been made so far,  Churkin added.</p>

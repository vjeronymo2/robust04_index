			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAN ON FALSE ENDORSEMENTS PUSHED;  </P> <P> LEGISLATION: A LAWMAKER FORGED FORMER PRESIDENT REAGAN'S SIGNATURE ON CAMPAIGN  MATERIALS, BUT CHARGES WERE DISMISSED. NOW REAGAN BACKS A BILL TO CLOSE THE  LEGAL LOOPHOLE.  </P> <P> Former President Ronald Reagan endorsed legislation introduced Wednesday aimed  at closing a legal loophole that allegedly enabled an Orange County legislator  to forge Reagan's signature on campaign materials without facing criminal  penalties.  </P> <P> The legislation was introduced in reaction to a recent court decision  dismissing felony forgery charges against Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange)  for using the unauthorized Reagan signature on 480,000 campaign letters in  1986.  </P> <P> The 3rd District Court of Appeal held last week that Lewis' use of the phony  Reagan signature did not defraud the voters of money or property -- ingredients  needed to warrant a criminal charge. The court also noted that the state's  election code held no criminal sanctions for the forged signature.  </P> <P> Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, who helped draft the new bill, said Wednesday  that he will appeal the ruling to the state Supreme Court.  </P> <P> The appeals court decision stunned many legislators, who said they were afraid  that it will encourage unscrupulous campaigners to forge signatures of  well-known politicians and celebrities without fear of sanction.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Sen. William A. Craven (R-Oceanside) called a press conference to  announce the introduction of a bill to make forging someone's name on campaign  material a crime that could result in three years in prison and a $50,000 fine.  </P> <P> The bill would also allow the candidate who is victimized by falsified mailers,  as well as the person whose unauthorized signature was used, to sue to recover  actual and punitive damages in civil court.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg said: "President Reagan supports  Sen. Craven's bipartisan bill because it seeks to protect the good name,  personal signature and political speech of every citizen. The right to publicly  endorse or oppose candidates or initiatives is as precious as the right to vote  on them.  </P> <P> "This right must be safeguarded. President Reagan believes this measure will  help restore much needed integrity and public confidence in California's  political process," Weinberg added.  </P> <P> Lewis was directing campaign strategy for Assembly Republicans when he  allegedly had Reagan's signature affixed to about 480,000 letters attacking  Democrats in six Assembly districts during the waning days of the 1986  legislative races.  </P> <P> Lewis sent the letters after the White House had rejected the use of Reagan's  name on the material, according to grand jury testimony. The ruse was  discovered when a number of undeliverable letters began trickling back to the  White House, which was listed as the return address on the campaign material.  </P> <P> After district attorneys in Los Angeles and Sacramento counties declined to  prosecute Lewis, Van de Kamp filed charges of felony forgery against the Orange  County legislator. The appeals court rejected the charges.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Lewis' Sacramento attorney accused Van de Kamp, a 1990 Democratic  gubernatorial candidate, of political motivation in vowing to take the case to  the state Supreme Court.  </P> <P> "An announcement on how to proceed in a legal case was made at a press  conference by a candidate for political office," Dale Drozd said. "I think it's  indicative that his (Van de Kamp's) decisions in this regard are being governed  by political considerations, and not by legal analysis, and I think that's  regrettable."  </P></p>

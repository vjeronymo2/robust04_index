			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article under the heading: "As GOLOS ARMENII </F> Sees It": "`Splendor' and Misery of Bagratyan's Cabinet"]    [Text] According to all calculations, it transpires that  the inhabitants of Armenia will shortly consist of Nakharars  [feudal lords] alone. And by no means because their number will  be increased and Nakhararism will emerge by subterranean  passageway, say. The number of top officials of the state will  not change. It is simply that no one, aside from them, wants to  live in this country. Because, as has become clear following the  recent parliamentary debate, they alone in Armenia have a good  life, and they will yield this fine life of theirs to no one for  anything. It is ordained for all the rest under these conditions  that they either let go of their own volition or clear off home.    In terms of the growth of somberness of the forecasts we  have, it should be noted, broken all world records. A year ago  it seemed that a million people could at the very least live on  this land. Now we ourselves are standing amazed at our naivete  of last year. And not only us. Everyone all around is talking  about this, and it is only a few Nakharar ministers who disagree  with this opinion. It is they who will continue to live here,  consequently. If they remain ministers, of course.    The absurdity of such an idea should not come as any  surprise. People capable of being surprised in this way are  hardly to be found because our society has lost this capacity  also. Being surprised means displaying emotions. We, however,  are for the most part unimputable. Except, of course, those who  with risible friskiness continue to cling to power.    In having ensured by hook or by crook that all ministers  without exception speak at the parliamentary lectern, Speaker  Ararktsyan did them a bad turn, I believe. The public at large,  to whom they are virtually unknown, suddenly gagged on such a  powerful stream of unprofessionalism, impudent complacency,  dismissive attitude toward the troubles of their compatriots,  and ability to unblushingly lie, blackmail, intimidate.... The  impetuosity of this step was obvious also from its results: The  Nakharars, summoned to the attack, by no means dispelled the  oppressive impression remaining following the speeches of  representatives of the opposition but intensified it even more.  Not acknowledging even a part of the gravity of what they have  wrought, the gentlemen of state have become professional  trouble-bearers not only in the eyes of their political  opponents but of all of society also.    Throughout the civilized world just one thing is required of  parliament--the timely adoption of laws and efficient  supervision of their fulfillment. Our members of parliament,  however, are being set by the government, in the person of its  ministers, the task of procuring gasoline, speeding up bank  transactions, effecting barter deals, and, generally, switching  over entirely to the spheres of activity for whose  malfunction-free realization ministers are supposed to exist.  And since the deputies are not doing this, they are not,  consequently, entitled to criticize those who are strenuously  creating the appearance of this "doing."    The habit of constantly erecting Potemkin villages is  becoming second nature even in the most critical situations.  Ministers just about mouthed from the parliamentary platform the  essentially primitive truth: While you, deputies, are here  making speeches and forcing us to listen to them, inflation at  the markets continues its victorious progression. Have done as  quickly as possible and let us go, get down to business, and  save the nation.    And this is being said to a hall that is constantly  protesting this influx of members of the government into  parliament and demanding an end to the stream of monotonous  maxims of the holders of high office. After all, ministers had  sufficient time to discharge their direct duties before the  sitting of parliament! But here it was ascertained that it was  these two tense parliamentary days that were the cause of all  the misfortunes that have come crashing down on our heads!    Bagratyan led out into the field of battle his entire host  in  the manifest hope of winning. He did so at the price of a  demonstration of the "splendor" and misery of the cabinet he  heads. Whether he won or not is another matter. The main thing  is that the population of the republic is the loser.</p>

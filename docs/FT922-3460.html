			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading BEAR closing and buying mainly by US houses pulled stock index futures out of the doldrums and helped underpin trading in the underlying cash market, writes Joel Kibazo. The June contract on the FT-SE opened firmly around the 2644 level and quickly moved forward, helped by bear closing and demand from US houses, reaching the day's peak of 2,656 by mid morning. After a period of sideways trading, June drifted lower over the lunch period in anticipation of an easier Wall Street. The poor opening on Wall Street led to increased selling of June causing a further retreat, though a squeeze towards the end saw the contract recover some ground. In contrast to the first two days of this week, the contract spent most of the session at a premium to fair value. Dealers once again pointed to the increased activity in September delivery in which over 2,000 lots were dealt. June closed at 2,649, up 11 on the previous session and around 7 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 7. Turnover reached 7,257 lots. Traded options remained dull with turnover reaching 27,914 contracts. FT-SE option volume at 7,876 was also poor. British Airways was the busiest stock option with 1,656 lots dealt. This was followed by Lasmo at 1,509 contracts.</p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Technology: A case for recycling - Worth Watching Triumph Adler, the office equipment company, is taking recycling to its limit. Its German factory is now producing typewriter casings made solely from recycled ribbon cassettes. The Cyclo, which will sell for just over Pounds 100, is a portable, electric daisywheel typewriter. Its casing is made from Triumph Adler cassettes returned to the manufacturer once their useful life is over. Triumph Adler: Germany 911 9320. UK: 0206 845251. Office managers with an environmental conscience may also be interested in a 'greener' approach to the miles of facsimile paper that churn off the fax machine. Arjo Wiggins Thermal Papers, of Lincoln, has developed a thermal paper, the base of which contains at least 50 per cent de-inked waste fibres. Arjo Wiggins: UK, 0522 681212.</p>

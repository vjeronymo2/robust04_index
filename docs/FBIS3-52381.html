Aqazadeh  pointed out that the Islamic Republic of Iran is ready for any  kind of cooperation with other OPEC members.    According to a report by our correspondent in Rasht, the  petroleum minister proposed that OPEC production be reduced by  four to five percent.    An IRNA report mentions that the petroleum minister said  OPEC  and non-OPEC members' overproduction is the main factor in the  decreasing trend of oil prices, but at the same time added that  behind-the-scenes political issues have also contributed to the  current oil price crisis.    Aqazadeh added that during the first six months of the  current year, average oil prices were above $16 and it was  expected that they go even higher during the winter. But that  failed to happen, which is not normal.</p>

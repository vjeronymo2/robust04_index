			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / World Commodities Prices: Tea TEA There was good general demand this week, reports the Tea Brokers' Association. Brightest Rwanda teas sold at lower levels, but good liquoring Kenyas met increased competition with prices 5 to 10p dearer. Better mediums remained fully firm, but plainer varieties tended easier throughout. Central Africans sold readily and were sometimes dearer, particularly the brighter descriptions. Ceylons attracted good support with brighter teas dearer, but the remainder barely steady. Offshore teas sold well and Kenya prices were often 3p to 5p higher. Quotations: Quality 230p nominal, medium 118p, low medium 77p.</p>

			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Swiss claim seaton Fund board THE Swiss government has formed a group large enough to claim a seat on the governing board of the International Monetary Fund, and it has asked the IMF to create a 24th seat to accommodate it, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. The Swiss finance ministry said it had so far attracted Azerbaijan, Kirgistan, Poland, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to its group, giving it 2.776 per cent of the votes on the board. This would be enough to displace the weakest group, composed mainly of francophone African countries.</p>

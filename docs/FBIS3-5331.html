Last week the United States revived its Super 301 law which  allows for unilateral trade sanctions against countries found to  have discriminated against US imports.    The long-standing view in the Australian Government is that  Australia does not take sides in the dispute but sees fault on  both sides, officials said.    It is understood that Evans will raise the trade dispute  with  Christopher in their talks which are scheduled to start Tuesday,  a trade ministry official said.    US President Bill Clinton signed an executive order  reinstating the Super 301 provision following breakdown of the  US-Japan economic-framework talks.    Trade Minister Bob McMullan stressed that Australia does not  support punitive trade sanctions like Super 301.    "We understand why the United States, like Australia and the  rest of the world, supports opening up of the Japanese market --  but we don't support anyone doing it in a unilateral or  discriminatory way," he said last week.    He added that he did not see reintroduction of Super 301 as  "the outbreak of a trade war," but as racheting up the pressure  on Japan.    McMullan said the trade question would not be a "priority  issue" in the Evans-Christopher talks which close Wednesday and  which are to focus on defence and security concerns.    "But it would be very surprising if such a senior US  representative came to Australia and we did not mention some  trade issues," he said.    In an editorial Monday, the conservative Sydney Morning  Herald labelled the invoking of Super 301 as "unnecessary and  reckless" and warned that if there was a trade war "countries  like Australia will be the first casualties."    Urging Evans to "tell it like it is", in his meetings with  Christopher, the daily said the US official should be "reminded  that Australia's ability to honour its alliance (with  Washington) is tied to the health of its trade-based economy.</p>

			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BEST FILMS OF 1990 -- FOUR VIEWS  </P> <P> Here are the Top 10 films of 1990 as selected by Sheila Benson, Peter Rainer,  Kevin Thomas and Michael Wilmington.  </P> <P> 1 -- "GoodFellas." In Martin Scorsese's portrait of mid-level Mafia life,  grisly events are often as not set off by a darkly hilarious humor, while the  screenplay gives these wiseguys' street talk a cheerfully obscene poetry.  Played with terrifying authority, it is a savvy backstage tour of a particular  hell.  </P> <P> 2 -- "Dances With Wolves." First-time director Kevin Costner has shaped a  passionate, clear-eyed vision of life in the late 1860s at the edge of the  Northwestern frontier. Costner has an infectious empathy for this rolling,  treeless land and for the Sioux.  </P> <P> 3 -- "The Godfather Part III." This last chapter of Francis Coppola's  monumental gangster trilogy is uneven in ways its predecessors never were, but  the flaws are not mortal. Flamboyantly operatic, utterly engrossing, the film  touches every important theme of the first two and strikes its deepest note  with Al Pacino's performance as the tormented Michael Corleone.  </P> <P> 4 -- "Sweetie." This portrait of a tightly knit Australian family marks the  debut of the assured writer-director Jane Campion; Campion has an original  visual style, her work with actors is extraordinary, and she has a streak of  pure romanticism that keeps the film's Grand Guignol undertones in balance.  </P> <P> 5 -- "Life and Nothing But." Bertrand Tavernier and his great, worldly  alter-ego Philippe Noiret bring off an almost impossible combination: a  full-bodied affirmation of life and passion amid reminders of death and  sacrifice in post-World War I France.  </P> <P> 6 -- "To Sleep With Anger." Charles Burnett fills his  slice-of-middle-class-life with mystery and a sense of malevolence as the visit  of a sweet-talking friend from the old South frays the fabric of a warm, close  family. The film proves William Faulkner's thesis that a writer who works from  his own home ground finds sustenance enough to last a lifetime. 7 -- "Reversal  of Fortune." Director Barbet Schroeder's choice to stage the story of the Von  Bulows as a tragicomedy of manners made it just that. Jeremy Irons' bitingly  witty performance as Von Bulow is rich, paradoxical and leaves behind doubts --  part of the film's deliberate mischief.  </P> <P> 8 -- "Vincent &amp; Theo." Robert Altman's approach to the Great Biographical  Film is astringent and realistic; the last years of the brothers Van Gogh  mirror the tenacity it takes to follow an artist's path -- something with which  Altman himself is not unfamiliar.  </P> <P> 9 -- "Men Don't Leave." Paul Brickman's film about a family adjusting to the  shocking death of their husband/father has a captivating unpredictability and  the highest concentration of offbeat characters since "The Accidental Tourist."  </P> <P> 10 -- "The Natural History of Parking Lots." Everett Lewis' arresting debut  film concerns two poignant kids of privilege, Hancock Park throw-aways  considered even more disposable than their parents' marriages. Touchingly  performed, beautifully shot, this modest feature is the announcement of a  singular new voice among American independents.  </P></p>

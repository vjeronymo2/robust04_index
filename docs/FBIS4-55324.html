			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jovan Dulovic: "The Career of the Federal </F> Minister for Information"]    [Text] Year and place of birth: 1947, the  village Gligovac near Smederevska Palanka, Socialist Republic of  Serbia.    What he is known for: As minister for information  in the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] Government he  announced expulsion of journalists back on 13 June of last year  ("Is it not illogical for so many falsehoods about the FRY to go  out into the world, when credentials have not been taken away  from a single journalist") and he recently decided to prohibit  some 14 foreign journalists from working because of  "satanization of the FRY and the Serbian people," which divided  the domestic public and embittered the world public.    What they reproach him for in the SPS [Socialist Party  of Serbia]: He is a member of the most hard-line current  among the incumbent members of the government and an unwavering  advocate of the motto: Whoever is not with us must go. Ratomir  Vico, newly appointed information minister in the Serbian  Government, recently explained to him on a television program  (there is a question of how serious he was) that Radio-TV Serbia  must also broadcast the relevant views of opposition parties and  groupings. Ignjatovic thanked him for having supplemented and  spelled out his previously expressed thought that government  television must exclusively represent the interests of the state.    What the opposition has against him: As director  of Radio-TV Serbia he did not allow coverage of the Saint Vitus'  Day Rally. He explained his decision this way: "There is no  reason for TV Belgrade to cover the rally when this is already  being done by Independent TV Studio B and TV Politika" (BORBA, 3  July 1992). Some 17 deputies of DEPOS [Democratic Movement of  Serbia], New Democracy, the Democratic Party, the People's Party  of Montenegro, and the Social Democratic Party of Montenegro in  the Citizens Chamber of the Assembly demanded that Ignjatovic be  dismissed because of the expulsion of the foreign journalists,  because that decision "placed the FRY and its citizens in still  greater isolation from the world."    How he got into politics: When KOMUNIST was shut  down, where he restated in his own words the speeches of party  bigwigs and said that there was no salvation for us without  self-management of the working class, he went over to POLITIKA  EKSPRES as an expert on the economy, but because he was not good  at writing commentary, he thought about opening a grocery store.  In the end, he gave that up and was elected a member of the  Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia,  which soon fell apart. Consistent with the policy of his party,  he joined the management team of POLITIKA EKSPRES: editor in  chief Slobodan Jovanovic, former executive secretary of the city  committee of the League of Communists, and Dragoljub Milanovic,  also a former executive secretary of the League of Communists of  Serbia.    How he won political points: His rating on the  list of personnel jumped up sharply when with his perspicacity  and comprehensive analysis he discovered and published that  "fascistoid Ante Markovic is driving the people into beggary"  and "intends to destroy Serbia and Yugoslavia." He announced to  the public that "it was during the term of A. Markovic that  inflation reached the highest level in the history of this  country" (POLITIKA EKSPRES, 11 November 1990).    What he has against certain periodicals: In an  article entitled "The Independent Are Sullying the People"  (VECERNJE NOVOSTI, 6 December 1993), in speaking about some of  the media, Ignjatovic said that they "usually say that the  present government is fascist."    What he promised: Announcing the "offensive and  preventive strategy of the ministry which he heads" (POLITIKA, 7  May 1993), Ignjatovic made the public announcement: "We have  formed an intersector group which will take the offensive in  supplying information in the FRY. We are studying the moves of  all our media `friends' and we will be ready and waiting with  everything cooked up in advance so that we can take appropriate  steps in good time" (VECERNJE NOVOSTI, 13 June 1993). The  results of that group are not evident, at least for the present.    What his qualifications are: He graduated from the  School of Philosophy at Belgrade University and took a master's  degree in the School of Economics.    What he should be afraid of: Those who put him in  the post of minister.    What inspires him: The investigative journalism of  his young colleagues, of which he was an example at EKSPRES. In  this style: "A full barrel of Serbian eyes from which the  ustashi were making burek was discovered in Mirkovci," "Ante  Markovic stole 28 kg of prosciutta from Uzice," "Even a little  fellow is stronger than the embargo," "The wolf is lunching with  Franjo," "Some 60 passengers were removed from the train and  slaughtered in cornfields. The bodies still have not been  found...."</p>

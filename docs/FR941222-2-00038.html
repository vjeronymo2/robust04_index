The purpose of proposing and promulgating the list is to set forth the list of experienced coke oven inspectors who will serve as panel members during the certification of coke oven observers. This action also informed the public that these people have demonstrated to the Agency that they satisfy the minimum experience requirements, established in Method 303 of Appendix A of Part 63, and gave the public the opportunity to examine the panel members' qualifications and to comment. Additional panel members may be added in the future in accordance with implementation needs. Any additions of certified and qualified inspectors to the panel will be made without promulgation, which was necessary only to establish this initial panel.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed list was published at 59 FR 11960 in the proposed rules section of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  December 22, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  For further information or documentation concerning the proposed rule, contact Mr. Roy Huntley, or Mr. Peter Westlin, Emission Measurement Branch (MD&hyph;19), Technical Support Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, (919) 541&hyph;1060.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  On October 27, 1993, the EPA promulgated the coke oven National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, which limits the number of visible leaks from coke oven doors, topside ports, and offtake systems, and the amount of time of visible emissions from the charging operation. Also promulgated at that time was Method 303 (40 CFR, part 63, appendix A), which sets forth the procedures an observer shall follow to determine compliance with the coke oven standards. In order to implement the coke oven rule, coke oven inspectors must be certified by an EPA recognized panel in accordance with the procedures set forth in section 2 of Method 303. The Method 303 certification training for each trainee concludes with a determination by a three-member panel as to the trainee's ability to conduct Method 303 satisfactorily. The Agency developed a certification course for coke oven inspectors and, as part of this effort, the Agency selected a group of experienced individuals to act as panel members. With today's action, the Agency finalizes an initial list of experienced coke oven inspectors who will serve as panel members during the certification of coke oven observers. Additional panel members may be added in the future in accordance with implementation needs. Any additions of certified and qualified inspectors to the panel will be made without promulgation, which was only necessary to establish this initial panel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Significant Comments and Associated Changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One verbal comment was received from EPA Region V. The commenter stated that one of the panel members, Mr. Basim Dihu of EPA, had the experience to be a panel member for all of the emission points covered in the coke oven NESHAP, i.e., doors, lids, offtakes, and charging. The proposal indicated that Mr. Dihu was qualified to be a panel member only for door observations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter is correct. Mr. Dihu's qualifications meet the Agency's criteria. The restrictions in the proposed list have been removed in the final list, and Mr. Dihu is now considered by the Agency to be a qualified panel member and able to act as such in the Method 303 certification course.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Administrative Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> A. Executive Order 12291  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major'' and therefore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action does not require any revision to existing State implementation plans (SIP's) or changes to any SIP regulation. This action is not a major rule because it will neither have an effect on the economy of $100 million or more, nor will it result in an increase in costs or prices to industry. There will be no adverse impact on the ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets. Because this action is not a major regulation, no RIA is being conducted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> B. Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Executive Order 12866, [58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)] the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) materially alter the budget impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OMB had exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> C. Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the information collection requirements for the Coke Oven Battery National Emission Standards under the provisions of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . and has assigned OMB control number 2060&hyph;0253.

Regulatory Flexibility Act Compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, because the publication of this list does not significantly change the status quo for such entities. This regulation therefore does not require an RFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 63  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental protection, Air pollution control, Coke oven emissions, Hazardous substances, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: December 8, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Carol M.

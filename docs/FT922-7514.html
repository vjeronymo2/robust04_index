			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Growth too sluggish to cut unemployment, says OECD ECONOMIC growth will be too sluggish to make inroads into the industrialised world's 30m jobless total this year, according to the latest projections from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The OECD, which released the figures today to coincide with its annual ministerial meeting in Paris, now expects real growth of 1.8 per cent this year in its 24 member countries compared with a projected 2.2 per cent last December. Unemployment is expected to jump to 7.5 per cent of the labour force this year, or roughly 30m people, from 7.1 per cent last year. It will only start a slow decline to 7.2 per cent of the labour force by the second half of next year as growth recovers to around 3 per cent. The Paris-based think tank's assessment of growth prospects in 1992 reflects a sharp downwards revision of forecast growth in Japan and western Germany in the first half of this year. In western Germany's case, the OECD forecasts growth in the first and second halves of 1992 at annual rates of 2.2 per cent and 2.1 per cent respectively compared with its December projections of 3.3 per cent and 2.6 per cent respectively. The organisation expects Japan will grow at an annual rate of only 1.5 per cent in the first six months of 1992 compared with its December 1991 forecast of 2.7 per cent. Japan's sluggish domestic growth is reflected in a sharp rise in its current account surplus. The OECD now expects this will be between Dollars 92bn (Pounds 51.3bn) and Dollars 93bn in both 1992 and 1993 against last December's forecasts of just over Dollars 80bn in each of the two years. Although Japanese imports have sparked resentment among some US citizens, the OECD has revised down its forecasts of the US current account deficit to Dollars 41.1bn in 1992 from Dollars 55.8bn previously and Dollars 49bn in 1993 from Dollars 60.6bn in its December forecast. The revisions are in line with a greatly improved US export performance recently.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      OECD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK                     Summary of Projections*             (Seasonally adjusted at annual rates)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                1990   1991   1992   1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Real GDP (% change**)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US                              1.0   -0.7    2.1    3.6 Japan                           5.2    4.5    1.8    3.1 Germany                         4.5    3.1    1.3    2.3 OECD Europe                     2.8    1.1    1.4    2.4 Total OECD                      2.5    1.0    1.8    3.0 World Trade (% change**)        5.3    3.9    5.6    6.6  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              Inflation (GDP deflator)(% change**)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US                              4.1    3.6    2.8    2.8 Japan                           2.1    1.9    1.7    1.6 Germany                         3.4    4.6    4.5    3.8 OECD Europe                     5.8    5.9    5.1    4.4 Total OECD                      4.4    4.1    3.5    3.2  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  Current Balances (Dollars bn)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US                            -92.1   -8.6  -41.1  -49.0 Japan                          35.8   72.6   92.4   92.8 Germany                        47.1  -19.8  -15.5  -12.7 OECD Europe                   -16.7  -45.6  -41.8  -40.0 Total OECD                   -107.6  -15.8  -26.9  -33.7 OPEC                           17.5  -45.9  -33.9  -31.6 Non-OPEC dev countries        -19.1  -26.5  -26.7  -28.3  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               Unemployment (% of labour force)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US                              5.5    6.7    7.1    6.5 Japan                           2.1    2.1    2.2    2.3 Germany                         4.9    4.3    4.7    4.8 OECD Europe                     8.0    8.7    9.3    9.3 Total OECD                      6.2    7.1    7.5    7.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Assumptions include: no change in policies; no change in exchange rates from May 5 1992 ie Dollars = Y132.75 and DM1.64; oil price Dollars 17 per barrel for first half 1992 and constant in real terms thereafter.

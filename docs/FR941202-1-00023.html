			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Overview of Amendments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Definition of Publicly Held Corporation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1.162&hyph;27(c)(1)(ii) of the proposed regulations defines a publicly held corporation to include an affiliated group of corporations, as defined in section 1504 of the Code (determined without regard to section 1504(b)). Because a subsidiary that is itself publicly held is subject to reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), &sect;1.162&hyph;27(c)(1)(ii) is amended to make clear that any publicly held subsidiary is excluded from the affiliated group of its parent. Such a publicly held subsidiary, and its subsidiaries (if any), are separately subject to section 162(m) and may comprise one or more separate affiliated groups of corporations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Thus, for example, if 85 percent of the stock of a subsidiary (S1) is owned by a parent (P) that is publicly held, and 15 percent is publicly traded, S1 is not considered a member of P's affiliated group for purposes of section 162(m). In this case, S1 is treated as a separate publicly held corporation. If, in turn, S1 owns, for example, 100 percent of the stock of another corporation, S2, then S2 is considered a member of S1's affiliated group, and not a member of P's affiliated group. Conversely, P (and, for example, a 100 percent subsidiary of P) are not considered members of S1's affiliated group. Thus, if P and S1 both pay compensation to the same covered employee, the compensation paid to the employee by each is not aggregated with the compensation paid to the employee by the other.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Definition of Compensation Committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1.162&hyph;27(c)(4) provides that a compensation committee must have the authority to establish and administer a ``performance-based compensation arrangement described in paragraph (e)(2).'' In order to clarify that, for example, the entire board of directors may establish a plan, this section is amended to state more narrowly that a compensation committee must have the authority to establish and administer ``performance goals described in paragraph (e)(2).''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Preestablished Performance Goal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1.162&hyph;27(e)(2)(i) and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  under &sect;1.162&hyph;27(e)(2)(vii) are amended to conform to the definition of ``preestablished'' provided in Notice 94&hyph;68. As amended, &sect;1.162&hyph;27(e)(2)(i) now provides that a performance goal is considered preestablished if it is established in writing by the compensation committee not later than 90 days after the commencement of the period of service to which the performance goal relates, provided that the outcome is substantially uncertain. However, in no event will a performance goal be considered preestablished if it is established after 25 percent of the period of service (as scheduled in good faith at the time the goal is established) has elapsed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The ``Substantially Uncertain'' Requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commentators have requested additional guidance as to when a performance goal is ``substantially uncertain.'' While this determination remains essentially factual in nature, two examples have been added to the proposed regulations under &sect;1.162&hyph;27(e)(2)(vii). Under new  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Example 2, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  it is concluded that a performance goal based on a percentage of total sales is not substantially uncertain because some sales are a virtual certainty. New  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Example 3, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  however, illustrates that a performance goal based on corporate profitability is substantially uncertain, even for companies with a history of profitability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

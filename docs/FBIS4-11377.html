			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Flavio Figueiredo in Brasilia] </F>   [Text] The Brazilian and Czech Governments today signed  economic cooperation agreements to expand bilateral relations  and promote trade between the two countries.    Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said that in 1993  Brazilian  exports to the Czech Republic totaled $7 million while its  imports totaled $5 million. Klaus said these amounts were small  following the separation of the Czech and Slovak Republics and  the economic reform the Czech Republic has been undergoing.    Under the agreements, the governments of Brazil and the  Czech  Republic commit themselves to increase trade and to diversify  their export and import items. They also agreed to undertake a  joint cooperation effort in the areas of machinery production  and professional training.    During his visit to Brazil, Klaus is also conveying to  Brazilian officials the experience earned by the Czech Republic  in the area of privatization. The Czech Republic has had the  most expeditious privatization process in history. As late as  1989 nothing had been privatized in the Czech Republic, but  today the private sector already accounts for two-thirds of the  country's GDP.</p>

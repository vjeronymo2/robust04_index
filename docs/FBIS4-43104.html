			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Remzi Kartal, deputy leader of DEP [Democracy  Party], and Murat Bozlak, leader of HADEP [People's Democracy  Party], held the government responsible for the killing of  Muhsin Melik, a leading member of HADEP, and his driver Mehmet  Ayyildiz, and asked for the dismissal of the governor and police  chief of Urfa to enable a serious investigation. [passage  omitted]    Kartal said that Melik refused to enter the police car that  had come to the scene of the incident to take him to hospital,  saying: "You shot me, I will not get in your car."  <H5>  Order To Pull the Trigger Comes From Ciller and Karayalcin </H5>   Kartal said that "no matter who pulls the trigger, the order  to pull the trigger comes from Ciller and [Deputy Prime  Minister] Karayalcin," and added: "With their policies Ciller  and Karayalcin turned the country into a bloodbath. They will  exhaust themselves and the country with these policies. They  should either find the murderers or resign."    Indicating that all the government officials, above all the  governor of the state of emergency region, are involved in these  incidents, Kartal asked for the dismissal of the governor and  police chief of Urfa.  <H5>  Bozluk: The Shots Were Fired at Peace </H5>   In a news conference at party headquarters, HADEP leader  Murat Bozluk described Muhsin Melik "as a person who devoted his  life to the people and who was a symbol of goodness and beauty."  He added: "The shots fired at Muhsin have in fact been fired at  peace and democracy."    Indicating that the murder was committed by the enemies of  democracy who found themselves helpless in the face of the  honorable struggle waged by Melik, Bozluk pointed out that  before he died in the presence of the policemen, Melik said to  those who gathered around him: "Those who shot me were  policemen who have been tailing me for the last two days."    Bozlak said: "The murderers' faces and the model and plate  number of the car used in the incident are all known. Most  importantly, our colleague's words exist. The governor and  police chief of Urfa should be dismissed and a serious inquiry  opened."</p>

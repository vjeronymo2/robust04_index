			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Bangkok's final quarter leaves observers cautious - The burgeoning Thai market The explosion in the Bangkok stock market's fourth quarter continued over the Christmas and new year holidays, with the Stock Exchange of Thailand index surging through record highs for seven consecutive sessions to 1,753.73, up 70.88 or 4.21 per cent yesterday. This has been a far cry from the mid-summer doldrums, when the index hovered weakly above the 800 level. Its final flourish incorporated the inevitable year-end window dressing, but most brokers seem to think that the weight of money available to the market is sufficient to carry equities past any minor short-term corrections. However, some market watchers are becoming uncomfortable. Thai stocks have rocketed by more than 80 per cent since the beginning of October, following the sudden interest which North American fund managers took in the region. New issues, notably in telecommunications, are improving the market's tone, but it remains relatively immature with a limited ability to absorb large amounts of cash. Investors have put behind them last spring's corporate earnings disappointments, the new Securities and Exchange Commission's various attacks on share price rampers early last year, and mild unease at the traditional shenanigans in parliament. It is true that, for investors jaded with economic performance or the lack of it in western countries, Thai growth in 1993 and 1994 approaching eight per cent is reassuring. However, if you anticipate earnings of 12-16 per cent for the rest of the decade than, by some estimates, Thai shares deserve to trade on a price-earnings ratio of 16-22 times. The market has been one or two points beyond this on 1993 earnings and stands at around 20 times 1994 earnings. Technical indicators are signalling caution: previous runs like that of late 1993 have presaged a sharp downturn. Foreign investors will almost certainly decide if and when the legs are to be pulled from under this market, having pushed a net Bt15.8 billion into the market in July/September, 1993 and, probably, at least Bt40bn (Dollars 1.57bn) in the final quarter. However, a burgeoning mutual fund industry is beginning to bring a stabilising influence into the market. Thailand's cash-rich middle classes receive scant returns for their savings from the local banking cartel, but they have become increasingly risk averse; the mutual fund industry took off in 1993 with at least Dollars 2 billion being raised from local savers. Mutual funds account for little more than three per cent of the market's capitalisation, but they will grow in importance. As one examlple of the domestic funds poised in the wings, professionals consider the implications of the impending liberalisation that will allow the setting up of private funds. Total deposit bases in the local banks and finance houses amount to an estimated Bt2,500bn. If just one per cent of that finds its way into the stock market, that is Bt25bn of new money, roughly the same figure that produced the striking outperformance in the final quarter of 1993. Thai companies have been quick capitalise upon the stock market's strength, with a flurry of Euroconvertible issues. The dearth of straight rights issues means that - remarkably, considering the bull run - less money will have been raised from the market than in 1992. This, of course, has also encouraged higher share prices in the short run. Bangkok's banking, financial and property sectors are, arguably, fully priced by most analytical measures. Aside from the odd respected blue-chip, like the property developer, Land and Houses, and certain special situations, this leaves the industrial sector for current investment consideration. Earnings here have been poor but are expected to improve: the problem is that so far there are only a relatively small number of companies in this area with a free-float of a decent size. Mr Robert Zielinski, head of research at Jardine Fleming Thanakom Securities, reckons that the stock market is on the verge of refocusing its attention away from financial stocks to companies serving the real economy. 'Liquidity-driven markets usually give way to earnings driven markets as the combination of low interest rates and the wealth effect of rising share prices lead to a pick up in demand,' he says. 'The risk premium for investing in Thai shares is higher than for more mature markets,' concludes Mr Zielinski, 'but growth prospects are good and, in time, funds will flow to the companies working in the real economy.'</p>

The latest round of negotiations brought to an end two years  of talks on the agreement governing return of illegal  immigrants. If parliament now approves the document, Interior  Minister Jan Ruml will sign it with his German counterpart,  Fendrych said. Both sides hope the agreement can be signed by  June this year.    The agreement provides for the establishment of an expert  committee to oversee the proper implementation of the agreement,  propose recommendations for the resolving of problems and  suggest any necessary changes or additions to the original  document.    The delegates agreed on a period of twelve months in which  an  immigrant can be returned to the country from which he (she)  illegally crossed the Czech-German border into the destination  country. It was also agreed that the German authorities have  six months to find a refugee. "Informal" readmission can be  undertaken within three days of the illegal immigrant crossing  the border.</p>

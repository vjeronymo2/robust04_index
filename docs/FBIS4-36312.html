			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Zuhayr Qusaybati: "Talabani Meets With Barzani To </F> Confirm Reconciliation and the Islamists Accuse Him of  Negotiating With Baghdad"]    [Excerpts] London -- The Islamic Movement has renewed its  campaign against the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] led by  Jalal Talabani, and it has accused the latter of sending a  delegation to Baghdad to resume negotiations with the Iraqi  Government. Talabani was due to meet yesterday with Kurdistan  Democratic Party [KDP] Leader Mas'ud Barzani, his partner in the  Kurdistan Front [KF] leadership, at the Shirin Palace Hotel in  Shaqlawah for the first time since the fighting broke out  between their two parties about a month ago. The fighting is  believed to have left hundreds of casualties in northern Iraq.  The purpose of the meeting is to confirm the reconciliation  between the two parties. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, PUK sources have denied that Talabani sent an  envoy to Baghdad to negotiate with the Iraqi Government. The  Islamic Movement in Kurdistan had claimed that the Kurdish  leader had sent Shaykh 'Abd-al-Latif al-Barzanji to Baghdad on  22 May and that the efforts of the latter, which coincided with  the Kurdish infighting, made no progress.    The sources said "al-Barzanji is an Irbil merchant who has  no links with the PUK." [passage omitted]</p>

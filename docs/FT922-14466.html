			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Survey of The Computer Industry (7): Battle of the giants - Midrange systems market is transformed THE 'mid-range' of the computer market is a moving target. Traditionally defined in terms of mainframe and minicomputer performance, it has recently been transformed by the emergence of networked 'client-server' combinations that represent a powerful new alternative. This is the ground that companies such as Digital Equipment and Hewlett-Packard are fighting over. It is also the prime target of workstation market leader, Sun Microsystems. International Business Machines addresses the mid-range with its widely used AS/400 systems today, but its RS/6000 workstation technology is clearly also a contender. Few doubt that before long the 'mid-range' will be claimed by systems based upon Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) microprocessors. This is spawning an industry-wide battle among different RISC architectures, with the designers of each RISC chip seeking the endorsement of several computer makers in a drive to encourage proliferation of applications software development. Sun Microsystems, with its SPARC chip, established the pattern by encouraging other computer makers to build computers ranging from portable personal computers to supercomputers based upon SPARC microprocessor chips. Sun's strategy has been to emulate the success of standards in the personal computer market, where hundreds of 'clone' makers use Intel chips to build IBM-compatible personal computers and software developers have flocked to produce thousands of applications programs. To date, however, few SPARC machines, other than those produced by Sun Microsystems itself, have had a significant impact in the marketplace. As a result, there is growing disaffection among SPARC chipmakers who find themselves largely dependent upon Sun for sales of the devices. Mips Computer attempted to form an alliance of hardware and software companies to establish a new standard architecture. The so-called 'Ace initiative' appears, however, to be losing momentum since the acquisition of Mips Computer, last month, by Silicon Graphics, a workstation manufacturer. Hewlett-Packard has taken a different tack by selectively licensing its PA-RISC technology to a small group of companies that it believes are willing to make a long-term commitment to the architecture, while establishing an organisation to promote a broader base of support for PA-RISC among software developers and other third parties by establishing interface standards. Development of PA-RISC standards will allow customers to purchase widely available, or 'shrink-wrapped,' software and operate it on many PA-RISC systems, HP promises. As a result, the company claims, software developers will be able to deliver their products to a larger PA-RISC market, and manufacturers will benefit from an increasingly broad base of software solutions that support PA-RISC technology. HP lost out to IBM in its bid to make Groupe Bull of France a key partner in its PA-RISC efforts. However, Convex a leading US manufacturer of supercomputers, recently announced plans to use PA-RISC in its future massively parallel processing (MPP) systems. Other HP partners include Hitachi, Hughes Aircraft, Mitsubishi Electric, Oki Electric, Prime Computer, Sequoia Systems and Yokagawa Electric. International Business Machines has partnered with Apple Computer and Groupe Bull to expand the use of its 'Power' RISC architecture which is currently used in IBM's RS/6000 workstation products. Digital Equipment is also looking for potential users of its recently unveiled Alpha chip, claimed to have the highest performance of any RISC chip to date. Cray Research has chosen the Alpha chip as the basis for a new massively parallel supercomputer. This frenzy of industry activity reflects the growing significance of RISC technology for a broadening spectrum of computers. Used singly, the chips can power high performance desktop computers. In multiprocessor systems they represent a lower-cost alternative to traditional mid-range computers. RISC technology is also playing a key role in the adoption of a new 'client-server' model of distributed computing in which processing tasks are shared among a collection of networked computers. Client-server is a radical departure from traditional information hierarchical systems with a 'host' mainframe or minicomputer at the centre attached by spokes to 'dumb' terminals. The personal computer began to outmode hierarchical systems by placing significant processing power on the desktop. The RISC workstation, with its higher performance computing capabilities is driving home the advantage of client-server computing. While lower cost is a primary attraction of client-server computing, its real advantages lie in the ability to provide all computer users in a corporation with real-time access to all of a company's information technology resources. New applications can be added relatively simply. 'Today, 70 cents out of every dollar spent on corporate information systems goes toward maintaining the infrastructure,' says Bruce Golden, director of commercial market development at Sun Microsystems Computer. 'Only 30 cents is spent on developing new applications.' With client-server systems, that spending ratio will eventually be turned on its head, Mr Golden predicts. Personal computers and workstations compete for the desktop in the new client-server arena. In routine applications, the lower cost personal computer wins out. Workstations hold the advantage, however, for complex applications such as customer service where multiple data bases may need to be interrogated and several applications run simultaneously in order to provide a virtually instantaneous response to a customer's question. Client-server computing may ultimately deliver upon the promise of computers to increase white collar productivity, enabling banks to process loan applications in seconds, rather than hours, retailers to audit inventories in hours rather than days and advertisers to produce graphics in minutes rather than hours.</p>

			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Clowes receives 10-year sentence MR Petre Clowes, who stole millions of pounds from investors in one of Britain's biggest frauds, was yesterday sent to prison for 10 years. Mr Clowes, of Wilmslow, Cheshire, founder of the Barlow Clowes investment group, was found guilty on Monday of eight charges of fraud, and 10 charges of theft totalling more than Pounds 14m. He was acquitted of one charge of conspiracy. Passing sentence at the end of the 112-day trial, Mr Justice Phillips said: 'I do not believe any judge in this country has been called upon to sentence a worse case of fraud than yours.' Mr Peter Naylor of Send, Surrey, deputy chairman of Barlow Clowes, described by the prosecution as Mr Clowes's 'lieutenant', was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. He was convicted of one charge of theft of Pounds 19,000, but cleared of four other charges. Mr Clowes's sentence is the highest passed as the result of a Serious Fraud Office prosecution. He was also disqualified from being a company director for 15 years, but the prosecution made no application for costs or for compensation from either defendant. The government has paid out more than Pounds 150m in compensation to investors who lost money after the collapse of Barlow Clowes in 1988. The court heard how Mr Clowes 'milked' millions of pounds from investors, many of them elderly people who thought their money was going into government gilt-edged stock. Instead it was spent on buying other companies, and on luxuries including a French chateau and vineyard, an executive jet and a yacht. 'It was your intention to help yourself to the money and to engage in schemes to make you rich,' Mr Justice Phillips said. 'What you were doing in effect was gambling the money dishonestly for your own benefit. The scale on which you did this was breathtaking. 'Anyone who deliberately carries out the kind of massive fraud you have perpetrated must face the fact that if he is caught he will go to prison for a very long time.' Mr Peter Rook QC, a member of the Serious Fraud Office's five-strong prosecution team, said yesterday that a second Barlow Clowes trial would not take place. The prosecution had decided to offer no evidence against Mr David Mitchell, former chairman of Barlow Clowes's parent company, of Veyrier, Switzerland, and Mr Ian Crabtree, an accountant, of Bramhall, Cheshire.

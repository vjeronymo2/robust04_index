			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Westinghouse posts Dollars 1.29bn full-year loss WESTINGHOUSE Electric, the US conglomerate, reported a fourth-quarter net loss of Dollars 1.18bn and full-year loss of Dollars 1.29bn as it took a large and previously-announced charge to cover the disposal of its troubled financial services business. However, its fourth-quarter net income from continuing operations was also down, due primarily to a decline in earnings at its electronic systems operations and the dilution of earnings per share through a preferred stock issue. Mr Paul Lego, the chairman, warned the group's first-quarter results might be below those for the same period of 1992, due to lower-than-expected order rates. He said the aim was to have better results for the full 1993 year, with improvement coming in the second half. The fourth-quarter net loss was Dollars 3.44 a share against profits of Dollars 171m, or 51 cents, in the same period of last year. Sales and revenues were little changed at Dollars 2.35bn, against Dollars 2.36bn. Westinghouse took a special charge of Dollars 1.28bn for the disposal of its financial services business. Net income from continuing operations in the quarter was Dollars 91m, or 22 cents, against Dollars 137m, or 41 cents a year ago. For the full year, it reported net income from continuing operations of Dollars 348m, or 93 cents, against Dollars 265m, or 84 cents, in 1991. Its net loss was Dollars 1.29bn, or Dollars 3.81 a share, against a net loss of Dollars 1.09bn, or Dollars 3.46 a share in 1991.</p>

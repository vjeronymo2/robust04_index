			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Kay's Food reverses into Corridor in all-paper deal Kay's Food Group, the meat processing company which floated earlier this year, yesterday announced a reverse takeover of Corridor Food Group, the privately-owned catering retailer and distributor. Although the company refused to disclose how much the deal was worth, it said the all-paper acquisition represented a significant expansion. Corridor's catering operations are expected to complement Kay's existing customer base, which ranges from Fortnum &amp; Mason to British Rail. Corridor shareholders will receive new ordinary shares in Kay's at 5p each. Kay's, which raised Pounds 2.1m from its flotation, said further shares could be issued to provide working capital. Funds from the issue have been used primarily to develop a Pounds 2.3m factory near Milton Keynes, designed to boost processing capacity from 3,000 tonnes to 15,000 tonnes a year.</p>

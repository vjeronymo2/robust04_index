			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Sutang (1728 1372 1016) ] </F>   [Excerpts] Beijing, 10 May (XINHUA) -- Liu Jiachen, vice  president of the Supreme People's Court, made an announcement in  Beijing today: People's courts in various places have completed  the trial of four serious cases involving theft and damage to  railways, oilfields, electric power equipment, and  communications facilities. Six law offenders were sentenced to  death and were executed by shooting in Daqing, Liuzhou,  Zhumadian and Huanggang respectively today.    At a news briefing held by the Supreme People's Court, Liu  Jiachen said: Recently, serious crimes involving theft and  damage to railways, oilfields, and electric power and  communications facilities have been rampant. Those criminal  activities are very harmful to public security, social  stability, state property, and the smooth building of the  national economy. The carrying out of the death sentence of the  six criminals who committed heinous crimes is a demonstration of  the resolute and forceful struggle against such activities waged  by the people's courts as state adjudication organizations.  [passage omitted]    After the people's courts passed their initial judgments,  all  six criminals appealed. The higher people's courts in  Heilongjiang, Guangxi, Henan, and Hubei rejected the appeals and  affirmed the original judgments in their final decisions.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / 'Bottom-up' style in fashion for ex-Soviet reform THE DEMISE of Mr Yegor Gaidar as leader of Russia's economic reformers, to be replaced as Russian prime minister by the conservative Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, might suggest the Russian government's attempt to stabilise the inflation rate has come to an end. In fact, the evidence appears to suggest that monetary stabilisation never really began. Apart from a small blip in the spring of last year, Russia's money supply has been growing as fast as the rouble exchange rate has been collapsing. The main culprit is rouble credits paid by the central bank to otherwise bankrupt Russian enterprises, as the charts, drawn from the latest issue of Russian Economic Trends, show. With officials from the International Monetary Fund breathing down their necks, Mr Gaidar and his team did manage to suppress the growth of these credits in May and June and the monthly inflation rate fell to a low of 9 per cent in August. But the control of the reformers waned, as enterprises' losses accumulated and the power of the industrial lobby grew. Having risen by 36 per cent in May and June, enterprise credits rose by 33 per cent in July alone while monthly inflation accelerated to 33 per cent in November. What went wrong? The reformers and their western advisers have been quick to blame the inflationary habits of the central bank. But Russia's inflation was only a symptom, the most direct manifestation of the power struggle between Moscow's reformers and the more reactionary forces who still control the economy. The reformers' strategy was to try to loosen the grip of the industrialists by imposing bankruptcies and rising unemployment from the centre in the name of stabilisation. But the evidence shows how successful the bureaucrats and industrialists have been in keeping control. Industrial productivity fell by 24 per cent last year but Russian output fell by 22 per cent. So the same number of workers produced a fifth less output at the expense of accelerating inflation. Russia's failed attempt at stabilisation suggests that success is possible only if the grip of the industrial lobby is weakened. Mr Daniel Kaufman, the World Bank mission chief in Kiev, is advising the Ukrainian government, currently struggling with a monthly inflation rate of 50 per cent, to press ahead with small-scale privatisation, especially of retail stores, trucks and farmland, and remove legal barriers to new businesses. This would weaken the power of the bureaucracy and generate alternative employment. Reform efforts should be concentrated in those regions where the local government is more progressive in order to provide a lead for more conservative regions and bypass well-organised vested interests, he says. State enterprises should be commercialised as fast as possible but potentially profitable large enterprises should be kept afloat with limited, transparent and time-bound subsidies tied to restructuring. Only then can the government bring the budget deficit under control and make the shift to the market irreversible. Russia's reformers are also embracing this 'bottom-up' approach. The Nizhny-Novgorod experiment in auction-based small-scale privatisation is being tested in Tomsk, Volgograd and Moscow, while last week the government said that 14 of Russia's 49 regions were to be included in a campaign to sell about 500 large and medium-sized enterprises under the direction of the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private sector arm. All of this appears to amount to a shift in the conventional wisdom away from the academically fashionable 'stabilise first, liberalise and restructure later' approach. As Mr Viktor Pynzenyk, Ukraine's minister for the economy, explains: 'The lesson we have drawn from Russia's experience is that a pure monetary approach which looks very good on paper is nearly impossible to implement in an almost entirely monopolised economy.' Russian Economic Trends is compiled by the LSE's Centre for Economic Performance and produced quarterly in London by Whurr Publishers.

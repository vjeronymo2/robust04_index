			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Government attacked on Land Travel collapse THE government has come under fire for its failure to hold an inquiry last year into the Land Travel holiday company in spite of warnings from the company's auditors. The company collapsed just over a month ago. Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour consumer affairs spokesman, yesterday published a letter from Price Waterhouse, the company's accountants until August last year, giving details of the heavy qualifications to the accounts they filed in July 1991. The accounts, for the six months to March 1991, recorded that the company's liabilities exceeded its assets by Pounds 2.1m, and that Price Waterhouse was not satisfied that Pounds 1.6m of debts and deferred expenditure was recoverable. The letter said: 'Our audit opinion is unambiguous and expresses very clearly our concerns about the viability of the company.' Soon after Land Travel collapsed, Baroness Denton, a junior minister at the Department of Trade and Industry, confirmed that the DTI had some discretionary powers to investigate cases if there was substantive information giving good reason to do so. Mr Griffiths - who is pressing for government compensation for the 40,000 to 50,000 people who lost money in the collapse - argued that the highly critical comments filed with the Registrar of Companies amounted to substantive information. 'It appears as though the DTI was asleep,' he said. The DTI said that it would be logistically impossible to examine all the thousands of accounts filed at Companies House. There was no mechanism for highlighting those accounts that were particularly heavily qualified. The department added that it had been unable to trace any complaints made to it about Land Travel before its collapse, which could have acted as a trigger for the exercise of the investigative powers. The plight of would-be holidaymakers who lost money when the company failed was worsened by the fact that Land Travel was not bonded by the Association of British Travel Agents or the Bus and Coach Council.</p>

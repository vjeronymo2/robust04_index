			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Zoo opts for Pounds 9m rescue scheme A MEETING of the Zoological Society of London to discuss the future of London Zoo yesterday agreed on a Pounds 9m scheme to rescue the zoo, which is running at a loss of Pounds 2m a year. A postal ballot gave a vote of confidence to the council by 659 to 191. A reform group then moved a motion of lack of confidence in the past performance of the council, officers, and executive directors. This was carried by 208 to 56.</p>

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: Thomson takes over property developer THOMSON Corporation, the international travel and publishing group, is entering the real estate business by taking over a loss-making US residential developer from another company controlled by Canada's Thomson family. Thomson insisted yesterday that the deal made sound business sense, noting it had been approved by a committee of independent directors. The company said the acquisition was 'neither material nor significant' to its overall business and it would continue to concentrate on its publishing and travel interests. Thomson will pay up to USDollars 145m for Markborough Communities (MC), the US community land division of Markborough Properties, which is 83 per cent owned by the Thomson family. Of the total, Dollars 30m will be paid immediately in cash, with the rest coming from cash flows generated by MC's properties over the next five years. Thomson will first be entitled to recover its initial Dollars 30m investment from cash flows. MC is developing residential communities on 7,900 acres of land in Florida, Texas, Colorado and Arizona. Markborough Properties yesterday completed the transfer of the community land division to Woodbridge, a Thomson holding company, after taking a CDollars 521m (US410m) writedown on the properties earlier this year. Woodbridge has further supported Markborough by taking up its full entitlement to the developer's CDollars 250m rights issue earlier this year. Mr Nigel Harrison, Thomson's chief financial officer, said yesterday that, unlike Woodbridge, Thomson has the operating capacity to manage the developments. It also has growing US taxable income to take advantage of tax losses incurred by MC. 'We would not do this unless it made business sense,' he said. Curragh, the Canadian zinc producer, has won more time to complete its restructuring and emerge from bankruptcy protection. It owes creditors CDollars 221m. The company has a two-month extension to August 31 to win court approval for its restructuring. A CDollars 50m equity infusion from Korea Zinc and Samsung, also of Korea, is conditional on Curragh raising another CDollars 25m in equity.</p>

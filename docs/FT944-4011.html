			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Ailing Japanese banks thrown lifeline: Credit unions pushed close to bankruptcy by lending to troubled property group The Bank of Japan moved yesterday to save two ailing credit unions, in the first publicly backed bank rescue since before the second world war. A new bank is to be set up to absorb the assets and liabilities of the Tokyo Kyowa and Anzen credit unions, which are on the brink of bankruptcy. The two institutions have total non-performing loans of about Y100bn (Pounds 637m), accumulated mainly through lending to EIE International, a troubled property group. The central bank will become the largest shareholder in the new institution, providing half its Y40bn capital. The remainder is to come from the private sector - including commercial, trust, regional, and long-term credit banks. The plan marks a shift from recent Japanese financial rescues, in which big private banks have been encouraged to take on ailing counterparts. It is also a reminder of the deep wounds left on Japan's financial system by the bursting of the 'bubble economy,' triggered by the asset price inflation and speculative investments of the late 1980s from which the country is only just recovering. The move is the first publicly backed bank rescue since 1927 and the first time the Bank of Japan has extended funds to any financial institution since 1965, when it helped rescue Yamaichi Securities. The central bank stepped in over the credit unions after concluding it would be difficult for them to attempt reconstruction on their own or find financial institutions prepared to absorb them. Mr Yasushi Mieno, central bank governor, said that although the problem of bad debts had peaked, 'there are still a number of small and medium-sized financial institutions that need help, and not extending support could lead to instability of the Japanese financial system'. He and Mr Masayoshi Takemura, finance minister, said the rescue plan was an emergency measure which did not reflect a change in the government's policy of not using public funds to bail out financial groups. There were no plans to use the new bank to rescue other institutions. The bank, which could begin operating as early as February, will continue deposit, loan and other banking operations. Non-performing loans will be transferred to another body that will receive financial support from the Tokyo metropolitan government, which has jurisdiction over credit unions.</p>

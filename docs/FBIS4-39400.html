			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Gleb Cherkasov report in the "Project" column: "Rank and </F> File Democrats in the Regions Are Accustomed to Working  Together. A United Democratic Center Has Been Formed"]    [Text] On 4 June a conference was held in Moscow by  activists of regional branches of the Party of Russian Unity and  Accord [PRES], the Russian Social Democratic People's Party, the  Democratic Party of Russia, Russia's Choice, the Russian  Democratic Reforms Movement, and other parties and movements  that are or were part of the democratic political spectrum.  Furthermore, State Duma deputies and Duma faction and political  party experts also took part in the conference.    According to the conference organizers, the need for holding  such a meeting was conditioned by the crisis currently unfolding  in regional democratic organizations, and also the results of  elections to the Federal Assembly and local representative power  bodies. Thus, organizing committee representative Vladimir  Zharikhin (PRES apparatus) noted that conflicts "at the top"  between Moscow leaders negatively affect the activity of  provincial primary cells. According to Zharikhin, the reason for  the centrist associations' relative failure in the elections was  the fact that their leaders did not manage to come to agreement  among themselves, while the activists of various regional party  branches are accustomed to working together, under "one roof."  Irina Zubkevich, deputy chairperson of the Duma Committee on  Public Associations and Religious Organizations (Democratic  Party of Russia faction); and Vladimir Komchatov, the  president's representative in Moscow, confirmed their  colleague's point, noting that the "provincials," who have  worked together for many years, often do not understand the  reasons for disagreements in Moscow. At the same time, some of  the "regionals" said quite openly that elections to the Federal  Assembly destroyed democratic blocs that had existed for several  years. It was no accident that the new organization's first  statement says that "the leaders' interests are isolated from  the interests of individual people, voters, and rank and file  members of political parties." The conference participants  virtually unanimously recognized the need for a new association.  In this context one of the participants observed that "unless  we hang together, we shall all hang separately."    Judging by the organizers' plans, the United Democratic  Center will not necessarily acquire the form of an election  association or independent political party. At least, the  majority of the conference participants did not express the wish  immediately to leave their parties' ranks. The new organization  intends to promote "a new political wave that would bring up new  leaders and create new organizational forms of democratic  activity." To accomplish these aims, the United Democratic  Center plans to create an information network and organize  political workshops inviting foreign experts. The creation of  financial groups to support regional democratic organization  activities is not ruled out.</p>

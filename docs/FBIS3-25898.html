			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Amy Liu] </F>   [Text] One thousand copies of Tendency Quarterly have been  confiscated by local police authorities because the content of  the magazine smacked of rightist tendency, the editor said.    Bei Ling, 34, editor-in-chief of the quarterly, said police  authorities maintained the literature quarterly contained some  "questionable" content.    A veteran dissident in the democratic wall movement of 1979,  Mr Bei was questioned at Shanghai airport and interrogated in  Shenzhen for three days last week.    The police did not identify the magazine as reactionary.    Police especially questioned one article, `The Nightmare of  the Post-Communist', written by Czech President Vaclav Havel and  translated by Shen Tong, an active dissident of the 1989  pro-democracy movement.    The magazine was blamed for publishing Chinese literature  written by dissidents.    It reports dissident poets such as Meng Lang and Mo Mo and  the prominent dissident writers in exile--Liu Qin Zheng Yi and  Bei Ming.    Mr Bei said 2,500 copies will be published in Hong Kong and  overseas.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall] </F>   [Text] Patriarch Deng Xiaoping may be officially retired  but he still ranks as a central leader of the Communist Party,  his son, Deng Pufang, inadvertently revealed yesterday.    Asked at a press conference if his father would be attending  any of the ceremonies at the forthcoming Far East and South  Pacific Disabled Persons Games in Beijing, Mr Deng said: "The  time has not yet come to issue invitations to central leaders".    Deng Xiaoping resigned from his last official post as  chairman of the party's central military commission in 1989 and  according to official reports has been leading a life of  relatively quiet retirement since.    It is an open secret, however, that Mr Deng still retains  considerable influence over party policy and his son's comments  yesterday clearly showed he was still regarded as a key member  of the central leadership.    Mr Deng Pufang also dismissed reports that his father was  seriously ill and had been in hospital, saying he was still in  "very good health".    "I deeply regret that these rumours (about Deng Xiaoping's  health) have been circulating recently," he said.    Mr Deng Pufang did not go as far as his sisters and claim  that his father managed to walk three kilometres a day but he  did say that as the weather in Beijing improved his father would  be taking leisurely walks outdoors.    His father would also be spending a lot of time glued to the  television watching the World Cup this summer he added.    "He is a great football fan, so I am sure he will watching a  lot of games on television this summer," he said.</p>

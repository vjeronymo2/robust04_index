			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Adriana Cortes] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, Foreign Trade Institute [ICE] Minister  Alberto Poletto announced that, in accordance with President  Rafael Caldera's inaugural speech in which he said Venezuela's  agreements with other countries must be based on reciprocity,  Venezuela will reappraise its treaty with Caricom [Caribbean  Common Market] countries -- a pact that calls on Venezuela to  offer unilateral preferences to Caribbean countries.    Regarding this point, the new ICE minister said the various  ministers who deal with economic issues will study the  preliminary text of the Group of Three [G-3] agreement to make  suggestions and draw up a joint position in about a week,  because, in the words of the ICE minister, "we are very  interested in signing the G-3 agreement, but not hastily."    Poletto added that mechanisms are being sought to attain  reciprocity in agreements with Caricom member-nations, but  within the framework of negotiations with these countries.    "There is willingness among the Caricom members themselves,  because they have concluded, just as we have, that reciprocity  makes bilateral negotiations more efficient, which is the idea  behind this point. [no closing quotation marks as published]    The Caricom agreement was signed in 1992 and includes, among  various points, the entry of Caribbean products and capital into  Venezuela with increased facility and tariff preferences without  Venezuela receiving other types of preferences in exchange. At  the time of its signing, the treaty was part of a strategic,  long-term foreign policy plan, and, in turn, the primary concern  was not with commercial issues, although such issues will now be  examined.    According to the ICE minister, studies are under way to  amend  the agreement in such a manner that certain Venezuelan products  would be subject to smaller tariffs than those extant in Caricom  countries, as well as having Caribbean nations offer possible  investment incentives for Venezuelan capital, even though these  countries are less developed than Venezuela. Meanwhile,  agreements with Central American countries would be retained in  their current form. These agreements, although not completely  balanced, do offer a gradual liberalizing of tariffs.    In fact, Alberto Poletto is to travel tomorrow to  Montevideo,  Uruguay, to represent Venezuela at a meeting of ALADI [Latin  American Integration Association] foreign ministers in light of  the fact that the foreign minister cannot attend. At the  meeting, efforts will be made to reach an agreement concerning  Mexico's participation in NAFTA, because, according to Article  44 of the ALADI Charter, any member who gives preferences to a  third country must extend those same preferences to ALADI  members. In other words, the 10 Latin American member-states  should in theory receive the same preferences Mexico has  extended to the United States and Canada -- a position defended  by Mercosur [Common Market of the South] countries.    According to Poletto, Venezuela will adopt a neutral  position  that could reconcile both positions, because, according to  previous negotiations, Venezuela supports Mexico in the search  for a formula that does not interfere with negotiations with  third countries.</p>

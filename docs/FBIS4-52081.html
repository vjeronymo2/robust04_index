			<p>BFN     [Text] Police cannot take legal action against MP Thanong  Siriprichaphong, who has been accused by a US court of smuggling  drugs into the United States, because the charges were brought  against him outside Thailand, police chief Prathin Santipraphop  said yesterday.    Pol Gen [Police General] Prathin said police had not yet  been  briefed by US officials and could not act at this stage.    On Wednesday, the US Embassy in Bangkok said in a statement  that Thanong (Chat Thai-Nakhon Phanom) had been involved in  successful and foiled attempts to smuggle more than 45 metric  tons of marijuana into the country.    Thanong allegedly received about $10 million from drug  trafficking between 1977 and 1987. His assets in the United  States have been seized by a US court order, according to the  statement.    Prathin said there was no automatic requirement for  Thanong's  extradition to the States. If it was requested by the US  government, police would have to carefully consider how the law  here applied to the case. Thai police may be able to oversee  the case themselves, Prathin said.    It would be up to Parliament to approve Thanong's arrest if  a  warrant was issued. An MP cannot be arrested during a  parliamentary session without the approval of Parliament.    Asked why police had taken no action against Thanong, even  though he had long been a suspect, Prathin said police must be  careful not to violate personal rights.    Police could make an arrest only when they had substantive  evidence, he said. Police have lists of probable criminals and  "influential" people, but they could not reveal them.</p>

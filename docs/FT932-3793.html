			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / BAe plans new turbo-prop aircraft: British manufacturer to strengthen its regional airliner range BRITISH AEROSPACE plans to launch two regional turbo-propellor aircraft programmes by the end of the year to strengthen its family of Jetstream commuter and regional airliners. The company, which has restructured its turbo-propellor activities by concentrating them at Prestwick in Scotland, said yesterday at the Paris Air Show it was discussing with the UK department of trade and industry the Pounds 450m funding of the two projects. These will involve development of a 72-seater Jetstream 71 and a 50-seat Jetstream 51 to complement the existing Jetstream range, which includes the 19-seat Jetstream 31, the 29-seat Jetstream 41 and the 64-seat ATP (advance turbo-propellor) aircraft. BAe is also stepping up discussions with international partners to try to form a broader strategic alliance in the turbo-propellor business. The company is now adopting a similar approach to its turbo-propellor activities as for its 146 regional jet business which has been turned into a joint company with Taiwan Aerospace. As part of its restructuring programme, BAe also transferred all its Jetstream and ATP activities to Prestwick where it employs about 2,400. It is spending Pounds 27m this year to improve the Prestwick plant. Mr Allan MacDonald, managing director of BAe's Jetstream subsidiary, said the new products would give a clear signal to the market that BAe was serious about staying in the turbo-propellor business. It would also strengthen the company's hand in negotiating a strategic alliance with international partners as part of the rationalisation of the commuter and regional aircraft industry. 'There are too many manufacturers and products in this market, but we want to lead the process of rationalisation,' Mr Mac-Donald said. The reorganisation of Jetstream activities at Prestwick would take 24 to 36 months, he added. The business earns about Pounds 250m a year but this is expected to grow to Pounds 350m-Pounds 400m a year after the new products are launched and the reorganisation is completed. He said the new aircraft programmes would help sustain employment at Prestwick. Avro International, BAe's new regional jet joint venture company with Taiwan, announced yesterday it had won an order worth Dollars 140m from the Turkish national airline THY. It involves firm orders for five regional jets and options for an additional three.</p>

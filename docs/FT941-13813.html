			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Clarke says Iraq case claim is 'tosh' Mr Kenneth Clarke yesterday dismissed as 'tosh' and 'outrageous' claims that he had conspired with other ministers to suppress evidence in the failed Matrix Churchill case. The chancellor said that if the Scott inquiry stated he had suppressed evidence in the Matrix Churchill case, 'I would carry on protesting my innocence but I would resign'. Speaking two days before Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, is due to give evidence to the inquiry, Mr Clarke said: 'The suggestion of conspiring with ministers to suppress evidence to see that innocent men are convicted is outrageous. 'It is, I suggest, tosh and far removed from anything you could picture.' He told BBC TV's Breakfast with Frost programme that the allegations had caused him 'more annoyance than anything else in my political career'. Mr Clarke was one of the ministers who signed certificates seeking to prevent secret government documents being made available to the defence in the Matrix Churchill trial.</p>

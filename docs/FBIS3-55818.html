			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature] </F>   [Text] The brief stop at Kiev's airport to be made by  President Bill Clinton on his way to Moscow will mean a gesture  of good will and a kind of reward for the compromise reached at  the Russian-American-Ukrainian consultations held in Washington  recently, a high-ranking official from Russia's Foreign Ministry  told Interfax on Tuesday.    According to him, participants in the consultations agreed  in  principle that the nuclear arms deployed in Ukraine will be  removed to Russia in exchange for compensation from Moscow.  This circumstance made it possible to conduct a meeting between  the Russian, American, and Ukrainian presidents on January 14  within the framework of the upcoming Russian-American summit.    According to the ministry official, the plan worked out in  Washington envisages that the nuclear arms to be removed from  Ukraine will be deconcentrated in Russia. "Russian specialists  will deconcentrate the enriched uranium of nuclear warheads,  that is bring it to the level of uranium used as fuel," he said.    "Russia will sell that fuel to the Americans, who are in  control of almost all uranium markets. In addition, part of  that uranium will be supplied to Ukraine as fuel for its nuclear  power plants. In other words, Ukraine will get some compensation  for the nuclear arms to be removed from its territory."    This plan, the Russian diplomat pointed out, will be  reflected in a special statement and a memorandum to be issued  after the proposed meeting between the Russian, American, and  Ukrainian presidents in Moscow. "This plan is to be  supplemented with concrete figures, calculations, etc. But this  is a purely technical issue to be resolved after the Moscow  summit in the process of negotiations," he said.    According to him, "it is essential that in Moscow Ukraine  will indicate the exact date when no nuclear weapons will be  left on its soil." The date in question will be known only by  January 14, since the relevant negotiations are continuing.  Nevertheless, this circumstance prompted the U.S. president to  make changes in the itinerary of his trip," he said.    According to preliminary plans, the official noted, in the  course of his European tour President Clinton was to visit  officially not only Moscow and Minsk, but also Kiev. "However,  Ukraine's 'nuclear drift' and the Ukrainian parliament's failure  to ratify the START-I treaty and the Lisbon Protocol to it in  full (IF note: START-I was ratified, with numerous  reservations, along with the Lisbon Protocol with the exception  of Article 5, which obliged Ukraine to join the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty as a denuclearized state) nudged the  Americans toward striking Kiev off their list. After the  consultations in Washington the stick was replaced by a carrot -  Bill Clinton will make a stop at Kiev's airport, if only for an  hour," he said.    According to the information available to Interfax, the  program for the American president's state visit to Moscow has  been fully coordinated; it will be published on Wednesday.  However some details of the program became known to Interfax.    Bill Clinton is expected to arrive in Moscow Wednesday  evening (at about 22:00).    He will not be accompanied by his wife; he will stay at the  Radisson-Slavyanskaya Hotel. However on January 14, when  Clinton's wife, Hillary, arrives in Moscow, the couple will move  to the Kremlin, where the official residence of the American  leader will be located.    Russian-American top-level talks are scheduled for January  13  and 14. In addition, on January 14 the Russian and American  presidents will be joined by their Ukrainian counterpart.    In the evening of January 14, Yeltsin and Clinton are  expected to give a news conference.    In the morning of January 15, after the farewell ceremony to  be held in the Kremlin, the U.S. president will leave for Minsk  to hold talks with the leadership of Belarus.</p>

From one side the commander in chief receives a decree on  releasing generals and admirals from the military service, while  from the other lists of officers who covet the general rank.    In such situations it is very important whether one hand  knows what the other is doing.    It is not a tragedy for the Army if four generals retire  simultaneously. Anyway, there are more generals on the payroll  than our Army needs. Furthermore, in the General Staff and in  the Ground Troops Command there are more generals than desks.    The problem with eventual cuts in the Army is more  complicated. In this sphere the commander in chief, [Defense]  Minister Valentin Aleksandrov, and the head of the General Staff  are between the hammer and the anvil. On the one side there is  the budget plight that hovers over the officers, and on the  other the war that rages only 500 km from our border. Even King  Solomon himself would have difficulties in resolving this  problem, but this is no justification for either staying idle or  adopting hasty decisions.    Obviously, the problem could only be resolved by experts,  who  would objectively consider all arguments for and against the  cuts, without being interested at all in the political  manipulations of parties, leaders, legions, and alliances, which  utilize the national security problems for promoting their own  interests.    Any other decision regarding the Army's fate could have  unpredictable consequences.</p>

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / People: Vardey and Balfour join exchanges A pair of investment bankers has slotted themselves into the hierarchy of two very different stock exchanges - apparent further indications of just how tough the climate in City firms has become. Giles Vardey (left), who left his position as head of continental equities at Swiss Bank Corporation in May, has joined the board of the London Stock Exchange in the newly created position of markets development director, while Charles Balfour (right), who until now has been a London-based director of Italian investment bank Cragnotti, will become the next managing director of the overseas arm of Nasdaq, the US over-the-counter market. Turnover of senior management under London Stock Exchange chief Peter Rawlins has been rapid, and the new job Vardey has plumped for is expected to be tough. 'I think he will be under more pressure to deliver than he expects,' was the comment from one market source. 'Why study history? - there is not a great deal of future in it,' Vardey ripostes. For the past couple of years, the exchange has come under heavy fire from its members for failing to take much account of their views. Vardey's appointment appears to be a, very belated, acknowledgement of this lack of liaison as the institution moves towards the creation of a trading infrastructure to house the UK national and so-called European inter-professional markets. Vardey's assignment is to work through the detail of members' trading and business requirements, and, above all, to sell the changes to the industry. Famous among other things for his flamboyant braces, Vardey, 36, had previously been at Salomon - twice, the second time as head of continental equities. He was at County NatWest in between the Salomon stints, including as managing director of European equities. Asked why he did not move to another investment bank after SBC, he stresses the importance of the exchange taking on more market practitioners. Meanwhile, Balfour, 41, who has been working at Cragnotti since 1991 as head of mergers and acquisitions and corporate finance, points out that cross-border business has been extremely slow. However, the 'mutual parting of the ways' came, he claims, because he would have had to go to Italy 'for it really to be a success and I didn't want to do that'. Of the 'three or four job offers,' he received, Nasdaq appealed the most. He succeeds Lynton Jones, who founded the London end of Nasdaq and is now with the Swedish derivatives market OM. Educated at Eton and the Sorbonne, Balfour had spells at Hoare Govett, Hill Samuel and Dillon Read before joining Banque Paribas where he stayed from 1979 until 1991.</p>

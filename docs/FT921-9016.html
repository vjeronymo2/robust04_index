			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Hanson There are times when Hanson seems gripped by an imp of perversity. As London's analysts and fund managers gather today to hear the company expound its grand strategy, they will be distracted by confusion over what on earth the company is up to with its dividend policy. Until yesterday, buyers of the shares could expect 11p per share of dividends  - assuming an unchanged payment - by next February. They will now have to wait until April, with the amount being doled out in four parts instead of two. In terms of present value, the difference is probably immaterial. It is also claimed to make no real difference to the group's tax payments in terms of cash flow. So what is Hanson up to? The answer seems a little depressing. Because the changeover to the new system means that only half the annual payment will be declared in Hanson's current financial year, it will have the cosmetic effect of reducing the group's huge and doubtless growing ACT liability. This means the tax charge gives the appearance of dropping this year, to some 18 per cent, before reverting to some 24 per cent next year. As a result of this, earnings per share in this year's first quarter were unchanged despite an unprecedented and embarrassing 6 per cent drop in pre-tax profits. Without this kind of fancy footwork, Hanson could put up a reasonable case for its investment attractions. As Hoare Govett argues this week, the company's solid portfolio in natural resources and low gearing means there is simply no need for a break-up or final blockbusting takeover. Looking ahead to the millennium, Hanson could present a combination of modest organic growth and occasional acquisitions on the Beazer model. It is the kind of strategy which could plausibly be entrusted to the next generation of professional managers. But if Lords Hanson and White wish to present their creation as transformed into a boring and stable investment, they are going the wrong way about it.</p>

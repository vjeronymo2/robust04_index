			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / UK and EC settle Pounds 120m funding dispute THE UK government yesterday settled a long-running dispute with the European Commission which had blocked the release of about Pounds 120m in European Community funds for Britain's depressed coal-mining regions. Mr Peter Lilley, Britain's trade and industry secretary, said the government had agreed to introduce more 'transparency' into the way it accounted for funds distributed by the European Regional Development Fund. He told MPs that the government planned also to widen 'competition' by allowing agencies such as British Coal Enterprises, urban development corporations and regional development agencies to compete against local authorities for the EC funds. Mr Bruce Millan, EC commissioner for regional policy, stressed yesterday that the agreement with the British government required that EC regional grants would be 'identified separately in expenditure programmes, and public expenditure cover (from the UK side) will automatically be made available for them'. Mr Millan claimed the 'automatic' nature of this matching finance was missing from yesterday's statement by Mr Lilley. He said the agreement they had reached was 'very clear' and he hoped the government would abide by it honestly. The deal, described by the Labour party as a 'humiliating climbdown', will allow the immediate distribution of Pounds 115m from the Community's Rechar programme to fund more than 50 projects in areas hit by coal-mine closures. Scotland, Lancashire and Nottinghamshire are among the main beneficiaries. The agreement should also allow the Commission to lift a threatened block on up to Pounds 900m of regional funds for 1992-93 for a range of projects in depressed areas. The dispute, the subject of fierce political exchanges at Westminster in recent months, arose after Mr Millan demanded changes to ensure that money allocated to Britain would represent a clear 'addition' to normal Treasury spending and that the EC money would reach the industrially-stricken regions at which it was targeted. The stance taken by Brussels sparked sharp differences within the cabinet, with Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, privately taking the Commission's side. Mr Lilley and the Treasury initially opposed any change in the way the EC funds were included in the government's overall public-spending totals. But Conservative MPs in areas denied the blocked funds had been pressing for a settlement before the general election.</p>

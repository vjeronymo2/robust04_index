			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> EX-CON INDICTED IN BANK ROBBERY  </P> <P> An ex-convict has been indicted in Pennsylvania in the robbery of a Buena Park  bank last year, accused of strapping what he said were explosives around a  teller's waist and forcing her to help him take $190,000.  </P> <P> Ralph Stephen Gambin, 42, has also been indicted in a similar holdup last year  in Torrance, where robbers got away with $410,000.  </P> <P> Gambin remains a suspect in other robberies in Torrance, San Francisco and  Florida, said Jim Neilson, an FBI spokesman in Los Angeles. The robberies, most  involving the abduction of a bank employee, have netted nearly $1 million since  April, 1988.  </P> <P> Federal authorities arrested Gambin in Elgin, Ill., on June 2. He had been on  parole since March, 1988, after serving 15 years in federal prison for a 1973  Iowa bank robbery and a failed escape attempt three years later in which he  shot two U.S. marshals, one of whom was left paralyzed.  </P> <P> Since his arrest, he has been held in the federal penitentiary in Lewisburg,  Pa. Arraignment in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles has not been scheduled.  </P> <P> Gambin's alleged crime spree began one month after his release from prison, FBI  officials say. On April 25, 1988, three men in disguises held a Wells Fargo  Bank manager and her son in a Torrance home overnight and then forced the woman  to open the bank's vault before the branch opened.  </P> <P> On Aug. 28 last year, in a similar incident, Gambin and another man allegedly  wore black wigs and beards and forced their way into the La Habra apartment of  a Buena Park bank teller, holding the woman and three family members at  gunpoint until morning.  </P> <P> They then forced the teller into a Security Pacific Bank branch, officials  allege, after saddling her with a device that they claimed was a remote control  bomb. It was fake and no one was injured, but the robbers got away with  $190,000.  </P> <P> The FBI believes that from Orange County, Gambin moved to southern Florida and  last Nov. 4 made an unsuccessful attempt to rob a bank in the town of  Plantation. The robbery was aborted when police came to the scene of a serious  car crash nearby. In Ft. Lauderdale on Dec. 20, Gambin allegedly accosted an  employee outside a bank and sent her inside to loot the safe, telling her, "By  the way, we have your children."  </P> <P> Gambin also is a suspect in a robbery attempt last May 5 at Security Pacific  National Bank in Torrance. FBI officials said the robber told a bank employee  that he was holding her children -- but she had no children. He had apparently  confused her house with a neighbor's house where there were children.  </P> <P> In the most recent incident, Gambin allegedly robbed a Bank of America branch  in San Mateo on May 12. FBI officials say Gambin and an accomplice took a bank  employee and her husband hostage at gunpoint and then ordered her to loot the  vault. The employee dragged a bag with $269,200 to the waiting car, and the  bandits fled. TED JOHNSON  </P></p>

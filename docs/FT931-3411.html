			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Doubts put share price surge on the line for NTT investors - A look into the background to the turnround in the Japanese group's stock IT IS difficult not to regard the rally in the share price of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Japan's telecommunications group, with at least a degree of suspicion. After sliding steadily for the past five years, the country's most widely-held stock has gained 31.5 per cent in just 10 days from Y616,000 on February 26 to Y810,000 on March 12. Yesterday, the issue took a breather and closed down Y7,000 at Y803,000 (Dollars 6,819). NTT's dramatic rise was the force behind last week's 1,219.82-point surge on the Tokyo stock exchange which took the Nikkei index over 18,000 for the first time since September 25. The ostensible trigger for the new surge in NTT has been a number of developments suggesting the group may at last be finding its way out of a situation in which it faces growing competition, falling market share and slumping profits. In the past few weeks there have been hints that the semi-private telecommunications group may be allowed to raise its call rates, and comments by senior government officials indicating they are keen to support the issue. In addition, there has been talk of public investment projects in a new telecommunications infrastructure. The combination of these developments has spurred excitement over the group's near-term prospects. But the timing of the rise in NTT, just before corporate Japan closes its accounts at the end of this month, arouses suspicions as to whether the fact these developments have all come at the same time is merely a coincidence. 'It was very cleverly timed,' says an analyst at Nomura Research Institute, the research arm of Nomura Securities. If any of the positive factors cited are realised, it would be good news for NTT. For example, reducing the time of a call from Y10 for three minutes to Y10 for 90 seconds - the likely in a rate rise - would double NTT's operating profits by 1994, according to Mr Eric Gan, industry analyst at Kleinwort Benson. In recent months, NTT has been lobbying heavily for a rise, fuelling speculation it has won some government support for its case. 'The time has finally come when we must really push for a price rebalance. Unless we do something the situation is going to affect our capital investments,' said Mr Tomeo Kanbayashi, vice-president. He was speaking at the group's announcement of its business plan for 1993 which was submitted to the ministry of posts and telecommunications last month. The group has announced a restructuring programme to reduce the number of employees by 30,000 over the next three years and retail outlets by a third. Comments made by a government official last week, accepting the need for an increase in pay phone rates, seemed to suggest government sympathy for NTT's cause. NTT enthusiasts argue that the government, which still owns 65 per cent of NTT shares, has plenty of reasons for wanting to see the share price rise. More than any other issue, NTT symbolises the hopes, and fears, of Japan's individual investors, many of whom invested in stocks for the first time when the government sold its first tranche in February 1987 for Y1.19m a share. By April 22 1987, the shares had climbed to a peak of Y3.18m. However, a series of financial scandals, the plunge in the Tokyo stock market and concerns over NTT's business prospects led to a spectacular fall in the share price. In the past three years, the issue has lost 80 per cent of its value, hitting an all-time low of Y453,000 last August. Individual investors have become thoroughly disillusioned with NTT, with the brokers who recommended the issue and the authorities who appeared to have betrayed the public trust. A strong rise in NTT would go a long way to lifting investor sentiment and help prepare the way for the launch this August of shares in JR East, a regional railway company created by the break-up of the state-owned Japan Railways, and in Japan Tobacco, in future. The ministry of finance, which has been forced to postpone a fourth sale of NTT shares due to the market's weakness, could also do with the income to help pay for Japan's emergency spending package. Furthermore, a rise in NTT's share price would help many of its corporate shareholders before the closing of their books this month. Thus, the government could kill several birds with one stone by ensuring that NTT's share price rises. The third bullish factor supporting NTT's rise has been the idea of a public works project focused on a new telecommunications infrastructure to stimulate the sagging domestic economy. However, there is little concrete evidence to suggest that NTT will be able to get what it wants. The ministry of posts and telecommunications, has publicly expressed no sympathy for a rate hike in anything but pay phones. On the contrary, the ministry has continued to take a hard stance on an increase in other local call rates. 'We believe that if NTT restructures its local call operations it could actually make a profit there. If that happens, NTT may end up subsidising its long-distance operations, where it faces competition, with profits from its local call business, where it has a monopoly,' says Mr Kazuhiro Suda, director of the tariff division in the ministry's telecommunications bureau. Meanwhile, plans for a government project to build a new telecommunications infrastructure have been roundly criticised by the ministry of international trade and industry, which believes such a move would undermine the whole purpose of having privatised NTT in the first place. The question for investors then is how far those who are interested in talking up the share price are prepared to go, and, perhaps more crucially, how long will other investors be prepared to believe them.</p>

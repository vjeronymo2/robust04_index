			<p>BFN     [Text] Stockholm, May 9 (XINHUA) -- Chairman of the  National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Li Ruihuan and Swedish Foreign  Minister Margaretha Ugglas expressed the hope today that the  traditional friendship and mutual cooperation between their  countries will be strengthened.    In their talks, Li spoke highly of the bilateral relations,  noting that Sweden is the first western country to establish  diplomatic relations with New China after it was born in 1949  and the two nations have no outstanding problems to settle.    The two countries share many common interests in the  maintenance of world peace and promotion of common development,  Li said.    Li added that so long as both sides pursue the principles of  mutual respect, non-interference in each other's internal  affairs, mutual benefit and equality as well as seeking common  grounds while reserving differences, the relations between the  countries will be promoted constantly.    Ugglas said in the talks that her country has paid great  attention to Li's current visit.    She said Sweden appreciates the economic and social  successes  achieved by China in recent years.    The Swedish Government supports broader economic and trade  cooperation between the two countries, said the foreign minister.    Ugglas expressed her belief that Li's visit will boost the  existing bilateral ties in the political and economic fields.    Li arrived in Sweden's second largest city of Gothenburg  last  Friday to begin a visit to the Nordic nation, the second leg of  his current five-European-nation tour, which has already taken  him to Finland. Li will proceed to Norway, Denmark and Belgium.</p>

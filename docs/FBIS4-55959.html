			<p>BFN     [Text] During his visit to Paris yesterday, Presidency  President Alija Izetbegovic made a statement for  Bosnia-Herzegovina television. He spoke about the coming Geneva  negotiations between our delegation and the contact group.    Izetbegovic said: We hesitated over whether to go to the  talks. There were different stands on this issue. We concluded  that the reasons for [words indistinct] prevailed. These are  not real negotiations, and our delegation (?sees them) only as  an opportunity to inform about the true state of affairs before  the 30 May session of the Assembly of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. We have had indications that certain  favorable changes have been made in the contact group, and we  will try to exert influence on the contact group's stands.  Public opinion in France and the United States seems to go in  the direction which could exert influence on certain stands  being changed to comply with our wishes.    Asked what he thought about the return to the negotiations  of  Lord David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, President Izetbegovic  said: Our great reservations about their involvement in the  negotiating process are very well justified. It is well known  that they have brought no good to us. They advocated stands  which were against the interests of Bosnia-Herzegovina and,  unfortunately, they were successful in doing that, so that it  was difficult (?to play that game) with them. I think that our  delegation at the meeting will speak out against the talks. We  sent a letter demanding Yasushi Akashi's resignation. We  refused to receive him on several occasions. I do not know how  much they respect our opinion, and whether they believe they  should act in line with our wishes.    Among other things, President Izetbegovic said the following  about a possible denouement in the military and political  spheres: Unfortunately, I cannot say that I expect a great deal  because I have been frustrated by the failure of negotiations so  far. I can say in particular that I do not expect much because  the contact group is again repeating the percentage of 51 [for  the Croats and Muslims] to 49 [for the Serbs], and we will see  whether they have changed their position on this. We cannot  [words indistinct] our occupied territories. The pressure  exerted on us to accept the proposed 51-49 percentage could be  (?seen) as the continuation of war, but not though our fault,  but through the fault of those who have not given us choice. We  keep repeating that we are in favor of a just peace. What is  being offered to us is not just peace, unless considerable  changes are made in future talks.    Regardless of what the world wants, it is, objectively  speaking, pushing us toward war. They have not offered us any  alternative. We have already defined our aims on the lower limit  of a bearable minimum, but further concessions have been  demanded of us. I believe that we can make no more concessions,  President of the Presidency Alija Izetbegovic said among other  things in an interview for Bosnia-Herzegovina television.</p>

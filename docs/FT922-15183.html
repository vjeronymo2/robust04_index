			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / World Trade News: Voluntary restraint may give way to Steel Wars THE stalled effort to negotiate a Multilateral Steel Arrangement (MSA), phasing out subsidies and market barriers among leading steel exporting nations, may stand as one more failure of free market idealists who at the end of the 20th century tried to build a world without trade distortions. Mr Bert Delano, a spokesman for the US specialty steel industry, sees the effort to get other nations to give up their regional aids, environmental subsidies, assistance to redundant workers and the rest as 'naive'. It is the view of others at the bargaining table in Geneva that the US, which launched the talks, stood as the principal obstacle to agreement by refusing to amend its anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws. Not surprisingly, Mr Delano sees the failure of the talks as all the fault of 'foreigners' who understood that the US 'badly' wanted an MSA and used the opportunity to try to 'gut' US trade laws. With the expiration of the Voluntary Restraint Agreements (VRAs) on Tuesday night, these laws may be given full rein. 'Every part of the industry has kept cases in some state of readiness as an insurance policy against the failure of the multilateral talks,' said one Washington trade lawyer. These cases are could be filed in chunks - product by product - against several countries at once. Although the industry has from time to time threatened to unload a lorry-load of cases before the doors of the Commerce Department, decisions to file have yet to be made. There is lingering hope that the Bush administration will succumb to election year pressure and change its mind about renewing the 'voluntary' restrains. Alternatively, the US industry might settle for de facto VRAs if foreign governments - particularly the EC, Japan and Korea - unilaterally decide to continue to restrain their US exports. The 'fair trade' option is not without risks for the US industry. Each case can cost Dollars 50,000-Dollars 100,000 to file, and victory cannot be assured. Small exporters may be deleted from a trade case by the Commerce Department because their market share is inconsequential. They may then feel in the clear to expand their sales in the US. The massive filings which frightened the EC into negotiating VRAs in 1982 resulted in losses in more than half the cases. That is because US anti-dumping and subsidy laws - although skewed towards the domestic producers - are still more fair than many other nations' because they require a finding by an independent International Trade Commission that an industry has suffered damage (or will do so in the future) from imports. The whole process is 'costly, time consuming and you have to be practically dead before you can win something,' said Mr Delano, sadly. The VRAs, imposed globally in 1984, were designed to limit US steel imports to 18-21 per cent. Many countries did not even fill their quotas. But others, such as stainless steel rod, have lost more than 40 per cent of the domestic market. One tactic in demonstrating injury will be to compare imports to the US with other countries, whose governments found injury with much lower levels of market penetration. The 36 nations negotiating an MSA agreed to continue the effort, but the outlook for its success is dim unless there is accord in the Uruguay Round over subsidies and anti-dumping. It was agreed among a small group of nations which met on Tuesday after the MSA talks broke off that bilateral and multilateral efforts would continue; the EC particularly did not want the negotiation to be seen as breaking up. The US is likely to continue to talk, said one source close to the negotiations, because 'you have two people at USTR and that is their only job. The only thing that will stop them is lack of travel funds.'  --------------------------------------------------         STEEL IMPORTERS AND EXPORTERS  -------------------------------------------------- Exporters              1989 Value (dollars bn)  -------------------------------------------------- 1  Japan                         14.8 2  Germany, Fed.

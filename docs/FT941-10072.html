			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Call for action on Norwegian salmon Scottish salmon farmers yesterday urged Whitehall to seek stronger EU action against Norwegian salmon exports. They published an analysis by Ernst &amp; Young which says that for five years the Norwegian salmon farming industry has been receiving a 20 per cent government subsidy and is bankrolled by the state-owned banking system. The Scottish farmers say the subsidies encourage Norway to dump salmon on the EU market, driving down prices and causing severe problems for the farmers. Commodities, Page 30</p>

			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP BASKETBALL STATE PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> THEY GIVE MATER DEI FAIL-SAFE RESERVE CLAUSE;  </P> <P> MONARCHS: BENCH PLAYERS USUALLY SHOW THEIR STRENGTH IN PRACTICE. THAT'S WHEN  NONSTARTERS BEAT STARS.  </P> <P> They call themselves "The Scrubs." Not only are they one of the best prep  basketball teams you'll seldom see, they're the only team to consistently beat  Mater Dei all season.  </P> <P> Mater Dei is the state's top-ranked high school team with a 33-1 record going  into the State Division I boys' championship game Saturday in Oakland. The  Monarchs have won 25 consecutive games, including a victory over Loyola for the  Southern Section's 5-A title and over Long Beach Poly for the Southern  California Division I regional championship.  </P> <P> But in the daily practices with only coaches and team managers in attendance,  the reserves are often the stars for Mater Dei.  </P> <P> "They're better than half the teams we've played this season," starting forward  Charlie Andres said.  </P> <P> "Most of them could be starting at other schools," Mater Dei Coach Gary  McKnight said. "They've been pushed to the limit just to survive here, but they  have a ring on their finger and a smile on their face."  </P> <P> Mater Dei's reserves are underclassmen projected as starters who are awaiting  their turn, seniors who are borderline starters but had an impact on  lower-level teams or seniors who rarely play but just want to be part of the  team.  </P> <P> Junior center Mark Moneypenny, junior forward Taylor Ivey and sophomore guard  Reggie Geary are considered the cornerstones of next season's team.  </P> <P> Senior point guard Glen Malone and senior off-guard Paul Nolan would start at  most schools, but find themselves playing behind returning starters Jason Quinn  and David Boyle and sixth man Dan O'Neil.  </P> <P> Despite being reserves, Malone and Nolan have caught the attention of college  coaches.  </P> <P> Orange Coast College Coach Tandy Gillis is interested in Malone. Nolan is being  recruited by University of Redlands Coach Gary Smith.  </P> <P> John O'Toole, senior class valedictorian with a 4.6 grade-point average, falls  into the third class of reserve. He rarely plays, but enjoys being part of a  championship team.  </P> <P> "I could be playing at other schools, but I wouldn't be playing now in March at  another school," O'Toole said. "I'd rather not play and win than play and  lose."  </P> <P> The Scrubs, headed by O'Toole, emulate an opponent's offense in practice or  provide depth and moral support from the bench on game nights.  </P> <P> Nolan is the team's great impostor. Before Mater Dei played Capistrano Valley,  Nolan was Scott McCorkle, the Cougars' high-scoring forward. He was Rob Johnson  before Mater Dei met El Toro in the 5-A semifinals; John Molle before Mater Dei  played Irvine in the opening round of the playoffs.  </P> <P> Nolan, a senior, was projected as a starter during the summer, but he broke his  finger last July in a tournament in Texas. Nolan recovered from that injury,  then broke his ankle on the second day of the season.  </P> <P> "I never caught up," Nolan said. "If you fall behind here, there's somebody  else just as good who's going to take your place."  </P> <P> Nolan displayed Mater Dei's incredible depth when he got the opportunity to  become the team's sixth man when O'Neil was on a football recruiting trip. He  scored nine points, hitting three consecutive critical shots, in a 66-53  victory over Ocean View.  </P> <P> "Paul showed how deep we are," O'Toole said. "We all have the confidence we can  produce if given the opportunity. The practices get the starters and reserves  ready for every game."  </P> <P> Ivey anticipates that next season "will be my year" and has accepted his role  as a reserve. He battles Andy Karich, the Angelus League's most valuable  player, every day in practice. He is quick to point out that the final two  minutes of a lopsided game is prime time for the reserves.  </P> <P> "It's our chance to show the coaches, but at the same time, you don't want to  be a ballhog, so you have to play within a team concept," Ivey said. "We  usually get in the game in the final two minutes if we have a 14-point lead or  better."  </P> <P> Geary is the prime reason Mater Dei fans seldom leave a game before it's over.  Geary's acrobatic dunks have helped him become the favorite of the Mater Dei  student section.  </P> <P> "He is the reason people stay for the whole game," O'Toole said. "Reggie is the  pride of the Scrubs. We know some day he's going to be the star player at Mater  Dei."  </P> <P> The Scrubs' excitement on the bench is often transmitted to the action on the  floor. The players sometimes try to excite the student section that is headed  by a former player, Brian Liberto.  </P> <P> Liberto was a reserve for three years in Mater Dei's basketball program, but  opted to become a rooter rather than a reserve in his senior year.  </P> <P> "You have to be a little subdued on the bench, and I found you can get out more  aggression and have more fun sitting in the rooter section," Liberto said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement signed on 7 March by His Majesty Norodom </F> Sihanouk Varaman, king of the Kingdom of Cambodia, concerning  the great danger from war between the Khmer Royal Armed Forces,  KRAF, and the forces of Democratic Kampuchea, DK" -- read by  announcer]    [Text] Most beloved compatriots: The war between the KRAF  and the DK forces, or Khmer Rouge, is now raging. It has  brought no good nor benefit to our motherland. On the contrary,  this war has brought only destruction, losses, suffering, pain,  shame, and desperation for Cambodia, for the nation, and  especially for its innocent poor people.    In my capacity as the father of the nation and the king  father of the entire Cambodian people, whether they are men or  women, belonging to whichever political parties and living  wherever in the country, I appeal on the one hand to the Royal  Government [RCG] and the KRAF and on the other to the party of  Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] and the National Army of Democratic  Kampuchea [NADK] to immediately agree to a general cease-fire on  all battlefields throughout Cambodia.    I appeal to all of you, my children, to accept a total and  unconditional reconciliation and concord. I appeal to all of you  to join hands in building peace and to coexist peacefully now,  in the future, and forever. Peace in Cambodia is the life,  happiness, prosperity, and glory of our nation and motherland.  War is death for Cambodia and our race. All problems remaining  between the RCG and the PDK must be settled through only one  means, a peaceful means. I appeal to the RCG and the PDK to give  our motherland total peace, because only in this total peace can  our motherland engage in the reconstruction process for the sake  of our people and thereby enable our people to live happily in  dignity and with freedom, bereft of all suffering.    I appeal to the NADK and the PDK to restore and rebuild all  bridges, roads, and trails that this army and party have damaged  and destroyed, and to help clear all mines from places that they  have been laid.    I appeal to the KRAF to uphold the good traditions of the  KRAF of the Sangkum Reas Niyum's era by, starting from now,  paying attention to helping our poor people improve their living  conditions. The KRAF must dedicate themselves to peaceful tasks  for national reconstruction as in the time of Sangkum Reas Niyum.    I ask all of you, my beloved children and compatriots, to  accept the expressions of my warmest and deepest love for you  and may you all enjoy the four blessings of Lord Buddha, namely:  long life, social prestige, happiness, and good health.    P.S. I would like to make it clear that I will not tolerate  any parity between the RCG and the PDK, because DK is only a  party whereas the RCG is a national government of the Kingdom of  Cambodia. One day, through peaceful negotiations, the PDK will  have to return to the Kingdom of Cambodia all the zones that  they are controlling, including Pailin and the Preah Vihear  temple, because the Kingdom of Cambodia has only one government,  that is, the RCG, and only one army, that is, the KRAF.    [Dated] Beijing, 7 March 1994    [Signed] Norodom Sihanouk</p>

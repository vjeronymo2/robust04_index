			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / International Company News: Foodland offer faces probe The Trade Practices Commission, Australia's competition watchdog, expects to 'look very closely' at the ADollars 500m (USDollars 365m) break-up bid launched on Wednesday for Foodland Associated, the Perth-based retail and wholesale group. The bidder, Rank Commercial, a privately-owned New Zealand company, intends to divide and sell on Foodland's assets if the offer gains 75 per cent acceptance. Its NZ interests would be sold to Whitcoulls, a stationery and bookshop group, while its Australian assets would pass to Coles Myer, one of Australia's biggest retailers. Mr Alan Fels, TPC chairman, said a major area of concern was that Coles might find it easier to raise prices if it took control of Foodland's Australian assets. It would move to a very strong position in West Australian grocery retailing and already has non-controlling interests in independent wholesalers in other states. However, the bidding group, which met TPC officials yesterday, said it had no reason to think the commission would block the bid, which is being contested by Foodland. TPC concerns, meanwhile, failed to halt a 76 cent rise in the Foodland share price, to ADollars 5.51 - well in excess of the ADollars 5.27 a share bid price. Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian resources group, has filed its defence documents in the ADollars 4bn environmental lawsuit brought against it by some 6,000 villagers living around the Ok Tedi copper mine in Papua New Guinea, which BHP manages. It said its defence overall did not vary from its previous position; that Ok Tedi operates in compliance with PNG law and with the support of its government. Foster's Brewing, the Australian brewer, has extended its licensed production and distribution agreement with Germany's Holsten Breweries to a national basis. It claimed the arrangements should allow it to become the top-selling foreign beer in Germany. It is currently in the number two spot.</p>

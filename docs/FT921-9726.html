			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Japanese voters turn up the heat on Miyazawa: Prime minister comes under growing pressure to restore party's image, or resign JAPAN'S RULING Liberal Democratic party faces its most serious political difficulties since losing two prime ministers in the space of a few weeks at the height of the 1989 Recruit bribery affair. The party's failure on Sunday to win a by-election in Nara, a long-time LDP stronghold in western Japan, has highlighted voters' anger at the LDP's recent performance, particularly its involvement in a new spate of financial scandals. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, who took office only last October, is under growing pressure to restore the party's tarnished image - or resign. Mr Miyazawa's immediate challenge is to break a deadlock in the Diet over the passage of the government budget bill for 1992-93 by the end of March. Opposition parties are demanding that aspects of the recent financial scandals should be examined first. While each side is primarily engaged in securing domestic political advantage, the impasse has international implications: The weaker Mr Miyazawa becomes, the more difficult it will be for the government to secure parliamentary approval for controversial plans to send Japanese servicemen on United Nations peace-keeping missions or for the possible liberalisation of the rice market - a key issue at the Uruguay Round trade talks. As Mr Masayuki Fukuoka, a political commentator, says: 'Mr Miyazawa's position is getting more difficult because he has shown no leadership either in the Diet or in this election.' Even though the LDP had been braced for defeat in Sunday's poll in Nara, the verdict came as a shock. The contest was for a seat in the upper house, left vacant by the death of the incumbent, a member of Rengo Sangiin, the political arm of Rengo, Japan's trade union confederation. He had won his seat only in 1989 the unusual circumstances of the Recruit affair - before that for more than 30 years the seat had been held by LDP-inclined conservatives and the LDP had hoped to win it back. The result showed that even in Nara, the ancient capital of Japan, modern concerns about political ethics are arousing strong passions among voters. Mr Yukihisa Yoshida, the winning candidate, also from Rengo Sangiin, ran on an anti-corruption platform. He secured 244,930 votes, against 178,002 for the LDP's candidate. LDP officials in Tokyo pledged after the result to renew efforts at political reform. Three scandals are now at the centre of voters' minds. First, the Kyowa affair, in which Kyowa, a steel framemaker and property company, allegedly bribed Mr Fumio Abe, a former minister, with Y80m (Pounds 360,000) in return for leaked planning information. Mr Abe was, until his resignaMr Miyazawa. Other Miyazawa supporters are also known to have accepted money in the form of political donations from Kyowa. Next, the opposition parties are trying to revive interest in Mr Miyazawa's own role in the Recruit scandal. Recruit, a recruitment company, distributed cut-price shares to a large number of influential people, including Mr Miyazawa. Mr Miyazawa, who was finance minister when the scandal erupted in 1988, resigned from his post. The opposition parties want to embarrass him and the LDP further by raking over the coals. Finally, there is the Sagawa Kyubin affair, still bubbling just below the surface but likely to explode any day into a full-scale scandal. At the centre is Sagawa Kyubin, a road transport company, which is under investigation by the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's office for alleged links with gangsters and illegal financial transactions. The prosecutor's office is examining the role of Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, the group's biggest subsidiary, in Y530bn worth of allegedly questionable transactions. Tokyo Sagawa apparently acted as an intermediary between banks and 84 borrowers, individuals and corporations - sometimes guaranteeing borrowings on behalf of the ultimate borrowers and sometimes diverting funds meant for its own use. While this is not illegal in itself, there is considerable suspicion about Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin's motives. The public prosecutor's office has alleged that some Y100bn of the funds were diverted to yakuza or gangster groups. Chief among them was Inagawakai, Japan's second largest criminal organisation, which was led until his death last year by Mr Susumu Ishii, a boss known for his commercial acumen. The public prosecutor's office also believes that companies in the Sagawa Kyubin group made donations to politicians. Such donations are legal if they are properly accounted for and if nothing was done in return for the money. But Sagawa Kyubin's donations are thought to total billions of yen - a figure which many Japanese regard as suspiciously large. The trouble for Mr Miyazawa is that even if he survives the attacks over the scandal, the party has already lost much of the credibility it regained in the years 1989-91, under the leadership of Mr Toshiki Kaifu, Mr Miyazawa's predecessor. Mr Kaifu failed in his most important goal - political reform - but he managed to create a clean political aura which the voters welcomed. The damage done should be kept in perspective. The LDP's lock on the Diet's lower house, where most power resides, remains unchallenged. Lower house elections are dominated by an MP's personal standing in a constituency. National issues, even scandals, are usually of secondary concern. But the LDP lost its majority in the upper house in 1989. It also faces the prospect of losing further ground in a by-election next month and in an election due in July to half the seats in the upper house. Legally, the LDP can use its lower house majority to force most kinds of legislation through the upper house. But under Japanese political conventions, the ruling party rarely behaves in this way. Instead it seeks compromises with the opposition. These compromises will now be even more difficult to achieve.</p>

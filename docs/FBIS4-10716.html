			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Here are the highlights of former President  Jaime Paz Zamora's six-hour testimony before the Constituent  Commission.    [Begin recording] [Amalia Pando] In his testimony before the  Constituent Commission, former President Jaime Paz Zamora  declared he was both a victim of his own mistakes as well as  those of the Special Antinarcotics Force [FELCN] and the  Prosecutor's office.    He referred to a U.S. plot that is allegedly focusing on him  because his government defended coca farming at an international  level and because he invited Fidel Castro to visit Bolivia.    [Paz] I hope the commission agrees with me when I say that  we  run the risk of our ineffective struggle against drug  trafficking being used within our country for political or other  purposes. [passage omitted]    Do you not think, when I saw the regrettable way in which  the  FELCN and the Prosecutor General acted, I did not wonder how  they acted in previous cases and how many people may have been  victims of this irresponsible, corrupt, and superficial  management of our prisons throughout the country.    [Pando] During his administration, Paz Zamora was asked to  safeguard our sovereignty in light of the obvious intervention  by the U.S. Embassy. At that time Paz Zamora talked about a  sham [pacotilla] sovereignty.    [Paz] We must not let the FELCN, in the name of the noble  struggle against drug trafficking, become a nightmare for the  citizenry as was the case of the Tonton Macoutes in Haiti.    [Pando] The former president then made a series of charges  which had been reported by the media throughout the four years  of his administration.    [Paz] Higher ranking FELCN officers, district prosecutors,  and the special prosecutors for drug cases receive their  salaries directly from the financial cooperation granted by the  United States. This is not normal. I would say this is a  typical case of cooperation -- which we need -- but which could  turn into intervention. After all, you obey the one who pays  you your salary.    [Pando] He ended his attacks against the FELCN and the  prosecutors in a categorical manner.    [Paz] Nothing of what was said was true. [passage omitted]  [end recording]</p>

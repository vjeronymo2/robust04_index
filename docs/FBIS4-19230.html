			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Anne Segall report: "Clarke Reveals How Bank Vetoed Rate </F> Cut Plan"]    [Text] The Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke,  yesterday swept aside the traditional secrecy surrounding  decisions on interest rates when he disclosed that the Governor  of the Bank of England, Eddie George, effectively vetoed his  plan to reduce rates by a half point in February, forcing a  compromise cut of a quarter point to 5.25 percent.    The cut was the smallest since April 1985 and proved  insufficent to allow a decline in mortgage costs. Building  societies dismissed the move as "a technical adjustment,"  claiming that they were unable to pass on the benefit to  customers.    The timing of the February interest rate cut has also proved  controversial, with the Bank sending out the signal for cheaper  money just two days after an upward adjustment in American  interest rates. That precipitated a sharp sell-off in world  bond markets with the British market suffering a particularly  savage correction.    As a result, the cost of long-term money has risen sharply,  making it more expensive for home owners to obtain fixed-rate  mortgage finance.    Discrepancies in the statements put out by the Bank and the  Treasury at the time of the February rate cut added to the  confusion and Mr Clarke admitted yesterday that the resulting  muddle had finally persuaded him to make public the minutes of  his regular meetings with the Governor after a lag of six weeks.    However, the Chancellor made it clear that he had not made  the decision lightly. He had been influenced by the  recommendation to publish contained in a report by the powerful  backbench Treasury and Civil Service Committee and had "ghosted"  the idea for some months.    The move was also consistent with other strategies designed  to make the conduct of monetary policy more transparent and less  subject to political influences, including the decision to allow  the Bank to publish an independent quarterly report on inflation.    The Governor hoped that by giving the market the opportunity  to appreciate the nuances behind interest rate decisions,  speculation would be reduced rather than increased. However, he  said that there would be a learning process and admitted that it  might not be "a particularly comforting process."    Yesterday's announcement was accompanied by the publication  of minutes for the last three meetings between the Chancellor  and the Governor, including the February meeting where the  decision to cut base rates from 5.5 percent to 5.25 percent was  taken. The February minutes reveal that Mr George would have  preferred to hold rates unchanged because he feared an adverse  reaction in financial markets and a loss of credibility. Mr  Clarke had on the other hand expressed concern about the likely  impact of higher taxes from April and argued that a rate cut in  April might be "too late."    Financial markets are likely to focus on the minutes for  March in which the Chancellor holds out the prospect of further  interest rate cuts, drawing attention to the fall in share and  bond prices. He says that "it would be appropriate to consider  a further reduction in interest rates if indicators subsequently  suggested that activity was subdued and inflationary pressures  remained under firm control."</p>

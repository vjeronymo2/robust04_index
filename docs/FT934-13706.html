			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Fine' deepens copper 'squeeze' mystery - The aftermath of alleged London Metal Exchange manipulation AN EXTRAORDINARY coda to the 'squeeze' on the London Metal Exchange's copper market has raised more questions rather than providing satisfactory answers. The supply squeeze was maintained through June, July and August amid widespread suggestions that the market was being manipulated to keep the copper price up. Last week, in an unprecedented move, Credit Lyonnaise Rouse, part of the French banking group, apologised to the LME for its part in the squeeze and said it had paid Pounds 100,000 towards the exchange's costs. This is a large enough sum for traders refer to it as a 'fine'. They are also pointing out that CLR's long list of blue chip clients includes Sumitomo Corporation, for which CLR acts as clearing broker. At the height of the squeeze traders suggested that Sumitomo was mainly responsible and had options on most of the LME copper stocks. Mr Yasuo Hamanaka, the senior Sumitomo manager responsible for copper trading, denied any manipulation was going on and said the tightness was caused by complex technical factors associated with a previous sharp fall in copper prices. Both CLR and the LME have agreed to provide no further comment on or illumination of this agreed statement. But the incident gives some clues about how the exchange can head off what it calls 'undesirable' situations in its metals markets and stop manipulation when necessary. It paved the way in April 1991 with the introduction of its so-called 'large postion reporting system' where traders are required to report to the LME daily any futures and options positions, held for their own or named clients accounts, that exceed certain limits. These highly-confidential reports, seen by only very senior members of the LME's secretariat, give advance warning of squeezes and attempts to manipulate the market. Mr David King, LME chief executive, explained at the time: 'The idea is to give the exchange a better understanding of what is taking place in the market. It is in line with our statutory obligation to maintain an orderly market and shows our determination to keep the market orderly while sticking to our fundamental principal of not interfering with free market forces.' During the recent copper squeeze the LME board issued two public warnings but to no avail. Then on September 8 the board decided to take action 'in anticipation of the development of an undesireable situation in the copper market,' and limited the daily backwardation (premium for immediate delivery over forward prices) to Dollars 5 a tonne. There have been previous squeezes in LME metals markets but never before has the exchange felt it necessary publicly to reprimand or to seek apology from any of the organisations involved. CLR's apology illustrates an important point: while the LME does not have the power to control the activities of some of the large organisations with deep pockets that use its metals markets, that business eventually has to be cleared with an exchange member - and the LME does have the right to force an exchange member to toe the line. This message will not have been lost on the LME's other 16 ring-dealing members. The question remains: what did CLR do to upset the LME so much? In the agreed statement CLR apologised for its involvement 'in the development of the situation in the copper market' and added, 'CLR accepts that that situation could have been interpreted as involving an undue influence over the market but CLR took no action because it was satisfied no such undue influence was or would be exercised'. So was it simply a simple case of human error, misunderstandings and crossed wires? This is hard to believe because, although CLR became a ring-dealing member of the LME as recently as January this year, the Rouse organisation has a long history in commodity markets. However, traders recall that during the squeeze CLR was giving the copper market some liquidity by lending to the market and it maybe CLR believed that was enough to prevent an 'undesirable' situation developing. The LME executive undoubtedly spent some money investigating what it must have first thought of as a nefarious scheme, but the Pounds 100,000 CLR is contributing towards those costs is undoubtedly generous  - hence traders' view that it was a fine. However, in view of the LME's determination firmly to close the book on this issue, we will probably never know. Mr King said yesterday: 'We worked in close consort with other regulators on this and both they and we are satisfied with the outcome. The matter is now closed.'  ----------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Monday's close) tonnes  ----------------------------------------------------- Aluminium       +12,225    to    2,250,275 Copper           +2,450    to      603,700 Lead             -1,575    to      288,650 Nickel              +54    to      118,494 Zinc             +1,375    to      814,500 Tin                 -95    to       20,570  -----------------------------------------------------</p>

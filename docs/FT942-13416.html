			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / International Company News: Unisys steady despite revenue decline First-quarter revenues at Unisys, the US computer manufacturer, have declined after falls in product sales and its maintenance business, although earnings were in line with expectations. Net income for the first quarter was Dollars 60.0m, or 17 cents a share, fully-diluted, after a charge of Dollars 7.7m for costs associated with repurchase of debt. In the same period last year net, income was Dollars 260.6m, or Dollars 1.06, including a net gain of Dollars 203.8m from accounting changes. Comparable earnings per share, before special items, were 21 cents in the current quarter against 16 cents last year. Total revenues declined to Dollars 1.69bn in the quarter, compared with Dollars 1.91bn. Strong growth in service revenues was more than offset by declines in product sales and maintenance, the company said. Unisys blamed lower revenues for the decline in its operating income. Partially offsetting this fall was a 10.7 per cent cut in total costs and expenses. 'We were pleased with our bottom-line profit achievement in the quarter,' said Mr James Unruh, chairman and chief executive. 'Revenue and orders were expected to decline, but they were weaker than anticipated, particularly in our European and government systems business units.' However, services revenues grew by 11 per cent, and were up even in Europe, Mr Unruh noted. During the quarter, Unisys repurchased debt and paid off its arrears on preferred stock dividends. 'As we move through 1994, we will deal with ongoing structural change in the industry and weakness in demand in some markets by continuing to reduce costs. Our goal for slight revenue growth in 1994, which is dependent on improvement in Europe and Japan in the second half of the year, now is a bigger challenge,' said Mr Unruh.</p>

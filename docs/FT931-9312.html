			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / People: Peter Coster leaves C&amp;G Peter Coster, 59, has resigned as a director of the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society following its decision to merge its specialised centralised lending operation into the rest of its business. Coster, who had been an assistant general manager of Scottish Life, joined C&amp;G in 1989 following its takeover of the Guardian Building Society. He was chief executive of C&amp;G Guardian which offered specialist mortgage products through life offices and as recently as May it had moved into a new headquarters in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, which had been designed to cater for considerable expansion. However, the downturn in the UK housing market has led to a scaling back of C&amp;G's ambitions in this area and it has closed C&amp;G Guardian's Potter's Bar headquarters and put it up for sale. Around 80 staff have lost their jobs.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] State President Liamine Zeroual received today  at his office Salim Salih Muhammad, special envoy of 'Ali Salim  al-Bid. The meeting was attended by Mihoub Mihoubi, adviser in  charge of diplomatic affairs and the president's official  spokesman. Upon leaving the state president's office the Yemeni  envoy made the following statement:    [Begin Salim Salih Muhammad recording] We explained to his  excellency the brother president the latest developments in the  situation in Yemen and the current war, which was started by  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih on 27 April, when he declared war  on the southern regions. Eight weeks have passed but fierce  fighting is still going on causing huge human and material  losses. [passage omitted]    We are calling on the Arab brothers, and Algeria in  particular given its place in our hearts as well as its  experience, to play a role and help us to secure an immediate  cease-fire so as to stop the bloodshed and save those Yemenis  who are still alive and the installations which are still  standing. We are also urging them to recognize the situation  before unification which has failed in its four years to achieve  the amalgamation of two systems, two armies, two state  institutions, two currencies, etc. We want a return to the  situation before 22 May 1990. This is our stand. And we are  now defending our right and the right of our children to life  and to the protection of our property which is being destroyed  day in and day out. [passage omitted]    We are, therefore, urging all our brothers in the Arab  Maghreb or in the Arab Mashriq to stop this war through the  implementation of the UN Security Council resolution and resolve  this problem wisely through dialogue and dialogue alone.

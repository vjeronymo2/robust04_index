			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Tokyo takes stock The last time international investors took a shine to Japanese equities  - towards the end of 1991 - the results were anything but pleasing, as the market continued to slide. Two years on, foreign institutions are prepared to give Tokyo another shot. The 17 per cent rise in the Nikkei average from the depths plumbed in November has been fuelled by overseas buying. Taking profits in over-heated Asian markets such as Hong Kong or Malaysia and reinvesting in Tokyo is a common strategy. Measured against bond yields hovering around 3 per cent the Nikkei hardly looks stretched. But investing in Japanese equities is an act of faith. Even if Mr Morihiro Hosokawa's coalition can push political reform through parliament this week, there is no guarantee it will be able to agree an economic package of stature. Three rounds of fiscal stimulus have failed to kick-start the economy. A more imaginative approach, probably including personal tax cuts, is required. With Mr Hosokawa due to meet President Clinton in Washington next month, failure to deliver a stimulus would create friction over Japan's trade surplus. The gentle depreciation of the yen against the dollar, from Y101 last August to Y111 yesterday, has brought relief for Japanese exporters. The stock market has been led higher by the big consumer electronics companies, which points to selective buying of exporters. Unless Japan acts to stimulate domestic demand, though, the US may again be tempted to talk the yen up as a way of tackling trade.</p>

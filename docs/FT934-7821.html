			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Nationwide buys Pounds 24m mortgages Nationwide, the UK's second largest building society, said yesterday that it had bought the National Bank of Canada's mortgage book. Purchase of the mortgage portfolio, worth Pounds 24.1m, marks the bank's departure from the UK mortgage business, which it entered in 1988. Neither the bank nor the Nationwide would reveal the price that had been paid. The portfolio will be managed by Nationwide Home Loans, a wholly owned subsidiary of the building society, bringing its assets to Pounds 147m. The society itself has assets of over Pounds 34bn. National Bank of Canada said that it had sold the mortgage book because its core business was in treasury and corporate matters rather than on the retail side. In August, the bank reported a strong recovery for the third quarter and nine months.</p>

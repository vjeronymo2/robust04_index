			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Royal Dutch/Shell profits depressed by fall in oil prices ROYAL Dutch/Shell Group's earnings from exploration and production were depressed by the decline in the oil price last year. For the full year profits from exploration and production fell by Pounds 384m to Pounds 1.44bn. The company said it expected its oil production to continue to rise this year, following last year's increase of 10 per cent. Growth areas were cited as the UK, Gabon, Syria, Malaysia and Colombia. Gas production rose last year by 8 per cent to 6.56bn cu ft a day. The group expects sales to increase this year in the UK, Denmark, Malaysia and Australia. Royal Dutch/Shell experienced a record year in its refining and marketing operations where replacement cost profits rose by more than 40 per cent to Pounds 1.62bn from Pounds 1.15bn. Oil product sales increased by 2 per cent over the year and the amount of oil refined rose by 5 per cent to 3.6m barrels a day (b/d) - the highest for more than a decade. Sir Peter Holmes, Shell's chairman, said this year's outlook for the refining business continues to be good since capacity in the Far East market remained tight. But analysts doubt that 1991's performance can be repeated without the special circumstances of the Gulf war, which caused a large jump in refining margins. The results were hit by the drop in the contribution from its chemicals division, where profits slipped to Pounds 23m for the year from Pounds 519m in 1990, while the group's coal operations incurred a loss of Pounds 33m. Earnings per share for the year dropped from 39.6p to 24.9p. The group's capital expenditure rose to Pounds 6.5bn, up from Pounds 5.9bn in 1990, and Sir Peter said the company would spend another Pounds 6.5bn this year. The fourth quarter showed a sharp drop in group income on a replacement cost basis from Pounds 963m to Pounds 492m following a decline in the oil price and a loss in the chemicals business.</p>

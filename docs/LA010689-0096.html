			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STADIUM BACKS OFF ON SMOKING BAN  </P> <P> After listening to pleas from paid tobacco industry lobbyists and smokers  Thursday, the San Diego Stadium Authority backed off on a proposed smoking ban  in all stadium seating areas in favor of merely asking smokers to be respectful  of nonsmokers.  </P> <P> As part of a compromise, a sign will be erected on the Jack Murphy Stadium  scoreboard that will read: "The Stadium Authority requests if you smoke please  be considerate of your neighbor."  </P> <P> The wording was worked out in committee meetings with officials of the San  Diego Chargers and Padres, primary stadium tenants.  </P></p>

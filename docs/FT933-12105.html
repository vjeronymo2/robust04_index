			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / International Company News: Shortfall at Quantum deepens in quarter QUANTUM, the US chemicals group which has agreed a Dollars 3.2bn bid from Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, reported a second-quarter loss, before income tax benefit, of Dollars 84.2m compared with a loss of Dollars 68.3m for the same quarter last year. The results were worse than expected. Turnover fell from Dollars 542m to Dollars 527m. Petrochemicals sales fell from Dollars 425m to Dollars 407m and generated a trading loss of Dollars 5.5m compared with an operating profit for the same quarter last year of Dollars 10.6m. The group, the largest US manufacturer of polyethylene, said that sales of the product were flat, and that average selling prices were lower than last year, particularly for high density polyethylene. The weak state of the European economies also affected volumes, selling prices and profit margins for the group's other main products. The company said margins were further weakened by the higher cost of ethylene, the principle component for most plastics, and the temporary closure of the group's ethylene facility in Morris, Illinois. The propane operations, the second largest in the US, increased sales from Dollars 117m to Dollars 120m. Operating profits were Dollars 2.2m compared with a quarterly loss last year of Dollars 5.3m.</p>

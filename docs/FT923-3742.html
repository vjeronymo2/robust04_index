			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Italian tax move will lift funding costs for agencies FUNDING costs for supranational agencies such as the World Bank and the European Investment Bank are set to rise sharply, following a decision yesterday by the Italian government to remove their tax exempt status for Italian residents. Until now, Italian residents holding Eurobonds issued by agencies of which Italy is a member have been exempted from paying 12 1/2 per cent withholding tax. The abolition of this exemption has been expected since early this year. The lifting of the tax-exemption is not retroactive, so the decision should have limited impact on World Bank and EIB bonds trading in the secondary market. Eurobonds issued by Italy, and government-backed borrowers such as Ferrovie will maintain their tax-exempt status. The World Bank and the European Investment Bank are likely to see their funding costs in certain markets rise dramatically. While in some sectors, such as the Eurodollar bond market, the broad distribution of their paper will limit their impact, their access to extremely cheap, opportunistic funding in more obscure markets will be severely curtailed. For example, the EIB yesterday launched a Pta10bn issue of floating-rate notes paying interest at  5/8 point below the London interbank offered rate. Such a pricing would be simply 'out of the question' without the tax-exempt status in Italy', one banker said. 'It may certainly put up the price of new issues,' said Mr Tom Hackett of the European Investment Bank after the announcement. Floating rate note issues were likely to be most affected, he added, though he said that it was impossible to assess the full impact until the details of the changes had been studied. The EIB has been raising Ecu1.2bn to Ecu1.3bn a month so far this year, and expected to continue its borrowing programme at the same rate. Yesterday's news puts into question the planned launch today of a Y50bn issue from the EIB. 'We will take advise from our lead managers on how we proceed,' Mr Hackett said. The World Bank, meanwhile, said that the tax change would have only a limited impact on its borrowing programme. Ms Jessica Einhorn, treasurer, said that the bank had been aware of the likely move for some time. 'We have for that reason structured a borrowing programme that explicitly sought not to become too dependent on those types of borrowing.' She acknowledged, though, that the change would have an effect 'at the margin'.</p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Food and Drink For Christmas: Bubbly competition winners WEEKEND FT readers revealed an extraordinary fondness for puns, anagrams and acronyms in a competition I set last month to find an acceptable colloquial name for bottle-fermented sparkling wine that is not made in Champagne, writes Jancis Robinson. Of the hundreds of suggestions, most were inspired by the forbidden appellation, as in Shampagne, the choice of many but, surely, too perjorative. There was Champ, Pagnecham, Chamagne, withChamps, Sparklagne, and, perhaps most onomatopoeically appealing, Chamcham. Pascham, like many of the entries, depended on a fair knowledge of French, although the Scotswoman who suggested it was keen to say that the name incorporated 'more than a hint of passion' (she also asked us not to print her address as: 'We'd rather not have any uninvited visitors after the prize'.) Another opinionated suggestion came from Cambridge, but again was pejorative: 'May I suggest that for something essentially bubbly and frothy a suitable name would be 'Fergie'. This has the further advantage that it suggests it is not quite the real thing'. The phrase Vin Deux Fois suggested a full grasp of production techniques, as did Bib (for Bubbled in Bottle). Notch (short for Not Champagne) suggested by a Belgian diplomat based in Muscadet country also had its attractions. But the six bottles of Green Point 1990 donated by Mot &amp; Chandon go to a reader with an indecipherable signature and the post code BN7 3PF near Lewes, east Sussex, for Trad, a shortened form of the official 'Methode Traditionnelle' description to be found increasingly on labels. He or she pointed out that it could be used as in 'non-vintage trad' and, in this case, jolly good 'Australian trad'. The name may not fizz on the tongue, but its credentials sound impeccably solid.</p>

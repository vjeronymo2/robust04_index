W. de  Klerk said he was working on an "Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP]  initiative" which might signify a breakthrough in the  constitutional deadlock and the IFP's non-participation in the  April election.    Mr de Klerk did not elaborate on what the initiative  entailed, but said it raised a "slight hope", adding the  negotiation remains the responsible route. The IFP missed the  final deadline to submit its candidates list on Wednesday [16  March].    Mr de Klerk made these remarks at a breakfast meeting on the  second of election tour through the PWV [Pretoria,  Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region.    Mr de Klerk told businessmen attending the breakfast that  the IFP's abstenance was a "dark cloud", but there was "a crack  of light ahead". He assured his audience that they had nothing  to fear under a new dispensation.    Mr de Klerk commended the issuing of a pamhlet in kwaZulu,  which assured kwaZulu government employees the non-participation  of the IFP would not affect their "career or pension security".    He said kwaZulu government employees would become part of  the  integration process, when the civil service of the kwaZulu/Natal  province is structured.</p>

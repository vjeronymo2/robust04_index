			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Definitions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As used in this section, the following definitions apply:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Consolidation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The combining of two or more debt instruments into one instrument, normally accompanied by reamortization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Debt writedown.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A one-time reduction of the debt owed to FmHA including principal and interest. This reduction will be the minimum amount necessary to meet the level of the facility's ability to service the debt. The writedown will be applied first to interest and then principal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Delinquency due to circumstances beyond the control of the debtor.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Includes situations such as: The debtor has less money than planned due to unexpected and uncontrollable events such as unexpected loss of service area population, unforeseeable costs incurred for compliance with State or Federal regulatory requirements, or the loss of key personnel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Delinquent debtor.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of this section, delinquency is defined as being 180 days behind schedule on the FmHA payments. That is, one full annual installment or the equivalent for monthly, quarterly, or semiannual installments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eligibility.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants must be delinquent due to circumstances beyond their control and have acted in good faith by trying to fulfill the agreements with FmHA in connection with the delinquent loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Interest rate reduction.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Reduction of the interest rate on the restructured loan to as low as the poverty line interest rate in effect on community and business programs loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Loan deferral.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The temporary delay of principal and interest payments for up to 6 months. The debtor must be able to demonstrate the ability to pay the debt, as restructured, at the end of this delay period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Net recovery value.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A calculation of the net value of the collateral and other assets held by the debtor. This value would be determined by adding the fair market value of FmHA's interest in any real property pledged as collateral for the loan, plus the value of any other assets pledged or otherwise available for the repayment of the debt, minus the anticipated administrative and legal expenses that would be incurred in connection with the liquidation of the loan. This value of the assets should be calculated based upon the facility continuing to operate as a going concern. Therefore, the facility should be valued not merely as an empty building but as a facility continuing to offer health care services which may, or may not, be similar to those offered by the current operators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Operations review.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A study of management and business operations of the facility by an independent expert. For example, a study of a hospital and nursing home would include such areas as: general and administrative, dietary, housekeeping, laundry, nursing, physical plant, social services, income potential, Federal, State, and insurance payments, and rate analysis. Also, recommendations and conclusions are to be included in the study which would indicate the creditworthiness of the facility and its ability to continue as a going concern. In analyzing a debtor's proposed restructuring plan, FmHA may contract for the completion of an operations review. These reviews will be developed by individuals and entities who have demonstrated an expertise in the analysis of health care facilities from an operational and administrative standpoint. FmHA will consider the following criteria for selection: past experience in health care facility analysis, a familiarity with the problems of rural health care facilities, a knowledge of the particular area currently served by the facility in question, and a willingness to work with both FmHA and the debtor in developing a final plan for restructuring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Restructured loan.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A revision of the debt instruments including any combination of the following: writing down of accumulated interest charges and principal, deferral, consolidation, and adjustment of the interest rates and terms, usually followed by reamortization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Debtor notification.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All servicing actions permitted under subpart E of part 1951 of this chapter are to be exhausted prior to consideration for debt restructuring under this section. To this end, the servicing official must ensure that the casefile clearly documents that all servicing actions under subpart E of part 1951 of this chapter have been exhausted and that the debtor is at least 1 full year's debt service behind schedule for a minimum of 180 days. The debtor then should be informed of the debt restructuring available under this section by using language similar to that provided in Guide 1 of this subpart (available in any FmHA Office) as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Any introductory paragraph;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A paragraph concerning prior servicing attempts;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A discussion of eligibility, as defined in this section, including the provision that the debtor acted in good faith in connection with their FmHA loan and that the delinquency was caused by circumstances beyond their control;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Two paragraphs that explain the goal of the debt restructuring program;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) A paragraph stating that debt restructuring may include a combination of servicing actions listed in paragraph (a) of this section;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Information that details what the debtor must do to apply for restructuring. A response must be received within 45 days of receipt of this letter to request consideration for debt restructuring and the request must include projected balance sheets, budgets, and cash-flow statements which include and clearly identify funding of the FmHA reserve account for the next 3 years;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) A discussion of FmHA's analysis and calculation process; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) A paragraph identifying the FmHA official who may be contacted for assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> State Director's restructuring determination.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Upon receipt of the delinquent debtor's request for debt restructuring consideration, the State Director will:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Within 15 days of receipt of debtor's request, if an operations review is deemed necessary, send a memorandum to the Administrator asking for program authority to contract for the review in accordance with Exhibit D of FmHA Instruction 2024&hyph;A (available in any FmHA Office). The name of the debtor involved and the projected amount of funds anticipated to be spent for the contract should also be provided. It is anticipated that an operations review will be necessary in most cases and that the only exceptions would be for smaller health care facilities or facilities that have developed a proposed plan that is comprehensive and realistic. Upon receipt of the Administrator's program contracting approval authority, a contract is to be awarded to an organization qualified to perform an operations review as defined in paragraph (a) of this section. The operations review normally will be completed and delivered to FmHA within 60 days of the award date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Contract for an appraisal to be performed by an independent, qualified fee appraiser. Note: To the extent possible, the appraisal should be scheduled for completion no later than the completion date of the operations review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Complete an analysis of the operations review, appraisal, and other documented information, and make an eligibility determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Eligibility determination. The State Director must conclude that the debtor is eligible for debt restructuring consideration. This conclusion will be clearly documented in the casefile based on a review of the following: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>SUMMARY                              President Boris Yeltsin has broken up the Ministry of Security  -the successor to the old KGB--and reduced the remaining parts to  several "services" directly under presidential control,  presumably reducing their ability to act independently of or  contrary to the president in future crises.  The splintered  security services have been placed under the supervision of a  young presidential assistant with a strong reformist background  and no previous ties with security, Yuriy Baturin, who thus  becomes a key figure in Yeltsin's team.                          END SUMMARY     In a 21 December edict declaring the "Cheka-OGPU-NKVD-NKGB-MGB  KGB-MB organs unreformable" and the reorganizations of the KGB in  recent years only "cosmetic," Yeltsin abolished the Ministry of  Security and created a smaller Federal Counterintelligence  Service (Federalnaya Sluzhba Kontrrazvedki) of the Russian  Federation (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 24 December 1993).  He explained  in a 22 December news conference that he was disbanding the KGB-  -"the last bulwark of the former Soviet totalitarian system"--and  that police surveillance of the people will now end and only the  counterintelligence functions of the old organization will remain  (Ostankino TV, 22 December 1993).     Sergey Stepashin (see box), whom Yeltsin appointed as the first  deputy head of the new service, also portrayed the move as a  drastic change, saying the new service will include only 75,000  employees, 46 percent less than the Ministry of Security (Radio  Rossii, 5 january).  At a 10 january news conference, Stepashin  stated flatly that the new service will not resemble the old  ministry and "all prerequisites for the revival of political  surveillance have been destroyed."  The service, according to  Stepashin, will deal only with operations by foreign intelligence  services, terrorism, and imports of drugs and weapons, and has  transferred its Investigations Directorate to the prosecutor's  office and its Lefortovo prison to the Ministry of Internal  Affairs (Krasnaya Zvezda, 11 january).  Articles in the 11  January Komsomolskaya Pravda and Pravda based on Stepashin's 10  January news conference added that some Ministry of Security  units have been shif ted to the Federal Agency for Government  Communications and Information and anti-crime units switched to  the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  In a 12 january Rossiyskaya  Gazeta interview, Stepashin said some ministry directorates will  be disbanded but the Directorates for Counterintelligence  Operations, for Counterintelligence Supply for Strategic  Installations, for Military Counterintelligence, for Economic  Counterintelligence, and for Combatting Terrorism will be  maintained with virtually no staff cuts.     Golushko Retained     The reorganization may not be as drastic as Yeltsin and Stepashin  indicate, however, since it was entrusted to Minister of Security  and longtime KGB official Nikolay Golushko.  In a 29 December  Izvestiya interview, Golushko, who was named director of the new  service and ordered to prepare a statute outlining the structure  and powers of the new service, spoke of only a 30 percent staff  reduction and expressed disapproval of the edict's "harsh"  evaluation of the ministry.  When asked how many of the  ministry's non-counterintelligence directorates will be  abolished, Golushko hinted that there may be little change in the  existing structure, replying that "virtually all of our  subdivisions" had worked on counterintelligence.  Yeltsin  reportedly signed Golushko's statute on the new service on 5  January.  The newspaper Segodnya, citing "sources close to  presidential quarters," reported that the statute kept "the very  same structure" as the ministry, minus the Investigation  Directorate and one other directorate and made no change in the  "fundamental nature" of the old ministry (Segodnya, 6 january).     Although Golushko was allowed to retain the rank of minister when  appointed director of the new service, the edict indicated that  he will be subordinate directly to the office of the president  (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 24 December 1993), rather than to Premier  Viktor Chernomyrdin as part of the cabinet.  A 10 january ITAR-  TASS report declared that the Ministry of Security had been  subordinated to both the cabinet and the president, but the new  service will be subordinated only to the president.  Granting  Golushko ministerial rank may have been a reward for his  cooperation in dissolving his ministry, as, no doubt, was  Yeltsin's promotion of 27 Ministry of Security officers to  general on the eve of the 21 December edict, which was reported  by the 29 December Izvestiya.  Other "service" chiefs do not hold  ministerial rank, according to Yeltsin's 30 September 1992 edict  "On the System of Central Organs of Federal Executive Power"  (Vedomosti Syezda Narodnykh Deputatov Rossiyskoy Federatsii i  Verkhovnogo Soveta Rossiyskoy Federatsii, 15 October 1992, pages  2936-7).  (See Note 1)     (Note 1)  There are a variety of other "services" (sluzhby) in  the government, some directly under the president, some not, but  all clearly outside the cabinet.  These include the Federal Tax  Service, Federal Service for Foreign Currency and Export Control,  the State Archive Service, the Federal Service of Geodesy and  Cartography, the Federal Service of Forestry, and the Federal  Service for Hydrometeorology and Monitoring the Environment.  Another was added on 22 December, when a Yeltsin edict formed the  Federal Service for Television and Radio Broadcasting as a  central organ of federal power to replace the Ministry of Press  and Information (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 24 December 1993).     The new counterintelligence service apparently is intended to  parallel the Foreign Intelligence Service, which also is directly  under the office of the president.  The Federal Foreign  Intelligence Service (Federalnaya Sluzhba Vneshney Razvedki  Rossii) had been listed as one of the "central organs of federal  executive power" in a 30 September 1992 Yeltsin edict (Vedomosti,  15 October 1992, page 2940) but only days later was dropped from  this category and made "directly subordinate to the president,"  apparently a reduction in status, by a 7 October 1992 edict  (Vedomosti, 15 October 1992, page 2964).  Foreign intelligence  service director Yevgeniy Primakov, like the minister of  security, was designated a Security Council member in a 20  October 1993 decree defining the Security Council's membership  (Sobraniye Aktov Prezidenta i Pravitelstva Rossiyskoy Federatsii,  25 October 1993, pages 4479-80), suggesting that Golushko may  continue on the Security Council in his new capacity.     Breakup of Old KGB Elements     With the creation of the counterintelligence service, there now  appear to be five agencies that have emerged from the old KGB,  and all apparently are now directly under the office of the  president.     --The foreign intelligence part was taken out of the KGB on 18  December 1991--after the August coup and the collapse of the  USSR--and made into the Federal Foreign Intelligence Service of  the Russian Federation, according to the service's press  secretary Tatyana Samolis (Interfax, 22 December 1993, Segodnya,  24 December 1993).  Primakov, who had been named first deputy  USSR KGB chairman and head of the foreign intelligence service  part of the USSR KGB in September 1991 (TASS, 30 September 1991),  was made director of the new Russian foreign intelligence service  on 26 December 1991 (Vedomosti, 2 january 1992, page 42).  "Federal" was later dropped from the service's title, and  Yeltsin's 10 january 1994 edict "On the Structure of Federal  Organs of Executive Power" listed it as the "Foreign Intelligence  Service of the Russian Federation" (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 12  january).     --About the same time--on 24 December 1991--some KGB  communications units were split off and formed into a Federal  Agency for Government Communications and Information under the  president (Vedomosti, 2 january 1992, page 38).  Former KGB  General Aleksandr Starovoytov was appointed to head the agency  (Segodnya, 30 july 1993).  The KGB's complete control of the  information flow to USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev and the ease  with which the KGB had cut off Gorbachev's communications in  August 1991 made clear the need to make communications  independent of the KGB, according to a 5 March 1992 Rossiyskaya  Gazeta article.  Yeltsin used his control over this agency in his  21 September move against the parliament.  Immediately after he  announced the legislature's dissolution, Yeltsin ordered  Starovoytov to cut off all parliament's communications  (Kommersant-Daily, 22 September 1993).     --On 17 December 1993 it was reported that Yeltsin had combined  the Ministry of Security's subdivision for protection of the  Kremlin and the leadership--the old KGB's 9th Directorate--with  his presidential guard to form a new federal "presidential  security service" to provide security for the president (Radio  Rossii, 17 December 1993).  The service was placed under Major  General Aleksandr Korzhakov, the longtime head of Yeltsin's  personal guards (nachalnik lichnoy okhrany prezidenta).  Korzhakov had met Yeltsin when the KGB 9th Directorate formed a  guard for then new Politburo candidate member Yeltsin in 1986,  and Yeltsin and Korzhakov became friends (Moskovskaya Pravda, 4  July 1992).  Although reportedly signed in November, the  presidential edict on this new service has not appeared among the  November edicts published in the Sobraniye and so the new  service's exact title and status are not yet clear.  However,  Izvestiya on 11 january gave its title as the "Directorate for  Protection of the President" (Upravleniye 0khrany Prezidenta) and  Yeltsin's 10 january edict on government structure listed it as  the "Main Directorate for Protection of the Russian Federation"  (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 12 january).     --On 30 December a Yeltsin edict formed the Federal Border  Service-Central Command of Russian border troops from the border  guards administration of the Ministry of Security.  It is to have  "status equivalent to that of a federal ministry and to operate  in direct subordination to the Russian president and government"  (ITAR-TASS, 30 December 1993), apparently giving it status  similar to the new counterintelligence service.  Yeltsin's 10  January 1994 edict on government structure specified that this  service is under the president (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 12 january).  Col. Gen. Andrey Nikolayev was named commander of the border  troops (ITAR-TASS, 30 December 1993) and, according to the 11  january Izvestiya, chief of the Federal Border Service  (Federalnaya Pogranichnaya Sluzhba).     Baturin's Appointment     Yuriy Baturin, appointed national security assistant  (pomoshchnik) to the president by Yeltsin on 6 january (Ostankino  TV, ITAR-TASS, 6 january), will play a major role in supervising  and coordinating the work of the security services.  The 44-year  old Baturin told Interfax that Yeltsin had suddenly phoned him  and told him he needed a "national security aide" and asked him  to take the job.  Baturin said he would be coordinating the  activities of security services and everyday decisions "which  must not encumber the president" and that this function  encompassed the counterintelligence, foreign intelligence, border  guards, and government communications services.  He said that  foreign intelligence head Primakov will report to the president  weekly but he (Baturin) would also brief Yeltsin on intelligence  matters.  He said "the president entrusts his national security  aide with making a decision jointly with the chiefs of these  services" (Interfax, 7 january).     Baturin is a recent addition to Yeltsin's staff and has been an  outspoken reformer and more independent-minded than Yeltsin's  other assistants. (See Note 2)  A protege of reformer Georgiy  Shakhnazarov, Baturin was one of the authors of the liberal Law  on the Press adopted in 1990.  He joined Yeltsin's Presidential  Council on 17 March 1993 and became notable for expressing  independent ideas often at odds with Yeltsin's other aides.  When  offered a post as presidential assistant in late April, Baturin  reportedly accepted on condition he could continue to speak out  publicly (Novaya Yezhednevnaya Gazeta, 7 july 1993).  He has  often appeared on the controversial television program Itogi  (Argumenty i Fakty, No. 33, August 1993).     (Note 2)  Yeltsin's other assistants have been with him longer  and stay out of the spotlight.  Viktor Ilyushin, "first assistant  to the president," has been with Yeltsin since 1977 in  Sverdlovsk, while Lev Sukhanov has been with him since his days  in the State Committee for Construction Affairs, where Yeltsin  went after he was fired as Moscow party chief in late 1987  (Moskovskiye Novosti, 8 August 1993).  Dmitriy Ryurikov, a career  diplomat, Iran scholar, and former head of the foreign ministry's  Middle East department, joined Yeltsin's staff in August 1991  (Moskovskiye Novosti, 8 August 1993).  Anatoliy Korabelshchikov,  appointed assistant to the president on 20 july 1991 (Vedomosti,  1 August 1991, page 1323), is responsible for ties to the cabinet  (Argumenty i Fakty, No. 33, August 1993).     His job was apparently to offer advice to Yeltsin on legal and  political matters, and Baturin himself titled his post assistant  "for legal affairs" (Izvestiya, 11 january).  He explained that  his function was not to draft edicts but to caution the president  if draft edicts are legally objectionable (Novaya Yezhednevnaya  Gazeta, 7 july 1993).  Suggesting that Yeltsin places  considerable trust in him, Baturin, according to the 25 September  Moskovskiy Komsomolets and Izvestiya, had a hand in drafting  Yeltsin's 21 September edict dissolving parliament.  He also  participated in preparing the statute on the new  counterintelligence service in late December, according to his  statements in an 11 january Nezavisimaya Gazeta interview.     Since his appointment as assistant to Yeltsin, Baturin has  remained outspoken and has even publicly criticized some of  Yeltsin's acts.  He recently criticized Yeltsin's edicts creating  a Federal Service for Television and Radio Broadcasting and a  Federal Committee for the Press for increasing state control over  the media.  He claimed that normally as a presidential assistant  he has an opportunity to influence edicts, but that these media  edicts were worked out by Yeltsin, Chernomyrdin, and First Deputy  Premier Vladimir Shumeyko, and he only saw them after the three  leaders had agreed upon them (Izvestiya, 29 December 1993).     Implications     By reorganizing the Ministry of Security, Yeltsin appears to be  making a concerted effort to finally break the political power of  the old Cheka-KGB and ensure that security functions are firmly  under presidential control.  The breakup, however, may not  eliminate all domestic intelligence functions, since Yeltsin  himself may find it worthwhile to quietly maintain some of these  activities to aid him against his foes.  By subordinating the new  security services to the presidential assistant for national  security and appointing to that post someone with no experience  as a security official, Yeltsin also seems to be signalling a  dimunition in the services' status and a less sympathetic  approach to their interests.  Yeltsin's appointment of Baturin  appears to make him one of the most powerful figures in the  presidential staff and a key player in the security field, along  with Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, Internal Affairs Minister  Viktor Yerin, and Security Council Secretary Oleg Lobov.     box                          KGB Reformer Stepashin     The 41-year old Stepashin, although a veteran of 22 years in the  Ministry of Internal Affairs, has long been an advocate of  reforming the KGB.  As chairman of the RSFSR Supreme Soviet's  Security Committee in early 1991, he insisted on removal of  communist party influence from the KGB (Radio Rossii, 6 May 1991;  Russian TV, 15 May 1991).  He was appointed by USSR President  Mikhail Gorbachev to investigate the role of the KGB in the  August 1991 coup and to formulate proposals for reforming the  security services (TASS, 28 August 1991).  He was appointed  deputy minister of a reorganized RSFSR KGB by Yeltsin in November  1991 and served in this post until October 1992 (Rossiyskaya  Gazeta, 13 October 1992).  For more detail, see the Trends of 22  May 1991, pages 13-15; and 11 December 1991, pages 17-23.     end box  (AUTHOR:  HAHN.

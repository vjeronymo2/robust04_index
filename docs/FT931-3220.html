			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities little changed by the close LONDON'S equity market made a cautious response to the Budget speech, which was still in progress at the official close of share trading last night. Initially, equities followed the government bond sector in turning down sharply when Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, disclosed a substantially higher estimate of Public Sector Borrowing Requirement for 1993/94 than the City expected. There was concern that the implications for UK pension funds of the changes in dividend tax credits might force an overall rerating of the equity market. Also disappointing was the chancellor's apparent coolness on prospects for a further cut in domestic base rates at present. Later last night some strategists predicted a setback in equities. However, UK share prices rallied before the close of trading yesterday as the market took aboard the wider range of Budget taxation proposals and the FT-SE 100 Index ended the session only 3.1 down at 2,919.3. Among the measures welcomed by the stock market were the chancellor's reduction in North Sea Petroleum Revenue Tax, which brought strong rises in the oil sector in late dealings. But some analysts feared that other energy industry stocks could be hurt by the proposal to impose VAT taxes on domestic fuel bills. Higher taxes on motor fuels, tobacco, betting and beer had been largely expected, but the absence of any increase on spirits duty was well received. Some traders felt that the chancellor had been discouraging on prospects for an immediate reduction in domestic interest rates. The lowering of the tax rate relief on mortgages had been foreseen and there was little reaction. Equities were drifting lower in virtually stagnant trading conditions when Mr Lamont stood up in the House of Commons. The PSBR statement brought a swift widening in the loss on the FT-SE 100 Index from around 2 points to 14.1, for a reading of 2,908.3. The recovery in shares came equally quickly but there was very little trading as the market trend changed direction. Seaq trading volume for the day fell to 492m shares. Unwillingness to take positions in the blue chips was indicated by a sharp increase in the percentage of non-Footsie shares to 85 per cent of the overall volume figure. On Monday, Seaq volume of 578.1m shares had a retail value of Pounds 1.20bn. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which reflects business in a range of non-Footsie stocks, gained ground during the chancellor's speech to close 6.9 ahead at 3,118.9. Strategy meetings at London's securities firms last night planned for the opening of the market today. At Strauss Turnbull, Mr Ian Harnett said: 'We do not think this Budget will be particularly positive for equities, unless there is an interest rate cut.' Further gains in the North Sea stocks are expected, however. UK traders will also brace themselves ahead of tomorrow's policy meeting at the Bundesbank, when some strategists expect the reduction in key interest rates foreshadowed by the Bundesbank's recent cuts in money market repurchase rates. On Friday, the UK retail price index for last month will be disclosed and this may yet set the stage for a cut in UK base rates.</p>

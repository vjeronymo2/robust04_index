			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Rhone-Alpes (10): Innovating is a tradition - Grenoble buzzes with technology research GRENOBLE'S post-war transformation from obscure little French industrial town to France's biggest technology research centre outside Paris is part accident, part industrial planning by an active local government. Its high-tech image was ruffled a few weeks ago with the publication of a parliamentary report claiming that Grenoble might be unwitting host to a Mafia network. This has provoked a firm denial from Mr Alain Carignon, the town's RPR mayor and it promises to be a strong local theme in the run-up to next month's parliamentary elections, in which Mr Carignon is planning a return to national politics. Underneath the pre-election alarms and excitements, Grenoble has reason to be content with its lot. At the end of the last war, Grenoble was 'a really mediocre, dull little town, even a national joke,' explains Mr Joele de Leiris, deputy mayor and university professor. 'On average, we have had one new big science establishment coming to Grenoble every 10 years. Today, people tell us we have too many. I can't agree,' he adds. Today, Grenoble and the Isere departement of which it is the capital is host to 250 laboratories and 8,500 researchers. It produces economic growth well above the national average and has lower than average unemployment. It is a fertile ground for a number of high prestige European technology projects and electronic company investments, around which have sprung a vigorous community of small high technology companies. Isere produced 1,433 new companies in 1990 - the first year of the economic slowdown, when unemployment stood at just at 8 per cent against a national norm now two points higher. Many of the start-up businesses founded by local executives, or spun off from the research departments of Grenoble's four universities, have quickly died. 'Too many of them have a product, but nothing else,' mourns Mr de Leiris. But others have flourished, such as Cap Gemini Sogeti, founded nearly 20 years ago in Grenoble by Serge Kampf and now Europe's largest computer services company. On a more modest scale, there are a flock of smaller successful start-ups such as Atral, an alarm systems maker founded nine years ago by two former executives of Merlin Gerin, the local electrical products group. Atral now employs 200 people at Crolles, just outside Grenoble. This solid base of skilled research workers and innovative companies has acted as a magnet for large technology-based groups such as the US group Hewlett Packard, which moved its world microcomputer heaquarters from California to Grenoble two years ago, at the same time as Sun Microsystems opened its international network computing centre there. The latest arrival is Rank Xerox, the office equipment group. These newcomers have helped to offset the job losses made over the past few years by Bull and Thomson, the French state-owned computer and electronics groups, which are both active in Grenoble. The town owes its break with its industrial past in part to the influence of one or two local decision makers - such as Louis Neel, the Nobel prize-winning physicist who was posted there during the war, and the Merlin family, founders of the Merlin Gerin electrical equipment group. They were influential in persuading central government to set up the CNRS national centre for scientific research in Grenoble just after the second world war. This was followed, 10 years later, by the CENG nuclear research centre, and joined, in the mid 1960s, by the Laue Langevin Franco-German neutron laboratory. The latest, scheduled to start operating later this year, is the Synchrotron, the FFr2.2bn particle accelerator owned by 12 European countries which is due to open to users next year. 'Here, within a radius of one or two kilometres, you have leading European laboratories in a whole range of disciplines,' says Mr Yves Petroff, director general. One of the things which made Grenoble attractive was the city's willingness to pay for road access to the Synchrotron. 'Until recently, Paris never gave money to technology. Grenoble has been doing it for years,' says Mr Petroff. This is where the town's tradition of several decades of active industrial and economic planning comes in. The late Mr Hubert Dubedout, the Socialist mayor for 18 years until 1983, and a former nuclear scientist, was another pioneer who used his local government resources to help put Grenoble on the map. He was instrumental in attracting the 1968 winter Olympics - and the infrastructure investment that came with it - as well as launching an ambitious urban development programme, including one of the most efficient public transport systems outside Paris. But perhaps his most important policy was that of encouraging links between scientific research and industry well ahead of other French towns. Grenoble's showcase in this respect is the awkwardly named Zirst, a business park which opened in 1973 on the twin principle that tenants must be vetted by a scientific committee. In return for this, the finance for their buildings is guaranteed by the departmental council. The idea came not from Mr Dubedout, but from the mayor of Meylan, a commune just outside Grenoble; it received full backing from the city. Zirst tenants now include the Cnet, France Telecom's research centre, Merlin Gerin, and Sema, the leading software group. Mr Dubedout's successor at the town hall, the young Gaullist Mr Alain Carignon, has continued in the same tradition. Under his tenure, the city has funded university chairs - normally the domain of central government - merged the area's disparate economic development organisations into a single powerful body, Grenoble Isere Developpement. He also launched the biggest public investment in the city for years: the Europole business centre, next to the railway station (which is now less than three hours from Paris, thanks to the opening of a direct Train a Grande Vitesse (TGV) link last year. The cost of all this activity has been a sharp increase in the city's debt. Grenoble's financial problems, however, are mild by comparison with a city like Angouleme, which has had to reschedule its debts. Mr Carignon's team has trimmed away at Grenoble's borrowings - down to FFr1.45bn last year from FFr1.7bn three years ago - with a programme of privatisations (a growing trend in French local government) and spending controls. Not for the first time, Grenoble is turning to innovative solutions.</p>

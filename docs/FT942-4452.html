			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: Broking tough man rejoins the fray - Richard Waters profiles the new Alexander &amp; Alexander chairman Mr Frank Zarb has been here before - a broking firm with a long and venerable history, but losing ground to competitors and with little control over its costs. And it is part of an industry without a tradition of strong management, where poorly performing firms are quicker to blame market conditions than their own shortcomings. In 1988, it was stockbroking. This week, it is insurance broking. Mr Zarb - once head of the Smith Barney stockbroking firm - emerged late on Tuesday as chairman, chief executive and president of Alexander &amp; Alexander, the US-based insurance broker. For the 59-year-old native of Brooklyn, it will be a challenging end to a long and varied career. Once a senior partner at Lazard Freres in New York, and a former energy adviser to President Gerald Ford, much of Mr Zarb's career has been spent in the stockbroking industry, where he has gained a reputation as a tough operating manager. Hired in 1988 by Mr Sanford Weill, head of Primerica (now renamed Travelers), Mr Zarb was behind a turnround at Smith Barney - though much of the recovery was due to the improvement in the stockbroking market after its post-crash lull in the late 1980s. Investors will be hoping he can work the same magic on Alexander &amp; Alexander. The share price of the insurance broker, the world's second biggest, has languished in recent years, as the company has been battered by a succession of one-off charges, high costs and a weak property/casualty insurance market. Last year, it revealed its consulting business had been overstating its income by failing to allow sufficiently for fees that would not be recovered. The year before, it took a Dollars 145m after-tax charge for liabilities taken on when it acquired the Sphere Drake insurance company during the 1980s. Alexander &amp; Alexander may have come to look accident-prone in recent years, but its troubles can be traced back to the early 1980s, when it first embarked on an international acquisition spree, buying Alexander Howden in the UK and Reed Stenhouse in Canada. 'They grew too fast,' says one person close to the company. 'They developed a certain amount of feudalism: different parts worked in different directions.' One result was a lack of control over costs. The company was also rocked during the 1980s by fraud-related losses at Alexander Howden, the Lloyd's broker. By January, the depth of the problems became clear. Mr Tinsely Irvin was replaced as chairman. At the same time, J. P. Morgan and CS First Boston were hired to find a way of buttressing the company's finances. It slipped into loss in the first quarter, losing Dollars 15m. By the end of March it was in breach of the terms of a banking facility, further limiting its financial flexibility. Options considered in recent months have included an outright sale of the company, the disposal of some of its businesses, and raising additional equity capital. 'Frankly, our goal is to preserve the independence of this fine franchise,' said Mr Robert Boni, who has served as interim chairman since January. 'We strongly believe there are great opportunities here to restore it to its rightful place in the industry.' Help finally came from Mr Maurice Greenburg, a renowned figure in the US property/casualty insurance industry. As head of American International Group (AIG), Mr Greenburg has established a reputation as a highly astute investor. His decision to invest Dollars 200m in A&amp;A already looks well-timed. The terms, which allow AIG to covert its holding into non-voting shares at Dollars 17, were agreed in mid-May, when A&amp;A's share price touched bottom at around Dollars 14. Yesterday, the shares were trading at Dollars 17 1/4 . With the breathing space granted by the AIG investment, what can Mr Zarb do to turn A&amp;A around? It seems a fair bet that cutting operating costs will be high on his list. 'I don't want to be pious,' he says, 'but in financial services businesses, you have to run your business so you do well in bad markets. And if you do that, you're going to do terrific in a good market. That is exactly how we ran Smith Barney.' Mr Boni goes further. 'Too much of the brokerage industry excused itself in the past for its deteriorating margins,' he says. Now, the pressure is on to find better and more efficient ways of conducting business. New technology, better training, re-engineering of processes - all those things will lead to much improved productivity in the industry, he says. And for A&amp;A brokers who fear that they will be harangued endlessly by Mr Zarb for not matching up to Smith Barney, there is hope - the new chairman promises he will refrain from making too many comparisons with the stockbroker he once headed.</p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Observer: Passing the OECD parcel Still no word on the top job at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Jean-Claude Paye, the current incumbent, has to step down at the end of the month and the 25 rich countries who own the Paris-based economic think tank are still no nearer finding a successor. The delay is starting to be embarrassing. It is normal for a new OECD secretary-general to be chosen several months before the handover and with the annual IMF meeting little more than a month away it is far from clear who will be holding the OECD torch. Don Johnstone, former head of Canada's liberal party, is still the frontrunner and the fact that last week Canada finally appointed a new High Commissioner in London ends speculation that the job was being held open for him in case he didn't get the OECD job. However, an informal poll of OECD ambassadors suggests that Johnstone's lead is narrowing despite being supported by the US. Paye is running a close second with the UK's Lord Lawson and Germany's Lorenz Schomerus trailing a long way behind. Paye, like his predecessor Emile Van Lennep, could stay on for another term because OECD members cannot agree on a successor. But if this was going to happen Paye should have had the nod long before now. One intriguing rumour is that if the Americans drop their support for Johnstone, the French would back the US choice for the Nato secretary-general's job. Indeed, Douglas Hurd's name is even being mentioned although it is hard to believe that John Major could afford to lose his foreign secretary at the moment.</p>

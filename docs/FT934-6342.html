			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Tate &amp; Lyle's rise beats forecast Record UK profit and currency gains helped Tate &amp; Lyle to increase annual pre-tax profits by 17.4 per cent to Pounds 222.5m. That was above market expectations, which had been revised downwards in September when the sweeteners company warned of difficult trading conditions in the North American sugar market. The shares gained 9p to 395p. A final dividend of 8.7p is proposed, which would raise the total from 12p to 13p, in line with Tate's policy of a 'progressive' dividend. Mr Neil Shaw, chairman, said the outlook for the current year was encouraging, with productivity gains and improved trading conditions expected. He emphasised that Tate is primarily a processor of agricultural products and is exposed to influences such as the weather, crop sizes and government regulation. The group's main problems in the year were a bumper sugar beet crop in the US, leading to lower prices and government imposed limits on sales, and a glut of potato starch in Europe, hitting prices there. In each case, conditions were expected to improve in 1994. Mr Shaw said he was 'very pleased' by the approval given to the Nafta trade agreement in the US. Tate plans to expand its interests in Mexico, where it has a starch plant. Tate is expanding in many developing countries, where the growth in consumption of its products is concentrated. In central Europe, it has set up a number of joint ventures, although it has yet to earn a normal return on its investment. Tate is now looking to establish joint ventures in China and south-east Asia. Mr Paul Lewis, finance director, said cash-flow had been strong. Net debt fell by Pounds 15m to Pounds 627m, although the weak pound meant the translation of the group's debt, which is largely in US dollars, added Pounds 94m to borrowings. Gearing was 78 per cent at the year end, down from 89 per cent a year earlier, in spite of a Pounds 20m write-down of UK property values. Mr Lewis said with interest cover of 5.7 times, up from 5, and given that it had written off Pounds 500m of goodwill over the years, the group was comfortable with its balance sheet.</p>

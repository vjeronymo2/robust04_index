			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> '91 ALL-STAR GAME GOES TO CHARLOTTE  </P> <P> Citing the success of the Charlotte Hornets, National Basketball Assn.  Commissioner David Stern designated Charlotte as the host of the 1991 All-Star  game.  </P> <P> Stern said Charlotte was picked over three or four other cities that he did not  identify. He said Charlotte's reputation for devoted fan support helped swing  the decision.  </P> <P> "It gets to be somewhat subjective," Stern said. "You have to have spent a  night of watching the fans of the Hornets assault the opposing teams, and see  the kind of support that this area has given their team."  </P> <P> The Hornets led the league in attendance as an expansion team in 1989.  </P></p>

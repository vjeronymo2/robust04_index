			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Letter: Privatise the Treasury too . . . Sir, My wholehearted appreciation of Samuel Brittan's Economic Viewpoint (' 'Advice given to ministers . . .' ', August 12). An independent central bank is certainly essential, but why should we stop there? Let us privatise the Treasury - that surely is the most effective way of achieving accountability, and sweeping away the cobwebs. R F Hassler, 12H Portman Mansions, Chiltern Street, London W1</p>

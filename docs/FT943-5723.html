			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Japan economy theory needs further analysis Sir, Martin Wolf's latest theory (Economic Eye, August 29) that the way to have a successful economy is to run a large trade deficit with Japan would be more convincing if he had analysed the imports of countries like Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia to discover how much of these were semi-manufactures from Japan to be completed with low cost labour and re-exported to the west. As it happens, the situation in Malaysia appeared in your survey (August 30), in which it was reported that typical products have 60 or 70 per cent of the value added in Japan or the US, a balance which the Malaysians are trying to change. What this means is intermediary 'Wolf-successful' countries merely provide cover for a Japanese trade surplus with the west which is even larger than the statistics show. His suggestion that 'sophisticated econometrics does not support the belief that (Japan's) imports are smaller than might reasonably be expected' also needs to be looked at critically, since studies in depth on the ground tell quite a different story, as was demonstrated for the construction industry in 1990. Incidentally, I am disappointed to find that Wolf is not the simple-minded free trader that l had always assumed, but a believer in sophisticated econometrics. This has the great danger of substituting a delight in the process for a hard look at the facts. No doubt he will be telling us next that the Japanese are not Keynesians.

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / People: Having 'a go at the Acas job' John Hougham believes it is the improved industrial relations at Ford of Britain, where he has been head of personnel for the past eight years, that has won him what is probably the top job in British industrial relations - chairman of Acas, the government conciliation service. The job was publicly advertised for the first time and attracted a strong field - including Brenda Dean, the former print union boss, and Mike Bett, deputy chairman of BT. Since there have been fewer big industrial disputes in recent years, the organisation has had a lower profile; and its association with the corporatism of the 1970s has even placed a question mark over its future. But the appointment of a personnel heavyweight like Hougham, who replaces Sir Douglas Smith, the current chairman, on February 19, suggests that Acas's work, especially in the growth area of individual conciliation between employers and employees, continues to be valued. Thanks to the work of Acas only one-third of 1991's 60,000 individual conciliation cases ended up at industrial tribunals. To some people, Hougham was a surprise choice but he comes with praise from both sides of industry. According to Jimmy Airlie, the main car industry official for the AEEU craft union, he is 'tough but shrewd'. Following record losses, Ford is currently in the middle of a big job shedding programme, but Hougham, 55, who is formally retiring from the company, leaving it 30 years to the day after joining it as a graduate trainee in 1963, insists that he is not running away. 'In some ways I regret going now but I think we are on course to come out of this difficult period  -and who in the personnel world would not want a go at the Acas job?' he says. But he is reluctant to describe any new plans he might have for Acas - 'that would be arrogant'. From the perspective of a junior personnel official at Dagenham in the early 1970s he would not have recognised the current calm in British industrial relations. 'The changes are not wholly or even mostly to do with changes in the law, the biggest change is the realisation of the need to compete,' he says. The biggest change he is likely to have to deal with at Acas will be an increased workload from the public sector. He will be paid just over Pounds 60,000, down from the Pounds 80,000-plus earned by Sir Douglas, and less than his undisclosed current salary. 'I'm not doing this to become a wealthy man,' he says. Replacing him as head of personnel at Ford is Bob Hill.</p>

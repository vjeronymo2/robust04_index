Such a  procedure is applicable to individuals who attack U.S. citizens  or property in any part of the world. Disparities between U.S.  and international law in this regard are not seen as  representing an obstacle to this effort.    The Government of the United States branded as terrorism the  Palestinian acts of resistance against occupation. The United  States labeled the PLO "a terrorist organization," a view that  was in keeping with the one held by Israel until the PLO signed  the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. Washington  also prepared a list of "countries sponsoring terror," rattling  it like a sword in the face of countries with whose policies it  disagrees.    The massacre in al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron is a classic  example of a terrorist operation. This is true by the standards  of common sense as well as U.S. and international law. The  massacre was perpetrated by Barukh Goldstein, who remained a  U.S. citizen even after obtaining Israeli nationality, a  practice common among Jewish Americans immigrating to Israel.  This gives us the right to ask for the United States to be  included on the list of "countries sponsoring terror."    Other reasons reinforce this claim. Goldstein hails from  Brooklyn, a hotbed of Jewish fanaticism. Brooklyn is U.S.  territory, as you may know, and Goldstein is not the first  Jewish terrorist that Brooklyn fired like a gun in the face of  the Palestinians in particular and Arab Americans in general.    The U.S. Government allows and even encourages Jewish  Americans to collect financial and material donations and send  them to Israel. Donations collected in the United States go  directly to settlers in the occupied territories, despite a U.S.  policy considering the settlements illegal.    The United States can, therefore, be seen as a state that  sponsors terror. Although indirectly, the United States  encourages Israeli settlers to commit crimes similar to the  Hebron massacre.</p>

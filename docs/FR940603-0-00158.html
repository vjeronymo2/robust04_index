			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;The credit union did not investigate the vendor's or the vendor's company's reputation, financial soundness, or the authority to do business in the state where the credit union operated. In those cases where NCUA liquidated the credit unions, the companies or firms were of the fly-by-night variety, out to obtain quick profits in short periods of time. Dealing with well established and reputable firms is important if problems arise to member complaints. Additionally, in the event of suits against the company or firm, adequate financial standing can often mitigate the credit union's losses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The credit union did not review the programs or products offered to ``its'' new members. In several instances, the policies were life insurance policies or annuity contracts which called for annual premiums (normally paid by installments) over long periods of time_20 to 30 years. While normal for such contracts, they generally called for limited reimbursement in the event of cancellation, for instance 20 percent reimbursement, if canceled before one year, 45 percent, two years, 55 percent, three years, etc. Many members who enrolled in these contracts did not understand the terms. When they subsequently canceled the policy and received only a 20 percent return, they held the credit union responsible. While the credit union had no legal obligation, it presented public relation problems which could have been avoided. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The credit union was unfamiliar with the sales techniques used by the vendor to enroll members into the credit union and in the vendor's programs. In the liquidated credit unions mentioned above, unethical methods were used to sign unsophisticated members. It was not uncommon to have them just sign blank forms which included a membership card, payroll deduction authorization, insurance policy, and a loan application and the first year's premium or other payment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The credit union did not provide written instructions to the vendor on procedures to enroll members. Thus the vendor contacted groups which the credit union was ill-equipped to serve. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The credit union authorized the vendor to approve loans en masse to cover first year fees or insurance premiums. NCUA considers this an unsafe and unsound practice which will result in appropriate administrative action. In several liquidated credit unions which had arrangements with insurance vendors, employees were enrolled in the credit union, received a loan to pay the first year's premium and authorized payroll deductions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reason the insurance agency proceeded in this manner was to be reimbursed immediately by the carrier for new policies. Such reimbursement ranged from 85 to 105 percent of the first year's premium. Thus an agency that enrolled just 100 new members for $500 per year insurance contracts could have received $42,500 to $52,500 in fees. This desire to obtain reimbursement clouded the vendor's objectivity and resulted in members having unwanted policies, which they generally canceled. At a minimum, since the policy holder received only 20 percent return on the policy, the credit union had a public relations problem collecting its exposed 80 percent. At the worst, the credit union had a loss loan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The credit union failed to obtain proper payroll deduction authorizations and authority to remit fees or insurance premiums to the company. In several cases, payroll deduction for all members, even those who chose not to enroll in the vendor's program, were sent to the company first. The company then sent the unauthorized fee or premium deductions to the credit union. This procedure exposed the credit union to misappropriation of funds by the company, to a potential surety problem, and to an uninsured status until the funds were received in the credit union. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;In another case, a vendor contracted with a credit union to assist credit union members select, locate, and negotiate the purchase or lease of automobiles. Members paid a fee to the vendor during the closing transactions. The vendor also provided marketing assistance to attract select employee groups into the credit union.The vendor was alleged to have falsified and concealed material facts and to have aided prospective credit union members in falsifying credit information to the credit union in attempts to obtain credit. In some cases the prospective member obtained possession of the automobile prior to being accepted as a member and in other cases prior to being approved for the financing. Other operational issues that have led to abuses are the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The dealer directly accepting the borrower's payments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

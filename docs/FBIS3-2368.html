Which option should actually be adopted? This is a great issue  which has a bearing on the peace and development of the  countries and regions concerned and also the world at large.  Recently, the West has adopted the first option.    On 9 February, the U.S.-led NATO issued an ultimatum to the  conflicting parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina, particularly the  Serbs, demanding that Serb armed forces withdraw their heavy  weapons to areas 20 km away from Sarajevo within 10 days,  otherwise NATO would launch air strikes against Serb armed  forces positions around the city. Hence, the situation in the  region suddenly became tense. Nevertheless, the international  community believed that: NATO had unexpectedly issued an  airstrike ultimatum, bypassing the UN Security Council, and was  prepared to resort to force or armed threat before investigating  and ascertaining who was responsible for the shelling of  Sarajevo. This manner of doing things was inappropriate.    If the NATO ultimatum is carried out, this will be the first  military action taken by the organization outside its own  defensive areas since its founding 44 years ago and also the  first eastward shift of its defense areas. This will seriously  affect Russia's strategic interests. Thus, the ultimatum  aroused Russia's strong dissatisfaction and opposition. Russian  leaders, including the president, prime minister, and the  defense minister, issued statements one after another expressing  opposition to NATO air strikes against Bosnia-Herzergovina.    On 19 February, Churkin, special presidential envoy and vice  foreign minister, emphatically told reporters: If NATO takes  reckless action against the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina in  disregard of Russian suggestions, this will lead to a tense  situation in Sarajevo and also a crisis in the relations between  Western countries and Russia.    If the NATO ultimatum is put into effect, the peace process  in Bosnia-Herzegovina will break down and all efforts for peace  made so far will be wasted and the civil war will continue and  there will be a danger of it further escalating and spreading.  People are worried that a surprise attack may trigger a Balkan  war. Since the outbreak of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  2.7 million people have become refugees, supporting themselves  and their families by relying mainly on international aid.  However, air strikes will fuel the flames of war and the  transport lines for the international aid goods and materials on  which the refugees, who are living in hunger and cold, rely for  their existence may possibly be sabotaged or cut off. If that  happens, their lives will become more miserable.    Bosnia-Herzegovina is different from Iraq. Once NATO puts  its ultimatum into effect, it will possibly get so deeply stuck  in the conflict that it will be unable to extricate itself  because, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, many mountains are covered with  thick forests and its geographical conditions are complicated.  Therefore, the targets for attack are hard to identify and  particularly most of the positions where the Serbs are well  concealed. Thus, it is difficult for air strikes to achieve the  desired results. Once the Serbs switch to the offensive, the  personnel in the countries concerned in which the UN  peacekeeping troops are stationed in Bosnia-Herzegovina will  become the selected targets of attack. Since air strikes will  solve no problems, if NATO dispatches ground forces for a large-  scale military intervention, it is possible for the organization  to sink into the quagmire of a "Vietnam-style" or  "Lebanon-style" war.    In view of the abovementioned situation, the international  community has universally opposed NATO air strikes against  Bosnia- Herzegovina and the use of the NATO ultimatum as a means  of settling the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue. The  Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict, which has lasted for 22 months, is  currently confronting the danger of external military  intervention and the expanding flames of war but the final way  out, and the wisest choice, is a peaceful settlement through  negotiations. In particular, the three parties in the  Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict recently agreed to form a union  after the country is divided into three parts, letting the  Muslims possess one-third of the territory and have access to  the sea. Because the Muslims were dissatisfied with the plan and  demanded more territory, the three conflicting parties still  need to bargain over it. If the peace talks continue and a  breakthrough is made, this will bring new hope to the peaceful  settlement of the Bosnia- Herzegovina issue.    Through frequent consultations between the United Nations  and  the various sides concerned, and also through diplomatic  efforts, the Serbs pulled back 80 percent of their heavy weapons  from the areas surrounding Sarajevo. NATO has decided not to  carry out, for the time being, its plan to launch air strikes  against Bosnia-Herzegovina. Since last year, some  "long-standing, large, and difficult" regional hot-spots, such  as the Middle East, Cambodia, and South Africa, have made  "historic breakthroughs" through negotiations and dialogue.  This shows that so long as there is hope for peace, be it only  a thin hope, efforts in this regard should not be abandoned.  This way of doing things is advantageous to peace and  development.</p>

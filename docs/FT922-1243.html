			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Survey of Indonesia (11): Shake-out may be imminent - Banking BANKING sector deregulation has been at the heart of Indonesia's economic growth over the past 10 years, prompting a surge in the number of banks and in the availability of credit to companies wishing to expand. It has done little, however, to improve efficiency and bankers say a shake-out of the sector may be imminent. Deregulation began in 1983 when ceilings on credit expansion were removed, but the real impetus came with the 1988 reforms which allowed new private domestic banks to set up, existing foreign banks to open limited branch networks and new foreign banks to create joint ventures with domestic institutions. Between 1988 and 1991 more than 70 banks and 2,000 branches were opened. Coinciding with a flood of new investment in low cost, export-oriented manufacturing, the result was a credit explosion. Total bank credits rose from Rp44,001bn in 1988 to Rp97,696bn in 1990. While banks chased clients with offers of large loans and generous credit card terms, bankers chased high salaries. The chief foreign currency dealer of one foreign bank was poached with an up-front payment of Dollars 400,000. In the past 18 months, banks have had to come to terms with a series of government initiatives that have reduced credit growth from a peak of 60 per cent year-on-year in mid-1990 to a forecast 15 per cent this year: In February 1991, the government ordered 12 parastatals to convert Rp8,000bn of their bank deposits - equivalent to about one third of money in circulation - into certificates issued by Bank Indonesia (BI), the central bank. Banks were told to raise their capital adequacy ratios requirement to 5 per cent of total assets by last March; banks had previously averaged about 2 per cent. This has to be raised further to 7 per cent by next March, and to 8 per cent the following December. Last October, ceilings on new foreign borrowing were announced. Private banks are collectively restricted to Dollars 500m of new borrowing in each of the next four years; the seven state banks are allowed up to Dollars 1bn of new foreign borrowing a year until 1996. In December 1991, a complex set of regulations was introduced which limited banks' offshore funding to 30 per cent of their equity. In addition, the central bank said that by next year 80 per cent of banks' lending in foreign currency portfolios must be to export-oriented companies. The restriction on foreign borrowing was prompted by the rapid growth of Indonesia's international debt which increased 44 per cent to Dollars 75bn in the past three years. Private debt accounts for one third of the total and has been growing most rapidly. Donors say, however, that the decision to announce new regulations is a sign of Bank Indonesia's weak capacity to supervise the sector. Confidence in the central bank was also shaken with the recent removal of its head of banking supervision. The official had complained that a leading private bank's loan portfolio was over-committed to companies belonging to its main shareholder. The central bank has not shown much inclination to enforce last December's regulations. Banks have handed in figures for their offshore borrowing but have not heard from Bank Indonesia if the sector is within its limit. Joint-venture banks have been told that they need not strictly comply with the rule limiting foreign borrowing to 30 per cent of equity. The regulations have, however, capped the worst excesses of the banks and made them look to the quality of their loan portfolios. Central bank officials say the level of bad and doubtful debts in the sector has increased from 3.9 per cent of total loans in 1990, to 5.9 per cent in 1991. Donor officials say that for the five state commercial banks, which account for about half the banking sector's assets, the position is considerably worse, with bad debts accounting for 15-25 per cent of their portfolios. The World Bank is proposing a Dollars 300m loan to restructure the state banks which, if all parties agree, should be in place by August. Bankers estimate that the state banks will require a capital injection of about Dollars 2bn by December, 1993, to satisfy capital adequacy requirements. Many private banks have also found themselves over-extended but have made use of a loosening of the money supply to lower deposit rates to about 17 per cent, while keeping lending rates relatively high at 24 per cent. One foreign broking house estimates that most banks in Indonesia need a spread of 7.6 per cent over deposit rates to break even. This allows for high overheads (3 per cent) and for provisions of bad debts (4.6 per cent). One bank which has accepted the need for restructuring is Bank Summa, majority owned by the Soerjadjaya family which also holds 76 per cent of Astra International, Indonesia's second-largest quoted company. Bank Summa has been hit by a sharp decline in the property development market. Its shareholders have recently injected up to Rp550bn but, bankers say, Bank Summa may require a further injection of capital unless property prices pick up soon. Like Bank Summa, many private banks must come to terms with bad debts on their books. A recent report by Jardine Fleming Nusantara, local subsidiary of Jardine Fleming merchant bank in Hong Kong, estimated that on average banks were providing just 1.0-1.5 per cent of performing loans for bad debt. While the state banks are looking to the government and donors for new capital, private banks will be looking to the foreign investor. A new banking decree, due to be finalised this month, will allow foreign investors to buy, for the first time, up to 49 per cent of a bank's listed shares. Foreigners are likely, however, to be selective of the banks in which they invest. While Bank Indonesia is certain to step in as a lender of last resort for any bank in crisis, a series of mergers in the year ahead remains on the cards as the sector attempts to reduce overheads and accommodate bad debt.</p>

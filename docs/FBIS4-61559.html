			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 7 TASS -- "NATO's Partnership for Peace  programme cannot suit Russia. A more serious programme of  cooperation is needed to correspond to Russia's status and  special conditions in which we will carry out partnership with  NATO," Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said.    In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS on Saturday,  Kozyrev  said that "our cooperation cannot be the same as with middle and  small European countries."    "We believe that there must not be deviation towards  NATO-centrism or NATOmania. With all our respect for that  organisation we proceed from the fact that it is only one of  many which exist on the continent," Kozyrev said.    He said Russia will present NATO at the end of May with its  own concept of European security. The minister stressed that  this will not be an alternative to the Partnership for Peace.  Russia's position on that matter will be outlined by Russian  Defence Minister Pavel Grachev at a meeting with NATO defence  ministers on May 24, Kozyrev said.</p>

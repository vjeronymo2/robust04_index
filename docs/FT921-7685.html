			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Energy bill clears hurdle in Congress THE US Congress is set to pass a new energy bill this spring, after the Senate reached agreement on compromise legislation to stiffen energy efficiency standards, curb offshore drilling and promote natural gas use. Environmentalists and energy industry advocates have been locked for months in a stalemate that prevented the bill's sponsor, Senator Bennett Johnston from the oil-producing state of Louisiana, from bringing it to the Senate floor. But in a compromise, environmentalists agreed to drop their demand that car makers must raise fuel efficiency on the vehicles they sell, in exchange for abandonment of efforts to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska for oil and gas drilling. The bill passed by 94-4 in the Senate, backed by Mr James Watkins, energy secretary, who said it was a 'substantial milestone' containing 'nothing we can't live with.' Similar legislation is expected to be moved by the House of Representatives energy committee in the next few weeks, paving the way for a bill to be enacted this year. The Senate bill would: Impose new energy efficiency standards on most commercial and residential lamps and electric motors, saving an estimated Dollars 25bn in energy costs over the next 20 years. Promote alternative motor fuels by requiring private and public fleet operators to buy vehicles powered by electricity, solar cells, ethanol or natural gas. By the year 2000, 90 per cent of non-military federal vehicles will have to run on these fuels. Maintain the current ban on oil and gas drilling on the US Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Ease licensing rules for natural gas pipelines, making it easier for gas producers to reach new markets. Allow independent electricity generators to compete in the wholesale electricity market.</p>

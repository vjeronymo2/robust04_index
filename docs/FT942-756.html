			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / MoD cuts beat Treasury needs The Ministry of Defence will next month announce cuts in military expenditure well in excess of those required by the Treasury in the current financial year, according to defence sources. The MoD is required to shave around Pounds 750m off its budget for the financial year 1994-95 to meet the targets set out in the last Budget. Officials drawing together about 30 separate reports for the Defence Cost Studies project have discovered far more room for cuts in military support services than had been expected. In the run up to the publication of the Defence Cost Studies, MoD officials are arguing with the Treasury over whether the extra expenditure saved will be retained by the department. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, will want to announce several 'sweeteners' when the cuts in support services are announced, probably on July 14. Backbench Conservative MPs have expressed anxiety about the projected cuts in military support services - such as hospitals and non-military transport  -arguing that these will undermine the military's front-line capability. While they accept that some support services can be reduced, some MPs have argued that the army needs more land-based helicopters, tanks and stores of ammunition. As a sign of their concern over the issue, the defence select committee has agreed, insisting that it will re-convene in the summer recess, if necessary, to discuss the Defence Cost Studies proposals. A meeting outside a parliamentary sitting would be almost unprecedented.</p>

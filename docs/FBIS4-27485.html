			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The 7 April QUAN DOI NHAN DAN reports  that for many years, production at the Yen Vien Oxygen Plant has  satisfied domestic industrial and medical needs for oxygen, CO2,  nitrogen, and calcium carbide, particularly in the north.  Recently, the plant succeeded in producing 99.99 percent pure  liquid nitrogen, essential for the manufacture of TV picture  tubes and for other high-tech industrial sectors. Yen Vien is  the only plant in the country which can produce liquid nitrogen.    Research and development efforts on liquid nitrogen were  begun by the plant's own cadres and technicians in 1993, with  the first successful test production occurring in early 1994.  It is noteworthy that this was achieved with old Soviet  equipment. Tests conducted using equipment from the Netherlands  confirmed that international standards had been achieved. Thus,  as of this year, the plant can reliably meet all domestic needs  (including joint enterprises) for 99.7 percent pure liquid  oxygen, 99.9 percent pure liquid nitrogen, CO2, and C2H2.    For the first quarter of 1994, the plant's total sales rose  13.2 percent over the same quarter of last year. Sales of  oxygen, the chief product, increased by 73.26 percent in the  same period.</p>

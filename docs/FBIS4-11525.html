			<p>BFN     [Text] Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat said today that the  Chilean Government has not made a decision on which path to take  in trade relations with the United States, whether this be a  bilateral trade agreement or treaty, or NAFTA.    Aninat said Chile would have to wait to see how events  develop before a proper decision is made on this issue. Aninat  also said that while according to several studies neither of the  two possibilities have trade advantages of any great  significance, an agreement would in any case eliminate the  different levels of tariffs, which would produce relatively  larger profits for our exports of nontraditional products which  have a large added value.    Aninat also said that joining NAFTA or signing a free trade  agreement with the United States would give prestige to the  country, and could be very important in terms of attracting  investments, giving more stability to national economic policy  and boosting the Chilean reputation abroad. Aninat added that  many people believe that simply signing a free trade agreement  with the United States is almost enough in itself, as that  country is very strict and demanding in its standards and this  would benefit the Chilean economy.    Aninat, who today attended a meeting of the Chilean-U.S.  Chamber of Commerce, said it is important to place a free trade  agreement with the United States within its real setting and  dimensions. He added that future negotiations should be put  into their proper context, as neither a bilateral trade  agreement nor joining NAFTA should be considered the more  successful measure, nor should one or the other be considered a  total failure or put at the highest levels, which might wear  down the issue of our relations with the United States. He  concluded by saying that our bilateral relations with the United  States are very complex, have profound historical roots, and  involve many aspects that go way beyond economic issues.</p>

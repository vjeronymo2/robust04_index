			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by President Lech Walesa at a ceremony at the Tomb </F> of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw marking the anniversary of  Poland's 1791 Constitution--live]    [Text] The event whose anniversary we are celebrating today  is among the most important and glorious in Polish history.  Although it was a fruit of peaceful thinking, this event is  equal in importance to our greatest military achievements, the  most famous victories of the Polish Army. On 3 May 1791, an  important and difficult battle was won in Warsaw, a battle for  Poland and for a modern Polish state. Patriotic, progressive,  and reformatory thinking won the battle. It changed, meeting  the needs of its time, the unsatisfactory political and social  setup of the state. However, internal arguments and foreign  forces destroyed the achievements this philosophy had initiated.  But the beautiful tradition that stimulated the minds and  spirit of subsequent generations of Poles has remained.    The adoption of the 3 May Constitution has proved that, at  important moments of history, we are capable of courageous and  long-term state thinking, that we are capable of initiating  radical reforms and of creating solid legal foundations for  actions organized on a national scale. Social agreement and  universal consent are the condition for such transformations to  be successful. This puts reformers under the obligation to make  great efforts in order to bring about pluralistic compromise  solutions.    For society, this means an even more difficult task of  finding appropriate proportions between one's own good and  public interest, of giving up some personal objectives for the  common good.    The message of the 3 May Constitution constitutes a living  and creative value for Poles today. We remembered this during  our struggles for a free and sovereign Third Republic aimed at  transforming Poland into a strong, modern, democratic and  tolerant country, a country that would be open to the world. We  feel that this Polish tradition is part of our legacy. However,  today we lack the determination and effectiveness of our great  predecessors. The Basic Law of the Third Republic is still  nonexistent. Despite the restructuring of the state continuing  for five years, this basic legal act has not yet been created.  We are building a house without a solid foundation.    A year ago, on the 202d anniversary of the 3 May  Constitution, I said here: It will be easier to meet new  challenges if we focus on what unites us all. The achievement  of the authors of the 3 May Constitution should be an example  for us to follow. They overcame divisions and rose above their  ambitions and grudges. They showed us what civic maturity,  responsibility and patriotism, tolerance and wise consensus mean.    We are in great need of these values today. We must reach an  agreement on matters most important to our homeland.  Irrespective of the fact that our views, options, and interests  vary, we must support Poland through a wise and long-sighted  compromise. The future successful development of the country  and the well-being of its citizens depend on that. The  endurance of the edifice of the state depends on it.    These words are still topical. We are still divided. We  have not managed to form a united stance on matters important  for the country or to give a clear answer to questions on the  future of the state. The matter most important for Poland--the  Constitution--is buried in insignificant and prolonged  discussions and arguments.    Despite this, I believe that we will find a common language  and citizens' concern for our common value--Poland. I believe  that this exchange of opinions will allow creative thought about  the state to emerge, and this will introduce a new democratic  order that will live up to our dreams and aspirations. It will  live up to the time in which we are living. Let us be worthy  successors to the tradition of 3 May. [Applause]</p>

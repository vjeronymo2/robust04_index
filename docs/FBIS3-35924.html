			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dmitriy Pavshentsev: "Yeltsin Awaited in </F> Tbilisi"]    [Text] Tbilisi -- The Russian president's coming visit to  Georgia 3 February is currently at the center of attention of  people in the republic, but attitudes to this event -- as was to  be expected -- are highly ambiguous.    Although most political parties are to one extent or another  pinning definite hopes on settling relations with their northern  neighbor, Georgia's most radical political forces continue to  back confrontation with Russia.    These include Boris Kakubava, leader of the Abkhazia  Liberation Organization, who has called on the public --  primarily on Abkhaz refugees living in Tbilisi (there are  currently around 60,000 of them in the capital) -- to stage  protests during the visit over "Russia's interference in  Georgia's internal affairs in the course of the Abkhaz conflict"  and to pin responsibility on Russia for defeat in the war.    A similar statement was issued by Irakliy Tsereteli, leader  of the Georgian National Independence Party. He believes that  President Yeltsin should know that there are forces in the  republic which are by no means delighted about Russia's policy  on Georgia.    Admittedly, the supporters of street protest demonstrations  are not particularly popular at the moment. The dominant  opinion in society and among most political parties is that  political pragmatism should prevail. People in Tbilisi are  confident that many of Georgia's political and economic problems  will be settled during the talks. "However different the  opinions in our political circles over Russia's policy with  regard to Georgia, it remains a fact that Georgia cannot leave  Russia's sphere of influence overnight and move to the West's  sphere of influence. Things need to be looked at realistically.  On this basis, we hope that aspects of our future relations  with Russia," Temur Zhorzholiani, chairman of the Georgian  Conservative Monarchist Party, said in an interview with this  PRAVDA correspondent.</p>

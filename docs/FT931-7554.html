			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Lawyers warn on shortage of judges A SHORTAGE of Commercial Court judges is threatening London's future as a centre for resolving international business disputes, the heads of the legal profession say. In a letter to Lord Mackay, the lord chancellor, Mr Mark Sheldon, president of the Law Society, and Mr John Rowe QC, chairman of the Bar, warn that at stake is the Pounds 450m contribution made by English commercial law to invisible foreign earnings each year. Delays in hearing international business disputes because of a lack of judges and uncertainty about their future availability could drive international clients of the Commercial Court to litigate in other commercial law centres such as Rotterdam or Frankfurt, they say. International businesses use the London court by choice largely because of its ability to offer fixed hearing dates within a reasonable time. 'Businesses need to be able to plan ahead, to allocate the time of management and other witnesses,' Mr Sheldon says. The normal complement of Commercial Court judges is six. At the moment there are only five. But the problem is made worse because a general shortage of High Court judges means that the five commercial judges are frequently required to sit on cases in other divisions of the High Court. Mr Justice Saville, the head of the Commercial Court, wants a full complement of six judges and for them all to sit full time on Commercial Court cases. The lord chancellor is considering a report by a working party chaired by Mr Justice Kennedy on judicial staffing in the High Court.</p>

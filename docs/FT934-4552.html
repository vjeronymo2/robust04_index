			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Nuclear Electric calls for sell-off Nuclear Electric, the state-owned electricity company, yesterday risked antagonising ministers when it coupled its publication of strongly improved interim results with a call for privatisation. A statement by Mr John Collier, its chairman, that the company's future lay in the private sector came only a week after Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, rebuked the company for earlier calls for privatisation by saying that it was up to the government to decide if and when the industry was sold off. Nuclear Electric announced pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 of Pounds 463m, against Pounds 221m for the same period last year. Operating profits were Pounds 497m, up from Pounds 255m. If the effects of the nuclear levy are excluded, however, the company shows an operating loss of Pounds 118m, compared with a Pounds 377m loss in the corresponding period last year. The company says the levy enables it to discharge liabilities inherited from the Central Electricity Generating Board when the rest of the electricity industry was privatised. The improvement was helped by high productivity and a considerably better performance from the company's five advanced gas-cooled reactors (AGRs), which have previously performed below expectations and design capacity. Income from electricity sales was Pounds 861m, up from Pounds 618m, reflecting an increase in power market share in England and Wales from 21.6 per cent to 25 per cent. Nuclear Levy receipts fell 3 per cent to Pounds 615m. The company said it was studying an offer for reprocessing contracts with British Nuclear Fuels. The deals are being negotiated after the government's decision last year not to underwrite them. Nuclear Electric provided Pounds 316m, included in operating costs, for decommissioning and disposal of used fuel in connection with the half year operations. It paid Pounds 306m in discharging CEGB liabilities.</p>

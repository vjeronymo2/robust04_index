			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / People: QMH: Cairns and Bould check in Andrew Coppel, the chief executive charged with sorting out the affairs of Queens Moat Houses, is still unable to explain exactly what went wrong at the hotel group, whose shares were suspended last March. He has, however, recruited two new senior executives charged with finding ways of turning the group's 191 hotels in the UK and continental Europe into a viable business. Michael Cairns, 53, is to join the board as chief operating officer, hotels on September 20. Cairns has been with Inter-Continental Hotels for 25 years, most recently managing its European, Middle Eastern and African properties. He is also managing director of Saison Overseas Holdings, Inter-Continental's parent company. The second appointee is Andrew Bould, 45, senior vice president of sales and marketing at HiltonInternational, who is to become managing director of Queens Moat's UK hotels division. Bould's appointment is in line with Coppel's view that the UK business needs its own chief executive, rather than being run directly by group head office, as under the previous management. Coppel says Cairns will need to grapple with markedly different problems in the UK and Germany, the group's two most important markets. In Germany, Coppel found that the hotels had been reasonably well-managed under the old regime, with proper financial controls. The difficulty is the country's economic downturn, which has damaged trading. In the UK, where hoteliers say business is picking up, Cairns and Bould need to decide what to do about the management weaknesses which existed before the shares were suspended. These include the management incentive scheme, which went badly wrong, and the branding and marketing of the hotels.</p>

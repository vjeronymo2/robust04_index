			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Why Does Russia Need 4 Million Men?"] </F>   [Text] Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the  Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff, stated at a  closed session of the State Duma Defense Committee that "a  multiplication of power structures is now going on in Russia."  In fact over 4 million people (2.3 million in the Armed Forces)  have been put "under arms" in the country.    Besides the Army and Internal Troops, Mobile Troops are  being  formed. The Ministry for Emergency Situations is planning to  form its own navy. Military formations are being recreated  within the Federal Counterintelligence Service system and in the  Federal Government Communications Service. The president's  Security Service is being expanded.    Kolesnikov said that Russia "is not in a position to  maintain  four armies." He stated that the Russian Federation Defense  Ministry is ready, "should the government so decide," to  transfer the Russian Federation Navy and part of the Airborne  Forces to the Border Guard Troops' command in order to form  mobile forces." According to Kolesnikov, because of insufficient  resources, this is the fourth year that mobilization assemblies  have not been carried out and all large-scale exercises have  been scrapped (all that is left is command and staff map  exercises).    Given normal financing, Kolesnikov said, we would be able to  reduce the Army to 1.5 million men as early as this year.</p>

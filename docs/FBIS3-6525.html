The officials said the Transport Ministry will extend  licenses for five U.S. airlines, due to expire on March 26,  until June 9, instead of October 31 as requested.    The step involves seven routes operated by the U.S.  carriers, including Chicago-Tokyo flights operated by United  Airlines, the officials said.    The action followed a similar move taken by the Department  of  Transportation against three Japanese airlines, extending  licenses for their Trans-Pacific operations which expired last  December 13 for only 179 days instead of one year, they said.    The U.S. decision applied to six routes, including Japan  Airlines flights between Tokyo and Chicago, a Tokyo-New York  route by All Nippon Airways and a cargo service between Tokyo  and Los Angeles via San Francisco by Nippon Cargo Airlines, the  officials said.    Friday's development will escalate a drawn-out civil  aviation  dispute between Japan and the United States over Washington's  demand for the beyond rights for American commercial carriers.    The Japanese officials said Japan will revoke permission for  the U.S. airlines to extend their service to Japan beyond June  9 if the United States take similar action against Japanese  carriers.</p>

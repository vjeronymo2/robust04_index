			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Nikolay Kondratenko and Natalya </F> Cherepanova]    [Text] St. Petersburg, 5 Apr -- St. Petersburg Mayor  Anatoliy Sobchak today received Swedish Foreign Minister  Margaretha af Ugglas, who arrived in Russia today on a working  visit.    In conversation, the sides touched upon questions of  strengthening regional economic ties, the implementation of  joint programmes to be financed by the Swedish side, and also  illegal immigration and cooperation between law-enforcement  bodies. In Margaretha af Ugglas' opinion, the setting up of a  House of Sweden in the city on the Neva would contribute to the  deepening of bilateral contacts, including cultural exchange.    At a meeting with Russian and foreign journalists she said  that in Pskov she intended to discuss with Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev the problem of the withdrawal of Russian  troops from the Baltic republics. Sweden's position, Margaretha  af Ugglas stressed, is that they should be withdrawn as soon as  possible. Replying to a question from an ITAR-TASS  correspondent on Sweden's attitude to the "Partnership for  Peace" program, she said that her country will be joining this  program. And it would very much like Russia to join this  process, too. "Sweden intends to build a new Europe together  with Russia, and not against Russia. Russia needs to take  reciprocal steps," the minister said.</p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Commission rushes to Delors' defence: Comments rejecting Danish opt-outs from Maastricht 'taken out of context' THE European Commission yesterday issued an angry response to reports that Mr Jacques Delors, its president, had ruled out any possibility of Denmark getting a series of legally binding opt-outs to the Maastricht treaty. According to his spokesman, Mr Delors's words were wrenched from their context, which was a simple restatement of what the 12, including Denmark, have reiterated ever since Danish voters rejected the treaty by a narrow margin in the June 2 referendum - that there can be no renegotiation of the treaty. Nevertheless, a transcript of Mr Delors' remarks cannot be interpreted as less than a reminder to Denmark that it risks being left behind by its partners if it fails to ratify Maastricht in a new referendum. Diplomats in Brussels were unwilling to add to the controversy, but regarded the remarks as unhelpful during the unresolved ratification crisis in Denmark and the UK. 'The president was merely restating the doctrine of the Community,' Mr Delors' spokesman insisted. 'Frankly, he only said what I have heard him say at least 15 times.' The spokesman drew attention to introductory and concluding remarks Mr Delors made in a question-and-answer session with the Belgian parliament on Thursday, which appeared to hedge Mr Delors' judgment that the treaty could not be tampered with to accommodate Danish concerns. The Commission president said: 'We can only resolve the Danish problem by adding interpretative declarations (to the treaty), and not a protocol, since that has the value of a treaty.' Denmark is looking for binding guarantees it will not have to take part in a single currency later this century, or the eventual common defence policy mooted by Maastricht. Denmark sent its demands for special terms, to enable it to submit the Maastricht treaty to a second referendum, to European governments yesterday, claiming that the special terms could be made legally binding without having to renegotiate the treaty. The Danish position paper, in which the country's demands are set out, is backed by seven of the eight parties in the Folketing. The paper received the formal approval of the Market Affairs Committee yesterday. Mr Delors underlined 'two principles', which conjured up again the spectre of Europe's integrationists going ahead towards union, leaving Denmark, and the UK if it fails to ratify Maastricht, on Europe's sidelines. 'First,' Mr Delors said, 'nobody can force a country to ratify Maastricht. Second, no country can possess such an enormous right of veto that it can stop others from going forward.' The Danish question, in the judgment of many Brussels and member state officials dealing with it, is likely to turn on the wording and legal status of the guarantees Copenhagen is seeking.</p>

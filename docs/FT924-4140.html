			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (11): Damage not permanent - France WHILE buy-outs may be suffering from the general economic downturn, damage should only be temporary since a sizeable pool of candidates for such deals still exists. The lack of takers when founders of medium-sized family firms retire continues to lead to a number of closures each year - a problem aggravated by today's shaky corporate climate. 'There is a large reservoir of enterprises to be financed by leveraged buy-outs,' said Mr Dominique Peninon, director of Alpha Associates and vice-president of the French Venture Capital Association, AFIC. Even more small companies close because of handover problems, but most of these are not in line for leveraged deals, in some cases, simply because they do not want to sell out to anyone at any price. However, the MBO is not the panacea for the problem of succession that some thought it would be, according to Gilles Cahen-Salvador, president of LBO France, the largest adviser and practitioner in France. 'Targets must be profitable with clear prospects since they must reply a large debt. Very few fit this bill,' he said. The recent progress of the sector is difficult to asses. Changes in statistical definitions deprive most year-to-year comparisons of meaning, according to AFIC. The only figure that stands up is that for the average size of buy-outs and buy-ins, which rose from FFr3.3m (Dollars .61m) in 1990 to FFr5.5m in 1991. Most operators are biding their time until the economy turns around, banks become braver and the prices of companies fall to more realistic levels. Asking prices are lower than they were two years ago, but the drop is 'not very significant yet', says Mr Daniel Toutlemonde, a partner in Suez Finance Conseil. He expects further declines in 1993. Banks have been more cautious about lending for highly-leveraged deals, even though the gearing - or debt-to-equity ratio - has come down sharply over the past three years. Although this reflects leaner times, the reverse was welcomed at a time when fears were mounting that France would follow the US with its over-leveraged transactions and sometimes spectacular corporate collapses. Buy-ins are increasing in importance. Nearly all deals used to be buy-outs, says Mr Cahen-Salvador, because there was no supply of proficient outside managers to be tapped. Now, however, more quality managers are available and, says Mr Maurice Tchenio, director of Apax Partners &amp; Cie, since the companies involved are less profitable, they need an fresh injection of expertise as well as cash. For Mr Cahen-Salvador's LBO France, buy-ins are now running equal to buy-outs numerically, while for Mr Toutlemonde at Suez, buy-ins are now in the majority. While most agree on the direction of MBO activity, obstacles caused by tax issues are hotly debated. Fiscal integration is allowed only if the transaction covers 95 per cent of the new company's capital, which upsets some operators but not others. Mr Cahen-Salvador is an outspoken critic of the rule, claiming that one recalcitrant member of an owning family with a stake of only 5.01 per cent can prevent an attractive deal taking place. He claims that even a 5 percentage point cut in the threshold would help under current tax laws. Mr Tchenio, however, believes the 95 per cent rule is not much of a brake. Problems can arise, he says, with listed companies and dispersed shareholdings, but these have little impact on the underlying need for MBOs or other LBOs. There are ways around the difficulty, says Mr Jean-Francois Court, chairman of AFIC's fiscal and legislation committee. One way is for a holding company to charge the operating subsidiary management fees, which reduces the tax bill and neutralises the lack of integration. Scrapping the rule is 'not a priority', even though it would be simplify procedures, he says. More important is to obtain greater flexibility over exoneration of capital gains tax on venture capital funds' investments in companies with at least 50 per cent of their shares listed in EC countries. The problem is that this applies only if the target holding company holds at least 40 per cent of the voting rights in its operating subsidiary, which is rarely the case with multi-tier corporate structures, Mr Court explains. He has been lobbying the Finance Ministry for a change, and hopes for a reply before the end of the year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Moti Bassok and On Levi] </F>   [Excerpts] Israel is demanding in the Taba talks the  setting up of a security belt around the Qatif Bloc settlements,  which would increase the territory to be left under its control  to 46 square kms. The Palestinians agree to Israeli control  over an area of 19 to 20 square kms. It was finally agreed  yesterday that PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat and Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres will meet in Oslo on Saturday in a further attempt  to break the deadlock in the Taba talks.    It was learned yesterday that contrary to announcements by  Israeli spokesmen there is a sharp dispute between Israel and  the Palestinians on the size of the Israeli autonomy area in the  Qatif Bloc. Israel is demanding that in addition to the  territories of the settlements and the areas in between them, it  will have control of a security belt that would "wrap" the  settlements from outside. Israel is demanding overall 46 square  kms. The Palestinians are opposed to this and are agreeing to  leaving some 19 to 20 square kms with Israel. [passage omitted]    The Security Committee in the Taba talks has still not found  a compromise formula for control of the border crossings. Some  progress was made in the Civilian Affairs Committee, headed by  Brigadier General Gadi Zohar. It was decided to set up a single  dialing area for the autonomy and to frank a Palestinian stamp.    Senior sources in the Israeli delegation said last night  that  "there would be no Israeli compromise on the crossings issue.  Israel went a long way toward the Palestinians on that issue and  we now expect them to show flexibility." [passage omitted]</p>

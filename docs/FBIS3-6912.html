			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement by National Army of Democratic Kampuchea </F> spokesman rejecting the communique of the Vietnamese puppets and  two-headed government on their seizure of Pailin"; dated 22  March -- read by announcer]    [Text] I. The Vietnamese communist puppets and the  two-headed government clamorously announced in Phnom Penh,  Battambang, and Treng that they have seized Pailin. Meanwhile,  some foreign news agencies and newspapers have echoed this  announcement of the Vietnamese communist puppets and the  two-headed government in an evil intention to deceive the  national and international public opinion just as they did  concerning the Anlung Veng battlefield.    II. Many observers and journalists stressed, however, that  they had been waiting several days for permission to go to  Pailin, but the Vietnamese communist puppets and the two-headed  government did not allow them to go. They waited in Battambang  and Treng for several days, but they did not reach Pailin.  Therefore, they assumed that the Vietnamese puppets had not yet  seized Pailin as they claimed. The Vietnamese communist puppets  and the two-headed government lied. They also reported that on  the Route 10-Pailin battlefield, many attacking troops of the  Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed government were  killed and wounded. The routed troops who retreated from the  battlefield said that hundreds of their colleagues were killed  and wounded. Several hundred other wounded troops were  hospitalized. The attacking troops died in battle and also due  to a shortage of water and food, while hundreds deserted their  ranks. Those deserters also said that the Vietnamese communist  puppets and the two-headed government lied to them that their  troops were fighting on the front line; but, in fact, they were  very far from Pailin.    III. The spokesman of the National Army of Democratic  Kampuchea [NADK] would like to stress to the national and  international audience that:    A. Not a single soldier of the Vietnamese communist puppets  and the two-headed government was able to enter Pailin city.  Presently, Pailin remains under the control of Democratic  Kampuchea in an orderly manner.    B. We would like to inform the national and international  audience that the Vietnamese communist puppets, two-headed  government, and their masters who have continued to kindle war  and oppose national reconciliation, peace, constitution, and the  king have made an all-out effort to smash the national forces  and people in order to enable Vietnam to swallow Cambodia and  enable their allies to seize and incorporate Cambodia into their  arena. This is why they have given money to the Vietnamese  communist puppets and two-headed government for continuing to  fuel the war. They ordered the attack on Anlung Veng and  claimed to have won victory and to have seized this area. In  fact, they suffered heavy and shameful defeats. The journalists  and national and international public opinion have been informed  about this big defeat at Anlung Veng -- they met a crushing  defeat and swore not to fight again for the rest of their lives.    While launching this new offensive, they shamelessly claimed  to have seized Pailin in such a way in an attempt, on the one  hand, to whitewash their big defeat at Anlung Veng and, on the  other, to beg for more money and to put pressure on FUNCINPEC  [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful,  and Cooperative Cambodia]. They also went so far as to flex  their muscles for the king when puppets Hun Sen and Chea Sim  visited Beijing.    IV. We would like to stress that on 17 and 18 March, the  attacking forces of the Vietnamese communist puppets and  two-headed government were severely smashed by the NADK forces,  inflicting heavy losses on them in terms of manpower, tanks, and  artillery. Many of their forces were forced to retreat and flee  in disarray. On 19 March, puppet Hun Sen and the Political  Bureau of the Cambodian People's Party of the Vietnamese  communists ordered their forces to make an adventurous assault.  On 19 March, the attacking forces then began their onslaught,  using tanks and artillery as the principle means. They moved up  to Sala Krau, but were intercepted and attacked from the rear  and the front by the NADK forces. They were cut to pieces and  four of their 20 tanks were destroyed. The remaining 16 tanks  moved up to Sala Krau on the night of 19 March. The people and  NADK surrounded them from all directions, cutting the attacking  forces into many parts in the area from Kon Damrei to (Phum Don  Ta).    On the afternoon of 21 March, we destroyed two tanks and  damaged three others. In addition to the nine tanks we  destroyed between 8 and 18 March, we destroyed 14 other tanks.  The remaining tanks are short of fuel and the enemy soldiers  are suffering shortages of food, ammunition, and spare parts to  repair the damaged tanks. They are encircled in a four to five  kilometer area at Sala Krau where the people's forces and the  NADK are continuing to attack and capture as many of them as  possible.    The attacking forces' supply is inoperable. This is, on the  one hand, caused by heavy rains as their vehicles get bogged  down and cannot move forward. On the other hand, they often hit  land mines and are targets of attack from the people and NADK.  Many of them are thus destroyed, damaged, and stalled in the  fields.    The doomsday of the Vietnamese communist puppets and the  two-  headed government is drawing near. They will soon suffer a  similar big defeat, just as they did at Anlung Veng because  their forces -- including tanks, infantrymen, and so forth --  that have hazardously moved forward are already being  intercepted by the people and NADK.    [Signed] NADK spokesman    [Dated] 22 March 1994</p>

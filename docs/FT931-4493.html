			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Philips to axe jobs in Belgium Philips, the Dutch electronics group, said yesterday that it planned to cut 800 jobs in Belgium as part of a trend to produce audio equipment in Singapore and other parts of the Far East. The job losses, to be spread over two years, are the first big cuts announced since Mr Jan Timmer, Philips' president, unveiled plans last week to eliminate 15,000 out of 252,000 jobs in an attempt to restore profitability in its loss-making consumer electronics business. The Belgian job losses will focus on Philips' operations in Hasselt, where the company employs nearly 2,000 people and where it produces compact disc (CD) players and CD-interactive, a multi-media version of the CD. Philips in Belgium said these products could be manufactured 25 per cent cheaper in Singapore. The remaining Hasselt operations will concentrate on more complex audio equipment. In Belgium, as in the rest of the world, Philips is confronted by stagnant markets for consumer electronics.</p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Time slips away for Romanian reforms Romania must take tough decisions within the next six months or lose the chance to reform its economy, Mr Mircea Cosea, Romania's recently appointed economic reform co-ordinator, said in London yesterday. 'We have wasted too much time before getting down to serious structural economic reforms,' he admitted. In an interview during an investment conference organised by the Confederation of British Industries, Mr Cosea, the deputy prime minister, said he would use the new executive powers granted to his economic reform council last month 'to eliminate loss-making enterprises, speed up privatisation and liberalise the foreign exchange market'. The latter is of top priority. The reluctance of the shaky coalition government led by Mr Nicolae Vacoroiu to allow the leu, the Romanian currency, to be determined by market forces has been a main sticking point in long negotiations with the International Monetary Fund for a new standby agreement. 'Without a real exchange rate the entire economy is distorted, leading to degradation and deformation,' Mr Cosea said. 'But up until now the government has feared to act because of the social consequences of the probable 28 to 30 per cent devaluation of the leu which would result.' But an estimated Dollars 3bn in finance from the IMF, the World Bank and other institutions hangs on parliamentary approval of the terms of IMF memorandum negotiated recently in Washington. Mr Cosea forecasts that parliament will approve the tough IMF terms by February, although it may be necessary to introduce temporary heating and energy subsidies to ease the pain. 'Once the forex system is liberalised, I will push parliament to reform the land laws to allow foreigners to buy land. 'This is essential to attract the equity investment which we desperately need to modernise the economy and keep unemployment from rising much above current levels around 10 per cent of the labour force,' he added.</p>

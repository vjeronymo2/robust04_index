			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / UK Company News: US spur puts Siebe in full control / A look at a Pounds 2.2bn group with a low public profile Siebe, the international controls group, is now one of the UK's largest engineering companies, with a market capitalisation of Pounds 2.2bn - bigger than better known names such as Rolls-Royce and British Aerospace. One reason for the company's relatively low public profile is that almost all of its products are used within industry or as components for other manufacturers' goods. Siebe's output ranges from multi-million pound computerised process control systems, which manage petrochemical plants, to small, mass-produced components sold for less than Pounds 1 each. Another factor is that more than 90 per cent of group sales are made outside the UK, with nearly half in the US. Mr Allen Yurko, the 43-year-old American who became chief executive in January, said North American operations alone would currently be number 233 in the Fortune 500 ranking of US companies. The Windsor-based company has started to publicise its name and activities through a press advertising campaign in the UK and the US. British journalists recently toured group factories near Chicago and Boston. The main exhibit was Foxboro, the company bought for Dollars 650m (Pounds 411m) in 1990 which is now the star of the controls division. Named after the small Massachusetts town close to Boston where it is based, Foxboro makes Intelligent Automation (I/A) systems, which have been gaining market share from larger US rivals in process control, such as Emerson Electric and Honeywell. Foxboro has recently won a string of international orders, including an Pounds 11m contract to supply its I/A control system for a petrochemical complex in Germany - the first greenfield refinery to be built in Europe for 15 years. The main Foxboro plant is controlled by one of its own I/A systems and is completely computerised - a paperless system monitors, stocks, workflow and product certification. Direct labour costs have been reduced to 1 per cent of sales, and sales per employee exceed Dollars 600,000. This compares with a group average of Pounds 62,200. The acquisition of Foxboro has proved the deal of a lifetime for Mr Barrie Stephens, chairman. The 66-year-old Welshman joined the company 31 years ago and until the beginning of this year combined the role of group chairman and chief executive The City of London was initially hostile to the deal. It feared that Siebe, which had expanded aggressively during the eighties through a flood of rights issues, had over-reached itself by gearing up to take over a family-controlled company in the US - the graveyard of so many British companies. What Mr Stephens realised was that Foxboro had developed a good product  - its I/A system - but was struggling under a bloated cost structure. Siebe, which has always had an aggressive record of cutting costs, found plenty of scope in an operation which employed 180 people in its public relations department - a function now fulfilled by three. Mr Yurko, part of the acquisition team who looked over Foxboro said it was 'a profit waiting to happen. Management was so sleepy. Gross margins were running at over 45 per cent, but by the time you got down to the bottom line it was just breaking even.' With the help of Foxboro, Siebe's controls division achieved sales of Pounds 646m in the year to April - a 22 per cent rise and accounting for 35 per cent of group sales. In recent years it has cut sales order lead times from several months to several weeks and improved production quality tenfold. Although investment analysts and journalists are intrigued by what Mr Yurko calls 'the sizzle' of the Foxboro operation, the chief executive regrets that this focus tends to overshadow Siebe's other activities - particularly its temperature and appliance controls division, which contributes 38 per cent of group sales. A more typical Siebe operation is the Paragon factory, which is situated north of Chicago on the western shore of Lake Michigan. Paragon, which was acquired in 1989, is a leading supplier of refrigeration and other appliance controls. Although it is moving away from electro-mechanical components towards electronic systems, it still carries out a wide variety of operations in this plant, including old-fashioned metal-bashing and paint-spraying. Some of the oldest products still in production - such as mechanical timers - have changed little in 40 years. It is, however, the trend towards electronic controls which offers the group its greatest sales opportunity - both in the US and overseas. Paragon is a leading supplier of automatic defrost controls on fridges, which are nearly universal in the US but which feature in only 7 per cent of European fridges. Siebe's centre of excellence in electronics is the Simicon plant located on the other side of Lake Michigan, near Grand Rapids. Simicon, part of the Robertshaw controls company, is located in a purpose-built factory in which Dollars 7m has been invested. The plant makes electronic controls for a variety of domestic appliance - particularly cookers. The company has recently completed controls which allow McDonald's to programme its ovens by computer. Each of these plants must, like all of its 133 manufacturing operations around the world, contribute to Siebe's ambitious growth and productivity plans. These include annual targets of a 5 per cent cost reduction, 10 per cent sales growth, 15 per cent increase in pre-tax profits and 20 per cent improvement in cashflow. Mr Yurko said last week in Boston that he was still comfortable about achieving those targets. The recent concerns about pressures on manufacturers' profit margins had been overdone. He said: 'We work in industries which are stable and well run, and which should enable us to make an adequate return on our capital.'</p>

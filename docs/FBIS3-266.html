			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>   Call for CP, IFP To Register for Election -- Johannesburg  THE  CITIZEN in English on 3 March in a page-6 editorial notes that  Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi "is  wise" to keep his "options open" by considering to provisionally  register his party for the election. He can participate in the  election "if he succeeds in getting his basic demands addressed,  or he can continue to boycott the election if they are not."  THE CITIZEN's advice to the Conservative Party (CP) is to  "register -- and decide what you want to do afterwards."  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   Anxiety Over National Peacekeeping Force -- Johannesburg THE  STAR in English on 4 March in a page-14 editorial believes there  are "real reasons for anxiety" over the National Peacekeeping  Force (NPKF) members' strike over pay. The strike, as well as  reports of "drunkenness, insubordination, desertion and racism  within the ranks" reinforces perceptions of the NPKF as "an  ill-disciplined, if not mutinous force." "To top it all, the  NPKF commander and former military ruler in Venda, Gabriel  Ramushwana, has been accused of being in receipt of money from  the Venda Pension Fund to which he is not entitled." "Meant to  serve as a model for the future, the NPKF has so far been a  generator of gloom."    No Time for International Mediation -- A second editorial on  the same page welcomes international mediation if it will bring  Buthelezi back into the constitutional process. "But it needs  to be realised that the mere logistics of this process are  daunting." The mediators would need more time "than is  available before the April election, which it would now be  highly unwise if not downright impossible to postpone."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   Inadequate Security for Election Process -- "How many times  have we heard government and police spokesman saying that  `violence will not be tolerated'?" notes a page-10 editorial in  Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 4 March. "With the best  will in the world, police cannot guarantee public safety." Just  as worrying as the security of the polling stations is "the  problem the police will face in combating ordinary crime with  their depleted numbers on election days. If 70,000 policemen  are indeed going to be on election duty, who is going to be on  the beat, or chasing criminals?" Although thousands of foreign  monitors will be on hand, "their job is to observe, not keep the  peace." "It is hoped that security chiefs will swallow their  pride and call on the expertise of their knowledgeable critics  in revising their strategies."  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   `Disjointed' Freedom Alliance -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in  English on 4 March in a page-10 editorial notes that the latest  reports are that "the Conservative Party is so racked by  internal dissent that it could see a breakaway rightwing group  registering for elections. There is general confusion and  distress -- not unexpected for a strange and disjointed grouping  united only by expedience -- in the Freedom Alliance. There is  likewise uncertainty in Natal and, it must be said, in the rest  of the country. For all these reasons Mandela must have read  the signals well -- there can be no lasting solution to the  country's problems without Buthelezi's inclusion and active  co-operation."  <H6>  CAPE TIMES </H6>   `Political Opportunism' in New Housing Scheme -- "Housing  Minister Louis Shill's unveiling of the government's massive new  housing subsidy scheme is a classic example of political  opportunism jeopardising political progress," points out Cape  Town CAPE TIMES in English on 2 March in a page-6 editorial.  "If the National Housing Forum [NHF] is correct, and Mr Shill  has jeopardised the scheme through a premature announcement, he  and his party will have much to answer for. The NHF and the ANC  [African National Congress] for that matter should, however,  avoid making the threat self-fulfilling." "Just as the  incumbent government does not deserve all the blame for failures  in the transition process, it cannot claim exclusive ownership  of the successes either."  <H6>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H6>   Official Indifference To Township Bloodletting --  Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN in English for 4-10  March in  a page-16 editorial says: "At first sight, the swift reaction  by state and private institutions to the Merriespruit slimes dam  disaster seemed to send messages of old. In sharp contrast to  the absence of meaningful response to violence on the East Rand,  where the average weekend death toll matches that of the dam  burst, the 15 white fatalities and destruction of property in  the [Orange] Free State provoked the prompt declaration of a  disaster area. Massive aid appeals were launched, topping  R[rand] 1 million within a week. Why, we might ask, have  government and the public not been able to react in a similar  fashion to the wholesale destruction of the communities of  Thokoza, Katlehong, and Vosloorus? Why is it that an apparent  act of God can generate a sense of urgency, while the daily  bloodletting in the townships meets increasing official  indifference?"  <H6>  BEELD </H6>   De Klerk Shows `Welcome' Leadership -- Johannesburg BEELD in  Afrikaans on 1 March says in a page-10 editorial: "In his  address to Parliament yesterday, State President de Klerk showed  why he, as an analytical thinker, has no equal in the government  and the National Party. In a short, powerful address he  analyzed the state of constitutional negotiations and summed it  up in a nutshell, and with a single stroke laid bare the  political opportunism of the leaders of the Freedom Alliance.  His conclusions were equally convincing: there is no longer any  reasonable excuse for nonparticipation in the election and the  national constitutional process." "For the first time he left  no doubt among Freedom Alliance and left-wing radicals that the  government would use every means at its disposal, including the  security forces, to protect the democratic process. The  firmness with which he declared that the police and the defense  force would defend the integrity of the state and the  constitution points to a newly found confidence in their loyalty  -- an assurance which all democrats will welcome and the kind of  leadership which the majority of South Africans expect of him.  President de Klerk's understanding of the concern of the Zulu  king and his followers over the future of the monarchy is only  partially shared. We do not believe that the Zulu king ought  necessarily to hold a unique position in any constitution. In  South Africa, with its unique ethnic diversity, such ethnic  exceptions create a recipe for ethnic conflict."    PAC Hostility Toward Journalists Intolerable -- A second  editorial on page 10 says: "The Pan-Africanist Congress' [PAC]  open hostility towards journalists, and in particular white  journalists, is becoming intolerable." "At the weekend PAC  leaders and supporters called for the summary shooting of white  journalists attending the funeral of PAC's Sabelo Phama in  Transkei. The guns of the organization's armed wing should be  turned on the white journalists, mourners said." "This kind of  naked racism is worrying. In the emotionally laden atmosphere  of such a funeral things could easily have taken a tragic turn.  Until the PAC leadership publicly repudiates these statements,  the PAC should not be surprised if journalists give a wide berth  to its election rallies. And that could only be to the  disadvantage of the PAC itself."    Criticism of Peacekeeping Force Members' Strike -- The  strike  by National Peacekeeping Force members "necessitates urgent and  real steps by authorities and leaders involved in the government  in the transition process," says a page-10 editorial in  Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 2 March. "It just does not  seem as though the peace force is getting its act together."  "If there is so much disaffection in the peace force, how on  earth will it succeed in ensuring peace during the election  itself?" "South Africa's political leaders must realize that  the problems in the peace force have the pontential to make the  transition, which is already proving to be very difficult, even  more so. Which is why urgent steps must be taken."    Housing Issue Too Politicized -- A second editorial on page  10 of BEELD says: "National Housing Minister Louis Shill  yesterday landed in the crossfire once again over his efforts to  ease the problems of South Africa's millions of homeless people.  In the Transitional Executive Council yesterday Mr. Cyril  Ramaphosa of the ANC went so far as to demand Mr. Shill's  resignation" for having allegedly acted without the approval of  the National Housing Forum. "The announcement of the housing  scheme, said Mr. Ramaphosa, was made for political gain in the  run-up to the election. Last year Mr. Moses Mayekiso on several  occasions accused Mr. Shill of unilateral action. As was the  case then, it is difficult to separate valid critism from  politically motivated criticism. One thing is certain: the  whole issue of housing has for a long time been highly  politicized. In the circumstances, one could hardly imagine  that Mr. Shill could believe he could issue such an important  announcement unilaterally. The ball is now in Mr. Shill's court  to prove that he acted with the necessary support of the  National Housing Forum."  <H6>  ILANGA </H6>   Call for Community Protection -- Durban ILANGA in Zulu for  28  February-2 March in a page-4 editorial notes it is a "mere eight  weeks" before election day. ILANGA cannot figure out "when the  ANC, and other groups that are campaigning, will begin preparing  to ensure a peaceful election. We do not know when the  government itself will flex its muscle to put some fear into  these lawbreakers who insist on disrupting the lives of people."  "Ideally voters should be experiencing peace already in their  communities. Even those from overseas cannot bring peace if  there is no peace within the country. We have peace agreements  that were signed by various groups in the country, they too are  broken day and night and nobody cares. Parties on the election  campaign trail have their rallies disrupted by lawless groups,  and some party leaders even end up canceling meetings in some  areas." "The nation is without any protection. It has become a  cardinal sin to belong to a political party, and yet Mr. de  Klerk and others say there can be no disruption of elections.  Does this mean that the protection of the masses will only  begin on election day? We feel that the protection of  communities should have long begun, so that come election day  all is quiet, with everyone wary of disturbing the peace, but as  things are now, lives are in danger. When will the campaign to  protect the people of this country from strife begin?"</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 20 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of  the South Korean National Democratic Front [SKNDF] (Hanminjon)  issued a statement on May 14 concerning the recent discovery of  much plutonium in Japan, the Seoul-based radio Voice of National  Salvation reported.    The statement said:    The discovery of 70 kg of plutonium in Japan is patent proof  that the Japanese authorities, while accelerating nuclear  armament behind the curtain of "peaceful nuclear development"  for scores of years, have produced and stockpiled a large amount  of plutonium in secrecy and are diverting it for military  purposes in actuality.    This also clearly proves that the surveillance system of the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] is not mechanism for  nuclear non-proliferation but a tool of pressure and aggression  allowing the United States and other nuclear-weapon states to  dominate non-nuclear weapon states.    With a view to diverting to the North the attention of Asia  and the rest of the world concerned over Japan's nuclear  armament, the Japanese authorities are playing the role of a  shock brigade in the anti-DPRK nuclear racket of the United  States and promoting their nuclear armament in real earnest  behind the big scene made over the "suspicion of the nuclear  development" by the North.    Japan's nuclear armament is a cancer in the peace of Asia  and  the rest of the world.    The danger of nuclear war on the Korean peninsula is growing  due to Japan's efforts to become a nuclear power.    Nevertheless, the United States and the IAEA are kicking up  a  pressure campaign against the North over its "nuclear suspicion"  while closing their eyes to Japan's undisguised nuclear  armament. This is a grave violation of international justice,  peace and impartiality.    We express the hope that the governments, political parties  and organisations of all countries that love justice and peace  and pursue common prosperity and development as well as  international organisations will more extensively organise the  struggle to check Japan's ambitious nuclear armament and  establish a new order of nuclear control based on international  impartiality.    Our Hanminjon will in the future, too, wage a strong  anti-war, anti-nuke peace movement against Japan's nuclear  armament threatening peace and human existence in the Korean  peninsula, Asia and the rest of the world and against the  anti-North nuclear intrigues of the United States and  international reactionary forces intended to put the Korean  peninsula on the altar of a nuclear war.</p>

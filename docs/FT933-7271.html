			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Consumer boost to recovery is forecast CONSUMERS ARE in a stronger financial position than generally realised, with the result that consumer spending can provide 'a solid bedrock' for durable economic recovery in the years ahead, a research paper from SG Warburg Securities says. Giving what they call 'a Consumer Health Check', two Warburg economists, Mr Kevin Gardiner and Mr Darren Winder, say that UK consumers as a whole have built up an 'extremely healthy' cashflow position while the personal sector balance sheet looks 'encouragingly firm'. While much of the City is eagerly anticipating a cut in interest rates to support economic recovery, they suggest that the government may eventually have to consider limiting growth of consumer de-mand rather than boosting it. The Warburg economists note that the recent recession and falling house prices have created the phenomenon of negative equity where the value of a property falls below the value of the mortgage. But they say that the problem has been exaggerated. They argue that conventional measures of negative equity take no account of the value of endowment policies against which many mortgages have been secured. The negative equity issue has been further defused by a tentative recovery in house prices and lower interest rates. In spite of the recession and lower house prices, consumers in aggregate are 'still substantially better off than they were a decade ago'. Although the ratio of personal-sector net wealth to disposable income fell from 514.2 per cent at the end of 1988 to 431.6 per cent at the end of last year, it was still about one third higher than the 322.7 per cent level of 1980. The economists say that consumer spending has been reviving since the second quarter of last year and that the recovery so far has been very much consumer-led. They expect further steady growth in consumer spending will result from a fall in the savings ratio from last year's 11.5 per cent of disposable incomes as a more settled macro-economic environment, falling real interest rates and stable wealth give more encouragement to consumers. The Warburg paper contrasts with a report from Lehman Brothers International, the US-owned investment house. It ranks the UK personal sector behind Germany, France, Japan, the US and Canada for the severity of its balance sheet and cashflow problems.</p>

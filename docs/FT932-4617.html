			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (5): The bigger, the better - Why the trend to larger widebody jets seems unstoppable SIZE rather than speed is becoming the dominant trend in commercial aviation. 'The next big challenge for the industry will be the development of ever-larger jumbos capable of carrying 600 to 800 passengers rather than a second generation supersonic airliner,' says Mr Adam Brown, planning director at the European Airbus consortium. The average size of airliners has been growing steadily during the past decade from 176 seats in 1980 to 193 seats last year. Boeing, the world's biggest commercial aircraft manufacturer with about 60 per cent of the western market, forecasts the average will increase to about 227 seats by 2010. It expects larger widebody aircraft will account for 58 per cent of all seats delivered during the next 18 years. This trend towards larger aircraft is driven by two factors: long-range, non-stop travel is expanding while on shorter routes big aircraft are seen as a way of beating congestion at busy airports. The new generation of jumbos also offers airline operators the opportunity to reduce their operating costs through a combination of enhanced technology and greater capacity. Although the recession in the airline industry has forced the three big manufacturers - Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Airbus - to cut production following a series of order cancellations and deferrals from financially pressed airline customers, all have forged ahead with development of new widebody aircraft. Boeing, which has dominated the long-distance widebody market with its four-engine 747 jumbo, is now in advanced development of the 777, a new family of twin-engine widebody airliners with versions for medium range flights and others for longer routes. It has invested about Dollars 4bn in the development of the 777 which will enter service in 1995. The three Japanese aerospace companies (Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Fuji Heavy Industries) have participated closely in this programme with a share of around 20 per cent of the new aircraft. The European Airbus consortium is now mounting an increasing challenge against Boeing's dominance of the big widebody market with its new family of A330/A340 widebodies. The A340 entered service this year. This four-engine airliner boasts the longest range of any civil aircraft capable of flying non-stop with a full passenger load for 16 hours or more. Later this year, the European consortium will start delivering to customers the A330, the twin engine sister of the A340. In this market, McDonnell Douglas is competing with its MD11 three-engine jet. Although it has been retrenching heavily in the face of the industry slump, it is continuing to study the development of a larger stretch version of the MD11 as well as of a new, even bigger four-engine jumbo, the MD12. However, these plans depend on the company's ability to complete the restructuring of its commercial aircraft activities by finding new international partners to invest in these operations and help fund the development of new large aircraft. McDonnell Douglas attempted to negotiate a partnership with Taiwan Aerospace but the Dollars 2bn deal finally fell through last year. The US company is now talking to potential partners in the Asia-Pacific region as well as other parts of the world to create a new joint partnership company for its commercial aircraft activities. Apart from the big three western civil aircraft manufacturers, the Russian aerospace industry, with a long history of producing very large aircraft, is now also seeking to penetrate the western widebody market. It is forming alliances with western aerospace partners to develop jets for the Commonwealth of Independent States and other world markets. To compete against the A330/A340, the 777 and the MD11, the Russian manufacturer Ilyushin has co-operated closely with US manufacturers to develop the Ilyushin 96M. This four-engine widebody with seating capacity for 386 passengers is the fruit of co-operation between the Russians, the US Pratt &amp; Whitney group, which is providing the engines for the new aircraft, and Rockwell-Collins, which is supplying the avionic equipment and systems. European and other US aerospace companies are now increasingly interested in working with the Russian industry. While strong on airframes, the Russians are seeking western help in particular for engines, avionics and cabin interiors to develop new airliners according to western standards for aircraft certification and passenger comfort. But the biggest challenge of all for the commercial aircraft manufacturers will be the development of a very large aircraft capable of seating up to 800 passengers. Boeing, Airbus and McDonnell Douglas have all been studying plans to build a super jumbo. They have already had extensive meetings with potential airline customers to discuss their needs and the possible timing when they would require a very large aircraft to enter service. 'Both Boeing and Airbus came to see us some time ago to ask us whether we had greater need for a new generation supersonic aircraft or a super jumbo. We said the big aircraft,' says Mr Kenzo Yoshikawa, purchasing director of the Japanese airline All Nippon Airways. Other large carriers in the Asia-Pacific region, the US and a few in Europe have also expressed interest in a new large aircraft to enter their fleets at the turn of this century. But the development of a super jumbo faces significant technical and financial hurdles. 'It's always a nightmare building a big aircraft,' says Mr Ken Brundle, head of aircraft operations at Shorts, the Belfast-based aerospace company. An aircraft of such size will require a significant amount of composite materials to keep its weight down. Many safety issues are raised, such as how to evacuate large numbers of passengers from both the top and upper decks of a double deck airliner. Terminal gates will probably need to be redesigned and runways strengthened. For maintenance, new extra large hangars will have to be built. 'Existing ground facilities and equipment are simply not adequate to handle such a double deck giant aircraft,' says Mr Hideo Aoki, the engineering and maintenance director of ANA. The costs of developing a super jumbo are an even bigger obstacle. The manufacturers estimate development would cost well over Dollars 10bn. 'From an economic standpoint the crucial question will be how many of these aircraft will be needed. Estimates range from 200-300 aircraft to around 600-700 aircraft. I think 300 is probably the more realistic number,' Mr Yoshikawa says. At these costs, no single company could contemplate assuming the full risk of developing a super jumbo on its own. The only way forward will be through wide-scale co-operation between big manufacturers. This has already led to perhaps a significant move in international collaboration in the commercial aircraft industry with Boeing's decision to join forces with the four Airbus partners (Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche Aerospace, British Aerospace and Casa of Spain) to study jointly a super jumbo. These companies are now also seeking to encourage others to join them including McDonnell Douglas in the US, the Russians and Japanese manufacturers. All agree that there is unlikely to be room for more than one super jumbo project.</p>

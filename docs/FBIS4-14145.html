			<p>BFN     [Text] Algiers, 27 Apr, KUNA--Algerian Foreign Affairs  Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri today expressed his "astonishment  that there was some confusion" over his country's position on  the crisis resulting from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. He said  that the position adopted from the beginning "was clear and  demanded the immediate withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwaiti  territory."    He added, in an interview with the Kuwaiti news agency, that  the visit of Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad, first deputy prime minister  and foreign minister, to Algeria "was an opportunity to remove  the misunderstanding resulting from the crisis caused by the  Iraqi invasion of Kuwait."    The Algerian foreign minister also called for the rebuilding  of Arab solidarity in accordance with principles that take into  account the national character of every people of the Arab  nation and that respect the sovereignty of states and their  existing borders. Dembri also said: "The Arab world needs  solidarity to confront external challenges." He indicated that  this did not mean ignoring the foundations and principles on  which such a solidarity had to be built. He added, in this  respect, that his talks with Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad, Kuwaiti  first deputy prime minister and foreign minister, dealt with  ways to achieve an effective Arab solidarity that would be  beneficial to the Arab nation.    Regarding the future of Kuwaiti-Algerian relations in the  light of Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad's visit, Dembri said that the  talks between the two sides "will give a big boost to bilateral  relations." He added that the relations between the two  countries "are solid and good but they need to be somewhat  revived in a number of areas."</p>

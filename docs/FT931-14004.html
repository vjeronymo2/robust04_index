			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Hatton 'at centre of web' in land deal MR DEREK HATTON, the former deputy leader of Liverpool City Council, was paid almost Pounds 120,000 to help push through a corrupt Pounds 1.8m land deal, the Crown Court at Mold, Clwyd, was told yesterday. Mr Hatton was alleged to have been at 'the centre of the web' in a plot to cheat the council by dishonestly using confidential information. Mr Hatton; former councillors Mr John Nelson and Ms Hannah Folan; and two businessmen, Mr Roy Stewart and Mr John Monk, all deny charges of conspiring to defraud Liverpool City Council. Mr Alan Rawley QC, prosecuting, said Settleside, Mr Hatton's public relations company, received an average of almost Pounds 30,000 a year from Mr Stewart over a four-year period. He said Ms Folan passed to Mr Hatton the confidential information that a 20-acre site in the city was to be offered for commercial development. He claimed Mr Hatton, who ceased to be a councillor in 1987, told Mr Stewart, head of a development company, that the land was to be made available for retail purposes. Mr Rawley also alleged that the council committee which Ms Folan chaired had given Mr Stewart an option to buy the land against the advice of council officials that it should be offered for tender. Mr Stewart's company, Rogerson Developments, paid Settleside regular sums for 'public relations and research', said Mr Rawley. 'That is an awful lot of public relations.' The trial continues.</p>

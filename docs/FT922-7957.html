			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: Equitable flotation scheme wins approval THE New York State Insurance Department has given the go-ahead for the demutualisation scheme at The Equitable Life Assurance Society, the large US life insurer. This is by far the largest US demutualisation - the process whereby a mutual insurer, controlled by its policyholders, turns itself into a 'conventional' shareholder-owned company. Equitable policyholders have already approved the move. The next step in the process will be the flotation of Equitable shares on the stock market, an event scheduled for this summer. Once that is complete, Axa, the French insurance group, should emerge with a 40 per cent to 49 per cent stake in Equitable in return for its Dollars 1bn infusion of capital into the ailing US group last year. Axa said that the initial public offering of Equitable shares in The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the US was expected to take place in July, following a period for appeals against the demutualisation approval.</p>

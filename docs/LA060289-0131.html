			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LISTEN: ONE-OF-A-KIND CLOTHES  </P> <P> "Diversity" is the name of the newest fashion game in town, and it debuts today  on the fourth floor of the Cooper Building in downtown Los Angeles. Key players  are graduates of the Fashion Industry of Design and Merchandising, who will  sell their one-of-a-kind clothing and accessories for men, women and children  every week from now on, Thursday through Sunday. Along with jewelry and  hand-painted T-shirts, there are more unusual, wintry items, such as alpaca  coats and real-fur earmuffs. According to an FIDM spokesperson, the idea for  Diversity came from London, where Hyper Hyper, a company formed by a group of  young fashion designers, is causing quite a stir.  </P> <P> Supermarket Sweep  </P> <P> John Candy let the folks in Brentwood see that he's just a regular guy when he  parked his Mercedes outside the Vicente Foods market and did the family grocery  shopping all by himself. He even loaded up the car on his own -- filled the  back seat with at least six hefty bags full. As for his attire that afternoon,  Candy chose a white polo shirt and a Perry Como-style, navy cardigan.  </P> <P> Comic Flair Royally  </P> <P> "She had every designer in the world to choose from, but she chose me," said  Tere Tereba after funny lady Sandra Bernhard wore a dress from the designer's  spring collection to perform in London for Prince Charles and Princess Diana.  The dress is ankle-length, off-the-shoulder and tight fitting, with an  embroidered net shawl to go with it. Tereba says it is available at the Shauna  Stein boutique.  </P> <P> Astonishing Reproductions  </P> <P> "Astonish me" are the words art director Alexey Brodovitch would snap during  his reign at Harper's Bazaar magazine, from 1934 to 1958. The astonishing  results, including photographic masterpieces by Richard Avedon, are part of an  exhibit of over-sized, magazine-page reproductions at the Art Center College of  Design in Pasadena. Look for Audrey Hepburn, Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra  among the famous faces. The exhibit is open to the public through June 31 and  free of charge.  </P> <P> Liza's Vacation Wear  </P> <P> Liza Minnelli was in town doing a little shopping for her upcoming vacation in  Cap d'Antibes, where she and husband Mark Gero are borrowing a friend's villa  for three weeks of R&amp;R. While taking in the Riviera, stepmom Lee Minnelli  reports, Liza will be wearing L.A. designer Louis Estevez's new matador look:  white high-waisted silk pants and his full-sleeved, white-and-black Dalmation  spot blouse. When she tires of that, she can switch into the black version of  same, which she also bought at Estevez's Melrose Avenue shop.  </P> <P> She's Definitely Not Fur It  </P> <P> Actress Julianne Phillipes, celebrity photographer Greg Gorman and fashion  model Janice Dickinson gathered together at Chantal Cloutier's house (she owns  Cloutier, the styling, makeup and hair agency) to reconsider fashion's role in  protecting animals. Cloutier announced that she will exercise her considerable  clout from now on, by refusing to book her clients on fashion projects that  involve real animal fur. "Wearing real fur advocates cruelty to animals," she  feels. If that's not enough: "Wearing fur is simply unfashionable."  </P> <P> Very Accessible  </P> <P> Hey Bubb! That's Brian Bubb, who designed the Perry Ellis menswear line until  he departed from the company a year ago. (Roger Forsythe replaced him.) Bubb  now plans to launch his own collection of neckwear and evening accessories,  starting with Holiday 1989. He'll include neckties, bow ties, vests and  cummerbunds, label the line simply Bubb and market it as "exquisite and  expensive." (Ties retail for about $50-$60.) He says he has an animal-print  group called "Oh Sauvage" in his first collection. And he can explain why:  "People get too deadly serious about fashion. You should have fun with a tie."  </P> <P> Just the Short of It  </P> <P> Not everybody thinks Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts is a fashion  wipeout. Even though he boasts about his bargain-basement suits and his frayed  shirt sleeves, he managed to make the top of this year's shorter men in America  fashion "in" list. Listen hears from Bob Stern, who owns Short Sizes Inc., the  Cleveland store that issues the verdict, that Dukakis is No. 1 because he knows  the secret to shorter-man dressing with style. "It's proper proportions" Stern  asserts. Others in this year's lineup (all of them 5-foot-8 or less) are  composer Leonard Bernstein (5 feet, 8 inches), publisher Malcolm Forbes (5  feet, 7 inches), talk-show host Dick Cavett (5 feet, 3 inches) and actor Danny  DeVito (5 feet, 1 inch). Stern, who measures in at 5-feet-2, also tells us that  his mail-order-catalogue business is booming, especially in Japan.  </P></p>

"I was commissioned by the city of Cannes to do  something with an environmental theme, and I did a mural on air pollution.  </P> <P> "An artist's mind is always open to people and problems," he said, "but it's  sometimes difficult to work in urban settings because of noise, traffic and  pollution."  </P> <P> University High School student Carlo Mattoni attained the highest overall  individual score in this year's Los Angeles Unified School District's Academic  Decathalon competition.  </P> <P> He scored 8,233 points in the 10-category competition.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Novi Sad, 18 Apr (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik,  president of the assembly of the Srpska republic, today said  that the Serbs were disappointed with the fact that the  situation in Gorazde had not calmed down following yesterday's  talks with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's special envoy  Yasushi Akashi.    We expected the situation to calm down. Instead, the Muslims  are making every effort to improve their military positions and  to depict themselves as victims in order to provoke military  intervention, Krajisnik told Novi Sad radio.    He said that the Muslim side did not want a cease-fire, nor  does it want a cease-fire across the entire territory of former  Bosnia-Herzegovina [as received]. He said that the Srpska  republic is attempting in every possible way to present the  truth to the world and prove that the Muslim side has brought  about the latest crisis around Gorazde.    We have, Krajisnik stressed, ceased all military activity  around Gorazde. The foreign media are, however, spreading lies  and claims that a large number of shells are still being fired  on Gorazde from Serb positions and that the Serb forces are  allegedly trying to occupy the town.    Krajisnik said that this was not true, stressing that the  Serb forces were on the right bank of the Drina and that they  did not want to cross onto the left bank, as envisaged under the  agreement [not further specified].</p>

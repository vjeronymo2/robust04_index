			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "The Peace Process and the U.S.  Problem," the newspaper AL-BA'TH comments on U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher's upcoming tour of the region, saying:  What is important is to know how far the peace process has gone,  and to evaluate the efforts made by the full partner in this  regard. The United States has chosen to play the role of a full  partner. This U.S. commitment has placed responsibility on the  shoulders of the U.S. Administration. It has made it incumbent  on the U.S. Administration to honor the terms of reference  agreed upon for the peace process it launched. That is, this  commitment requires the U.S. Administration to uphold the  relevant UN resolutions, and the principles of international  legitimacy, as well.    In this regard, there is no room for anything called  neutrality, or the role of a mailman. For the United States  does not have responsibilities only in its capacity as the  actual sponsor of the peace process, but also in its capacity as  the greatest power on Earth at present, and as a member of the  UN Security Council, not to mention its responsibilities with  regard to UN resolutions. Given all this, there is no room for  neutrality. The United States can either be a supporter or an  opponent of international legitimacy.    The paper adds: We in Syria support international  resolutions and charters. In the same vein, we support the  principles and objectives of the peace process. We have agreed  to participate in this process on the basis of the parameters  the United States proposed to regional players. We have  cooperated to make this process a success, because we actually  look forward to attaining a just and comprehensive peace.    The paper indicates that Israel, which is opposed to  international legitimacy, has defied the international community  and rebelled against it. Worse still, it has violated the  resolutions of the world body. Hence, the problem lies in the  Israeli position. The paper adds: We are not asking the United  States to side with either Syria or the Arabs. What we are  demanding is that the United States support the terms of  reference of the peace initiative it has launched. Moreover, we  are asking it to uphold international resolutions. Any  departure from this would be a concession to those who have  rebelled against such legitimacy and acted against peace.    AL-BA'TH concludes by saying: If the U.S. Administration is  to play its role as a full partner in the peace process in a  convincing manner, it should not succumb to the lame Israeli  reasoning, which is grounded in usurpation, occupation, and  aggression. This is a must if the region is to be rid of the  vicious circle of escalation, tension, wars, and bloodshed.    Under the headline "From the Peace Opportunity to War," the  newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: Israel, which has constantly managed  to avert any progress in the stalemated peace talks, has  exacerbated the situation and driven the region to the point of  explosion under the very nose of the entire world community in  order to kill the current peace opportunity once and for all.    The paper believes the constant and escalating Israeli  aggression against Lebanon poses the greatest challenge to the  international community, which has seen how Israel has dealt  successive blows to the peace process, which in turn has turned  into crossword puzzle entangled by Israeli conditions, excuses,  and aggressive practices.    The paper urges the international community and the United  States to put an end to Israeli belligerence and arrogance, to  Israel's disregard for international resolutions and the  international community's efforts to achieve a just and  comprehensive peace. It also calls upon them to immediately  halt all forms of Israeli aggression.    Concluding its commentary, the paper says: Unless the  international community shoulders its responsibilities by  deterring Israeli aggression, this aggression will push the  region in the direction of an explosion, whose results are  unpredictable.    In another commentary entitled "Where is Justice," the  newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: The situation in southern Lebanon  has seen a serious deterioration. It has become a hotbed of  tension that threatens to drown the region in an endless  whirlpool of violence and chaos, thanks to the constant Israeli  attacks on southern Lebanese villages and towns.    The paper explains that the continuation of this serious  situation in southern Lebanon, caused by the escalation of  constant Israeli attacks, will cause the peace process to  collapse and dash all the hopes for a just and comprehensive  peace in the Middle East.    The paper holds Israeli leaders responsible for this  uncomfortable situation, and also for the failure of the  stalemated peace process to bear fruit.</p>

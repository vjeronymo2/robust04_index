This  resignation, which occurred yesterday, has not yet been  officially confirmed. However, the national daily L'ESSOR said  in today's issue that Mr. Sow did not participate in yesterday's  regular cabinet meeting. Oumar Toure has the details:    [Toure] Prime Minister Abdoulaye Sekou Sow resigned  yesterday. This report has not yet been confirmed by the  presidency, but, according to sources close to the prime  minister's office, the outgoing head of government was said to  be categorical on his decision. This resignation, according to  the same sources, reportedly followed a crisis of confidence  between the resigning prime minister and the majority party, on  one hand, and the prime minister and some political parties  represented within the government, on the other.    This resignation comes at a time when Mali is trying to come  to equitable and appropriate solutions to the situation  generated by the devaluation of the CFA franc and also at a time  when high school and university students are demonstrating  against the criteria for the awarding of scholarships.  Abdoulaye Sekou Sow entered the first government of the Third  Republic as defense minister. He was appointed prime minister  on 12 April 1993, following the resignation of Younoussi Toure's  cabinet. He was later reappointed on 7 November 1993 to head  the broad-based democratic cabinet. According to reliable  sources, talks are under way at the political level to designate  the new prime minister.</p>

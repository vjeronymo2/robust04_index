			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Consumer prices soar in Turkey CONSUMER prices in Turkey rose 7.4 per cent in September, the highest rate since January, according to the state institute of statistics, writes John Murray Brown in Istanbul. The rise was fuelled by a 10 per cent rise in agricultural price, including a 31 per cent jump in fruit and vegetable prices. In manufacturing, private sector prices rose 5.5 per cent over August, and state industries 5.8 per cent. With the year-on-year inflation rate now running at 67.7 per cent, few economists believe the government will achieve its forecast target of 45-50 per cent by the year end.</p>

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: French banks see further property loan losses FRENCH banks will continue to shoulder losses from their exposure to the troubled property market for the next three to six years, but the worst seems to be over, the head of the AFB French banking association said yesterday. The problems of the Parisian property market needed 'a specific solution,' but 'this does not mean necessarily that there is need for financial assistance from the public authorities,' Mr Michel Freyche, the AFB's president, told Les Echos newspaper. 'We need adjustments of fiscal and regulatory measures,' he added. Banks wanted to spread their property provisions over time, as they did with sovereign debts, so as to benefit from a future improvement market conditions. Mr Freyche was unable to estimate AFB members' exposure to the property market, where average commercial rentals in central Paris have fallen by 20 per cent from a peak three years ago. Estimates of French banks' property loans vary from FFr250bn (Dollars 45.4bn), by the Paris commercial court, to FFr500bn by Paribas and Suez, the investment banks. Estimates of the banking industry's property losses vary from FFr45bn to FFr80bn. 'By the end of three to six years, the crisis will be completely over and with it the potential losses,' he said. Mr Freyche gave a lukewarm reception to the tax and regulatory measures launched by the government last month to stimulate the property industry. The measures were 'positive and useful but insufficient.' Last year had been 'difficult, above all for banks strongly exposed to property,' said Mr Freyche. 'On top of this came the difficulties of the economic situation, with a record year for small business bankruptcies. I think, however, that 1993 will be a better year for provisions on individual risks. The biggest provisions seem to me to behind us,' he predicted.</p>

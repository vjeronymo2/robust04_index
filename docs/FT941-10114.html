			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Russia 'must print money or face crisis' The new Russian government is in a critical financial position and will need to print vast quantities of money to avoid financial collapse, Mr Jakov Urinson, first deputy economics minister, told the state duma (lower house) yesterday. Mr Urinson said 75 per cent of Russian enterprises were urgently calling for priority support because of heavy debts, and that the budget deficit in the first quarter of the year had already mounted to Rbs12,000bn. In an account which lay much blame at the door of the former administration, Mr Urinson said the government's failure to pay wages and other bills last year had left a huge budget deficit in the first quarter of this year. At the same time, short-term, three-month bonds issued by the last government were now falling due, to the tune of Rbs850bn. Mr Urinson said the demands from enterprises for more credits had aggravated the crisis, and that a document was being prepared discriminating between those enteprises needing funding and those which should be allowed to fail. He said Rbs130,000bn would be set aside for investment in the forthcoming budget - with the share of investment going to defence unchanged, but the security budget being raised. Some 40 per cent of expenditure would be devoted to social spending. The target for monthly inflation by the end of the year was 10 per cent, he said, and the government was aiming to reduce the budget deficit to 5-6 per cent of gross national product. The crisis appears to be compounded by a lack of any new ideas from the government of Mr Victor Chernomyrdin whose members had sworn to fight inflation and budget deficits by means other than the monetary ones favoured by Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former finance minister, and Mr Yegor Gaidar, the former first deputy prime minister for the economy. Mr Fyodorov, who was present at the hearings as a parliamentary deputy, said: 'If we don't stop the collapse of the financial system we will have to change the government every three months.' In newspaper interviews, Mr Gaidar said attempts were being made in plans put forward by academics and former ministers, to reinstate controls which would prevent stabilisation of the economy. These would 'bring the country back to chaos,' he said. However, Mr Urinson said the much-criticised high taxes would stay, but enterprises' bank accounts would be scrutinised more rigorously and further controls would be put on payments to regions and republics within Russia.</p>

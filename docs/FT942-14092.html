			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: Casualties of a currency crisis  -Turkey's banks seem ill-prepared for the storm Turkey's currency crisis has thrown up its first bank casualties. The Treasury stepped in last week to close down the small Istanbul-based Turkish Tourism and Investment bank TYT, and the Istanbul stock exchange yesterday suspended trading in Marbank, a small trade finance bank. With a growing likelihood of mergers and consolidations - if not liquidations - of some private banks, the sole consolation is that the crisis may well result in a long overdue shake-out of Turkey's banking industry. The moves raise questions about the durability of the Turkish financial system and the country's 70 banks, in the wake of what has been the worst financial crisis in more than a decade. The sector appears ill-prepared to weather the storm. Turkish banks are under-capitalised, although some improvements have been made in recent years to meet international standards on capital adequacy. More important, Turkey's recent economic development has been highly leveraged. With a real interest differential as high as 20 per cent, many banks have been funding their lira loan book through foreign borrowings. However, with the lira slipping by more than 50 per cent against the dollar since the start of the year, many banks face heavy foreign exchange losses when they come to collect on their loans. Interbank rates touched 1,000 per cent in March, although rates had yesterday slipped back to 150 per cent. With this sort of volatility many banks suffer a mismatch between the interest paid on short-term deposits, and the income earned on long-term Treasury bills, which they are obliged to hold to meet central bank reserve requirements. As the economy heads towards recession, there are deeper worries about asset quality with reports that even for blue chip companies, banks are having to recapitalise their loans and roll over interest. Banks such as the Sabanci group's Akbank, which have a strong deposit base and are less dependent on foreign funding, are likely to be best off. It is among the smaller, non-deposit taking banks that the losses are likely to be most acute. There are particular reasons for the troubles at TYT and its parent company Lapis Holding. Last July, the group agreed a Dollars 213m takeover of an 89 per cent stake in Disbank, a small trade finance bank for Dollars 213m, Isbank, the semi-autonomous state bank. This was Turkey's largest bank takeover. Isbank was paid one installment of Dollars 75m, but took promissory notes from Lapis for the remainder, secured by Disbank shares. In the wake of TYT's troubles, Isbank confirmed this week it had re-acquired Disbank. The broader issue concerns the quality of official bank supervision. Why, for example, was Lapis, better known as a gold trader and tour operator, given Treasury permission to take over Disbank, a reputable trade finance bank? If TYT's demise is to foreshadow a series of bank failures, the government is presented with a much larger headache. Until now, insolvent private banks were always bailed out by the state. Given the government's cash constraints, a similar course seems unlikely today. However, bankers point out that Turkey's rudimentary insurance scheme will cover barely a fraction of the amounts due to depositors and correspondent banks. Mr Aykon Dogan, the economy minister, recently gave the banking sector a clean bill of health. Among officials in Ankara, concern at bank failures is tempered by anxiety not to be seen to rush in to bail out the shareholders. 'You make money. You can lose money too. That's a fact of life,' said a Treasury official. Foreign exchange losses are one area of concern. The recent currency turbulence will have hit profitability as banks seek to close their open foreign exchange positions - the difference between foreign exchange liabilities and Turkish lira assets. At the end of 1993 the total open position of the banking sector stood at Dollars 4bn-Dollars 5bn. According to an unofficial estimate, over the last few weeks, bank foreign exchange losses have totalled more three times what they made in profits on their open positions in the whole of 1993. These problems may pale beside the possible losses from non-performing loans. During the first quarter, bankers were able to collect on interest payments. But with many industries standing down labour and slowing production, the second quarter could be much more difficult. Liquidity is particularly tight for companies dependent on government contracts. 'The problem is that at this time you should have zero credits, zero T-bills and a surplus of dollars - and who's in that position?' said Mr Haluk Dayigil of Korfezbank.</p>

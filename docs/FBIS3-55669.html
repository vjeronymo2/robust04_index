			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Jan 10, BNS -- The chairman of the  opposition Coalition Party, Tiit Vahi, accused Prime Minister  Mart Laar of failure to cope with his duties and said it was the  head of the government rather than the Cabinet as such that  needed replacement.    "Our (the Coalition Party's -- BNS) position is that the  head  of government is failing to cope with his tasks," Vahi said.  Vahi, the predecessor of Mart Laar in the prime minister's  office, said his party would be ready for cooperation if the  opportunity came up to appoint a new prime minister candidate.    Vahi said there was no constitutional crisis in Estonia, as  the constitution gives the president the right to sack ministers  and approve new ministers into office.    "How the authors of the constitution meant it, is quite  another thing," Vahi said.    But the Coalition Party leader also added he had been  somewhat bewildered by the president's decision not to relieve  the economics minister of office.    "In my personal opinion, this can be interpreted as the  president's wish to shape the setup of Mart Laar's Cabinet," he  said.    Vahi added that the interior political crisis emerged in  Estonia had to be resolved by intensive negotiations between the  prime minister and the president.</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Industry leaders welcome tax cuts LEADERS OF German industry yesterday abandoned their recent harsh criticism of the ruling coalition in Bonn, and praised a hard-fought compromise which will cut corporation tax from 53 per cent to 47 per cent of earnings. The deal, negotiated between the two houses of the German parliament, is less generous in the headline tax rate than the German government originally intended: the proposal approved by the Bundestag, the lower house, would have cut the rate to just 44 per cent. However the compromise negotiated after nine hours of talks late on Wednesday will reinstate depreciation allowances for company investments of up to 30 per cent, instead of cutting them to 25 per cent as planned. That deal was welcomed yesterday by both the federation of German industry (BDI) and the German chambers of industry and commerce (DIHT), both of which have been highly critical of the government recently. They had fought, supported by the opposition Social Democrats, to reinstate the 30 per cent depreciation allowance.</p>

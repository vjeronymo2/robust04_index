The ECONOMIC DAILY NEWS reported that the commission took  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and Organization  of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) regulations into  consideration before proposing to lift prohibitions and  limitations on foreign investments in the above fields.    Under the proposal, the report said, the ban on foreign  investment in oil refineries and real estate agencies will be  lifted.    In addition, restrictions on foreign investment in  residential construction, water and electricity supply, and  railway transportation will be eased, the report added.    Under the proposed changes, however, foreign investment in  oil refineries will be limited to a 30 percent stake in the  company.    The commission officials also said a ban on foreign  investment in the railway industry will be lifted sometime in  the future.    The easing of investment restrictions will be in line with  economic liberalization plans and help develop Taiwan into a  Asia- Pacific region business operations center, the officials  said.</p>

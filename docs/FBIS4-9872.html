			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by correspondent Gabriel Molina "for EL SOL DE </F> MEXICO": "The Cuban Economic Situation Will Make Ration Books  Disappear"; PRENSA LATINA in Spanish at 0259 GMT on 29 March  transmits a service message killing this item]    [Text] Havana -- The Cuban ration book is about to  disappear. Strangely enough, this is not because it is no longer  necessary, but because it is so necessary that it has become  unsustainable.    Researcher Dario Machado Rodriguez, director of the Center  for Social, Political, and Public Opinion Studies [Centro de  Estudios Sociopoliticos y de Opinion] told EL SOL DE MEXICO that  surveys and studies carried out among the population show, among  other things, that products should no longer be subsidized by  maintaining the so-called ration book. Consensus indicates,  however, that subsidies should be granted to people or families  with lower incomes or experiencing a particularly difficult  social situation.    "It is my opinion that the general subsidy offered by the  ration book should gradually disappear.    ``At the same time, salary policies should change. I believe  it is essential for these measures to include a wage  reevaluation, from which to establish some sort of  differentiation system. But this must be accomplished  gradually, not in one single blow.''    Machado pointed out the contradiction "between the policy of  egalitarianism implemented by the revolutionary process and the  inevitable nonegalitarian solution" to solve the crisis.    He explained that this is a basic problem that has been  examined during the meetings of the Parliaments in the  Workplace. According to the Cuban Workers Federation (CTC),  there have been about 80,000 such meetings. He added that "the  meetings allow us to better understand the crudeness of the  possible solutions and the realistic approach the situation  requires, in addition," he stressed, "the will to apply these  solutions gradually and not as a shock treatment."    Machado, a 1977 political science graduate, has worked as  the  Center's director for eight years. As a leading researcher, he  specializes in social issues.    He said the people have stayed abreast of the situation,  especially since the discussions at the plenary session of the  Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba last year and  later at the National Assembly of the People's Government.    "Our investigations show that the meetings in the workplace  have created an interest that has been increasing ever since  their inception. The debate itself, the goal of which is to  collect ideas, has generated enthusiasm and reaffirmed the  people's trust in their right to participate in the consensus  building process. In addition, I believe it has allowed people  to express their expectations regarding economic measures, which  billowed after the first measures were announced in June 1993."    Machado pointed out that two months after the possession of  dollars was deregulated, the expectation was that the situation  would improve. Self-employment had an 82 percent approval  rating, while 73 percent of those polled said that it would  create new jobs and 72 percent believed that it would help  reduce excess currency by establishing taxes on income. About  58 percent of those interviewed said that cooperative production  revenues are a good short-term initiative, while 73 percent said  the basic production units would increase food supplies and 80  percent believe they would help attract people to work  permanently in agriculture.    "Other studies indicate that basic achievements in  education,  health, and social security should not be affected because no  one should be left out in the cold. As a rule, however, there  should be no other similar egalitarian distribution."    With the exception of these three basic guarantees, the  socialist principle that preaches "to each according to his  ability and to each according to his work should apply," he  said, "because there is no other way of offering sufficient  incentive to get people to produce. It is, therefore, essential  to structure an economic system to guarantee equal pay for equal  work."    Official sources admit that since the crisis worsened,  egalitarianism -- the highest expression of which is the ration  book -- has increased absenteeism and the lack of motivation in  the workplace.</p>

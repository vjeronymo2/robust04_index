			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MCMARTIN JUROR IN HOSPITAL FOR TESTS  </P> <P> An ailing juror in the marathon McMartin Pre-School molestation trial has been  hospitalized for diagnostic tests and may have to be replaced by the last  remaining alternate.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders ordered the other jurors to  return today in the hope that he will have further information about the  juror's condition from his physician.  </P> <P> If the physician feels the juror will be unable to rejoin the panel next week  -- when the prosecution has scheduled a key rebuttal witness, an expert in  pedophilia -- testimony will resume Thursday with the alternate taking the  ailing man's seat.  </P> <P> Both sides have rested their cases, but rebuttal, surrebuttal and closing  arguments remain. Pounders has vowed to get the case to the jury by Dec. 1.  </P> <P> The judge has repeatedly voiced fears of "the probability" of a mistrial as the  number of jurors dwindles. Five have been released during the trial, now in its  29th month.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Ivan Ivanov, "head of the General </F> Staff `Material and Financial Resources Planning' Department,"  by Major Spiridon Spiridonov; place and date not given: "Army  Needs Much More Than 12.7 Billion Leva"]    [Excerpts] [Spiridonov] Is it true that the military  budget has been constantly decreasing in recent years?    [Ivanov] During the 1989-1994 period there is a continuing  tendency to reduce the country's military budget. If in 1989 it  was 8.1 percent of the national budget in 1990 it decreased to  6.7 percent. In 1991 and 1992 it was 7 percent, while in 1993  it dropped to 5.7 percent. What is envisaged for 1994 is within  the framework of 6.5 percent of the national budget, an amount  that is smaller than the 1990 budget. We regress to a lower  level. This is as far as absolute terms are is concerned. The  amount is actually much less when you consider the inflation  since 1990.    [Spiridonov] Is this tendency characteristic only of our  country or also of our neighbors?    [Ivanov] As far as I know there is no such tendency among  our neighbors.    [Spiridonov] The military themselves felt the insecurity and  irregularity of receiving funds from the Ministry of Defense.    [Ivanov] For almost six months (until June, when the 1993  budget was adopted), the army functioned with one twelfth of its  1992 budget. Throughout that entire period the prices and  inflation were completely different and the overall economic  situation was much more complex. As a result, at the end of the  first half of 1993 the army lagged behind in payments for  supplies, services, and repairs, both locally and  internationally, by more than $600 million. This fact had an  exceptionally negative effect on the suppliers of the various  branches of the army and resulted in refusal to supply the army  with various materials. I mean food, clothing, water, electric  power, and telephone services. The delay in the payments  prompted the suppliers in question to refuse the army's supply  orders. This process continued until the end of the year and  produced our unpaid debt of 480 million leva.    [Spiridonov] The issue of the army wages is probably in the  same category?    [Ivanov] All the established terms of paying army personnel  were violated. Pay for army officers, non-commissioned  officers, military employees, and soldiers was delayed by 5-10  days. Another paradox emerged: In July 1993 the pay of the  officers and non- commissioned officers was delayed by two  weeks. Naturally, this created great tension in the army units.  You know that in the remote garrisons, and not only there, the  young military families are in a very grave situation. Spouses  are unemployed and the families rely on a single salary.  [passage omitted]    [Spiridonov] What resources does the army need in 1994?    [Ivanov] After most responsibly reviewing the real situation  in the army and in accordance with the instructions of the  Finance Ministry on preparing the 1994 budget we prepared the  budget of the Ministry of Defense. All state institutions are  familiar with it. It is the most economic variant, which has  been coordinated with the army's real minimal needs.    [Spiridonov] Are you satisfied with the defense means  envisaged by the Finance Ministry's draft budget?    [Ivanov] The total military budget proposed by the Finance  Ministry amounts to 12.7 billion leva. It hardly covers a part  of the army's real needs. Priority again was given to the  everyday maintenance of the army, and not to the army's  technical supply, for which only 5 percent of the budget has  been envisaged. [passage omitted]</p>

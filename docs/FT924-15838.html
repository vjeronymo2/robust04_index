			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Blow for housebuilding body in competition case THE NATIONAL House Building Council yesterday lost its legal battle against the findings of a 1991 Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into new housing warranty services. A High Court judge rejected the council's application for judicial review of the MMC's conclusion that its 10-year structural warranty scheme was anti-competitive and against the public interest. The council had argued that the conclusion was 'irrational' and could fatally undermine the economics of the council and the protection it gives to house buyers. The case focused on a council rule requiring builders to present for inspection every home under construction and to obtain a structural warranty policy from the council. Mr Peter Lilley, then trade and industry secretary, had accepted the MMC's finding that the rule could restrict competition by deterring builders from using alternative warranty schemes available from other insurers. The council's main insurance competitor is Foundation 15 - a subsidiary of the leading local government insurer Municipal Mutual Insurance, which last night imposed an indefinite freeze on claims payments. Mr Basil Bean, council chief executive, said after the hearing that the organisation was considering an appeal. 'The MMC's recommendations threaten the interests of new home buyers,' he added. The MMC said last night it was delighted with the decision. In the past five years there have been 10 judicial review challenges to MMC decisions including the NHBC case. In five cases the MMC's decisions were upheld; two are under appeal and two relating to the supply of razor blades are still pending.</p>

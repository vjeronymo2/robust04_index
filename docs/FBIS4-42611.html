			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ben Fayot, chariman of the Socialist Workers </F> Party: "Is the Democratic Party the Main Opposition Party?"]    [Text] Democratic Party [DP] circles are upset about the  numerous attacks against the DP. They consider this a plot to  keep the DP out of the goverment.    Even worse, they claim that the CSV [Christian Social  People's Party] and LSAP [Socialist Workers' Party of  Luxembourg] have already decided to form a government again  after the 12 June elections.    Everyone knows that this is a big lie.    In Luxembourg no coalitions are formed before the elections.    But accusing political opponents of this is as old as the  elections themselves and as such does not need to be taken  seriously.    We wonder why the DP is upset right now by the attacks on  its  program. If I were a DP strategist, I would be very delighted  by this instead of being upset.    I would be glad because criticism proves that the neoliberal  DP program has "reached" the voters and that its content and  statements with all their social consequences are being taken  seriously and are feared. Or would the DP suddenly be afraid of  its own courage and shortly before the elections want to pour  water in the neoliberal sacramental wine?</p>

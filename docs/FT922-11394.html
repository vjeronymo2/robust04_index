			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Special Report on Language Courses: Business looks out for the linguists BRITISH business is in no doubt about the need for a multilingual work force. Participants in a recent report by the Institute of Manpower Studies* considered that a lack of language skills restricted the pattern of trade, led to misunderstandings and stress, and prevented business activity in certain countries. But a gulf exists between the perceived needs in British companies, and the action necessary to meet them. The same IMS report concludes that 'in most companies, few employees received language training.' Those who do are likely to be the recipients of brief, total immersion programmes. Linguistic short-termism is widespread in British boardrooms. Intensive courses, while arguably the most effective way to learn a foreign language, are also the most expensive - particularly if the skill acquired in the heat of secondment to the Bonn office is lost within months of a return to the UK. Knowledge of a foreign language, like any skill acquired through training, will atrophy unless put into practice and sustained. Yet few British companies provide a culture in which staff are encouraged to maintain their hard-won competence. Positive corporate initiatives are needed to ensure that language skills are maintained at an operational level: Conduct a language audit. It is essential to know who can do what. This may seem obvious, but companies often reveal a surprising ignorance of their current language resources. One participant in the IMS study discovered that the employee with the highest degree of language competence was the Polish gardener. Design programmes: There is a confusing variety of material and methodology available, from simple 'get-by' texts and cassettes to sophisticated interactive video courses. Different learners have different needs, and no-one benefits from a random selection. A competent training provider will assist in the design of programmes to meet specific objectives and circumstances. Set realistic goals: Continuing study should be geared towards appropriate achievements. Maintenance at a given level of fluency is a realistic aim; rapid progress is not. Provide motivation: Few staff will take the trouble to maintain a skill for which there is no perceived need. Use of the target language - on occasional overseas trips, for example, or in monitoring the foreign media - should be built into the work structure. 'It is back to career planning,' says Gavin Barrett, international marketing director of Sundridge Park Management Centre. 'But a bit more planning will pay off handsomely.' Mr Barrett's organisation provides continuous language support for all those likely to have international involvement. Even employees without front-line contact are encouraged to join the same programmes, as part of their self-development. Staff at Sundridge Park are given a choice of which language they would like to study. At present, the mainstream second language is French, with some Spanish and Italian, and Russian at a basic 'survival' level. As well as expert tuition 'bought in' from outside providers, and specific training in the vocabulary of their industry, staff meet with others at a similar level of fluency for 'du pain et du vin' working lunches, using the language in an easy, idiomatic context. The core of the training takes place in company hours, but at a time least likely to disrupt normal work. Employees are encouraged to spend extra time on study, by the funding of books and materials. Requests for more focussed tuition are considered individually. The overall attitude of the company is supportive. 'Self-study requires exceptional motivation,' says Barrett. 'Unless the organisation sustains the motivation and the morale, it can be a lonely path.' But he is clear, too, about the pay-off in corporate terms: 'We have a strong operational need to deliver abroad, and it is imperative to deliver in the target language. It is part of our vision of being a leading provider in business management. Languages are part of that.'

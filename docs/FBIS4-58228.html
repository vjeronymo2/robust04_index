			<p>BFN     [Text] Riyadh, April 26, SPA -- The Saudi newspapers shed  light today on a number of topics. Riyadh-based AL-JAZIRAH  commenting on the talks held in Riyadh on Sunday evening between  Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz  and Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, said these talks had come  within the framework of existing coordination between the  kingdom and Egypt. As the kingdom and Egypt constitute the most  important pillars of joint Arab work, Custodian of the Two Holy  Mosques King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz and President Husni Mubarak  are capable of playing an effective role in the service of the  Arab cause, said the daily. The kingdom and Egypt have been  exerting sincere efforts to contain the dangers facing the  region, added the daily. The kingdom and Egypt, while working  for tackling the peace process in the Middle East, are aware of  the Israeli maneuvers to block the march of the peace, the daily  pointed out.    For its part, Mecca-based AL-NADWAH said it has been clear  that Israel is trying to escape from the pledges it had earlier  made. This policy of procrastination will have an adverse impact  on the future of the peace process in the Middle East, said the  daily.    As we face the danger of the Zionist plots in the Middle  East, the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina face the dangers of the  plots hatched by the Serbs, added the daily.    It has become an essential matter for the international  community to put an end for the maneuvers of the Serbs and  Zionists in defiance to the international legitimacy, said the  daily and added it has also become necessary to take the  appropriate measures for enhancing the pillars of just and  comprehensive peace in the Middle East and the Balkan region.</p>

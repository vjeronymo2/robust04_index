Also, protective garments capable of preventing skin contact with liquid vinyl chloride must be provided. The garments must be clean and dry for each use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 56. In &sect;154.1760, designate the text as paragraph (a) and add a new paragraph (b) to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;154.1760 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Liquid ammonia. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) For pressure vessels and pipelines made of carbon-manganese steel, the oxygen content of the vapor space must be reduced to the minimum level practicable before the introduction of liquid ammonia at temperatures of greater than ^20  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C (^4  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 57.

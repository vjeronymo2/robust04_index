			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK grain farmers grapple with new variables - Currency volatility and floods in the Mississippi basin promise storms for harvesters / Farmer's Viewpoint THE LEGEND of St Swithin lives on. It rained on his day, July 15, and precipitation seems set to continue for most of the following 40 days. Nevertheless, weather permitting, the UK cereals harvest will need to swing fully into gear in the next few days. Most farmers in the south have already dodged the storms and showers of the past couple of weeks to make a stuttering start at combine harvesting their winter sown barley fields. Spring sown barley is now almost ready too, as are the earliest fields of winter sown wheat. Little harvesting has so far been carried out in the north but the only thing delaying it is the lack of a dry spell. The weather, good or bad, is a frustrating variable that is usually accepted by farmers with equanimity. Variations in supply and demand are recognised as inevitable influences on returns, although many farmers have not yet come fully to terms with the fact of declining guaranteed prices and less secure market outlets as a result of CAP reforms. International currency volatility is the relatively new variable over which farmers realise they also have no control. Let us consider those variables in turn. First supply and demand: in the past few years UK farmers have grown about 22m tonnes of cereal a year while domestic demand has been about 16m tonnes, leaving 6m tonnes for export. By good fortune as well as good farming the recent quality of UK grain has been good enough to attract buyers from abroad to take up almost every tonne of the country's domestic surplus. The British balance of trade had benefited to the tune of some Pounds 750m a year and UK intervention stores have been virtually unused. Mainly as a result of new set-aside regulations the exportable surplus could well be halved this year. Questions, however, are being asked about the suitability and price of some UK grain for export. Much of the barley harvested in the south and west of England is reported to be thin and to contain high percentages of screenings  -undersized grains which fall through a sieve designed to screen them out of the sample. If the proportion falling through the sieve is greater than 6 per cent, and reports suggest that in many samples it is up to 12 per cent, the barley is only fit for animal feed. Most samples of malting barley from East Anglia are better than that and should, on the face of it, be ideal for the export trade. But Denmark, Britain's greatest competitor for export markets, is reported to have a big crop, although it is still in the fields. And France, which harvests its crops before more northerly nations, has already begun to supply barley to breweries in Belgium and elsewhere at prices British merchants would find difficult to match. It has also been estimated that France has 500,000 tonnes of malting barley available for export and Denmark a potential 700,000 tonnes. The total demand across the European Community - now that the old East Germany is supplying all that the old West Germany needs - is a mere 500,000 tonnes. It is hardly surprising therefore that the prices being bid for UK malting barley are only about Pounds 120 a tonne for the very best samples and much less than that for anything of lower quality. This figure represents a reduction from last year's best prices of up to Pounds 50 per tonne, the benefit from which will doubtless be pocketed by the brewers. It would be surprising and entirely out of character if they cut the price of a pint of beer. One of the reasons why the French are able to undercut British exporters is the decline in the value of the French franc and the relative strength of sterling. Even before last weekend French merchants were gambling on the value of their currency falling. They were selling grain in other harder currencies on the assumption that they would soon be able to buy more French francs with them. The immediate effect was to reduce the bid price for British barley by Pounds 5 per tonne. Paradoxically the British merchants and the farmers who supplied them were in a similar situation last September when sterling fell out of the currency system. It is not so pleasant when the boot is on the other foot. British guarantee prices for basic commodities, such as feed barley and wheat, as compared with specialist products like malting barley, however, are still substantially better than they would have been without the devaluation of the pound. And then there is the perennial problem of the weather - here and abroad. In Britain farmers are already worrying about the prospect of an unsettled period, which would make harvesting difficult and expensive. Not only are there more machine breakages in moist conditions as cutter bars of combine harvesters are forced to run close to the ground to pick up the flattened corn, but there are also extra costs of drying the grain. Such weather conditions inevitably lead to lower quality, lower value samples. Meanwhile, the floods in the Mississippi basin could affect EC arable farmers' returns. There is no doubt that US farmers whose land has been under flood water for several weeks will have no crops to harvest and could face ruin without government support. What is less clear - and conflicting reports and a volatile trade in Chicago confuse the situation even more - is to what extent the floods will cut overall US production of maize and soyabeans. But if US maize production and carry over stock is significantly reduced, which I suspect is unlikely, the price of EC wheat, which can be used as an alternative animal feed ingredient, could rise. And if the floods lead to a shortage of soyabeans, which is more likely - prices suggest this is already the case - that too could give a lift to other commodity markets. If US soya supplies become scarce the cost of vegetable protein around the world will increase. It is interesting to note that the last time there was such a soya shortage was in 1973. Then US President Nixon reacted by imposing an embargo on exports and the price of available supplies from South America and the like trebled. This was the main reason why the EC introduced its subsidy system for oilseeds and protein - a system which threatened to derail the recent General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade negotiations. A similar soya supply situation may occur again just as the possibility of freer trade looms on the horizon. How fascinating it will be to see President Clinton's reaction if such a scenario materialises.</p>

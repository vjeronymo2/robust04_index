			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Willis Corroon Investors cannot complain that there was no advance warning this week to don tin hats ahead of Willis' interim results. In the event the company appears to have suffered just as much as Sedgwick from the weak US market in the second quarter, and the shares duly responded with another 9 per cent fall. This is surely the correct response. Willis needs to make roughly Pounds 85m pre-tax next year to cover a maintained dividend, a figure which looks well beyond its reach on present trends. To be fair, the increase in operating expenses should continue to fall over the next 18 months, while the combination of restructuring and new projects may reap as yet undreamt-of benefits. Without any help from the markets, though, the best that can be hoped for at this stage is a less savage dividend cut next year than Sedgwick's threatened halved payout in 1992.</p>

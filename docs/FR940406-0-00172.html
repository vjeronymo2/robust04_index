			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After analyzing the responses to the questionnaire and reviewing other available data, NHTSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) proposing average fuel economy standards for light trucks for MYs 1995&hyph;97. 57 FR 61377 (December 24, 1992). The agency proposed to select the standards from within a range of 20.5&hyph;21.0 mpg for MY 1995, and 20.5&hyph;21.5 mpg for MYs 1996 and 1997. These ranges were based on the agency's tentative evaluation of manufacturer capabilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to the December 24, 1992 NPRM, the agency received comments from General Motors (GM), Ford, Chrysler, the American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA, formerly the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association), Rover Group, the National Automobile Dealers Association, and about 50 organizations concerned about the continuing availability to consumers of a full range of light trucks, including, among others, the Coalition for Vehicle Choice, Consumer Alert, and the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI). The issues raised by the commenters are addressed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 7, 1993, the agency published a final rule establishing a 20.6 mpg combined average fuel economy standard for light trucks manufactured in MY 1995 (58 FR 18019). The limited time then available to promulgate a final rule for MY 1995 precluded a thorough consideration of the issues related to light truck CAFE standards for MYs 1996&hyph;97. Therefore, NHTSA announced that it would reach a decision later with respect to the light truck standard for those model years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsequent to publication of the final rule establishing the CAFE standard for MY 1995, NHTSA received another comment from Ford, in which the manufacturer revised some of the risks and opportunities it believed it faced in MYs 1996&hyph;97. This resulted in revised CAFE projections for those years. The Department also received a letter from the Energy Conservation Coalition (ECC) recommending that light truck CAFE for those years be sharply increased. ECC's letter was signed by ECC, itself, as well as the Environmental &amp; Energy Study Institute, Public Citizen, Sierra Club, American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, Center for Auto Safety, and U.S. Public Interest Research Group.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Summary of Decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on its analysis, the agency is establishing a combined average fuel economy standard for MYs 1996 and 1997 at 20.7 mpg. The agency notes that the relatively short leadtime for MYs 1996&hyph;97 precludes significant technological changes beyond that which manufacturers have already planned. Given the continuing need to conserve energy, as discussed elsewhere in this notice, and the increasing ratio of light truck to passenger car sales, NHTSA desires to insure that feasible light truck CAFE improvements will continue to be made. To achieve this goal, the agency has published an ANPRM in today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  addressing light truck CAFE standards for MYs 1998&hyph;2006.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA is eliminating the requirement that captive imports and other light trucks be required to meet CAFE standards separately. Beginning in MY 1996, there will be a combined standard that will apply to each manufacturer's light truck fleet in its entirety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III. Manufacturer Capabilities for MYs 1996&hyph;97  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In evaluating manufacturers' fuel economy capabilities for MYs 1996&hyph;97, the agency has analyzed manufacturers' current projections and underlying product plans and has considered what, if any, additional actions the manufacturers could take to improve their fuel economy. A more detailed discussion of these issues is contained in the agency's Regulatory Evaluation, which is being placed in the docket for this notice. Some of the information included in the Regulatory Evaluation, including the details of manufacturers' future product plans, has been determined by the agency to be confidential business information whose release could cause competitive harm. The public version of the Regulatory Evaluation omits the confidential information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Manufacturer Projections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. General Motors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed in the NPRM, General Motors (GM) projected in December 1991 that it could achieve a light truck CAFE level of 20.7 mpg for MYs 1996&hyph;97. In its February 1993 comment on the NPRM, GM revised its projection slightly downward, to 20.5 mpg. By comparison, in a mid-model year report submitted in July 1992, GM projected a MY 1992 CAFE of 20.2 mpg. In its mid-model year report submitted in July 1993, it projected a MY 1993 CAFE of 19.8 mpg.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GM stated in its February 1993 comment that the light truck CAFE standard for MYs 1996&hyph;97 ``should be set no higher than 20.5 mpg, and even that may be too high.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Ford  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ford projected in January 1992 that it could achieve a light truck CAFE level of 21.6 mpg for MY 1996, and 21.5 mpg for MY 1997. These projections were revised by Ford in a May 1993 letter updating its comment to the NPRM, which stated that, after re-evaluating the risks and opportunities it faced in those model years, it could achieve a light truck CAFE level of 21.1 mpg in MY 1996 and 21.6 mpg in MY 1997. Ford stated that the risk factors could reduce its CAFE level for MY 1996 to as low as 20.8 mpg, and for MY 1997 to 21.0 mpg. By comparison, in its final model year data submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Ford reported a MY 1992 CAFE of 20.3 mpg. In its mid-model year report submitted to NHTSA in July 1993, that company projected a MY 1993 CAFE of 20.7 mpg.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ford recommended in its comment on the NPRM that the agency establish the MY 1996 standard at the same level as the MY 1994 standard, 20.5 mpg. It commented that the agency could raise the MY 1997 standard to a level no higher than 21.0 mpg.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Chrysler  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Chrysler projected in December 1991 that it could achieve a light truck CAFE level of 21.0 mpg for MYs 1996&hyph;97. In its January 1993 comment on the NPRM, Chrysler revised its projection slightly downward, to 20.8 mpg for MY 1996 and 20.9 mpg for MY 1997. By way of comparison, Chrysler achieved a CAFE level of 21.2 mpg for MY 1992 according to its final model year data as reported to the EPA, and projected a CAFE level of 21.0 mpg for MY 1993 in its July 1993 mid-model year report to NHTSA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chrysler commented that it supports a standard of 20.5 mpg for MYs 1996&hyph;97 because it does not anticipate any major improvements in light truck fuel economy through new technological applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Other Manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most light truck manufacturers other than GM, Ford and Chrysler only compete in the small vehicle portion of the light truck market and are therefore expected to achieve CAFE levels well above those three companies. By way of example, in their mid-model year reports for 1993, Toyota projected a light truck CAFE of 21.8 mpg, Isuzu 21.8 mpg, Mazda 23.6 mpg, Mitsubishi 21.2 mpg, Subaru 29.1 mpg, Suzuki 28.9 mpg, and Volkswagen 21.0 mpg.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

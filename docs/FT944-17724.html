			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Markets Report: Political worries hit lira Renewed tensions in Italy between the government and magistrates investigating corruption prompted a sharp fall in the lira yesterday, writes Philip Gawith. Fears that investigations were reaching ever higher into government, possibly to the point where Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi might be implicated, saw the lira fall to a London close of L1,016 per D-Mark from L1,008. The dollar was again weaker. Stronger than expected factory order figures caused bond prices to fall, and the dollar fell in tandem. It finished in London at DM1.5426 and Y99.47, from DM1.5519 and Y99.69 respectively. In New York it closed at DM1.5445 and Y99.605. The Russian rouble continued its recent fall, closing in Moscow at Rbs2,808 to the dollar from Rbs2,668. The Russian currency started the year around Rbs1,250 to the dollar. Sterling was firmer on the day, with the trade weighted index ending at 80.2 from 80. With renewed political instability in Italy, some observers believe the lira will test the low for the year of L1,030.50 against the D-Mark. Mr Stephen Yorke, analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank in London, commented: 'I think the government is encircled. The magistrates seem on the verge of implicating very senior members of government. If that were to happen, the lira would, at the very least, retest the lows for the year. 'If it looks like Mr Berlusconi will be investigated (by the magistrates), then I think we will be in for freefall.' Elsewhere in Europe, the Swiss franc and D-Mark were both generally firmer as the weakness in the lira spread to the French franc and other currencies. The franc finished at FFr3.418, from FFr3.415, against the D-Mark. The catalyst for the rouble's recent weakness was the central bank's decision, on September 22, to stop intervening to support the currency. Over the two to three months prior to this, according to Mr Sergei Alexashenko, the deputy finance minister, the central bank had spent more than Dollars 2bn defending the rouble. The main reason for the currency's weakness would appear to be the high rate of inflation. Consumer price inflation in the year to August was 267.9 per cent. However, some bankers argue that the rouble's recent fall merely reflects the central bank trying to drive the rate lower, in order that it can sell hard currency to help pay the government's debts. Mr Jonathan Hoffman, international economist at CS First Boston in London, said the rouble, after a period of relative stability, was merely catching up for recent inflation losses. He added, however, that in spite of recent weakness, the rouble's real value was probably about 10 per cent higher than at the start of the year. The weakness of the dollar came against the backdrop of market fears that the Federal Reserve was not being sufficiently aggressive in combatting inflation. This view was encouraged by the higher than expected factory orders figures. Comments in Jeddah from Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, that the fundamentals supporting the dollar were the best in 20 years, and that the US did not use the dollar as a trade tool, were ignored by the market. Mr George Magnus, international economist at SG War-burg, argued that even a 50 basis-point rise in US rates 'would constitute firefighting . . . and at best could be expected to hold the dollar in its current range for a while longer'. He went on to say: 'A significant dollar recovery will only be seen once confidence in the Federal Reserve has returned, sufficient to spark an inflow of long-term capital into US asset markets. 'The inability of either equity or bond markets to make headway during 1994 does not provide us with much confidence on this score, and the combination of higher inflation, higher rates and slower growth in the next few months hardly seems the recipe for a change in trend over the winter.' Taking a slightly different view was Mr David Munro, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics in New York. He said the special feature of the current US economic recovery is ongoing restructuring, and competitive resistance to higher finished goods prices. 'This is why a merely fractional acceleration of inflation is due. That will give the Fed a rationale to moderate its boost to short rates,' added Mr Munro. In the weekly repo tender, the Bundesbank allocated DM74.2bn in 14-day securities repurchase agreements at a fixed interest rate of 4.85 per cent - the 11th consecutive pact at this level. This constituted a net addition of DM4.9bn to the market. Call money rates eased slightly to 4.85/4.95 per cent. In the UK, the Bank of England provided Pounds 385m assistance to UK money markets, compared with a shortage of Pounds 600m. Overnight money traded between 5 1/8 and 7 per cent. The Bank also said it would today provide Pounds 1.359bn to the market by way of repo and secured loan facilities.</p>

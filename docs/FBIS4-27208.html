			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- The head of the Democratic  Socialist Party (DSP) is likely to step down soon over his part  in a political maneuver that ended up leaving the ruling  coalition without a Diet majority, party officials said Tuesday  [31 May].    DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi is tilting toward resigning,  possibly by the weekend, and Takashi Yonezawa, party's general  secretary, will probably succeed him, they said.    The DSP, a centrist component of the ruling coalition, will  hold an emergency meeting of its policy-making board this week  to discuss the issue, they said.    Ouchi has been under fire from rank-and-file party members  and supporters for his role in creating the new Diet bloc  Kaishin, which excluded the Social Democratic Party [of Japan]  (SDP) [SDPJ], the largest party in the previous coalition  government.    The SDPJ walked out of the coalition immediately after it  helped to elect Tsutomu Hata as prime minister on April 25 as it  saw the Ouchi-initiated move as a plot to reduce its influence  on policy- making.    The parliamentary debacle greatly undermined Hata's  political  standing, and he has been the constant target of opposition  calls for his resignation or snap elections since he came to  office.    Ouchi has talked with the DSP leadership about the Kaishin  and as a result is close to deciding to quit, party insiders  said.    Party officials, however, are concerned that if Ouchi  resigns  to take responsibility for the Kaishin fiasco it could have  unpleasant repercussions for the coalition.    Key coalition strategist Ichiro Ozawa of Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party] and former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa --  the other prime movers behind Kaishin -- could also come under  fire, they said. That would further shake the  already-sputtering coalition, they said.    Some young party members, on the other hand, are demanding  that Ouchi make clear his responsibility for the Kaishin debacle.    Ouchi said at a Tuesday press conference that he is still  consulting party colleagues and has yet to make a final decision  on the issue.</p>

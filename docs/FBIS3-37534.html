The Aim: To Bring Georgia Out of the Crisis!"]    [Text] An extended session of the Republic of Georgia  Cabinet of Ministers on 9 February was devoted to implementing  an anticrisis program, outlining ways of reviving the economy,  conducting a correct credit and monetary policy, strengthening  the coupon's exchange rate, developing the private sector, and  reviving the nation spiritually.    Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia delivered a report  "on  the Basic Results of the Functioning of the Economy in 1993 and  on Immediate Tasks." The report delivered by Tamaz Chikvaidze,  first deputy minister of the economy, was devoted to  macroeconomic stability in the republic, an anticrisis program  of systematic changes, and the first indicative plan for the  country's socioeconomic development. This was then followed by  a debate.    The speakers and the various participants in the debate,  including ministers from various departments, the heads of  institutes and large enterprises, rayon gamgebelis  [administrative board chairmen], bank employees, and  representatives from the private sector, pointed out that, in  spite of the important measures that had been implemented in  1993 to regulate and reform economic life in the Republic of  Georgia, it had not been possible to activate factors aimed at  stabilizing the economy or to reverse the trend toward a  deepening of the crisis and the shortages of electricity and  other resources. With the conditions of serious and, to a  certain extent, chaotic economic processes currently prevailing,  the effectiveness of laws and legislative acts that have already  been adopted, as well as credit, monetary, taxation, and  financial mechanisms, is extremely low. A significant part of  the republic's economic potential has been excluded from  economic life.    In terms of 1993 prices, the total GDP amounted to 1,878  billion coupons, which is only 54 percent of that of the  previous year. There was a reduction of 46.3 percent in gross  national income, which fell to the level of 1964.    With the credit, monetary, and financial systems on the  brink  of almost total collapse, it was not possible last year to  ratify the budget while the rate of devaluation of the temporary  currency -- the coupon -- exceeded the most pessimistic  forecasts and turned into hyperinflation. Along with objective  factors that have deep roots, this state of affairs was due to  the fact that it had not been possible to implement measures  aimed at stabilizing the coupon's rate of exchange in time.    The speakers emphasized that one of the main reasons for  inflation was the universal shortages on the consumer market.  It was necessary, in a short period of time, to regulate the  question of stocktaking in respect of all trade and implement  measures aimed at saturating the consumer market with goods and  services.    It is significant that all the speakers tried to give a  thorough analysis of current processes in their individual  sector and outline concrete proposals and measures aimed at  extricating Georgia from the crisis.    A speech was delivered at the session by Eduard  Shevardnadze, chairman of the Georgian parliament-head of  state.    He said: "It is impossible to draw up a universal  program. This program is the result of serious work carried out  by many collectives over one year. At the moment, we are short  of skills [kvalipikatsia] and experience. It is necessary for  us to study together not only work but also new thinking.    "In the situation that has taken shape, we have to draw one  most important conclusion: We should refrain from the sickly  politicization of society as this will hurl us toward painful  anarchy.    "As regards the program for bringing the country out of  the crisis -- it makes no difference whether we call its  variants pessimistic or optimistic, minimalist or maximalist --  the main thing is for us not to be skeptical, as there exist the  preconditions for escaping from the crisis and positive shifts  enabling us to begin an economic recovery.    "The main thing," said Eduard Shevardnadze, "is that  Georgia avoids isolation and has the initial basis for  extricating itself from the crisis. Emerging from its isolation  will contribute to the restoration of economic ties. At the  same time, we should not forget that the economy should be  controlled."    Then, the head of state touched upon the development of  the private sector: "It is necessary to open the way for  businessmen and to help and support them, not brandish our  swords at them. The state should be the instrument that manages  the economy and struggles against chaos [stikiuroba]. We speak  a lot about liberalization and do the opposite. Wages should  increase along with prices.    "It is still not too late to halt the struggle for the  Russian market. We should bring Georgian tea and Georgian wine  onto the consumer market as quickly as possible; otherwise, if  we delay, nothing will help this situation. Georgia has adopted  the status of a developing country. This factor will contribute  to the restoration of the economy but our country must tread  this path quickly and within a short period of time. We should  not be afraid of elements of planning being inserted into branch  programs; all plans should work for the interests of the  state.    Our relations with the IMF and the World Bank will open  up new horizons and broad paths. We have to try to get the  European Community to finance our programs. In order to do  this, we have to acquire the reputation of a reliable partner.  However, no single businessman or investor will come to Georgia  until the country resembles a country and there is  stability."    Batoni [Georgian polite form of address] Eduard  Shevardnadze touched upon the size of military expenditure. He  said: "If necessary, we will give our right arms, but  everything has to be legalized and decreed by the state; a  military budget has to be determined that will maintain the  army."    The head of state devoted significant attention to  measures aimed at strengthening the coupon. "It was a mistake  to introduce the coupon. Unless the economy is activated, it is  impossible to strengthen it. It is probably necessary to have a  parallel currency; otherwise what we have on the market today  will also disappear. We cannot post a policeman at every stall.  As for joining the ruble zone, the door is not yet open. There  are many conditions that will have to be studied thoroughly.  Working groups are being formed both in Georgia and Russia. We  have to organize discussions on trade and hold debates."    Then, Batoni Eduard Shevardnadze spoke about the search  for ways to overcome the electricity crisis. "Georgia is a  country rich in hydroelectric resources and, therefore, this  problem should be resolved in the shortest time.    "It is of great benefit to Georgia that Russia has  agreed to supply us with gas.    "The delivery of gas from Turkmenistan is expensive.  Therefore, this development will ease our financial  situation.    "The use of non-traditional energy signifies  inexhaustible sources for us. We should make the sun, wind,  small hydroelectric power stations, and so forth serve the  economy. It is possible that, with the help of UNESCO, Georgia  will become one of the world centers for conducting this  research."    He devoted a lot of attention to improving work on the  railroads, highways, and waterways.    "The customs system, which represents an inexhaustible  source of revenue for our budget, needs to be reorganized.    "In spite of the difficulties of our life, no one  should forget that it is essential for us to save our culture  and science. The entire nation should concern itself with  this."    The extended session of the Cabinet of Ministers adopted the  corresponding decrees on the questions discussed.</p>

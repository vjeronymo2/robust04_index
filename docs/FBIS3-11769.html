They realized that if we do not discuss and control costs, if an  economic analysis on the basis of costs is not conducted, the  goal of increasing profitability and reducing losses and state  subsidies to enterprises is not feasible. What has to be done  first is to identify and measure our expenses. These expenses,  material and labor, are reflected in the cost. This concern you  said the workers have, which is true, is being expressed even as  a mandate. Nowadays, there is a trend which I believe is very  healthy: The workers are demanding of the management that a cost  system, even a minimal one, be established and made known,  especially where the expenses are incurred -- the workshop,  department, shift, and the smallest unit. This is based on the  concept that those who can do the most to reduce costs are those  who incur the expense.    I believe that it is very important to analyze a phenomenon  typical of our economy in the last few decades. I dare to  advance the following opinion: In general, we in Cuba have  underestimated the importance of the financial elements of the  economy.    By this I mean the following: We have worked above all on  the  basis of material balance. We have balanced consumption values  and material values in terms of their productive function.  However, we have frequently dismissed the importance of  financial factors and, above all, the problem of determining,  controlling, and reducing costs.    [Santana] Yes, there have been other priorities. As you  said,  material production has been a priority. However, material  production per se has not had a quality, a use value. Despite  these concerns, it has not always had an appropriate use value.    [Recio] There are things we cannot separate at this time. I  have used this chemical image: If you separate hydrogen from  oxygen, you no longer have water. Likewise, if you separate the  material value of things, in terms of their utilitarian and  social value, and take away the financial element reflected by  that value, then you are simply canceling the entire quality of  the economy.    [Santana] Of course. You were referring to cost as a  financial factor. I think we need to speak next of the elements  comprising cost because I think that is very interesting. It is  something not frequently discussed. Many people are surprised to  find that there is not a single cost, but many. The issue of  cost has been discussed by the workers on the recently concluded  process of Parliaments in the Workplaces.    [Recio] First of all, I do not believe this process has  concluded. I insist on the idea I have stressed before: This is  only the beginning of the process. We have to maintain  everywhere that style of frank language, open discussion, and  realistic analysis of the economic problems at each workplace. I  believe the union movement is committed to maintain that work  style and method. Therefore, I do not speak of its conclusion. I  said that it is only beginning.    [Santana] Therefore, it is a process that has completed its  first round, its first phase. You were saying that there are  many ways of expressing cost and that there are several  components to cost.    [Recio] I prefer to mention the two main elements: salary  costs and material costs. Those resulting from the work force  expenses and those from the consumption of raw material, energy,  etc. Most workers are aware that this is expressed in the  phrase: Cost per peso of consumer goods production.    What is happening today in Cuba -- highly affected by  economic decline -- is that the cost per peso of consumer goods  production exceeds the peso. This is no good. In order to  produce a peso you have to spend more than a peso in resources.    [Santana] There is the fact that 69 percent of Cuba's  enterprises are unprofitable.    [Recio] That means that in those enterprises it costs over a  peso to produce a peso's worth of goods. Expressed in this  manner, one can see that if this situation were to be sustained  for long, life would become almost unaffordable because you are  consuming more in production than you are producing. This is in  financial terms. It is good to explain this here. It can be  expressed in financial terms. However, the list of material  expenses is unending. Thus, no one can express it in terms that  consuming such and such things produces such and such a thing.  Therefore, the financial, monetary, cost expression is the  shorter and more objective way to determine whether one is  expending more or less in production than the value of the goods  produced. I believe that should be constantly the focus of the  Cuban workers, as owners of the means of production.    [Santana] You also mentioned the cost of salaries. You spoke  of material expenses. Undoubtedly, the large personnel roster in  almost every workplace in Cuba cannot continue to exist if we  want 69 percent of the enterprises to become profitable. It is  clear that excessive salary cost is an unjustified expense of  production. I believe this is under discussion today. Many think  they can solve their problems by reducing the number of workers.  I believe that is part of the problem. You said this was one of  the elements of cost but not all of it. There are other  elements, such as material costs, and many others such as  efficient production, maximum use of the machinery, compliance  with all the technological requirements, etc. I believe this is  an element that has to be stressed.    [Recio] All this, obviously, promotes cost reduction or, if  improperly done, increased costs. I want to warn about something  which is my opinion. We should not exaggerate the importance of  the salary factor in our highly elevated costs. I believe that  inflated rosters at the workplaces have very negative  consequences for productivity and work organization. However,  not always, everywhere, does the main factor determining  elevated costs lie in salaries. I believe this always requires a  casuistic analysis, an analysis place by place in order to  reflect in situ what portion of the costs is determined by  personnel salaries and what portion results from poor use of  material resources. I believe we have to insist on this idea in  order to avoid confusion. We also make extremely poor use of the  material elements consumed in the productive process.    We do not have to go far. We are once again linking finances  and production: The problem discussed recently -- the lack of  payment among enterprises -- also contributes to the pilfering  of resources, which results in cost increases as a result of  unfulfilled material consumption. I believe this also deserves  analysis.    [Santana] You were speaking of something very important:  payment among enterprises.    [Recio] I believe that in the previous National Assembly  session this issue was highlighted. This is very interesting  because it is unthinkable that there are enterprises subsidized  by the state whose failure to charge other enterprises for  production is also being subsidized. There are also enterprises  that refuse to pay. I have spoken with many managers who tell  me, yes, they try to collect but their counterparts do not want  to pay. Within this there is a whole bureaucratic apparatus, the  bank, etc., which complicates payment. I believe this issue is  very interesting. In no other system is it acceptable that you  deliver a product and are not paid for it by the receiving  enterprise. As you said, this is the main tool of those who  steal and pilfer, since there are no controls.    [Santana] Also a tool of those who are inefficient and  negligent.    [Recio] All I have to add is that this absurd, truly absurd  situation of those selling goods not getting paid, and those  purchasing not paying, takes place only because of the break we  had -- which was intensified at the beginning of the special  period -- between the financial and production factors of  production. Fortunately, we are undergoing the process of a new  mentality, of rethinking economic logic and rationale. The  struggle for efficiency has become an essential element to save  the fatherland, nation, socialism, and its accomplishments.    I believe that all -- workers, administration workers,  managers, political organizations, and people in general -- have  to get involved with the issue of cost.    [Santana] Yes, I believe it is very important that all  workers get involved in this problem. I believe it is essential  to the Cuban people, not only in production but also in terms of  state finances where we should try to make costs a constant  concern.    [Recio] That sector speaks primarily of expenses because  they  have no production. They do get a profit, in general, for  production. However, in health as well as in education and  culture, we have seen a willingness to reduce costs, to measure  how much is expended on primary level education and how much on  each disease treated at hospitals.    I believe that all these concerns and interests may result  in  an improvement in the Cuban economy.</p>

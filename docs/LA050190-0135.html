			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> MA, AX PROVIDE PROFOUND PERFORMANCE  </P> <P> The Civic Theatre's cavernous proportions can daunt even the most skilled  chamber musicians. Sunday night, however, the 3,000-seat hall seemed barely  large enough to contain pianist Emanuel Ax and cellist Yo-Yo Ma, especially in  their expansive performance of Rachmaninoff's G Minor Sonata for Piano and  Cello.  </P> <P> In their concert for the La Jolla Chamber Music Society, the two musicians  displayed the rich rewards of their longstanding musical collaboration. Their  partnership far exceeded the decorum of thoughtful integration and comradely  give and take: Ax and Ma fused their probing interpretations with uncommon  unanimity and depth. Even in a busy musical season, performances this profound  are rare.  </P> <P> Besides the Rachmaninoff, the duo chose but two other works, Stravinsky's  "Suite Italienne" and Prokofiev's C Major Cello Sonata, Op. 119. This demanding  fare gave little comfort to the audience, which would have been happier with  French bonbons and bathetic elegies.  </P> <P> The uncompromising Ma refused to begin any movement without complete silence  from the audience. With their consummate artistry -- and a rather diffident  stripe of patience -- the duo refashioned the audience's expectations to their  own agenda. By the concert's finale, the sold-out house was ecstatic.  </P> <P> Ma attacked the Stravinsky Suite with elegant vigor, and Ax's dry, finely  pointed accompaniment gave this neoclassical gem an aptly industrial finish.  The Suite, plundered by the composer from his ballet score "Pulcinella,"  elicited an edgy timbre from Ma, and in the energetic "Tarantella" movement,  his tone was reduced to an animated buzz.  </P> <P> Fortunately, Prokofiev's Sonata called forth richer sonorities, which Ma  supplied in abundance. His shapely phrasing and quicksilver transitions were a  constant reminder of the C Major work's bittersweet ambiguities. If Ma's  reverent formality had a tendency to distance his listeners, his underlying  passion was unmistakable.  </P> <P> The duo's transcendent interpretation of Rachmaninoff's giant rhapsody was  orchestral in its sweep, yet revealingly intimate in the communion between  cellist and pianist. The lyrical third movement could not have been more  ethereal. Ax never exploited the piano's commanding role in the Sonata, yet his  rock-solid, authoritative technique made his contribution more satisfying than  any display of virtuoso fireworks.  </P></p>

He was commenting on a report released by the Goldstone  Commission implicating South African Police officers, including  three generals, of being involved in "third force" activities.  "The way it was made public came as a shock to all of us," Gen  Mellet said at his farewell function in Cape Town. He is  retiring.    Gen mellet said he disputed the implications. "The whole  thing is worrying. It's unsettling, because it was done  unfairly. I am upset about the way it was made public."    He said he felt the perception was being created that those  named in the report were guilty. "They have been found guilty  before the investigating team has arrived in South Africa." He  went on: "Do you really think a general would start a third  force? Whatever the finding about those involved in the  so-called third force, let it be known very soon with the same  haste in which the allegations were made public."    Gen Mellet said he was asking only for fairness and the  truth. "Be reasonable and be fair. Don't be overhasty in  crucifying these men. If they broke the law, it's a different  story."    Gen Mellet called for public support for the police, adding  that pressure on the force was bound to increase in the run-up  to the elections.    Police would be out in force at polling booths. "We also  have 5,000 reservists to call up and slightly more than 3,000  retired policemen."    He accused Bophuthatswana policemen of plundering during the  uprising in the homeland. They had smashed automatic teller  machines to get at their contents, he said. "Those police will  be our colleagues in the next couple of weeks. If that is an  example, then the SAP do not wish to be part of that force."</p>

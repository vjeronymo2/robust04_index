			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Bull Ring redevelopment clears regulatory barrier THE last significant regulatory barrier to the redevelopment of the Bull Ring, the most conspicuous and inhospitable example of Birmingham's 1960s city centre building programme, fell yesterday. Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, gave authority for compulsory land purchases to make possible the assembly of a 26-acre site to create a shopping and business complex. The Rotunda office tower, which has glowered over Birmingham's skyline for a generation, will be demolished. London &amp; Edinburgh Trust, the Swedish-owned property group that owns the Bull Ring, will start detailed discussions with Birmingham City Council about design and construction of a new complex, for which outline planning permission was granted in 1990. Noting that it had taken six years to complete the planning process, the trust said: 'It will take at least as long with a following wind to realise the scheme itself.' The City Council said the scheme has 'got to wait until the economic climate is right'. The redevelopment will cost about Pounds 500m and LET has to put financing in place. It also has to find tenants for the two department stores included in the 1m sq ft shopping complex and for the new 300,000 sq ft of office space based on a tower replacing the Rotunda. The Bull Ring, with its angular concrete and bleak subways, is a longstanding butt of criticism.</p>

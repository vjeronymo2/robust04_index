			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku (May 24) TURAN--Behaviour of the authorities  shows that they intend to urge the opposition on open and forced  confrontation. It is not a secret that parliament's crisis on  May 18 was intendedly provoked by the authorities. They knew  that the irritated opposition would leave Parliament's session  and would prefer to conduct a rally. Dispersion of the  demonstrators, arrests and slaughter of the deputies and party  leaders on May 21 just poured oil in the flame.    Yesterday the police seized and beat the deputy and the PFA  leader, Ibragim Ibragimli. On the same day the Milli Majlis  made a request to President Aliyev to reduce the quorum in the  Majlis from 34 to 26 voices. The approval of this request by  President Aliyev means that any his proposals will be  immediately adopted by legislative body of the country.    The opposition is put in the following conditions: Either it  will capitulate and resign itself to dictatorship or it will put  resistance.    The authorities commit outrages and realizing the danger of  it, they try to make their activities legal.    The conflict between the opposition and the authorities  takes  place on the background of worsened geopolitical situation and  due to this fact foreign forces urge Azerbaijan on confrontation  with elements of civil war. Probably, the foreign forces intend  to remove the current president. However, he will not leave his  office easily and the situation can lose control. One should  take into account that Azerbaijan is at the state of war and  civil confrontation in the Republic can cause serious  consequences.</p>

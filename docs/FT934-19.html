			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Nervous bond market tilts Dow into decline Wall Street US share prices retreated yester day as a skittish bond market undercut the eagerness of investors to lift the bell wether blue-chip index over the 3,800 mark before the new year, writes Frank McGurty in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 18.45 lower at 3,775.88, while the more broadly based Standard &amp;Poor's 500 was down 1.94 at 468.64. Secondary indices showed slight gains, with the American SE compos ite was 0.39 ahead at 472.55, and the Nasdaq composite up 2.60 to 771.08. Volume on the NYSE was light, with 193m shares traded. Declining issues led advances, 1,080 to 958. After two days of razor-thin gains, stocks opened weaker as the US Treasury market reacted nervously to a strong report on November housing activity. The Commerce Department said that sales of new single-family homes last month had surged to their highest annual rate in more than seven years. In a further sign of the econ omy's strength, weekly claims for unemployment benefit fell sharply confounding expectations of no change. In late trading, the inflation-sensitive 30-year government bond was down 1 9/32 to 98 3/4 , with the yield rising to 6.339 per cent in thin holiday trading. The negative implications of the data were somewhat miti gated by the December index of industrial activity released by the Purchasing Manage ment Association of Chicago. The report showed continued economic strength in the area, but the rate of acceleration eased from November's espe cially fast pace. It was no consolation for bonds, however, and the losses at the long end grew more pro nounced as the day progressed. Stocks followed suit. Among the blue chips, IBM lost Dollars 1 to Dollars 57 1/8 , AT&amp;T Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 52 1/2 , and Chrysler Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 53 3/8 . Among the bright spots, LTV climbed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 16 1/8 and USF&amp;G, the insurance holding company, advanced Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 15 1/8 . The Nasdaq held up better than the other mar kets. It was aided by a solid gain by MCI Communications, which added Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 27 on news that it was planning to spend Dollars 1bn to build local net works in direct competition with the so-called Baby Bell regional telecoms. Canada Toronto stocks rose in light trading, hitting a record high for the second consecutive day. The TSE-300 composite index increased 19.96 points, or 0.46 per cent, to close at 4,329.88. Advancing issues outnumbered declines 429 to 281. Shell Canada agreed to sell its polypropylene business to a new entity formed by the merger of most of the petrochemicals businesses of Royal Dutch/Shell Group and Montedison. Shell Canada gained 5/8 to 38 1/2.</p>

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / G7 set for showdown over Russian economic reforms THE Group of Seven industri-alised countries and leading international financial institutions believe Russian reforms may not survive the present period of political uncertainty and are preparing for a showdown with the Russian government after the summer holiday season. One diplomat in Moscow said yesterday: 'The reformers in the cabinet presently look weak and isolated, unable to move.' Mr Sergei Shakhrai, a deputy prime minister and a close aide to President Boris Yeltsin, said the basic institutions of authority were paralysed. 'Rust is eating out the body of the state.' A top G7 official said: 'We always recognised that Russian policy would go in fits and starts - and this is certainly a fit. But with proper policy from now on, this would not prevent the success of Russian reform and further western support.' At stake is the G7 aid of Dollars 44bn (Pounds 29.5bn), announced at the US-Russian summit in Vancouver in April and approved at the G7 Tokyo summit in July. Included in that figure is the second Dollars 1.5bn tranche of a Dollars 3bn International Monetary Fund loan and accelerated loans from the World Bank worth up to Dollars 2bn in the next year. They are due to be decided in September or soon after. President Yeltsin, who returned early from a holiday a week ago, has made no public appearance or speech since then. Nor has he reacted to the urgent call by Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister and the leading economic reformer in the cabinet, for the annulment of the Central Bank's decision to withdraw from circulation all pre-1993 cash roubles and for the sacking of Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the bank's chairman. The bank's action caused chaos last week in Russia and in most members of the Commonwealth of Independent States still in the rouble zone. Western fears about the course of Russian reforms have been fuelled by the precariousness of the budget and the power struggle between Mr Yeltsin and parliament. Officials from the G7 governments and the World Bank and IMF believe the budget proposed by Mr Fyodorov, which envisages a deficit of some Rbs11,000 bn to Rbs12,000bn, may fall victim to pressure from within the cabinet for extra spending, especially industry aid. One senior G7 official said: 'I think both Fyodorov and Yeltsin have been the losers over this last week. By the time it comes to September and decisions have to be made, I think we could be looking at some very bad figures in the budget.' Another said: 'If this were a country like India or Brazil, we would already have said to the government that we could not carry on with our programmes in the face of an incoherent reform process. I don't think there are many inhibitions left about doing this in Russia if things do not improve.'</p>

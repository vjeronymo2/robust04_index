			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Duty to report suspicions of bank fraud moves closer PLANS to give auditors a statutory duty to report suspicion of fraud on the part of their client banks to the Bank of England will take a step forward later this month when the government publishes a consultation paper. The paper, which follows consultation with the professional institutes, will include draft regulations setting out the new duties for auditors of banks, building societies, friendly societies and some companies. The Treasury hopes the extensive discussions it has already held with the profession mean that the official consultation period can be relatively short and it can proceed with legislation in the autumn. It is seeking legislative time in the next parliamentary session, but is not guaranteed a slot in the programme. Labour is critical of the delay so far because ministers said the move was a matter of urgency after the Bingham report into the collapse of BCCI. 'I'm dismayed by the government's lack of urgency,' said Mr Alistair Darling, a Labour Treasury spokesman. The accountancy profession initially argued that there was no need for legislation on the duty to report fraud, since auditors had this requirement in their guidelines.</p>

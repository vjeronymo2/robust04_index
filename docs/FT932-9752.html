			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: Procordia falls 20% in first term PROCORDIA, the Swedish pharmaceutical and food group, yesterday blamed lower Swedish tobacco sales, losses from hotels and one-off lease settlement costs for a 20 per cent fall in first-quarter profits. Profits after financial items fell to SKr893m (Dollars 120.6m) from SKr1.12bn in the same 1991 period, disappointing stock market expectations. The B shares fell SKr4 to close at SKr169. Sales were virtually static at SKr9.55bn, although on a pro-forma basis they rose 10 per cent. Income from ongoing operations fell 4 per cent to SKr963m from SKr1.01bn. The group said a 20 per cent fall in Swedish tobacco sales in the first quarter was a significant reason for the downturn - the result of hoarding prior to an increase in tobacco tax at the end of last year. It saw an increase in one-off costs to SKr83m from SKr3m, largely due to an early settlement of a lease. It incurred a SKr150m deficit from its share of losses in the Sara Travel and Hotel group.</p>

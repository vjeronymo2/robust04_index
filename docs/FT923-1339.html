			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Survey of Georgia and Atlanta (12): Sponsored fanfare has begun - The 1996 centennial Olympic games offer an enormous marketing opportunity IMAGES of the Barcelona Olympics have barely begun to fade, but Atlanta is already revving up for the 1996 games. The official Olympic flag arrived in the port of Savannah on September 10, and embarked on a glitzy train trip through seven more Georgian cities before its final stop in Atlanta. The aim of the trip was to raise interest in the games, but with the fanfare so far, it would be hard to find a Georgian who is not aware - and proud - that the 100th anniversary of the modern Olympics will take place in his/her home state. In local minds, the award of the 1996 Olympics means Atlanta has arrived as an international city. Ever striving to make its mark, it aims to stage the biggest extravaganza of its history for the 1996 centennial games. As a top US convention city, Atlanta has a proven capacity to handle large crowds. It has over 53,000 hotel rooms in its metropolitan area, a number which will climb to 62,000 rooms by 1996. Mr Andrew Young, a former mayor of Atlanta and former US ambassador to the United Nations, is co-chairman of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG: a private, non-profit corporation in charge of staging the event). He says: 'There are conventions of 80,000 people in Atlanta and you don't even notice.' The city recently completed the construction of the Georgia Dome, a 70,500 seat stadium that will be the venue for the 1996 basketball and gymnastics competitions. And it is planning to build a Dollars 207m Olympic Stadium with a capacity to seat 85,000. The construction of these two venues in downtown Atlanta, and the construction or improvement of facilities in nearby Stone Mountain park, will mean that the most of the 32 Olympic events will be concentrated within the city or at the park. Equestrian and shooting events will be held at special facilities no more than 33 miles away. Sailing events will be held in the Atlantic ocean off the city of Savannah, and white water canoeing will take place in Tennessee's Ocoee River. Yet with all Atlanta's attractions as the capital of the New South, its old fashioned southern hospitality and its fame as the cradle of the 1960s civil rights movement, even some of the city's most enthusiastic promoters worry that it will not measure up to Barcelona in terms of cultural history and physically elegant gathering places. Unlike the older northeastern US cities such as New York or Boston, Atlanta is not a pedestrian setting. The summer's sweltering heat discourages much walking. Its downtown area is mostly devoted to the indoor, non-recreational activities of government and business, and the city boasts only one notable crowd gathering spot, the Underground, a redeveloped 19th century remnant of Atlanta before it was burned to the ground by General William T. Sherman during the Civil War. None the less, a pedestrian walkway connecting the main downtown Olympic installations is planned. In total, the ACOG estimates that it will need to spend approximately Dollars 1.4bn for construction and other operations - to include a Dollars 100m host broadcasting facility. While the local government officials are hoping to find Dollars 2.5bn for their wish list of city improvements, the ACOG, which is not asking for any government funds, says that it does not aim to redevelop the city. Mr Young says he tells city leaders bluntly: 'Find a way to do what you need to do with your own money.' ACOG estimates its revenues - including television rights, corporate sponsorships, ticket sales and other marketing income - at just over Dollars 1.5bn. The planned surplus of roughly Dollars 132m is to be donated for the support of amateur athletics. The ACOG's plan for bringing in corporate sponsors seems a bit risky. It is drastically cutting back the number of corporate sponsorships to 12, and raising the price to the unprecedented level of Dollars 40m. Compare this with the 1984 Los Angeles Games - the last time the Olympics were in the US  -which had 35 sponsors at just Dollars 4m each. But Mr Young and Mr AD Frazier, ACOG's chief operating officer, defend the sponsorship strategy by saying that, unlike previous games, the marketing possibilities of the Atlanta Games exceed those of the past. 'We are creating one of the most powerful marketing vehicles in history,' claims Mr Young. The period during which sponsors will be able to use the Atlanta logos and trademarks will be four years instead of the usual one to two years, and the rights to the Atlanta games's symbols will be combined for the first time with those of the US Olympic committee, making a double package. The exclusivity of being among the 12 sponsors - the ACOG calls them 'partners' - will provide greater exposure for companies. This has genuine value: the Atlanta games will be held during US Eastern Standard time, providing for the greatest amount of exposure for a North American audience, according to Mr Frazier. (Some 80 per cent of the US population lives within its Eastern and Central time zones.) The ACOG also believes there will be greater interest in the 1996 games because they mark the centennial of the modern Olympic movement. Already the arguments have convinced three companies to hand over their Dollars 40m: Nationsbank, Sara Lee and Home Depot. In addition, IBM has announced its sponsorship, but it will contribute goods and services worth more than Dollars 40m. Mr Frazier believes the Olympic 12 will all be lined up by mid-1993. All these marketing arguments will likewise be employed good reasons for charging Dollars 500m for the US television rights. NBC bought the Barcelona rights for Dollars 401m and, despite relatively good ratings, still lost Dollars 50m on the operation. Nevertheless - even with sporting events advertising in the doldrums - the sheer size of the potential US audience may be too attractive to pass up. US broadcasters also note that, unlike Olympic games held elsewhere in the world, North Americans will be able to see the events live - an extra incentive to tune in. For Atlanta - given that about 3bn people around the globe may expected to see the games - it is a chance to get on the world map as never before.</p>

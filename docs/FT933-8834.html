			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / People: McDonald - 'enjoying problems' Stuart McDonald, former joint chief executive of London &amp; Edinburgh Trust, has been appointed non-executive chairman of Windsor, a small insurance broker which dominates the sports insurance market. McDonald, 49, resigned from LET last September along with the Beckwith brothers, who founded the property group which was sold to Sweden's SPP for Pounds 491m at the peak of the UK property market in 1990. Windsor, which has a stock market capitalisation of just over Pounds 6m, is recovering from a difficult period when its profits have been hit by a series of ill-conceived acquisitions and diversifications. The need to write down the value of a large property led the group to report a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.9m in the half year to end-March. A new chief executive, Mike Eagles, was brought in from Citicorp two years ago, and the group has been looking for a new chairman to replace Stanley Cohen who has been doing the job on an interim basis. McDonald, who first met John Beckwith when they worked as accountants at Arthur Andersen in the 1960s, spent 14 years with NM Rothschild before joining LET in 1985. Although he says that he has not been hired by Windsor for his property expertise, he continues to advise com-panies on property matters. In May he was appointed to the board of Brent Walker, the heavily indebted pubs and betting shop group. 'I enjoy working for companies with problems rather than massive organisations which are plugging along doing well,' he says.</p>

			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMA CHIEF QUITS AMID FINANCE PROBE  </P> <P> The head of the American Medical Assn. has resigned because of an inquiry into  financial transactions, the doctors' group said Sunday.  </P> <P> James H. Sammons, chief executive of the 300,000-member organization, said he  was retiring 10 months earlier than planned because the financial questions  were interfering with his job.  </P> <P> "My concern was that there was so much inordinate time and energy that was  going into answering all of these things, and the AMA has got to get on with  the business of looking at the health care of this country," he said in a  statement.  </P> <P> Sammons, 62, has been under scrutiny for a $350,000 bailout in pension fund  stock losses to one AMA executive and for a home loan to another association  official. He has denied any impropriety.  </P></p>

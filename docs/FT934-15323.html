			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium producers urged to 'share pain' of output cuts ALUMINIUM PRODUCERS must accept further cuts in output if the industry as a whole is to survive, a London Metal Exchange seminar heard yesterday, reports Reuter. Mr Colin Pratt, of Commodities and Research Unit International, said the western world aluminium industry was already operating at about 91 per cent of capacity but that more cuts were needed, and suggested a 5 to 10 per cent reduction by all producers. 'They must adopt a shared pain, shared gain approach,' he said. The crisis had been caused by world recession, the coming on stream of 1.8m tonnes of new smelter capacity over the past three years, and a huge increase in Russian exports, said Mr Pratt. But no new capacity was expected in the short term, giving the industry a two-year breathing space. Demand growth, which had averaged about 1.5 per cent a year for the past four years, would increase to 3 per cent in 1994 as economies emerged from recession, he said. However, huge Russian exports would continue as they represented genuine excess of production over consumption, not just a stocks drawdown. Without the shared approach to production cuts, the industry faced prices, already at all-time lows in real terms, drifting further downwards, Mr Pratt warned. Mr Huw Roberts, of research consultancy Brook Hunt and Associates, told the seminar that action to bring the lead and zinc markets into balance would be taken over the next 12 months, as smelters in some cases would simply run out of concentrates to process. Lead would outpace zinc in the recovery, thanks to the positive outlook for replacement battery demand, said Mr Roberts. Production cuts had already made an impact in both markets, he said, and there was no chance of large-scale reactivation of mothballed mines next year. This year, he estimated, some 400,000 tonnes of zinc mine production would be lost, while lead output would be 200,000 tonnes lower. Zinc prices would average Dollars 925 a tonne next year, unchanged from the projected 1993 level, Mr Roberts said. He saw the lead price average recovering to Dollars 500 a tonne from Dollars 390, but that would still be low in real terms. The LME should consider extending its business beyond the London daytime and look at introducing contracts further forward, Mr Barry Marshall, president of Hunter Douglas Metals, told the seminar. 'We would like to see a 24-hour market and currently only four or five brokers provide such a service,' he said. Presenting a consumers' view of the LME, he welcomed the recent decision to move contracts out to 27 months but added that more could be done. 'We have to look at prices four, five or six years ahead,' he said. Mr Marshall thought the LME offered a very good hedging mechanism but said some fine tuning was required. More transparency on prices and volumes of LME business was desirable as at present a lot of the exchange's business went unreported.</p>

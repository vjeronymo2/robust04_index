			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / People: Jones follows in Kerss' footsteps David Jones, chief executive of South Wales Electricity, is taking over as the next chief executive of the National Grid Company. He joins at the end of the year, with a short handover period between himself and his predecessor, Bill Kerss, who is stepping down next March when he reaches the normal retiring age of 63. An English engineer from the Midlands, Jones, 51, looks back on a 32-year career in the industry, with two regional electricity boards, South Western and Midlands. He joined South Wales in 1988 as deputy chairman - coincidentally exactly the position Kerss had held before moving on to the National Grid. He was appointed managing director at the time of privatisation and has run the company, together with chairman Wynford Evans, since then. One analyst describes it as an extremely effective partnership, with Evans dealing with much of the political and Welsh aspects of the com-pany's affairs, while Jones concentrated on the day-to-day operation. In April, Jones had assumed the new title of group chief executive, a move which did not however entail any real change of responsibilities or a change in salary. Jones is credited with helping mastermind a comprehensive reorganisation at South Wales. The presence of Welsh Water, which built a controversial stake in the company which it then disposed of at the end of last year, helped spur management on to make a round of cost-cutting more quickly than happened in some of the other regions. South Wales says it is embarking on an extensive search for Jones' replacement. While there are internal candidates, it is also searching elsewhere within the industry as well as outside the confines of the electricity business. The National Grid Holding (NGH) company is owned by the 12 regional electricity companies and South Wales has a 5.4 per cent stake. Jones has been on the board of NGH since privatisation; no head- hunters were involved in his appointment.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Shevelev report under the "Market" rubric: "`Echo' </F> Up for Grabs"]    [Text] January promises to be a turning point in the  history of the "Ekho Moskvy" radio station. Its future will  depend on whose capital it will manage to attract. The largest  independent radio station already boasts an audience of 4  million listeners or so.    In Moscow and Moscow Oblast, where "Ekho" is on the air, it  has already presented serious competition for "Radio Rossii" and  "Mayak." By the end of 1993, however, it became obvious that  "Ekho's" financial position does not look as bright as its  approval rating. Wear and tear on its equipment has begun  affecting the quality of broadcasting. Meager salaries by  comparison with, say, music radio stations, force journalists to  look for extra income or to go into business.    If "Ekho Moskvy" is to survive, it has no other choice but  to  attract outside capital. There have been so far two candidates  courting this "bride" -- the "Most" financial group and Weigel  Broadcasting, an American company.    In the past six months the "Most" group under Vladimir  Gusinskiy proved to be an aggressive buyer on the mass media  market. At present, it controls the SEGODNYA newspaper and the  fourth television channel. What it lacks to have a complete  spectrum is a popular radio station. "Most's" offer to "Ekho"  looks as follows: an open credit line in exchange for 51 percent  of the radio station's stock. This means that the station risks  losing political, not only financial, independence.    Weigel Broadcasting is not a newcomer on the broadcasting  market: After 25 years in business it owns eight television  stations in the United States. According to the company's  spokesmen, they are interested in "Ekho's" independence, because  in the end it earns a good income. Weigel Broadcasting is ready  to invest money not only in equipment: the 50 percent of stock  it expects to get in exchange for its services opens up a way  toward compromise-based management.    There is no unity inside "Ekho Moskvy" as to whose proposal  it should accept. Editor-in-chief Sergey Korzun and journalists  are inclined to forge a partnership with Weigel Broadcasting.  Proposals by the "Most" group appear enticing to Yuriy  Fedutinov, the station's commercial director. The fate of "Ekho  Moskvy" will apparently be decided in mid-January at a general  meeting of stockholders.</p>

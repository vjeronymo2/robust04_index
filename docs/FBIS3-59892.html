			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F> Diplomatic Correspondents Dmitriy Vosboinikov, Igor Porshnev,  Vitaly Trubetskoi and others]    [Text] "Considering our international commitments and  proceeding from the interests of Russia's security, we cannot  allow the emergence of new nuclear states on our borders." This  statement was made in an exclusive interview with INTERFAX in  Murmansk on Tuesday by Russia's Foreign Minister, Andrey Kozyrev.    That is why Moscow intends to firmly insist on removing  nuclear arms from Ukraine for their further scrapping in Russia,  he pointed out.    According to the foreign minister, the stand taken by Russia  gained "unanimous support" at the Brussels session of the  North-Atlantic Council for Cooperation. At Russia's insistence  the Council urged Ukraine to ratify the START I treaty, "since  no one in the world recognizes the Ukrainian parliament's  resolution on this score as ratification."    As Kozyrev said, "Ukraine's interpretation of this issue is  fundamentally wrong." "Kiev's arguments to the effect that the  Ukrainian parliament ratified START I, and that this is its way  of claiming the right to possess nuclear weapons deployed in  Ukraine, cannot be taken seriously," he stressed.    Russia, Kozyrev pointed out, "did all it could to conduct a  peaceful dialog with Ukraine." "However, the problem of nuclear  weapons makes the situation hopeless. The same relates to the  Black Sea Fleet whose division is absurd in itself," he said.    According to the head of Russian diplomacy, "Sevastopol was  Russia's naval base and it must remain as such." "The process of  placing the fleet under Russia's jurisdiction must proceed  painlessly by means of making compensation to Ukraine,  notwithstanding the fact that Ukraine owes Russia enormous sums  of money for oil and gas, as well as in the framework of trade,"  he said.    Kozyrev is confident that relations between Russia and  Ukraine can be normalized as soon as Ukraine begins to honor the  bilateral agreements reached in Massandra. "But we have no right  to go along with the absurd ideas of proliferating nuclear arms  and dividing the Black Sea Fleet," Kozyrev said.    When asked about Russia's attitude to the possibility of  expanding the number of permanent members in the UN Security  Council by means of including Germany and Japan in it, Kozyrev  noted that this is not a pressing problem.    With reference to the Russian Choice bloc, he is a  co-founder  of, Kozyrev said that in the future parliament the bloc may "in  principle" enter into coalition with "any reformist movements."  "However let's wait and see how many seats in the parliament  Russian Choice itself will obtain," he added.    Kozyrev said he fears that members of the future parliament  "will spend a year or two on their accomodation and training  alone." "As a result we'll lose the Duma. To prevent this from  happening we'll have to elect real professionals, such as those  who belong to the Russian Choice bloc, to the Yavlinskiy bloc,  to the Shakhray bloc," Kozyrev said. "In the next two years  we'll have to 'push through' several laws which would enable the  country to live in peace. Let the new deputies who will come  later improve them."</p>

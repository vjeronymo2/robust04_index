			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / The price is wrong for some motorists: Why sales to private car buyers are declining The motor trade is starting to fear that sales of new cars to private buyers are plunging - not because of a lack of consumer confidence, but because of discontent with high prices and depreciation. Evidence is mounting that private motorists who can afford to buy new cars are instead buying cars which are one or two years old. This leaves the heaviest burden of depreciation to be borne by the companies which bought them new - often at deeply discounted prices which disillusioned private motorists believe they subsidise. Professor Garel Rhys, professor of motor industry economics at Cardiff Business School, said improvements to the quality of cars meant that private buyers were finding such second-hand purchases largely problem-free, and many might never return to the new car market - 'at least not until. . . new car prices come down to the value-for-money level offered by cars in North America'. The National Franchised Dealers Association, which represents franchised motor dealers, said carmakers' 'fleets first' marketing priorities meant the average price of a medium-size family car was Pounds 2,000 higher than it would otherwise be. Mr Alan Pulham, association director, said this reflected two factors: The need to fund the discounts, free servicing and other inducements to fleets not normally available to private buyers. These perks were paid for in the main by private motorists paying close to the manufacturer's list price. Cars available to private buyers often had higher specifications than they wanted or could afford as they were aimed mainly at fleets. Statistics from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show that new car registrations rose 8.5 per cent in the first 10 months of this year to 1.71m, compared with the same period last year. But this was led overwhelmingly by the business car sector - which accounts for nearly 60 per cent of the total - with a rise of 15.8 per cent. Even taking into account the August rush, when private buyers usually predominate, registrations to private buyers rose just 2.2 per cent. If the August factor is removed registrations to private buyers fell 5 per cent in the first half of the year, in spite of a 14 per cent rise in total registrations. But a more telling pointer to a consumer revolt comes in the latest quarterly statistical bulletin from HPI, the motor trade finance organisation. This shows that the number of new cars bought on credit is ahead of last year but that the rate of increase has fallen in each of the past three quarters. Many businesses, as well as private motorists, buy new cars on credit. So the weakening of new cars bought on credit understates the rate of decline among private buyers. In contrast, purchases of used cars on credit have been rising for most of the past year. HPI's data for last month shows another year-on-year rise of 11.1 per cent - almost twice the new car level. Carmakers have made much of price cuts - or at least the absence of sizeable price increases - as showing fierce competition. Yet an analysis by Sewells International, the motor-trade monitoring group, concludes that the price restraint is more apparent than real. The analysis shows the list price of a typical best-selling car to have risen just 3.7 per cent between 1991 and this year. In that period the 10 per cent special car tax has been removed and dealers have had their profit margins cut - slashing the discounts they could offer private buyers. The study concludes: 'The average new car should be around 13 per cer cent cheaper because of the abolition of special car tax and the introduction of lower dealer margins.' Prof Rhys said that the view of private buyers that they were subsiding fleet buyers was misguided because the sheer size of the fleet market helped to cover costs which would otherwise fall on private buyers. But the crunch for carmakers, he said, was that their costs were too high and that 'for the first time British buyers are becoming aware of the car value that Americans get for their money'. He added: 'Prices of new cars in Europe must come down in real terms to North American levels. That's when the fur will fly. There are simply too many carmakers in Europe and they can't all survive.'</p>

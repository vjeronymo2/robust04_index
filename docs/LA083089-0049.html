			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD UNIVERSITY GAMES;  </P> <P> U.S. DEFEATS SOVIETS FOR BASKETBALL TITLE  </P> <P> The United States won its first major men's international basketball  competition in three years on Tuesday with an 88-80 victory over the Soviet  Union in the championship game of the World University Games.  </P> <P> Stephen Thompson of Syracuse scored 16 points to lead the U.S. team, and Stacey  Augmon, the only player here who also played on the bronze medal team at Seoul,  added 15 points.  </P> <P> The title was the first for the United States since the 1986 World  Championships. The United States lost on home soil to Brazil in the 1987 Pan Am  Games and was beaten by the Soviet Union in the semifinals of the 1988 Seoul  Olympics.  </P> <P> Larry Johnson, who will join Augmon at Nevada Las Vegas next season, had 14  points and 11 rebounds for the United States, which overcame an early  eight-point deficit to take a 47-40 halftime lead.  </P> <P> "They played slowdown and they played a little herky-jerky during a couple of  streaks," said U.S. Coach Gene Keady of Purdue. "But we didn't expect to beat  anyone badly in the final. We'd have been glad with a one-point win.  </P> <P> "I feel that the U.S. image has slipped a bit. But at the same time, though, we  wanted to be number one again. We feel we have a team that could stand on its  own against anyone here regardless of the past."  </P> <P> The United States took control of the game with pressure defense and inside  dominance. The Soviets committed 19 turnovers to just four for the United  States.  </P> <P> Goundars Vetra led all scorers with 27 points, 17 in the first half when the  Soviet Union was able to slow the pace and take advantage of his outside  shooting.  </P> <P> Vetra, who also had seven rebounds, fouled out midway through the second half,  all but eliminating any Soviet comeback hopes.  </P> <P> The Unites States' fourth gold in track and field came when Kamy Keshmiri won  the discus with a throw of 214 feet 7 inches.  </P> <P> In other events, Viorica Ghican of Romania won the women's 10,000 meters in 31  minutes 46.43 seconds, the second fastest in the world this year; Ari Suhonen  of Finland won the men's 800 in 1:47.13; Igor Lapshin of the Soviet Union took  the triple jump at 57-1, and Larisa Nikitina of the Soviet Union won the  heptathlon with 6,847 points, a meet record.  </P></p>

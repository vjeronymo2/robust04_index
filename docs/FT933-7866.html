			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Examiners asked if they make the grade: John Authers on whether a rise in A-level passes means candidates are improving THE EDUCATION community had hoped to take some credit for good news after a troubled year. But yesterday teachers and administrators were being asked whether the fifth successive rise in the pass rate in A-level exams was because examination candidates were improving or because examiners were making exams easier. The National Union of Teachers dismissed the claim that standards had been lowered as 'a hoary chestnut', while the Association of Teachers and Lecturers had 'full confidence' that A-level examining boards were setting papers which were 'as rigorous as ever'. Dr William Lambert, convener of the GCE secretaries group which represents the examination boards, said: 'Any improvement in the percentage of students gaining these grades is due solely to improved performance on their part.' The examinations were 'second to none in terms of quality control and consistency of standards from year to year'. A-levels have not always been intended as a measure of educational standards. When they were developed after the war as the main examination for university entrants in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, each board was given a general guideline that the top 10 per cent of candidates would receive an A grade, the next 15 per cent a B grade and so on. This ranked candidates but said nothing about the standard of one year's entrants compared with another's. Also, a given grade might be easier to achieve from one examining board than from another. The boards now meet every three or four years to try to agree on uniform standards. But the table, compiled from the boards' reports by Mander Portman Woodward, a group of independent sixth form colleges, shows that success rates continue to vary widely. In English Literature, where marking must be more subjective than in some subjects, only 1.5 per cent fail with the Oxford and Cambridge board, while 25.6 per cent fail the Associated Examining Board's purely written syllabus. Its more popular alter-native syllabus, which includes an element of teacher assessment, has a failure rate of 6 per cent. Similar, although smaller, disparities are noticeable in other subjects  - for example, 9.1 per cent fail mathematics with Oxford and Cambridge, compared with 33.5 per cent at the AEB. Dr George Turnbull of the AEB says the differences are due to the boards' customers. The Oxford and Cambridge board is popular with independent schools, many of which are selective and could be expected to achieve higher results. The AEB has traditional links with adult and further education. The boards' standards are monitored by the Schools Examination and Assessment Council, a government body which assesses two subjects each year. The council enforces a more uniform standard than that achieved by different universities for degrees. Mr Joe Ruston, a director of Mander Portman Woodward, argues that there is a need for a single examining board. 'The question is, how do you achieve harmonisation between the boards unless by having one board for the whole country?' This year the government mounted an investigation of all A-level boards, which should settle the question. The Office for Standards in Education, which runs school inspection in England and Wales, expects to publish its review in October.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- A-LEVEL ENGLISH RESULTS JUNE 1992  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                               ------ Grade % ------                                  Number of     Good Examination board               candidates    pass*   Pass**   Fail  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Oxford local                         3,539     29.4   52       18.5 Oxford and Cambridge                 5,388     47.5   51        1.5 AEB                                  3,316     20     54.4     25.6 AEB (alternative syllabus)          16,999     29.5   64.5      6 London                               6,833     38.1   46.3     15.6 NEAB (JMB) Syllabus A                7,596     33.2   50.6     16.2 NEAB (JMB) Syllabus C                5,019     34.1   48.2     17.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                               48,690     33.1   55.1     11.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Grades A and B, ** Grades C, D and E Source: Examining Boards  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

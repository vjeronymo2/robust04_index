			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Sutherland faces toughest brief - Profile of the free trade champion likely to be Gatt's new chief MR PETER Sutherland, former European Community competition commissioner and now chairman of Allied Irish Banks, is confidently expected to be chosen director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade at a special meeting of the contracting parties on June 9. Once the EC, US and other European nations made clear their support for Mr Sutherland, the two Latin American candidates, Mr Julio Lacarte-Muro of Uruguay and Mr Luis Fernando Jaramillo of Colombia, had no chance of securing the necessary consensus of Gatt's 111 members. Mr Sutherland is to take over from Mr Arthur Dunkel, a Swiss who has held the post since 1980. He will be only the fourth head of the Gatt. The first two were Sir Eric Wyndham White (1948-65), a British citizen who presided over the birth and establishment of the institution, and Mr Olivier Long (1968-80), another Swiss, who was in charge of the Tokyo Round of multilateral trade negotiations. Mr Sutherland's pressing task will be to inject dynamism into the world trade body. His immediate priority will be completion of the Uruguay Round of trade talks, already 2 1/2 years delayed. The next deadline is the end of this year, when the extension of the US 'fast track' negotiating authority now sought by the Clinton administration is to run out. A strong supporter of liberal trade and Gatt, Mr Sutherland has agreed to take on this exasperating job after initial hesitation. He does so at a time of fierce bilateral disputes between the US, EC and Japan and open questioning of Gatt norms, rules and procedures by the new US administration and Congress. The credibility of the multilateral trading system is at stake. Mr Sutherland established his international reputation as EC competition commissioner between 1984 and 1988, when he emerged as a key architect of the single market programme - along with Britain's Lord Cockfield and Commission president Jacques Delors. His legal experience made him master of many a complex EC brief and his negotiation skills - a touch primitive at first - ripened impressively over time. He quickly saw the potential of the EC's founding charter, the Treaty of Rome, to break down national barriers, typically using the threat of action in the European Court of Justice to extract political concessions from reluctant member states. Mr Sutherland's efforts to expose unfair state aid and breathe competition into European industry enjoyed the benefit of a strong tailwind of business and public support - something the EC lacks today. In particular, the campaign to break up Europe's airline cartel and usher in cheaper fares was a popular crusading issue almost made in heaven. That said, the airline industry is a powerful and well organised lobby and only someone with Mr Sutherland's persistence could have achieved what he did on liberalisation. Writing in his autobiography The Enterprise Years, the former British trade and industry secretary Lord Young says he had a 'high regard for (Mr Sutherland's) ability and character. . . I thought (he was) quite outstanding in his grasp both of concept and detail in all the City and competition matters we had dealt with together.' A Commission official at the time believes 'his strength derived from the fact that he was remarkably apolitical. He didn't have the normal fears of a politician, and marched into a room quite happily to present his case. He won respect because he always took a straightforward approach.' Mr Sutherland's high profile stemmed in part from his controversial portfolio, but also from his widely publicised tussles with the more dirigiste Mr Delors. Mr Sutherland's stock in Brussels went up sharply when the stories first started to leak out - but the man patronisingly dubbed the 'little sheriff' by the Commission president was always ambivalent about the publicity. His support for the Commission's collegiate decision-making style was genuine and, despite their differences, he and Mr Delors had a mutual respect. Although Mr Sutherland played expansively on the European - and even international - stage when in Brussels, he could not have been accused of neglecting Irish interests. He broadly supported the thrust of the Community's common agricultural policy reforms, but on more than one occasion sought, behind the scenes, to soften the blow for Irish farmers. Mr Sutherland earlier demonstrated his interest in the Uruguay Round by participating, notwithstanding the agricultural interests of his country, in the Eminent Persons Group on World Trade, under the chairmanship of Count Otto Lambsdorff. Participants included former US trade representative William Brock and Lord Young. The group called for completion of a liberalising Uruguay Round in 1990, arguing that 'what is at stake is not prosperity alone. It is the framework of international competition and security.' As a citizen of an EC member state with strong agricultural interests, it will be particularly important for Mr Sutherland to demonstrate total disinterestedness in his new role. The director-general represents the interests of the world as a whole, particularly those of the small trade-dependent nations that make up the bulk of the Gatt's membership. To succeed in his task, Mr Sutherland will need to show independence from the EC. Senior policy-makers in the leading trading powers are at least showing renewed interest in making the Uruguay Round succeed. It will be Mr Sutherland's immediate task to seize on that opportunity and bring the round to completion at last. This will prove a tougher challenge than any he has experienced before.</p>

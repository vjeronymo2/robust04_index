			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: Kmart forced to float units Kmart, the troubled US discount store group, yielded to pressure from rebellious institutional investors and has announced plans to float off three of its four specialty retailing subsidiaries on the stock market. The three companies to be divested are OfficeMax, a chain of office supplies superstores; The Sports Authority, a chain of sporting goods superstores; and Borders/Walden, comprising the Borders book superstores and Waldenbooks book shops. The group's fourth specialty retailing operation, Builders Square, is not considered a candidate for flotation because it does not make a profit. Kmart has been forced into the divestment by its shareholders' rejection of an earlier plan to create classes of Kmart shares tied to the performance of the specialty retailers. Kmart had hoped to raise between Dollars 600m and Dollars 900m by selling 20 per cent to 30 per cent of these shares without relinquishing control of the subsidiaries. Under the new plan, Kmart will sell at least 51 per cent of its shares in three of the specialty retailers through initial public offerings, so yielding control of the companies. An initial public offering of shares in OfficeMax will take place in the next few weeks. Kmart said it was confident the revised plan would win shareholders' approval because it had discussed it with institutional investors.</p>

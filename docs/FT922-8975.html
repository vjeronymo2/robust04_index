			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / International Company News: Woolworth takes stake in German retail group THE GERMAN arm of Woolworth, the US retail giant, has taken an indirect stake of 6.25 per cent in Horten, Germany's fourth largest retail group, for an undisclosed sum. F. W. Woolworth, which operates 316 retail stores in Germany, is buying a 25 per cent stake in Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Anlagenverwaltung (Degav), a holding company owning 25 per cent of Horten. Woolworth said it regarded the holding as a long-term investment in the German department store sector, made especially secure because of Horten's extensive property portfolio. Following a restructuring this year, Horten is indirectly controlled via Westdeutsche Landesbank, the Dusseldorf-based regional bank. It has a 60 per cent stake in a holding company which owns 49.9 per cent of the retailer, and a further 1.1 per cent stake directly. The remaining 75 per cent of Degav is owned by Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank. Woolworth's German operations had sales of DM2.9bn (Dollars 1.75bn) in 1991, and net earnings of DM78.3m.</p>

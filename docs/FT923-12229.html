			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Letter: Tax regime change not way to promote N Sea oil construction industry Sir, While wholeheartedly sympathising with the desire of Liberal MPs Russell Johnston and Charles Kennedy to preserve jobs in the North Sea oil construction industry, I cannot agree with their view that it is 'essential to explore whether a change in the North Sea tax regime might promote development and bring forward orders' ('200 oil jobs to be cut', July 10). I wonder if they are aware of the extent to which the UK North Sea tax regime has already become one of the most generous in the world and that, in 1991, Petroleum Revenue Tax, the instrument which ought to be extracting the economic rent from North Sea hydrocarbon production, has actually become negative, with repayments of Pounds 200m from the taxpayer to the oil companies. A substantial array of tax allowances (production allowance, capital 'uplift', cross-field allowances etc), combined with the lowest corporation tax in Europe (and lower than the US), means that the UK is now virtually giving its oil and gas reserves away. Our calculations show that in 1991 the government's share of the North Sea surplus had fallen to a mere 14.4 per cent and the average government 'take' per barrel of oil equivalent produced was only 96 pence. Moreover, an inspection of the published accounts of oil companies operating in the UK sector of the North Sea indicates that many of them are currently paying no tax at all to the UK and many will continue to pay no tax well into the future. In many developing countries this would be regarded as a national scandal. Not apparently in Britain. In his forward to the latest Brown Book on the development of UK oil and gas resources, the minister for energy remarks that 'over the years a close working relationship has developed between industry and government'. Surely it is time to conclude that this close working relationship has become a little too close. Ian Rutledge, energy/minerals economist, SERIS, 103 Carter Knowle Road, Sheffield S7 2DY</p>

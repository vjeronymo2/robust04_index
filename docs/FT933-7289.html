			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / BR confirms Prideaux is to leave BRITISH RAIL yesterday confirmed that Mr John Prideaux, chairman of Union Railways the subsidiary responsible for the Pounds 2.5bn Channel tunnel rail link, is to leave, Andrew Adonis writes. He is to be replaced by Mr John Armitt, director of John Laing's civil engineering and international division. The decision to change the project's management reflects increasingly fraught relations at the top of BR in the run-up to privatisation. Ministers are keen to inject private capital into the Channel project, but no viable arrangement is thought to be imminent.</p>

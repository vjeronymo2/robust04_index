			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa prices surge on Ivory Coast worries The cocoa market surged yesterday in busy trading in spite of the New York market being closed for the Thanksgiving holiday. The March futures contract at the London Commodity Exchange gained Pounds 29 a tonne to close at the day's high of Pounds 1,048 a tonne as traders continued to express concerns about the political situation in the Ivory Coast - the world's largest producer. Fears for the health of Ivorian President Houphouet-Boigny have been fueled by a total blackout on news concerning him following rumours earlier this week that he was dead. On Monday, near March coffee prices reached a high of Pounds 1,056 a tonne, as the market feared political unrest in the Ivory Coast, which has been one of Africa's more stable economies. Cocoa prices have been buoyed for several months on reports of a deficit in this year's crop. The low estimates for the cocoa harvest have since been upgraded, but the market still believes that the past two years of production deficits could augur a longer term trend. There are still problems associated with this year's Ivory Coast crop, with reports of poor quality, some late harvesting and a shortage of bags. At the same time, consumption is increasing and processors are eager to stock up on supplies. 'What you're seeing is that the people who need cocoa are doubling up on their cover so that if they don't receive the physical delivery, they could at least take the futures instead', said Mr Tony Chadwick, cocoa trader at Prudential Bache, the London securities house. But he sounded a note of caution about the bull run. 'The higher the price goes, the more likely that countries introduce cocoa butter substitutes,' he warned. Members of the Cocoa Producers' Alliance have agreed to restrict output in an attempt to build on the recent rise in prices. But Indonesia, a large producer but not a CPA member, is refusing to co-operate and is increasing its own production, which could jeopardise the success of the scheme. The CPA agreement has no future and will not work, Brazilian cocoa traders insisted yesterday, reports Reuter from Rio de Janeiro. Alliance members, including Brazil, agreed on Wednesday in Guayaquil, Ecuador, that each would limit its annual production to its average over the past three years. But Brazil's traders dismissed the plan. 'I suppose they're going to tell the trees to stop growing cocoa,' said one. 'It's a completely stupid plan and when I say that, I'm being diplomatic,' he added. The agreement still has to be approved by the CPA's council of ministers in January before it can come into effect, but Brazil's exporters said that even if that happened, it would not be a guarantee that the plan would work. 'Maybe the agreement will be signed but even so, I can't see any way it will actually function,' said one dealer. 'It will probably take a few years just for everyone to agree on what is their average for the last three years. How are you going to control what each members' level is?'</p>

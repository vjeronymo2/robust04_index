			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Prudential Stop the carping - it may be time to pass the hat round for Mr Mick Newmarch. The Pru's remuneration committee has just awarded its new chief executive a 43 per cent salary rise for his work in 1989, when earnings advanced 12 per cent and pre-tax profits were 9 per cent ahead. Next time the committee meets, it will base its calculations on calendar 1990 when earnings plunged by 60 per cent and profits slipped by a third. Using the same sort of arithmetic, Mr Newmarch may soon be paying his shareholders to come to the office.</p>

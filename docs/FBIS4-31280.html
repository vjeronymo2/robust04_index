			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] In a move that could forecast similar  actions by other foreign oil companies investing in Poland,  Amoco was reported in the 26 April RZECZPOSPOLITA, based on  "unofficial sources," to be planning to withdraw from its  agreement with the Polish Republic signed 2 October 1992 ``to  explore and exploit'' oil and gas deposits following initial  borings that located only ``small amounts of gas.'' The Warsaw  daily further reported that Amoco had purchased land parcels  south of Lodz and also in the southeast of Poland near the  border with Ukraine for $8 million. Amoco also planned,  according to the report, to invest a further $22 million, a fact  that was unofficially confirmed by Polish Oil and Gas  Engineering (PGNiG). That information was seemingly  contradicted by Eryk Mistewicz's article in the 15 May WPROST,  entitled ``Poland for the Poles,'' which reported that Amoco  was ``suspending'' a much larger sum, ``several hundreds of  millions of dollars'' worth of investments.    A second contract, allowing Amoco to search for methane in  the hard-oal deposits of Upper Silesia, was, until recently,  praised as the Ministry of Environmental Protection's ``greatest  accomplishment.'' WPROST noted that the company ``retains the  right to withdraw'' from the second contract, although it is not  clear if it indeed intends to do so. WPROST asserts that Amoco  ``had planned'' to extract 5 billion cubic meters of methane  annually, ``with reserves estimated at 1.2 trillion cubic  meters''--which would mean an investment of $2-3 million ``in  each of the 400-square kilometers of surface awarded in the  concession,'' according to head geologist Michal Wilczynski.  Sejm Deputy Radoslaw Gawlik of UW (Freedom Union) complains  that, if Amoco withdraws from the contract, ``the losses would  be obvious,'' forcing Poland to continue reliance on Russian  imports, amounting to ``almost 7 billion cubic meters''  annually. The Upper Silesian area would also get none of the  ``ecological relief'' promised by Amoco production.  <H5>  The Tax Exemption Issue </H5>   ``Officially,'' Amoco representatives say one reason for  their withdrawal is the issue of the ``all too-short'' tax  exemption, RZECZPOSPOLITA reports, based on ``well-informed  sources.'' The current law, dated December 1988, allows  companies with foreign capital up to three years tax exempt  status. The world standard for oil companies, however, is to  allow a period of seven to 10 years before expecting a profit.  Nor was Amoco pleased that it was not exempt from the VAT  [value-added tax] during the exploration period. While a June  1991 amendment to the law allowed companies formed under the  1988 law--including Amoco--to retain their tax exempt status as  originally granted, a new condition was added at the beginning  of this year, forfeiting the tax exempt status of any company  formed under the 1988 law that had not yet begun economic  activity nor had, by 31 March 1994, conducted its first  commercial transaction. Forfeiture could be avoided if the  company met at least two conditions: The contribution of the  foreign party to the statutory capital had to exceed the  equivalent of 2 million ECU's, and the company had to either a)  undertake its activity in regions of high unemployment, b)  ensure implementation of new technology, or c) sell at least 20  percent of its goods and services for export.    In accordance with the 1991 law, the tax relief cannot be  higher than the value of the acquisition or the assumption of  shares by the foreign entity. Thus, the exemption from income  tax cannot be higher than the amount committed by the foreign  entity to purchase the company's capital. RZECZPOSPOLITA notes  that, on the basis of its information, there was no deviation  from that principle. The entities now benefiting from tax  exemptions either received them on the basis of the earlier 1988  law or have not exceeded in tax benefits the amount of their  capital involvement.  <H5>  Blaming the Government </H5>   The 15 May WPROST article viewed the Amoco situation less  from an economic situation than from a political one,  attributing it to a ``three-part'' ping-pong game between Amoco,  the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Environmental  Protection. While the ministers of finance in each of the  governments since the agreement was signed acknowledged that  demands for tax exempt status were valid and assured Amoco that  ``necessary decisions'' were forthcoming, Amoco ``continued to  wait.'' WPROST further placed some of the blame for Amoco's  departure on the resignation of Finance Minister Marek Borowski  (a member of the Democratic Left Alliance), quoting the Amoco  director in Poland, Karl F. Arleth, as saying the day after  Borowski's resignation that ``we no longer felt welcome'' in  Poland. According to WPROST, Amoco ``understood'' that ``all  previously enacted settlements would no longer be respected''  and quoted Arleth that the company never expected special tax  consideration but only ``to be treated in accordance with the  rules of the oil business throughout the world.'' Indeed,  WPROST reports that, while Amoco expected to ``wait a while''  for results, it later ``warned'' the Ministry of Environmental  Protection that it had no intention of negotiating the  conditions for the already signed contract ``for eternity.''    WPROST asserted that ``directors of other companies have  also  expressed their disillusionment'' and elsewhere notes that  ``today, British Gas, Exxon, and Shell have the same problems in  Poland and are not advancing in their work.'' An unnamed ``head  of one of the oil comapnies represented in Poland'' is quoted as  saying that, in both Poland and Russia, ``not much'' has  happened, ``despite many contracts having been signed.''  ``Everyone always wants more time,'' he said, but added that  ``after all, Poland simply does not have the number of deposits  that Russia has.'' RZECZPOSPOLITA, in turn, notes that British  Gas is currently drilling in the Lodz area and that ``Exxon  Shell'' intends to drill in the area east of Poznan.  <H5>  A General Downturn </H5>   In addition to the small deposits located in Poland thus  far,  RZECZPOSPOLITA offered a less politically involved reason for  Amoco's departure: Last year, international oil suffered a  ``serious drop'' in profits as a result of lower prices for  crude oil. Citing FORTUNE magazine, it noted that oil companies  around the world have dropped in the Fortune 500 list of major  corporations, including Exxon, Elf Aquitaine, and the Spanish  Repsol, which, RZECZPOSPOLITA noted, had also considered  investing in Poland but decided against it. With Amoco dropping  from 12th to 13th place in the list of leading oil companies,  ``it is very likely that, because there was little chance of  making a big profit, Poland was simply crossed off the list.''</p>

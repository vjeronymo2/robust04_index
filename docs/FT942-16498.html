			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Playing it by the book I am about to sign an agreement with a publisher for another book. At my request, it has agreed to divide any royalties between my two adult sons. But my accountant and the Society of Authors doubt the wisdom of this. What are the income tax, inheritance tax and capital gains tax implications? Income tax: The royalties will form part of your income assessable under Case II of Schedule D. Your sons will not be taxable on the money. IHT: The payments will be potentially-exempt (or possibly exempt) transfers, depending upon more facts that we have). CGT: There will be no consequences. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Nabil Sha'th has explained that his meeting with  members of the Palestinian Authority [PA] scheduled for tomorrow  at Orient House in East Jerusalem will be a reception and not a  working session or an official meeting. He told our  correspondent Moti Amir that he will confer with the PA members  in Jericho this afternoon to brief them about his meeting with  Major General Amnon Shahaq, during which he will discuss the  continuation of the negotiations on the implementation of the  autonomy agreements. Dr. Sha'th said that a reception, and not  an official meeting, will be held for him at Orient House. He  added that he will pray at al-Aqsa Mosque and visit churches in  East Jerusalem tomorrow.    Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert has called on the prime minister  to take immediate action to thwart Sha'th's plans to visit  Jerusalem. He told our correspondent Aviv Bushinsky that such a  visit would constitute a violation of the autonomy agreements.    The National Religious Party [NRP] and Moledet have joined  the call to prevent the PA from holding a meeting in East  Jerusalem. Our correspondent Hayim Hecht quotes NRP leader  Zvulun Hammer as saying: Giving the PA a foothold in Jerusalem  is tantamount to letting it trample on the State of Israel's  honor. Moledet leader Rehav'am Ze'evi said the Palestinians are  making a mockery of the State of Israel, and that is why Rabin  must prevent the meeting in Jerusalem.</p>

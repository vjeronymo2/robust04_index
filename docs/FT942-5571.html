			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Moody's downgrades Canadian debt rating Moody's, the New York-based rating agency, has downgraded Canada's foreign-currency debt to reflect concern over growing federal and provincial borrowing requirements. The downgrade, from AAA, the highest rating, to AA1, affects about USDollars 8.5bn of securities, issued by the federal government as well as agencies such as the Export Development Corporation and the Canadian Wheat Board. Loans denominated in Canadian dollars, which make up the bulk of government borrowings, are not affected. Prices on the domestic bond market fell slightly after the Moody's announcement. Standard &amp; Poor's, the other large rating agency, lowered its rating early last year. Moody's said the federal government and the provinces face a 'long and difficult' task in containing their respective debts. While recent deficit-cutting measures were expected to continue, the agency said that there was a risk 'that a deviation from the medium-term programmes of a number of important public sector issuers could occur'.</p>

			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BLACK COLLEGE BONANZA  </P> <P> Your decision to run the article "Black Colleges Enjoy Renaissance" was greatly  appreciated by us. The article meant so much to the continuance and growth of  our program, the purpose of which is to expose Black youth to a very positive  and motivational experience.  </P> <P> As a result of the article in The Times, new doors have opened to us, doors we  didn't even know existed.  </P> <P> We received a call from Mr. Randy St. Martin of the L.A. Theatre Center, who  would like to perform his one-man show "Color Me Black" at the Theatre Center  during Black History Month and donate the proceeds to the Black College Tours.  With the money raised, we intend to offer scholarships at high schools  throughout the Los Angeles and Compton unified school districts.  </P> <P> The United Negro College Fund called to say that any individual or corporation  wishing to make a donation to help sponsor a student's tour could do so. Thus,  they are setting up a restricted fund with all monies collected to be earmarked  for Black College Tours.  </P> <P> We would like to thank Ms. Jocelyn Stewart for the outstanding job that she did  on the article. With this type of help, we are certain that we will be able to  continue to have a positive impact on the lives of the youth of our community.  </P> <P> GREGORY and YASMIN DELAHOUSSAYE  </P> <P> Sepulveda  </P></p>

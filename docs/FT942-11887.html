			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / World Bank plans Dollars 1.2bn Palestinian aid The World Bank has produced a Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 820m) emergency assistance programme designed to yield improvements over three years in living standards in the occupied territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The programme is intended to serve as a sketch map to help co-ordinate aid flows from a wide range of donors, with the hope of avoiding some of the problems that could follow as money is pumped into a region with only rudimentary governmental and institutional structures. 'It is in one sense a blessing not to have a long history of government bureaucracy. The negative side is you don't have any institutional structures,' said Mr Ram Chopra, World Bank director in charge of the occupied territories programme. The programme proposes investing Dollars 234m for Gaza and Dollars 366m for the West Bank over the next three years in infrastructure projects such as water, sewers, transportation, electricity and education, as well as Dollars 300m to support private-sector development of housing, telecommunications and industry. But it also includes an unusual Dollars 225m start-up expenditure programme intended to provide temporary funding for a new Palestinian central administration, and to finance a social safety net through the public sector and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) already working in the area. 'It is critical in this period to work with existing institutions and programmes, composed mainly of municipal structures authorised under the Israeli government, and the NGOs,' Mr Chopra said. The World Bank has been working with the Palestinian Council for Economic Development and Reconstruction, set up by the Palestinian assembly last year to manage economic issues in a transition period. The emergency assistance programme represents a first tranche of aid commitments from donor countries to the occupied territories totalling Dollars 2.4bn over four years. Mr Chopra said the Bank's task force had examined proposals totalling about Dollars 2.8bn, but had cut them to Dollars 1.2bn to include only projects with the most immediate impact and which could be effectively implemented. 'That does not mean the ones we did not include are not a priority; they may just not have been ready,' he added. Earlier Palestinian estimates of the money needed went as high as Dollars 10bn, but Mr Chopra said that included projects over a much longer period, as well as private-sector investment. Official statistics suggest an average annual income of around Dollars 1,275 per capita for Palestinians in the occupied territories, higher than in Jordan and more than double Egypt's income level. But World Bank studies showed that services such as power, water and sewerage are often on a par with the least-developed countries.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe 13 June TASS -- The "SADO-I MARDUM" daily,  an official newspaper of the Tajik parliament, has published a  sensational exposure of "anti-popular and anti-state activities"  of the Former Tajik Premier Abdumalik Abdullajanov, who is now  Tajik ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to the  Russian Federation.    The article, which takes up two pages and a half, includes  accusations against Abdullajanov for breaking down the country's  economy, selling out national economy, scheming with hard  currency for the sake of personal wealth and other crimes  against Tajik people.    Moreover, the newspaper incriminates Abdullajanov - who was  Tajik premier in 1992-93 and who was dismissed at a session of  Tajik Parliament in December 1993, according to the official  statement, "because he was appointed ambassador to the Russian  Federation" -- political and economic support of the armed  opposition. [passage as received]    The daily clearly suggests that Abdullajanov was mixed up in  establishing economic blockade in the southern regions of the  Republic during the armed stand-off between the opposition and  those who supported restoration of the constitutional order.    The newspaper comes to a significant conclusion: The former  prime minister is to blame for the troubles of the Tajik people  and must be punished along with the former opposition leaders.    It is not known as yet, how the Dushanbe officialdom  responds  to the publication. According to a well-informed source inside  the Tajik leadership, the response is sure to come. One thing  is certain: competent bodies will check on the published facts  most carefully, he added.    According to independent sources in Dushanbe, the article  was  published under the pressure from certain Tajik political forces  (Abdullajanov has many foes in Tajikistan).    Despite his resignation, Abdullajanov is one of Tajikistan's  prominent politicians and influential reformers; he is regarded  in the Russian corridors of power and in Western business  circles.    Moreover, it is persistently rumoured here that he is likely  to run for president in accordance with a new Tajik draft  Constitution.    Though the presidential rule in the republic has to be  approved at the forthcoming referendum scheduled for the end of  this summer, unofficial campaign for the highest governmental  position has begun in point of fact.</p>

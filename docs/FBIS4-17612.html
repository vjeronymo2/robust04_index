			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Oleg Velichko] </F>   [Text] Damascus April 26 TASS -- The first round of the  Russian-Syrian talks was held between First Russian Vice-Prime  Minister Oleg Soskovets, who arrived in Syria on Monday on an  official visit, and Syrian Vice-Prime Minister of Economic  Affairs Salim Yasin.    The ministers had a closed door meeting. But sources in the  Russian delegation told ITAR-TASS that during the talks  attention was focussed on questions concerning political, trade  and economic cooperation between the two countries. According  to the Russian side, the questions do not conform to the  interests of the two states [as received]. Problems of military  and technical cooperation were also touched upon during the  negotiations.    Soskovets called on the Syrian side to "constructive  cooperation", and also expressed readiness to "adopt specific  decisions" during his three-day visit. In this context, he  offered to form three working groups. The first one to deal  with questions concerning mutual obligations, the second to  resolve econimic problems, and the third to deal with problems  of arms and special technologies. The first two groups from the  Russian side will be led by Minister for Foreign Economic  Relations Oleg Davydov, and the third by Chairman of the Russian  Committee for Defence Industry Viktor Glukhikh and the Russian  Defence Industry Committee Chairman Viktor Samoylov.    At the end of the talks Russian State Industry Committee  Chairman Igor Suchkov told ITAR-TASS that the delicate question  of Syria's debts was also touched upon during the talks. Till  date it amounts to about 10 billion U.S. dollars. In this  connection, he expressed assumption that if the Russian side  "returns at least 20 per cent of the debts in the form of goods  and simply in cash, then it will be equivalent to those expenses  which we have borne."    The second round of the Russian-Syrian talks will be held on  Tuesday.</p>

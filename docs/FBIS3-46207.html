The weather was chilly and the land was frozen during the  bitterly cold January, but the house of (Ma Qinglin), a worker  of the No. 5 cotton mill in Jinan city, was filled with the  atmosphere of spring. On the morning of 19 January, Jiang  Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party committee, and  leading comrades of the province and Jinan city sent the warmth  of the party and the government to his house. As soon as he  entered the house, Secretary Jiang held the hands of (Ma  Qinglin) and asked after his health with deep concern. He said  cordially: We came to visit you today in order to send regards  to all workers of your plant. On saying this, he placed a red  envelope containing 400 yuan of relief money in his hand. Not  having received wages for over two months, (Ma Qinglin) was so  excited that he could not say anything. His wife, with tears in  her eyes, said emotionally: I never dreamt that leaders would  come to our house. The party and the government have always  kept us in mind. I thank the party and the government for this  and thank them for sending us relief funds. She bowed as she  gave thanks.    On the afternoon of 19 January, accompanied by the party  committee of (Huaiyun) District in Jinan city, Jiang Chunyun  also held a forum of leaders and representatives of workers of  financially strapped enterprises and sent relief funds to them.  Jiang Chunyun said: Recently, in order to solve difficulties in  the lives of workers of enterprises in the red, the provincial  party committee and the provincial government have collected a  relief fund of 80 million yuan to help some workers of  financially strapped enterprises and retired personnel so that  they may have a happy Spring Festival. To realistically solve  difficulties in the lives of enterprise workers, the most  fundamental thing we should do is to enhance the vitality of  enterprises through deepening enterprise reform.    Jiang Chunyun called on party and government leaders at all  levels to always be concerned with the well-being of the masses,  care for their food and clothing, listen to their voices,  understand their difficulties, and adopt practical measures to  help them solve difficulties. Party and government organs at  all levels and all trades and professions should continue to  promote the spirit of conducting all tasks by means of thrift  and long years of hard work, resolutely check the unhealthy  trend of using public funds to invite guests, send gifts, and  arbitrarily issue bonuses and articles, share the happiness and  hardships of the masses of people, and realistically spend the  Spring Festival in an honest, clean, civilized, peaceful and  harmonious manner.</p>

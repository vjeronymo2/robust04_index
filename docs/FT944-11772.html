			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Tunnel grease stamps out fire The blame for tunnel fires often rests with the inflammable greases used to seal newly-cut tunnel edges, claim engineers at Oxford Brookes University. Greases are used to help seal the gap between the tunnel lining and the tunnel-boring machine. Problems arise when the seals are repaired or replaced because tunnel workers often pump compressed air into the workings to keep out water. The oxygen-rich atmosphere adds to the danger that the grease may ignite when the seals are burned away with oxyacetylene torches. The researchers have developed a non-flammable tunnel grease, consisting of water and minerals suspended in wax, which they claim is safer, easier to use and more economical than existing greases.

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Control Securities nearly ready with business plan CONTROL Securities, the property, hotels, pubs and brewing group in negotiations with its banks and creditors over refinancing, hopes to present a plan to shareholders within 'the next few weeks' the annual meeting was told yesterday. Mr Sydney Robin, chairman, said the timing of the meeting - held in respect of the year to March 31 - was not ideal but unavoidable. He said the group was in 'what I hope are the last stages of long and difficult negotiations' and he could not answer questions which might jeopardise the success of the talks. He said 'provided the final discussions go well, I will be calling another meeting in the near future'. He also told shareholders that borrowings had been reduced 'by quite a considerable amount' and the process was continuing. The meeting approved all the resolutions including one waiving the company's borrowing limits. Mr Robin said that if the resolution was defeated the group would have to cease trading. Its shares have been suspended since October 1991, and it is hoped trading will resume once a package has been put to shareholders. The business plan will include asset sales and Mr Robin said: 'I continue to believe that better values are available outside receivership'. One shareholder, who worked for a Swiss investment group, asked about the recent sale of the group's stake in Stylo at 90p a share. He said his firm would have been interested in buying the shares and could have paid a higher price. The company is instituting an investigation after another investor asked questions which revealed that he had ob-tained confidential information about management and staff salaries. See Observer</p>

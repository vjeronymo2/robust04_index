			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (3): A capital plan like Sheila's - The Plowshares / Alison's mother wants to move to a sheltered flat, but almost takes fright when Mr Ledger talks about annuities John and Alison Plowshare, a couple in their late forties, live in one of the smarter bits of North London. John is a partner in an architectural practice and earned Pounds 60,000 last year, although this year has not proved so profitable. Alison has a part-time job as a receptionist at the local GP's surgery. The Plowshares have two children: Lucy, who is 20 and at university in the Midlands; and Toby, 17, who is still at school. Through the death of John's parents and his subsequent inheritance, the Plowshares have a portfolio of Pounds 50,000 in unit trusts, Pounds 6,000 each in a personal equity plan, and just over Pounds 36,000 deposited in the building society as 'rainy day' money. IT IS a cold winter's evening, and Alison Plowshare and her mother are sitting doing the crossword together in front of the fire. However, Alison is well aware that her mother is not concentrating. Alison's mother, Mrs Geraldine Martin, is 72, still, thankfully, possessed of all her faculties and in robust good health. She has been staying with the Plowshares for a week and has clearly had something on her mind, though until now no amount of gentle coaxing from Alison could get her to share it. Fortunately the rigours of a particularly difficult clue finally inspire Alison's mother to spill the beans. Abruptly, she leans forward and announces: 'I think that I should move house.' Alison is dumbfounded. Her mother has lived alone in their family home, a large Victorian house in the suburbs, since her husband's death. She has been in that classic position of owning a large house, which has gradually been deteriorating, and becoming very uncomfortable, while living on very little income, which is also quite uncomfortable. Until now, no amount of cajoling or pleading could succeed in persuading her to sell the house, move into something more suitable and use some of her tied-up capital to give herself a better income. Once the shock has passed, Alison is enormously relieved that her mother has arrived at a decision. 'I think that I would like to sell the house and buy a sheltered flat,' says Mrs Martin with a defiant air. 'I need something smaller and easier to maintain and, now that I am a little older, I would like to be nearer other people.' Alison suddenly realises the reason behind this change of heart. Mrs Martin's great friend Sheila has recently moved into a sheltered flat, and the move has proved to be a great success. The next day, eager to strike while the iron is hot, Alison takes her mother back to her house and helps her to start the lengthy process of re-organising her affairs. Her mother's house is duly valued at Pounds 150,000 and put on the market. The sheltered flat, in the same estate as Sheila's, is visited, approved of and signed up for at a cost of Pounds 80,000. It's at the accountants that the problems start. 'Mrs Martin, in your circumstances I would recommend that you consider taking out an annuity,' says Mr Ledger - the Plowshares' own accountant, to whom Alison has introduced her mother. 'You have very little income beyond your state pension at the moment, but when your house is sold, you will have a nice lump sum of capital left over from the purchase of your new flat. The most sensible thing would be to buy an annuity with some of that capital.' Neither Alison nor her mother is quite clear what an annuity is. 'One buys an annuity and it gives you a guaranteed income for the rest of your life,' says Mr Ledger. 'In your case, Mrs Martin, if you put Pounds 50,000 into an annuity, you would receive a gross income of roughly Pounds 7,000 a year until you die, a net income of Pounds 6,300 a year.' Just as Alison is thinking that this is the best solution to her mother's problems, her mother asks astutely: 'Would I still have the Pounds 50,000 in my estate?' Mr Ledger has to admit that this is not the case. 'I'm afraid that with a straightforward annuity, such as the one I am proposing here, the income and the capital die with you.' 'That Pounds 50,000 is for my grandchildren,' says Mrs Martin firmly. 'I'm not spending it on an annuity. I have left it to dear Lucy and Toby in my will.' However much Mr Ledger explains the tax advantages - the Inland Revenue recognises that part of the income from an annuity is drawn from capital, and so it doesn't tax that part - and however much he explains that Mrs Martin's robust good health probably means that she will live for many years to come, secure in the knowledge that her income will continue to arrive, Mrs Martin is determined not to consider it. However, the alternative is to put the money into a building society account and live on the interest. 'This will give you an average gross income of around Pounds 5,000 a year,' explains Mr Ledger. 'It will put you into the 25 per cent tax band - you will have to pay some income tax - and you will be vulnerable to changes in the interest rate: your income will fluctuate, Mrs Martin.' Alison's mother is still not convinced. Later that night Alison talks the problem over with her husband John. 'I only want what's best for her,' says Alison. 'Lucy and Toby will only want what's best for her. I just wish that she wanted what's best for her. With the service charges and bills on her new flat, she will need a regular, guaranteed income and the higher the better.' The impasse continues for several weeks as the Plowshares and Mrs Martin wait for a buyer. One evening, when Alison and John are watching the news on television, Alison's mother rings: 'I've sold the house and I'm off,' she says. 'And I'm going to buy one of those annuity things. I need a nice steady income for the rest of my life. My family are very long-lived, unlike your father's. I have every intention of getting good value out of my annuity by living until I get a telegram from the Queen. Toby and Lucy can have the value of my flat in my will, and they will just have to be happy with that.' Alison heaves a sigh of relief: 'I do think that you are right,' she says. 'How clever of you to work it all out.' 'Well, I didn't really,' says her mother. 'My dear friend Sheila has an annuity, and she explained it all to me.'

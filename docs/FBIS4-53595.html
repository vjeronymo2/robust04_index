			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Full Text" of interview with Kim Il-song by the president </F> of Cuba's PRENSA LATINA on 13 April -- read by announcer]    [Text] The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has answered  questions raised by the president of Cuba's PRENSA LATINA on 13  April 1994. The full text of the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song's answers were carried by the Cuban publication. The  full text of his answers reads as follows:    [Kim Il-song] I appreciate your congratulations on my  birthday and welcome your visit to our country. Hoping you will  achieve a new success in your just communication and information  business, I will answer your questions.    [PRENSA LATINA] The United States and the South Korean  authorities are straining the situation by insisting that the  DPRK has nuclear facilities to produce nuclear weapons. What is  your country's position regarding this?    [Kim] We built nuclear facilities with our own strength and  technology to further strengthen the country's energy base. Our  nuclear activities are every inch peaceful. We have reiterated  on many occasions that we have neither the will nor the ability  to develop nuclear weapons. We do not need to develop nuclear  weapons and, even if we make one or two nuclear weapons, they  are of no use [solsa handugaeui haengmugirul mandundaeya kugosun  amu soyongdo opsumnida]. The Government of our Republic has  invariably made efforts to realize the denuclearization of the  Korean peninsula.    The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula originated from  the  United States' bringing of nuclear weapons into South Korea.  The United States occupied South Korea, a strategic point, and  brought large-scale nuclear weapons into South Korea to realize  its aggressive Asia-Pacific strategy opposing our Republic.    Under the condition created in recent years, in which the  Cold War ended internationally and North and South Korea adopted  an agreement on nonaggression and the Joint Declaration on the  Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, the United States has  lost the justification for retaining nuclear weapons and its  aggression army in South Korea. Since then, the United States  has tried to find a ruse to keep occupying South Korea and has  deliberately strained the situation on the Korean peninsula by  crying over the fictitious nuclear suspicion on us aimed at  crushing [apsal] our Republic.    The South Korean authorities are also frenzied in the new  war  provocation maneuver, following the U.S. nuclear commotion.    The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula must be resolved  through dialogue between us and the United States since it  originated in the hostile U.S. policy against Korea. The United  States also recognized [injong] that the nuclear problem on the  Korean peninsula should be settled by the DPRK and the United  States, and acceded to DPRK-U.S. talks last year.    The joint statement that the DPRK and the United States  announced at the talks after reaching an agreement clearly  stipulates that the United States should not pose nuclear  threats against us, that both countries should respect each  other's sovereignty and should not interfere in domestic  affairs, and that they support the peaceful reunification of  Korea. The United States, however, is persistently adhering to  the anti-Republic maneuver even after the announcement of the  DPRK-U.S. joint statement.    The United States has driven the situation of our country to  an extreme one [kuktanuro moragago issumyo] by overturning the  agreement with us and rupturing DPRK-U.S. talks, and is  maneuvering to pressure us by even mobilizing international  organizations. Pressure cannot be a method to resolve the issue.    If one thinks that one can bring our people, who regard  sovereignty as their life, to one's knee with pressure and  strong-arm tactics, it is a miscalculation.    If the United States continues adhering to commotions of  pressure against our Republic, we cannot but take due defensive  steps in order to defend the nation's dignity and sovereignty.    It is our consistent position to resolve the nuclear problem  on the Korean peninsula through dialogue. If the United States  sincerely wants to resolve the nuclear problem on the Korean  peninsula, it should discard the international anti-Republic  pressure commotions and come to DPRK-U.S. talks with a sincere  attitude.    Whether the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula can be  resolved peacefully or not totally depends on the U.S. attitude.  Besides, international organizations should not follow the  unjust demands of big nations but should do what is helpful to a  solution of the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula by  keeping the principle of justice and fairness.    [PRENSA LATINA] What are the bases of the foreign policies  of  the DPRK and how are its relations with neighboring countries,  including China, developing?    [Kim] The foreign policy of our Republic is based on the  ideal of independence, peace, and friendship. The ideal of  independence, peace, and friendship is a just ideal reflecting  the common aspirations and desire of our people and the  progressive people of the world to build a new, independent,  peaceful, and friendly world against various dominations and  subjugations.    Based on this ideal, the government of our Republic is  actively making efforts to develop friendship and cooperative  relations with socialist countries and nonaligned countries. It  concluded good neighbor relations with capitalist countries that  respect our nation's sovereignty, and is developing economic and  cultural exchanges with these countries.    In particular, the government of our Republic pays deep  attention to developing relations with our neighboring countries  in a good manner.    The relations between nations cannot develop in a good  manner  with the effort of only one side. Among our neighboring  countries, there are nations that have good relations with our  country while others do not.    The relations between our country and China are good. The  two countries of DPRK and China are neighbors with a river in  between, and the Korean and Chinese people are close and  friendly [chingunhan] comrades-in-arms and brothers who are  struggling for a common cause.    The people of the DPRK and China have fought firmly  hand-in-hand and by shedding blood against the imperialists.  They supported and closely cooperated with each other in the  struggle for socialism.    The traditional DPRK-PRC friendship is continually  developing  in all domains -- political, economic and cultural -- thanks to  joint efforts of the parties, governments and peoples of the two  countries.    Japan is also our neighboring country. However, normal  relations have not been achieved between the DPRK and Japan.  The Japanese Government implemented hostile policies against  our country in the past. Recently it is disturbing a solution  to the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula by taking part in  the United States' anti- Republic maneuvers, and is attempting  to pursue its insidious political and military purposes.    If the situation on the Korean peninsula is aggravated and  an unexpected state [puluiui satae] is formed, it will not be  good for Japan, either.    The Japanese Government should look at the reality and act  with discretion.    [PRENSA LATINA] As a socialist country, what policy is the  DPRK adopting concerning foreign countries' investment in its  territory?    [Kim] It is the consistent policy of our Republic's  government to expand and develop economic and technological  exchanges with various world countries on the basis of building  a self-reliant national economy. In accordance with the further  development of our self- reliant socialist economy on the basis  of modern technology, our foreign economic relations, too, will  expand and develop in various forms such as joint ventures and  collaboration as well as trade. This is of help to our economic  building, and is also compatible with the progressing tendency  of international economic cooperation.    We have enacted and promulgated relevant laws, including the  Foreigners Investment Law, with a view to encouraging foreign  investors to make investments within the boundary [yongyok] of  the Republic, protecting their investments, and to guaranteeing  their legitimate rights and interests on the basis of complete  equality and reciprocity.    As is already widely known, we have proclaimed the  Najin-Sonbong District a free economic trade zone, and have been  providing a more favorable environment and conditions for  foreign investments in this zone. Because of its vast economic  potential and favorable natural, geographical conditions, the  Najin-Sonbong free economic trade zone, which is located on the  border area of Korea, China, and Russia, is attracting great  interest from foreign investors, and there are many countries  hoping to invest in this zone.    If foreign investors make investments in the Najin-Sonbong  Free Economic Trade Zone, this will greatly contribute to  expanding and developing the regional economic cooperation and  the economic and technological exchanges among various world  countries.    The government of our Republic is always opening doors of  investment to foreign investors.    [PRENSA LATINA] What do you think of the prospect for  Korea's  reunification?    [Kim] The division of our nation imposed by outside forces  has been continuing for nearly half a century. It is the  supreme task of the nation--which cannot be put off even for a  moment--to end the tragedy of the national division and realize  the reunification of the fatherland.    Our party and the government of the Republic are making all  efforts to realize by all means [ottokehana] the historic cause  of the reunification of the fatherland in the nineties. We put  forth the 10-point program for the grand unity of the whole  nation for the fatherland's reunification last year. The  10-point program for the grand unity of the whole nation  reflects the unanimous desire of all Korean compatriots in the  North, the South, and abroad who wish to realize the nation's  reunification and prosperity by firmly uniting as one while  transcending the differences in ideologies, ideas, and systems.    We have hoped that the people in the South Korean authority  come out on the path to reconciliation and cooperation by  responding to our 10-point program for the grand unity of the  whole nation. This notwithstanding, turning their face away  from the whole nation's desire for reunification, they have been  traversing the road to dependence on outside forces and to  confrontation between the North and South.    The present regime in South Korea is a flunkeyist,  nation-selling one which is following the outside forces in a  thorough way. Due to the maneuvers of opposing reunification  and provoking a new war by the people in authority in South  Korea, there lay a grave obstacle and difficulties on the road  before our people aspiring to the fatherland's reunification.  But, we are optimistic about the prospect of the fatherland's  reunification.    Our nation is a homogeneous one with a long history of 5,000  years. No force can divide our nation into two forever. The  fatherland's reunification is a unanimous wish and a vital  demand of the whole nation. Those running counter to this are  only a tiny fraction of the flunkyist, nation-selling force.    It is inevitable for a nation, which has artificially been  divided by outside forces, to be reunified into one. The forces  aspiring for reunification will surely overwhelm and be  victorious over the splittist forces.    We have already put forth the most reasonable method for the  fatherland's reunification, too. The method for the  fatherland's reunification in the form of a confederal system  based on one nation, one state, two systems, and two  governments--we have put forth--is a just and realistic way for  reunification which can help realize the country's reunification  in an above-board manner, in an independent and peaceful way,  and in the quickest fashion,--while one neither swallows up, nor  is swallowed up [mokgona mokiujianko] by another--under the  circumstances in which different ideologies and systems exist in  the North and South of Korea.    The formula for fatherland reunification based on a  confederal system foresees our country developing into a neutral  state without becoming a satellite state of another country or  joining in any political and military alliance or bloc after our  fatherland is reunified. For this reason, this complies with  the earnest desire of our neighboring countries and the  peace-loving countries of the world.    As long as all fellow countrymen unanimously yearn for the  reunification of the fatherland and as long as we have the most  fair and aboveboard and realistic proposal for fatherland  reunification, the historic cause of the fatherland's  reunification will be achieved without fail.    At this opportunity, I express my deep appreciation to the  Cuban party, government, and people for always positively  supporting our people's cause of the fatherland's reunification.    [PRENSA LATINA] How do you assess the relations between your  country and Cuba, and how do you recall your meeting with  Comrade Fidel Castro Ruz.    [Kim] Though Korea and Cuba are far apart with an ocean and  a  continent in between, the friendly ties between the people of  the two countries are close like neighbors.    The friendship between the people of our two countries is  militant friendship between class brothers who oppose  imperialism and struggle for victory in the socialist cause and  a genuine and solid friendship based on revolutionary principle  and comradely loyalty.    The friendly and cooperative relations between our two  countries have been developing on a new high stage since we and  Comrade Fidel Castro met. I still emotionally recall our  meeting with Comrade Fidel Castro in 1986 in Pyongyang. At that  time, we had our historic first meeting that we had looked  forward to for a long time and talked and conversed in a  comradely atmosphere.    The leaders of our two countries discussed the issue of  further expanding and developing friendly and cooperative  relations between Korea and Cuba and various other matters of  mutual concern, reached a consensus of views on all issues under  discussion, and further consolidated our intimate relations.    Comrade Fidel Castro's visit to our country left an  unforgettable impression on our people. Comrade Fidel Castro's  visit to our country was followed by unanticipated complicated  events in the international arena. However, the friendly and  cooperative relations between our two countries are continuously  developing according to the spirit, which was agreed on during  the meeting between the leaders of the two countries, without  shaking even in the vortex of history which determines the  destiny of socialism.    The Cuban people are heroic people who are solidly defending  the socialist post in the Western Hemisphere under difficult  circumstances in which the imperialists are continuously  maneuvering to isolate and crush [korip apsal] them.    Our people highly assess the fraternal Cuban people for the  fact that they are excellently carrying out strategic tasks in a  special time in a peaceful period [pyonghwa sigiui tukpyol sigi]  after strongly uniting around the Communist Party of Cuba led by  Comrade Fidel Castro, the outstanding leader of the Cuban  revolution, and extend full support for and firm solidarity with  them.    Further expanding and developing friendly and cooperative  relations between Korea and Cuba is the common desire of the  people of the two countries, and marching under the uplifted  banner of socialism in our two countries would greatly  contribute to defending and maintaining the socialist cause and  carrying out the cause of independence for mankind.    The Korean people will also in the future make every effort  to develop the friendly and cooperative relations with the  fraternal Cuban people.    I convey my friendly greetings to the fraternal Cuban people  and sincerely wish that the Cuban people will bring about  greater achievements in their struggle to defend the  independence and sovereignty of the country and build socialism.</p>

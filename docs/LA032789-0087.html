			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFS: OFFICER IN ARREST STING TAKES A PAID LEAVE  </P> <P> Long Beach Police Officer Mark Dickey was so distressed to hear that the city  had dropped the resisting-arrest case against anti-brutality crusader Don  Jackson that he coughed up blood and has taken a paid leave, officials said  Thursday. "He's been under quite a bit of stress," said Long Beach Police Sgt.  Gary Halliday, who said Dickey was placed on paid "injured-on-duty" status  Wednesday after the coughing episode and was taken to a doctor. Dickey stopped  Jackson for an alleged traffic violation, then apparently pushed him into a  plate-glass window Jan. 14 while a TV crew secretly filmed the incident. Dickey  arrested Jackson for allegedly interfering with a police officer, but the Long  Beach prosecutor Wednesday dropped the charge, saying the case was too weak to  prove. The Long Beach Police Department, the FBI and the Los Angeles County  district attorney's office are all investigating the arrest to determine  whether disciplinary action or criminal charges should be filed against Dickey.  </P></p>

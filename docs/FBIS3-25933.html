According to local officials, there are now more than 4,200  farmers' markets in rural Hubei. It is estimated that about 10  billion yuan of commodities are traded there in a year.    The market network in rural areas of the province is formed  with farmers' markets as the basis, and with specialized and  wholesale markets of various kinds as the backbone. Markets of  essential production factors have also begun to emerge.    In Jingzhou Prefecture, dubbed a "grain and cotton  storehouse," farmers used to have great difficulty in selling  their farm products.    But now, to the relief of local farmers, various kinds of  grain wholesale markets, involving 20,000 individual traders,  are doing brisk businesses of farm products through major grain  and edible oil wholesale markets in the seats of 11 counties and  cities, and 41 wholesale offices across 28 provinces, with one  billion kg of grain, edible oil and related products being  marketed a year.    Many farmers have become prosperous through farmers'  markets.  For instance, the beancurd market at Shipai township, Zhongxiang  city has got famous. The existence of the market not only  enriches the vegetable baskets of local residents, but also  helps to increase the income of nearby farmers.    Now 50 percent of farmers from rural areas not far from the  beancurd market are engaged in production and marketing of bean  products. Their annual per capita income has reached 1,000 yuan.    The quick development of various specialized markets and  wholesale markets has played a positive role in the overall  economic development of different localities, said the officials.    The provincial government has been working out more rules  and  regulations to guide markets of various kinds in the province to  develop healthily.</p>

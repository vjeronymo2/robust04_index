			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MOST OF THEM ARE UNWANTED, JOBLESS AND HOMELESS, BUT CHILDREN OF U.S.  SERVICEMEN STILL HOPE FOR A BETTER LIFE IN THE LAND OF THEIR FATHERS;  </P> <P> AMERASIANS: VIETNAM'S MISBEGOTTEN LEGACY  </P> <P> The war was still raging that day 15 years ago when Vietnamese nuns heard the  cries of a baby boy stuffed in a garbage can and took him inside their  orphanage to raise.  </P> <P> Today, Nguyen Thanh Binh, the son of a black American who went home and a  Vietnamese mother who abandoned him, shares the plight of thousands of  Amerasian youths languishing in the decay of Vietnam, desperately trying to get  out and find their fathers.  </P> <P> "My circumstances are miserable," says Lam Anh Hong, 18, whose mother gave her  away to a relative. "I always live with hope. I don't give up hope."  </P> <P> Like Binh and Hong, many of the Amerasians born of American fathers and  Vietnamese mothers were abandoned by both parents, left in orphanages or with  relatives or friends, often to fend for themselves.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Jobless, Unwanted  </P> <P> Many of the Amerasians are jobless, homeless, uneducated, unwanted, barely able  to speak English. They sleep at night on the sidewalks and in the parks. Some  turn to prostitution to stay alive.  </P> <P> Blacks like Binh also are victims of a Vietnamese caste system. White  Amerasians may be at the bottom in the clannish Vietnamese society, but they  are at the top within the Amerasian society. The black Amerasians are at the  bottom.  </P> <P> All suffer the taunts of their Vietnamese peers, "Amerasians no good. Go to  America."  </P> <P> Charlie Brown Phuong, at 25 one of the older Amerasians, was one of those  abandoned by their mothers. "She don't want I be her son," he says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Nobody Helps Us'  </P> <P> Phuong was raised in a Roman Catholic orphanage in Da Nang but ran away when he  was 11 and boarded an evacuation ship to Ho Chi Minh City as North Vietnamese  forces swept southward to conquer South Vietnam in 1975.  </P> <P> Now he sells newspapers, cigarettes and bread and sleeps in a park. "Nobody  helps us," he says. "Look at my eyes. They are very old because I work very  hard."  </P> <P> But some get lucky. Nguyen Thi Thu Huong, an 18-year-old wearing a blue ribbon  in her brown hair and pink slippers on her mud-caked feet, was found one day  selling postcards for nickels and dimes, washing herself in a fountain in the  center of the city. Her father left Vietnam when she was 2.  </P> <P> "Only foreigners help," she says. "I feel lonely. I feel sad. I want to be in  the U.S. to study, work and have friends. I go, I have a job and a good house."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dream Came True  </P> <P> Then, a short time later, she is a Cinderella, on her way to America with her  mother, one hand carrying a suitcase, the other affectionately wrapped around  her 8-year-old Vietnamese half-brother. A small group of Amerasian street kids  went to Tan Son Nhut Airport to see them off.  </P> <P> U.S. officials say help is also on the way for the 10,000 Amerasians that they  estimate still remain. Vietnamese authorities put the estimate at 16,000 but  that is hard to pin down because no official census has been taken. More than  6,000 Amerasians and 11,000 of their relatives have left Vietnam legally since  the start of the U.S. Orderly Departures Program in 1980.  </P> <P> Bruce A. Beardsley, director of the Orderly Departures Program in Bangkok,  Thailand, has cut much of the bureaucratic paper work and persuaded the  Vietnamese to do the same.  </P> <P> "I have been pushing the best I can to get departures to go at a much more  rapid rate," he says. "We're trying to expand the transportation net."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 5,500 Were Waiting  </P> <P> At one point early this year, 5,500 Amerasians and their family members already  approved for resettlement in the United States were awaiting transportation.  </P> <P> Some of the Amerasians camp out in a park next to the Foreign Ministry,  awaiting the roll of the dice, the anticipated approval that will be their  ticket to America. In the interim, they hang out in front of the hotels,  clinging to American tourists, begging not only for money but for affection.  </P> <P> Some Amerasians carry the physical scars of war as well as the mental pain of  rejection.  </P> <P> Pham Thi Lan, 22, never knew her father. Her mother died of heart disease when  she was 8. When her stepfather remarried, he threw her out of the house and she  went to live with her grandmother. Her neck and chest are scarred by napalm.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Los Arm in War  </P> <P> Vuong Thanh Hai, 20, has a hole in his head and only one arm. His father left  when he was born, his mother died when he was 6. Shrapnel from a 155-millimeter  artillery shell cut away his right arm.  </P> <P> The Amerasians are the legacy of some 2.7 million Americans who served in  Vietnam until the last were withdrawn in 1973. Other Americans, including  military and civilian employees of the U.S. Embassy, remained until the  U.S.-supported Saigon government of South Vietnam fell to Communist North  Vietnam in 1975.  </P> <P> Many Amerasians and their fathers have been trying for years to find each  other. But some Amerasians were rejected by fathers who want nothing to do with  them. Some of the fathers, already married, went back to their American  families. Others returned and married American women after the war and started  new families. Some may be unaware that they left offspring behind.  </P> <P> But for some who do know, the wrenching memories have driven them into  post-traumatic stress disorder and counseling, unable to resolve the guilt of  leaving their child in the streets.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Government Cooperation  </P> <P> The Vietnamese government lately has been cooperating more in efforts to send  the remaining Amerasians to America, promoting it as a humanitarian gesture.  But U.S. officials say the real motive is to establish better relations with  the United States in hope that it will lead to diplomatic recognition and badly  needed American aid.  </P> <P> "I'm sure it's not just humanitarian instincts which are pushing things in the  direction they're going," Beardsley says. "They've got an economy that's in a  hell of a mess."  </P> <P> So bankrupt is Vietnam's economy that the government until recently insisted on  booking all refugees including Amerasians and their families on Air Vietnam,  the official government airline, because it so desperately needs the U.S.  dollars. But often the Air Vietnam flights are unreliable because of mechanical  problems or the bumping of refugees, whose fares are discounted, for  higher-paying passengers, U.S. officials say.  </P> <P> Now refugees are permitted to travel on other airlines, and U.S. officials have  been working to add charters. The other carriers that service Ho Chi Minh City  -- Air France and Thai Airways -- are booked with so many regular passengers at  full fare that it is difficult to get seats for refugees at reduced fare.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cultural Orientation  </P> <P> Last December, some flights were begun directly to the Philippines, where  Amerasians and relatives spend six months for language training and cultural  orientation that will help them adjust quicker in the United States. The usual  routing is through Bangkok.  </P> <P> The International Committee for Migration based in Geneva, an organization that  assists refugees, is now coordinating all transportation out of Ho Chi Minh  City for them.  </P> <P> In efforts to help the dirt-poor Amerasians in the countryside who could not  otherwise afford the travel and lodging for their interviews in Ho Chi Minh  City, the United States has approved in principle a Vietnamese proposal to  establish an Amerasian transit center to be financed by the United States. The  center would provide transportation and a place to stay for the Amerasians and  their families while they are being processed.  </P> <P> Despite all the promises, for some it is too late. They are no longer the cute,  cuddly children of the war years of the '60s and '70s. They have grown into  teen-agers and young adults, as old now as their fathers were then. Some gave  up hope, took jobs, married, had children of their own and changed their minds  about leaving.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Search Is Futile  </P> <P> For many Amerasians, the desperate search for their fathers is futile.  </P> <P> "We have been contacted by probably just over 200 men who are looking for kids  or know where their kids are at," says Bruce Burns, a San Jose, Calif.,  attorney and tracer of Amerasians and their fathers. "If you compare that to  how many Amerasians there are, it's a very small number."  </P> <P> Burns has been successful in locating some fathers. But many of them have  settled into the "real world," as opposed to what they saw as the unreality of  Vietnam.  </P> <P> "In most cases," Burns says, "the father said, 'I don't want anything to do  with the child. Don't bother me. I don't want to disrupt my family or my life.  That was a long time ago when I was young and I want to forget about it.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rejected by Father  </P> <P> Burns recalls helping one girl find her father, an Army chaplain during the  war. She was attractive, bright, fluent in English and a medical school  student.  </P> <P> "He's still a minister in the United States," Burns says. "He just told her to  get lost. He didn't want anything to do with her. He didn't want her to  infringe on his life. He acknowledged that this is his child but he didn't care  about her."  </P> <P> Burns says the Vietnamese government is concerned that some Amerasian women are  selling sex, attracting mostly Soviet and other Eastern European soldiers and  civilians.  </P> <P> "When you're living on the streets and you don't know who your family is and  you have the opportunity to make money through prostitution, it's very  attractive to them," he says. "The alternative is to continue to not have  enough to eat and to barely survive."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Minimum Requirements  </P> <P> Beardsley says the United States has cut the documentary requirements for an  Amerasian to leave Vietnam to a minimum.  </P> <P> "Essentially an Amerasian's face is his passport," he says. "If you look like  an Amerasian, we don't care if you have any documents at all. You don't have to  have an identified father to move somebody out."  </P> <P> Beardsley says no one has been denied resettlement because they are suspected  of prostitution, but he says he has seen reports that "some of them have been  continuing in this profession on resettlement in the U.S."  </P> <P> Luu Van Tanh, vice chief of the Consular Section, denies his government  discriminates against the Amerasians, but concedes that other Vietnamese  children mock them and other Vietnamese discriminate against them.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mothers Forced to Choose  </P> <P> Some of the mothers later married Vietnamese men who forced them to choose  between them and their Amerasian children. Others had difficulty finding a job  because they had Amerasian children.  </P> <P> Other women tried to protect their children by hiding them in the home or  moving them from the cities to the country, by putting charcoal on their face  or dying their light hair black to disguise them, and by destroying all of the  documents and photographs showing that they had an American father.  </P> <P> One child was virtually a prisoner in her apartment until she went to the  United States because her mother did not want her subjected to the taunts of  the other kids.  </P> <P> "Those children are the victims of the war and we . . . must help them," Tanh  says.  </P></p>

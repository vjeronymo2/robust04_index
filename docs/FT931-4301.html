			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market report London COCOA prices closed up to Pounds 22 a tonne weaker after the nearby May broke through what had proved to be fairly solid support around Pounds 695 a tonne in early trading. 'I think the chartists will be very excited but there's no fundamental reason behind today's fall,' one trader said. 'It's just that in the light of last week's downward action and this week's continuation, no one wants to jump in front of the train.' But until either there is fresh fundamental news or active industry buying, prices look set to slide further. ALUMINIUM dropped to the lowest levels for around four months on the London Metal Exchange, reacting to news that January IPAI producer stocks had risen by 89,000 tonnes, against some expectations of a decline. Three-month metal failed to hold Dollars 1,170 a tonne, and ended at Dollars 1,169.50, down Dollars 12. COPPER held in a narrow range, trading below overnight levels throughout, with resistance building above Dollars 2,160 a tonne for three-month metal. Compiled from Reuters</p>

At the Chamber of  Commerce and Industry's New Year Reception in Duesseldorf on  Tuesday [18 January], Kohl pointed out that top achievements in  research and technology are important preconditions for  future-oriented jobs in Germany.    "I am, therefore, very concerned about our falling behind  important competitors in the fields of research and technology,  for instance regarding the number of patent applications," Kohl  said. Research and innovation are not only a matter of funds.  They also require a social climate that is open to new ideas.    On the labor market situation, Kohl said the problems  "cannot  be solved in the short term," even with the expected upswing of  the economy. For this reason, everybody who is involved in the  economic process is called on to help secure jobs. The Federal  Government has taken action. The new law on working time, which  enables more flexible working hours and longer machinery  operating hours, has been presented to the Bundestag. The 1992  pension reform provides the opportunity to combine part-time  work with drawing partial pensions. So far, this instrument has  been made far too little use of. Almost 2.5 million full-time  employees would rather work part-time. This means there is an  enormous job potential there, said Kohl.    Kohl welcomed the wage agreement in the chemical industry as  "an important signal." The wage round parties put employment at  the center of their talks. This is a good contribution to  securing jobs. Other important factors are the agreed starting  wages for young people starting work and for the long-term  unemployed. This is the first time that wage round parties made  agreements that take account of the different capacities of  different companies.    Kohl said the government's job is to improve the basic  structures for stimulating growth and employment in Germany. In  this connection, the chancellor emphasized the government's  decision to cut the budget by another 5 billion German marks  [DM]. This was "not simple," because a total of DM21 billion  had already been saved in the 1994 budget. Financial planning  has a "solid base," which can also be seen from the preliminary  1993 budget balance. In 1993, the government's new indebtedness  was some DM500 million below estimate. Economizing also means  fighting the misuse of social benefits, which has led to DM1.2  billion being saved by the end of November 1993.    Kohl stressed that in the next legislative term the tax law  should be simplified and the company tax reform continued.  Another important issue on the government's agenda is  simplifying the planning and licensing procedures in Germany.  These -- with the "program to increase growth and employment"  -- are important steps taken by the coalition toward enforcing  the measures laid down in the report on "Securing Germany's  Future as a Business Location," as was announced last September.</p>

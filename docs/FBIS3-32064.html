			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Managua, 31 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- Nicaraguan President  Violeta Chamorro said today that the National Transportation  Commission's (CNT) attitude was "inhumane." The CNT has upheld  a strike for the past eight days to demand that fuel prices be  reduced.    A climate of tension prevails in the city, where the main  avenues continue to be blocked by hundreds of buses and taxis.  Police surveillance was reinforced in several conflict areas in  Managua although no major incidents have taken place.    According to police reports, the striking transportation  workers and those who do not support the measure clashed in a  sector of the northern highway, which leads to the Managua  international airport, and the windshield glass of three  vehicles were destroyed.    Chamorro said today that the strike could have political  undertones. She said the CNT continues the protest because its  affiliates "are tough and who knows who is inciting them."  "What they have to do is work," the president said, after she  accused them of pressuring and threatening those who do want to  work and of carrying out an "inhumane" task that leaves people  without a vital service. The economic losses caused by the  eight days of transportation strike amounts to many millions but  has not been added up yet.    The four [number as received] other cargo and transportation  organizations that signed agreements with the government last  Friday, have renewed their work. However, the service has not  been totally reestablished. According to the agreement between  government authorities and the Nicaraguan Federation of Cargo  Transportation (Fetracanic), the National Chamber of  Transportation (Canat), and the National Association of  Transportation (Anatra) the fuel prices will be frozen until  next May. Additionally, the agreement gives taxi and  commercial cargo cooperatives a subsidy for the next four months  and other concessions and tax exonerations.</p>

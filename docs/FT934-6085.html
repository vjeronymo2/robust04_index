			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Arts: Drawn to the Old Masters / Review of the Chatsworth and Getty collections If the Duke of Devonshire were to offer me one wish, the response would be unhesitating. 'Give me Annibale Carracci's drawing of 'The Hunchback Boy'. Out of so many lovely things in the exhibition Old Master Drawings From Chatsworth at the British Museum, the poignancy of that drawing tugs at the heart. Made in Bologna circa 1610, the younger Carracci's study is an example of the power drawings which witness particular moments in an artist's studio. The lad sat without his shirt. With short, sparing strokes of red chalk Annibale drew the deformed torso, the scrofulous skull showing through the thin hair. Yet it is the combination of the draughtsman's scientific detachment with humanity which is so wonderful. The boy turns towards us shadowed eyes which are eloquent of misery. The enigmatic words added by Annibale, 'I do not know if God helps me', are surely his response to suffering. One visit to the Print Gallery may well seem inadequate for an exhibition of this size and quality, with 220 drawings by artists such as Ghirlandaio, Leonardo, Raphael, Rosso Fiorentino, Pontormo, Durer, Van Dyck, Rembrandt and Corot. So make several. This collection is the finest of its kind in private hands, apart from the royal collection at Windsor. Kept at Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, most of it was bought between 1690 and 1729 by the 2nd Duke. Its notoriety has come from sales in recent years, although the collection still has some 2,000 works. The BM selection is the largest showing of Chatsworth drawings. There is a fully illustrated catalogue, based on the complete catalogue by Michael Jaffe now under way; volume one should be out next spring from Phaidon Press. Leonardo's 'Leda and the Swan' shows not the mating but the morning after. The swan peacably nibbles his lady's ear. Squirming unpleasantly on the ground, Leda's children hatch out of eggs: Castor, Pollux, Helen and Clytemnestra. A sheet of small grotesque heads by Leonardo makes a happy pair with Durer's caricature of a rubber-faced old man. The Raphael drawings are marvellous: three studies for the 'The Transfiguration' and a ravishing sketch of a mother reading to a child. A sheet of chilling studies in red chalk by Andrea del Sarto reminds us that in Renaissance Italy, artists were enlisted to make the link between crime and punishment. After the siege of Florence in 1530, he was commissioned to paint six executed traitors on a wall in the marketplace. These sketches shows the contorted body of a villain suspended by his foot. A gem of a sketch is Rembrandt's 'Actor in his Dressing-Room'. It passes understanding that 30 years ago this could have been exhibited as St Augustine in his study. Here to the life is a flabby old actor, his jug-shaped body wrapped in a fur mantel, scanning his lines before he goes on stage. Rarities are the only drawing which survives from Bruegel's stay in Rome and Altdorfer's only design for a stained glass window: a magnificent drawing by Veronese commemorates the forging in 1571 of the Holy League against Suleiman the Magnificent. For sheer inventive brilliance, nothing in the show surpasses Guercino's 'Rest on the Flight', exhibited for the first time. Guercino has used ink wash so cleverly that the areas of white paper give the impression of blinding sunshine. A crenellated wall runs slap across the picture. Joseph leans on it, facing us, gazing pensively at a view we cannot see. Mary, a vigorous young woman, distracts the attention of her baby who is perched, rather carelessly, on the wall. Anyone with an weakness for horses will appreciate a fine, quizzical beast by the young Van Dyck, a study for his 'St Martin Dividing His Cloak'. Rather harder to explain at first is the horse in Petro da Cortona's grandiose 'Pope Urban VIII Being Carried Down the Nave of St Peter's'. Surely they did not allow horses into St Peter's? In fact, it seems they did, once a year when the king of Naples presented the pope with a chinea, hacanea in Spanish, from where we derive 'hackney'. The Royal Academy's Drawings from the J. Paul Getty Museum is the junior exhibition but is still well worth seeing, put together in the last 10 years and including 14 ex-Chatsworth works. With 100 drawings from the 15th to 20th centuries, it is a question of breadth rather than depth. Cuyp's smooth drawing of a milkmaid, framed by the cow's belly, is a particular delight. So is an unforgettable portrait by Rubens of a Korean gentleman swathed in silk as light as air. Spare a moment, too, for a puzzle picture, 'Two Male Nudes' by the late-16th century Haarlem Mannerist, Cornelis van Cornelisz. If you can decipher what precisely, apart from the prelude to sodomy, he intended to convey, you will have gone one better than the Getty. Drawings from Chatsworth, British Museum (071-636-1500) until Jan 9: Drawings from the J. Paul Getty Museum, Royal Academy (071-439-7438) until Jan 23.

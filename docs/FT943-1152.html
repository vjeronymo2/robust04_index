			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / This Week: Sport Football. Tuesday, September 27: UEFA Cup, second round, second leg. Wednesday, September 28: European Cup, Champions' League, round two. Thursday, September 29: Cup Winners' Cup, second round, second leg. UEFA's decision to play the three competitions on three separate nights to maximise television revenue has upset Roman restaurateurs who complain that armchair fans now only eat out on Mondays and Fridays. This week's highlight comes on Wednesday when Manchester United revisit Galatasaray, scene of one of their rare setbacks last season. That match was followed by unpleasant outbreaks of jingoism on both sides. Will the bad feelings persist among players, fans, club officials and, most importantly, the Turkish police? Ice Hockey. Saturday, October 1. The 78th season of National Hockey League, north America's top ice hockey competition, is scheduled to start on Saturday - maybe. The league has struggled for a decade to overcome its reputation as the country cousin of professional team sports. Now it has found a way to put itself instantly on a par with baseball. Gary Bettman, the NHL commissioner, has threatened to lock the players out unless they sign an agreement by Saturday. Asian Games. Open Sunday October 2. The Asian sports jamboree in Hiroshima, Japan, brings together more than 7,200 athletes from 42 countries competing in 34 sports, and that's not counting politics and capitalism. Ma Junren, the Chinese running coach, and sundry Taiwanese politicians threaten to dominate the headlines with their off-field activities. Chinese women runners coached by Ma broke a string of world records last year. They will re-emerge for these games along with men coached by Ma and a sales agent. Ma plans to use the games to market his secret (and increasingly lucrative) elixirs. Their ingredients include herbs, caterpillar fungus and turtle blood. They are, says Ma, partly responsible for his runners' success. China said it would boycott the games if Lee Teng-hui, Taiwan's president, attended the opening ceremony. The Olympic Council of Asia solved the problem by deciding not to invite any non-Japanese politicians. Taiwan has said that its officials will turn up anyway.</p>

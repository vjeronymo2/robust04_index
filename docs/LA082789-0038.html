			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEPARTING RIO HONDO PRESIDENT LOSES BATTLE OVER SCHOLARSHIP  </P> <P> At first it seemed like a simple request, one of the last official acts of a  departing president.  </P> <P> Herbert Sussman, the leader of Rio Hondo Community College for seven years,  wanted to create a scholarship in his name.  </P> <P> But like many other efforts in the waning years of Sussman's controversial  tenure -- the request caused turmoil. Sussman, whose contract was not renewed  last fall, asked that the recipient of a scholarship bearing his name be  announced at the annual commencement ceremony.  </P> <P> Some board members and college staff described Sussman's effort as one last act  of defiance, an attempt to force his foes on the board to listen to his name  being read when the scholarship is presented every year. Sussman denies the  assertion.  </P> <P> On Wednesday night, the board voted 4 to 1 to reject Sussman's scholarship  proposal, which was being funded by donations largely from Rio Hondo faculty  and staff. Trustee Isabelle Gonthier cast the only vote in favor of Sussman's  proposal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Only One Is Presented  </P> <P> About 40 scholarships are awarded every year at Rio Hondo Community College and  only one, the valedictorian award, is presented at the ceremony. Sussman's  scholarship, which would have been given to a graduating biology student, was  not on a par with the valedictorian scholarship, according to the board members  who voted against the proposal.  </P> <P> They also expressed concern that a graduation ceremony would be lengthened  considerably if all scholarship sponsors made the same request.  </P> <P> Sussman questioned the board's priorities. "Let's talk about scholarships for  students," Sussman said Wednesday night after the board meeting. "Let's not  talk about shortcutting a commencement for 15 minutes. Let's talk about  students."  </P> <P> Before the meeting, college staff members tried to persuade Sussman, who will  teach anatomy at the college in the fall, to compromise. Pamela Cox, the  college's public information officer, said she offered to place a special  insert in the graduation program to recognize Sussman's scholarship.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sought Announcement  </P> <P> Sussman refused. "It's the announcement to the audience that's the critical  thing," he said after the meeting.  </P> <P> "I think it is appropriate for (the name of) every student that graduates from  this college and gets a scholarship . . . to be announced at commencement so  that their parents and friends can hear," Sussman said.  </P> <P> Sussman said he had wanted Rio Hondo officials to place the donations, which so  far have totaled $1,300, in an interest-earning account. At the end of each  year, the interest would have been given to a student transferring to a  four-year college or university, he said.  </P> <P> Sussman said he will give the money to another community college. "It will make  students at another community college very happy," he said. Those who donated  to the fund and disagree with his plans can have their money back, he added.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Motives Questioned  </P> <P> Board member Ralph Pacheco accused Sussman of being selfish.  </P> <P> "If he thought that strongly about announcing all scholarships during  commencement, why didn't he implement that during his tenure as president?"  Pacheco asked. "You have to question the motivation.  </P> <P> "If you are doing it out of generosity, you give without expecting  recognition," he said. "The person with the humble and contrite heart would not  be concerned if his name is mentioned."  </P> <P> Pacheco and board members Hilda Solis, Bill Hernandez and Marilee Morgan voted  against Sussman's proposal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Criticism from 3 Trustees  </P> <P> It has not been unusual for the three Latino trustees to spar with Sussman. The  three have accused the departing president of not doing enough to hire minority  staff members and of failing to recruit promising students in the heavily  Latino communities that surround the campus just north of Whittier.  </P> <P> In addition, the three trustees didn't like Sussman's personality, they said.  Pacheco once called Sussman "brash, capricious and arbitrary."  </P> <P> Cox said: "The situation had broken down to the point where they could no  longer work with him. It made for a very tense seven months."  </P> <P> In October, 1988, the three Latino trustees approved an offer to buy out  Sussman's contract, but the president asked for more money than the board  members were willing to pay. Instead, Solis, Pacheco and Hernandez voted not to  renew Sussman's contract for the 1989-90 school year, even though he had  announced that he was retiring in June, 1989.  </P> <P> Throughout the contract dispute, Morgan and Gonthier supported the president  and defended his leadership style. Morgan also organized a going-away party for  Sussman and solicited funds for a scholarship in his name at the college. She  said she did not invite the three Latino trustees at Sussman's request.  </P> <P> As a result, Morgan's decision to vote against Sussman's scholarship proposal  Wednesday night caught some board members by surprise. After the meeting Morgan  sat quietly, dabbing tears. She said she was sorry that the board could not  reach a compromise with Sussman.  </P> <P> "I'm very sad, very disappointed," Morgan said. "I did not think it (the  scholarship proposal) was a legitimate request." She said there was "no way to  accommodate his wish" because all scholarship sponsors would have wanted their  awards announced as well.  </P> <P> But, Gonthier, who voted in favor of Sussman's proposal, said she was willing  to make the sacrifice, if it meant money for students.  </P> <P> "I don't want the students to lose, no matter what the conditions are,"  Gonthier said. "I want us to find another way to work it out."  </P></p>

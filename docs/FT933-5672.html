			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Murdoch banks on cheaper Times THE DECISION by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation to cut the price of The Times is a surprising one for a publication marketed in the past as the 'top people's paper'. Nothing like it has happened since the 1930s, and conventional wisdom has always been that newspapers - particularly broadsheet newspapers - are not very price-sensitive. But Mr Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, has long suspected that newspapers are too expensive, and that the way to reverse current falls in circulation is to cut costs. The national price cut, leaving the weekday Times selling for 30p, a cut of 15p, and the Saturday edition for 40p, a cut of 10p, is expected to be permanent. Mr Peter Stothard, editor of The Times, said last night: 'We have studied closely the results of our current experiment in Kent and concluded that the new price for The Times is the right one. 'There has been considerable debate in the industry about price levels and declining circulation in the quality market as a whole. 'We have led the argument and are now leading with the necessary action.' The move is likely to put intense pressure on The Times' broadsheet rivals to follow suit. While The Guardian is seen as impregnable with its own distinct readership, the immediate target is to win readers from The Independent, which sells for 45p. According to Audit Bureau of Circulation figures for July 1993, The Times sold an average 359,822 copies per day, down 6.42 per cent on the same month last year. The Daily Telegraph, priced at 48p, leads the quality field, with average daily sales in July of 1,017,483, a 0.23 per cent drop on 1992.</p>

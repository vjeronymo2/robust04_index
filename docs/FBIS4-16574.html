			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Election Results in Kiev"] </F>   [Text] The winners in the three electoral districts of Kiev  where people's deputies of Ukraine were elected on 10 April are:  in Radyanskyy E.D. No. 16 -- Myroslav Horbatyuk, the Rukh  candidate; in Svyatoshynskyy E.D. No. 18 -- Ivan Zayets (Rukh),  a deputy to the old Supreme Council of Ukraine (he defeated a  CPU member); in Chervonoarmiyskyy E.D. No. 23 -- Environmental  Protection Minister Yuriy Kostenko, a Rukh member (he defeated  Semen Yufa, chairman of the Merkuriy Cooperative Society).    No deputies were elected in five other districts [because  neither candidate obtained the qualifying number of votes], and  the elections in the remaining districts were invalid [because  voter turnout was lower than required by law].</p>

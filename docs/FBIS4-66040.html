			<p>BFN     [Text] President Rauf Denktas said it is important to the  Turkish Cypriot side that it be understood that there are  ambiguities with regard to several issues in the  confidence-building measures package. Denktas noted that the  Turkish Cypriot side is pleased with the recognition that there  are still issues that must be discussed. The president met with  Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's assistant special  envoy to Cyprus, for approximately two hours today.    In a statement to the press after the meeting, Denktas  remarked that the noted ambiguous points must be clarified if  the Turkish Cypriot side is to decide on its response to the 21  March nondocument document. Pointing out that there is a second  important issue for the Turkish Cypriot side, Denktas noted that  this consists of the fact that the nondocument document has been  transformed into the UN secretary general's proposals. The  Greek Cypriot side has been given the opportunity to hide behind  this nonexistent document, Denktas noted, adding that this is a  Byzantine trick.    Denktas also stated that the ambassadors to Lefkosa  [Nicosia]  from the UN Security Council permanent member countries are  aware that almost none of the Greek Cypriot political party  leaders have accepted the confidence-building measures.    In reply to a question, Denktas said the UN secretary  general's report is being postponed in order to allow for the  continuation of the work and not with ulterior motives. There  are still aspects for discussion and benefits promised to the  Turkish Cypriot side to be solidified and written down, Denktas  added. He also hoped that the UN secretary general would act in  a balanced way with regard to the report.    Stressing that the Turkish Cypriot side never reached the  point of saying yes or no, Denktas declared that, if necessary,  the Council of Ministers will discuss the issue upon his return  from Turkey.    In his statement after the meeting, Feissel declared that  some of the issues Denktas wanted clarified or confirmed were  discussed during the meeting. Feissel did not specify of what  these consist. He announced that he is waiting for a Turkish  Cypriot response on a few key issues concerning the  confidence-buidling measures and he did not receive any replies  during today's meeting. Pointing out that the UN secretary  general's report will soon be announced, Feissel described the  current situation as the most advanced phase of the process and  added that he will brief New York on the latest developments.  Feissel concluded by saying that he will be in contact with  Denktas both before and after the announcement of the report.</p>

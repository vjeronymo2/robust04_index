			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LA HABRA;  </P> <P> CITY TO LAUNCH GANG PREVENTION PROGRAM  </P> <P> The city has unveiled a $51,034 Preventive Gang Activity Program that officials  hope will spare La Habra some of the drug and gang violence so common in other  cities.  </P> <P> City Manager Lee Risner said gang activity in La Habra is limited to about 12  individuals and "a substantial percentage of this number is incarcerated or  (about) to stand trial for various incidents."  </P> <P> He estimated that an additional "75 to 100 young people, predominately males,  might have some propensity" to become gang members.  </P> <P> Risner said the city, the La Habra City School District and the Neighborhood  Housing Service of La Habra have joined forces to organize the program. A  $25,000 grant will be combined with local funds to provide educational and  counseling services to fourth- and fifth-grade students, he said.  </P> <P> Glen D. Hayes, executive director of the Neighborhood Housing Service, said the  program "is designed to expose the reality of gang activity and its serious  effects which in some cases are fatal."  </P> <P> The program provides $27,000 for a counselor who will meet with school children  as well as neighborhood groups in the El Campo, Grace Pacific, and Alta Vista  communities.  </P> <P> The school district has initiated another program targeting youths who are  identified to be "at risk."  </P> <P> Felipe Plascencia, newly hired youth and community services coordinator,  indicated that the program will include direct interaction with students as  well as involvement of parents and community agencies, including the clergy.  </P></p>

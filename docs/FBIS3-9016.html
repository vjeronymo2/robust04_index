			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister-designate Jozef Moravcik by </F> Julius Gembicky in Bratislava on 15 March: "Consensus and a New  Political Culture"]    [Text] Bratislava -- Shortly after Prime  Minister-designate Jozef Moravcik had been officially entrusted  by President Michal Kovac with forming a new broad coalition  government, he granted his first interview to NARODNA  OBRODA.    [Gembicky] Mr. Moravcik, the coalition method of government  is demanding because various political entities will directly  influence it or will enter into it. Some of the parties --  mainly the centrist ones -- do not yet have clear-cut policies,  which may make things difficult for the future prime minister,  not only in seeking a compromise but also in ensuring that the  cabinet functions efficiently as a unit. In this context, some  experts are wondering whether the new government will be able to  function as a compact unit or whether it will be divided  department by department in accordance with the strength of the  political parties, movements, and factions that entered into it.  In your opinion, what would be the most effective way of  reducing this handicap?    [Moravcik] We have to place emphasis on forming a collective  that is mutually compact. That means that we are not attaching  importance to allegiance to individual parties and groupings but  to ensuring that a homogeneous collective is formed, which would  provide a guarantee that not only the real obstacles but also  the diverse points of view will be overcome, that there will be  unity, and that compromises will be sought.    [Gembicky] What mechanism for a coalition agreement among  the ruling entities have you decided to embrace?    [Moravcik] The basis for this coalition mechanism is and  will be consensus. I firmly believe -- and up to now we have  always succeeded -- that we will achieve a consensus, although  it seems rather unusual. However, it has a very important side  effect. It will help to unite the very divergent or disunited  entities on our political scene. That is extraordinarily  important for Slovakia at the moment. If we succeed, we can lay  the foundations for a new political culture, which would be a  good sign for Slovakia's political future.    [Gembicky] What positive activities undertaken by the  previous cabinet would you like to follow up on, what would you  like to improve, and what would you like radically to change?    [Moravcik] In my opinion, what was positive about the  previous cabinet was its industriousness and assiduousness. We  would like to inherit these qualities. However, they should not  be undermined by the lack of a concept. That means that we  should see to it that a firm line is established and that stress  is laid on its execution. We would definitely like to improve  this.    [Gembicky] Following your naming as prime  minister-designate, you emphasized economic recovery as a  priority for making your government's activity more efficient.  How will that be projected into the mechanism for the  functioning of the government and for the considerable personnel  changes in the crucial economic departments?    [Moravcik] The team of economic ministers will actually be  completed in the next few hours. Those negotiations are the  most demanding because we all feel that the composition of the  team is the pivotal point of the entire strategy from which the  new government wants to proceed and that it wants to present to  the parliament in April in its policy statement. For that  reason, the negotiations have not yet been completed and, in  this sphere, we are much more interested in the expertise than  the political allegiance of the candidates for the ministerial  posts.    [Gembicky] Do you consider it essential -- and you  personally, Mr. Moravcik -- for your government to be only a  temporary one or would it not bother you if it were in office  until the end of this electoral term?    [Moravcik] We will keep to the generally accepted political  agreement. The concept for the new government's work is based  on this and, according to it, elections must be held this fall  at the latest. We have sufficient means for pushing for  elections at the end of September or the beginning of October.  This is, in our view, the optimum date and we want to do  everything to ensure that it is adhered to.    [Gembicky] How do you view effective cooperation within  the trio of the most senior constitutional officials -- the  president, the National Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR]  chairman, and the prime minister?    [Moravcik] Regular meetings and an in-depth discussion on  the most important issues before a decision is made is the basis  for good cooperation. I think it could be a fundamental course  of action that would guarantee the harmonization of cooperation  and collaboration among the representatives of the  aforementioned most senior constitutional institutions.    [Gembicky] On the basis of a political decision, however,  the outgoing government refused to administer the affairs of the  individual departments until a new government is appointed.  What if NRSR Chairman Ivan Gasparovic, for instance, were to be  governed by the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia's [HZDS] new  political decisions and were to refuse to take part or if, as  the case may be, he were to make effective cooperation in the  president-parliamentary chairman-prime minister triumvirate  difficult?    [Moravcik] At the moment, we are proceeding from the view  held by those of us participating in the formation of the new  government that as far as the National Council chairman is  concerned, it is necessary to respect the fact that the HZDS has  the strongest deputies' club. Therefore, we also intend to  accept the fact that the chairman of the Slovak parliament is  also from that club. Naturally, if cooperation were to be  impeded and if it were necessary to alter this informal  principle, then we have sufficient means for ensuring that we  alter this situation.    [Gembicky] In your opinion, what kind of coordination should  there be in foreign policy between the Castle, the government,  and the Foreign Ministry, an area in which there have recently  been, to a certain extent, glitches?    [Moravcik] I think that favorable prerequisites will now be  created for ensuring that cooperation among all these  constitutional entities is harmonized. I am well acquainted  with the situation in the Foreign Ministry. My views on foreign  policy are identical -- in the fundamental principles -- with  those of the president. That is, there is a fundamental  prerequisite for ensuring that our cooperation runs smoothly.  Incidentally, this is merely a question of maintaining the best  possible mutual connections, relations, and coordination. The  means for doing so are in our hands.</p>

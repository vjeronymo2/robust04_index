			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] As the date for tight international sanctions  for Haiti draws near, some nationals believe that Barbados  should be part of the peacekeeping or police force sent to  Haiti. However, for the most part, they do not seem too keen on  housing Haitian refugees. Nobeline Brewster tells us more:    [Begin recording] [Brewster] Media reports say the United  States is asking Caribbean nations to provide a temporary or  permanent home for the Haitians and part of a military or police  force. This as efforts intensify to get rid of the military and  restore democracy to the French-speaking nation. Government  officials in Barbados wouldn't say much more than that the  Haitian crisis is being discussed, but other Barbadians are  quite vocal. Senator Dr. Erskins Simmons says we should open  our doors to as many Haitians as we can. Dr. Simmons argues  that Haiti was home to many Caribbean people in the past and the  region must now return the favor. He says we could seek  financial assistance from the United Nations High Commission for  Refugees.    [Simmons] Lots of Barbadians, Vincentians, Jamaicans  migrated  to Haiti in the early days. We put strain on their social  systems when we were under pressure. We owe it to them to take  some of the strain off of their social systems now because their  social systems cannot absorb the type of problems that they  have. [passage omitted]    [Brewster] But many other Barbadians are not too keen on  allowing Haitians here, but all seem to agree on Barbadian  participation in an international force.    [Unidentified speaker] If you have armies and your neighbor  is in trouble, and the armies are not going to help the  neighbor, what is the sense of having the army? This is a  tailor-made situation where we can use an army effectively. Of  course, we cannot fight [words indistinct], but certainly we can  be there to give moral support to whichever developed countries  are willing to restore democracy back to Haiti again. [passage  omitted]    [Brewster] The U.S. is currently conducting exercises off  Haiti and political analysts say they may be preparing for a  military intervention. U.S. President Bill Clinton says such  intervention may be used to get rid of the defiant Haitian Army.  [end recording]</p>

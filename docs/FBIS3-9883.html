			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Panama City Circuito RPC Television in  Spanish at 0200 GMT on 23 February broadcasts during its  regularly scheduled "Democracy 94" program a 60-minute live or  recorded interview with Samuel Lewis Galindo, presidential  candidate of the National Consensus Alliance, by "Democracy 94"  host Hugo Famania.    Famania opens the program by asking Lewis Galindo why he  decided to run for office since he is a very successful  entrepreneur. He replies: "I have devoted 45 years of my life  to private enterprise and I have developed it. I have created  many job opportunities and given employment to many. I have  seen many enterprises grow, and I have reached a stage in my  life where I think I must devote my efforts to serving the  fatherland." Lewis Galindo goes on to speak about the economic  plan he would launch and explains that "we must try to keep a  5-percent annual growth rate," and attain a national consensus  that will keep the country calm so that foreign investments are  made. This can only be done "if we modernize the government  structures by improving administrative functions," he adds.    When Famania asks him if this modernization entails  "reducing  bureaucracy," Lewis Galindo answers that a modern and efficient  state requires fewer personnel, but we must watch out for the  high unemployment rate; therefore, private enterprise must grow.  The presidential candidate goes on to speak about ways to  reduce poverty and pay the "social debt" rather than pay the  foreign debt. After pointing out the foreign debt is higher  today that in 1989, Lewis Galindo says that, should he be  elected, he will seek an agreement with the people to see how  the country can cope with "these inherited responsibilities."    At 0230 GMT, Famania explains that Samuel Lewis Galindo is  the presidential candidate of the National Consensus Alliance  that is made up of Solidarity Party and the National Unity  Mission. Expanding on the foreign debt issue, Lewis Galindo  points out that another presidential candidate, Ruben Dario  Carles, "is also responsible for the increase in the foreign  debt" as Carles was the comptroller general for the current  administration. To cope with this problem, Lewis Galindo says  that the next government will have to do what Costa Rica did.  For example, he adds, it must first seek Panamanian economists  who will draft a national plan and not act according to "plans  imposed by the international financing institutions, which is  what has happened in Panama."    Lewis Galindo says that the only way Panama can obtain  "adequate growth" is through exports, but the problem is that  while private enterprise has modernized, the government has not.  Panama must reduce tariffs, and the state must become more  efficient, he points out. To sum it up, Famania emphasizes that  Lewis Galindo proposes "modernization of the economy."    Turning to the subject of public security, Lewis Galindo  says  the National Police must become more professional, and the  organization must be reorganized thoroughly, with a civilian  hierarchy, without including the former officers of the defunct  Panama Defense Forces and National Guard.    Referring to the Panama Canal, Famania mentions that "about  one week ago, the new chief of the Southern Command said that  the United States was willing to change the timetable for  returning the military bases at the request of Panama." He then  asks the presidential candidate: "Do you think it would be  advisable for Panama to change this timetable?" Samuel Lewis  Galindo answers: "I think we Panamanians must conduct ourselves  with a certain amount of dignity. If the United States gives  clear signals that it needs certain areas for some bases that  will benefit Latin America and Panama, I -- as head of the  government -- would be willing to negotiate. However, first of  all, certain things would have to take place. First, we must  determine what is the value, what is the economic potential of  those bases? What are the economic benefits those bases have  for the country versus the exploitation of those areas? It will  probably be more advantageous for Panama -- should there be  mutual interest by the two nations -- that these bases be moved  to other areas where they will promote the development of those  areas, for example Darien, should that be the case. Nonetheless,  we must first consult the sovereign power, that is, the people."    As for the reverted areas, Lewis Galindo says he proposes  conducting studies "to obtain the maximum benefit of the entire  canal bank area, so that these resources will attract  investors," but this must all be part of an overall program as  "the former Canal Zone cannot become a privileged island while  Panama remains poor." He adds that "the wealth generated from  these areas must help solve the unemployment, health, and --  particularly -- the education problems."    The presidential candidate then answers listeners' questions  that cover subjects such as denying there is any political  agreement with the Democratic Revolutionary Party,  privatization, and the Social Security system.</p>

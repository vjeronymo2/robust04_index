			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Russian industrial plan to be redrafted THE RUSSIAN government yesterday failed to agree a long-promised industrial policy because of divisions over how generous the cash-strapped state can be as it tries to tackle inflation. At yesterday's cabinet meeting older conservatives disagreed among themselves rather than clashing with young monetarist-minded radicals. The cabinet ordered the redrafting of a plan which was supposed to provide selective support for industry after Mr Oleg Lobov, first deputy prime minister in charge of the economy, widened it to support virtually all economic sectors. Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, prime minister, said the plan had to focus on priority sectors as the state had to avoid fuelling inflation by printing money. Mr Ivan Materov, the deputy economic minister, who presented the plan to the cabinet, said its intention was to support areas which did not enjoy demand now but would do so once the economy pulled out of its 'deep depression'.</p>

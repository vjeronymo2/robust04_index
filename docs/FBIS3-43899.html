PAC Regional Secretary Mfanelo Skwatsha said the move was not in  line with national conference resolutions taken in Umtata last  year.    "The conference mandated the PAC leadership to negotiate a  mutual cessation of hostilities with the regime. This move is  nothing but capitulation and renegation on the part of the PAC  leadership," Mr Skwatsha said.    He called for a special conference for the PAC leadership to  explain its decision.</p>

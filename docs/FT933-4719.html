			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / American Airlines hits at EC rivals AMERICAN Airlines, the largest US carrier, yesterday accused European national flag carriers of undermining competition in the European airline market by seeking to delay the passage of a new EC code of conduct for airline computer reservation systems (CRS). American Airlines, owner of the world's largest computer reservation system called Sabre, has been frustrated in its efforts to expand its network in Europe because of what it claims are efforts by European flag carriers to maintain the dominant position of their own CRS systems in the European market. The US company also claimed that European airlines such as Air France, Iberia and Lufthansa are attempting to shelter themselves from vigorous fare competition from smaller airlines provided through Sabre's fare-shopping system. This allows users to find the lowest fare for a seat on any airline in seconds. The US complaint comes on the eve of a two-day meeting in Paris today of European air transport officials. Mr David Schwarte, American Airlines' legal adviser, said the US carrier hoped the meeting would help clear the way for rapid approval by EC transport ministers of the new European CRS code later this month. The code was blocked last June following pressure from the Association of European Airlines (AEA), the trade organisation grouping 23 European carriers. The AEA complained that the code was tantamount to a 'sell-out of European interests' because it would make it mandatory for large European carriers to participate in Sabre. The AEA argued that mandatory participation by European airlines would give American Airlines an unfair advantage because the US carrier directly owned the CRS and would be able to monitor schedules and bookings of the competition. The AEA said the code would only be acceptable if there was a physical separation (or what the industry calls dehosting) of the airline's internal computer systems from the CRS marketed to the travel industry. European CRS systems, owned by groups of airlines, are already dehosted and limit their owners to viewing only their data. But Mr Schwarte said this issue was a 'red herring' aimed at delaying implementation of the new CRS rules. 'It is the way a system is programmed that determines whether or not it is neutral and provides appropriate safeguards for confidential information,' he added. He also said that if American Airlines compromised the neutrality of Sabre, it would destroy the system's credibility. 'After an investment of nearly Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn), we're hardly likely to put this at risk by not playing the game according to the rules,' he said.</p>

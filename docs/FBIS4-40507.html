			<p>BFN     [Text] We arrived here to fill the gap between the  authorities of Kiev and Crimea, said Oleksandr Moroz, Supreme  Council chairman of Ukraine, while speaking in the Crimean  Supreme Council today. Our task, he pointed out, is to establish  business and emotional contacts. However, we have prospects  only on condition that we work in a single constitutional field,  said Oleksandr Moroz.    According to the Ukrainian Supreme Council speaker, the  aggravation of the situation in Crimea was caused not only by  the local authorities' actions, but also by the mistakes made by  the Kiev authorities.    Touching on the Black Sea Fleet issue, Oleksandr Moroz  pointed out that this is a zone of special interest of Ukraine  and Russia. In the opinion of Oleksandr Moroz, the Black Sea  Fleet should be used jointly by both countries and it should  have a joint command. However, the Supreme Council chairman  pointed out, Ukraine and Russia should maintain and be in charge  of their own parts of the fleet.    Oleksandr Moroz held a news conference for journalists  during  which he, in particular, spoke out against the federal system in  Ukraine, saying that the time has not yet come for this.</p>

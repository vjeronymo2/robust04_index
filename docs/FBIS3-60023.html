In addition, eight other suspects  of the same case were also arrested.    The two culprits, surnamed Gong and Tang, often carrying  guns  with them, have been engaging in drug trafficking from Burma to  mainland China for a long time. The case was tracked down and  solved by the Enping County Public Security Bureau, which took  as a clue the rumor among the drug addicts in the county that  the "rice" (meaning drugs) there was both cheap and fine.    Further investigations are now under way for this case.</p>

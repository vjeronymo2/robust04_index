			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'FINE-TUNING' THE MEDICARE SURTAX  </P> <P> The Times' advice for fine-tuning Medicare's catastrophic insurance is sound.  However, health insurance for seniors, both government and private, needs a  complete overhaul.  </P> <P> As a 65 year old who will be paying some percentage of the surtax, I'm not  complaining. It is a bargain. However, my secondary insurance, retained from my  job when I retired, already will pay much of what this program does. Better  over-insured than under-insured, of course.  </P> <P> Some cautious few of us are buying long-term care insurance. Now that's what we  really need. It's not cheap nor easy to find good policies which can cost from  $700 to $1,200 a year.  </P> <P> Those seniors who are protesting the surtax -- and those legislators who are  tip-toeing around the issue -- should spend their energies trying to come up  with some basic long-term care insurance. A lot of us will willingly pay.  </P> <P> MARY MEYER  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

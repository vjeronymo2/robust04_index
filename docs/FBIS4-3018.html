			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 16 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher urged Russia today to influence the  Bosnian Serbs to stop its offensive on Gorazde so as not to  trigger new NATO air strikes, reports said.    Quoting an unnamed State Department official, the Associated  Press said Christopher called Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev and asked him "to use his influence with the Serbs."    The official said Christopher made the telephone call before  Kozyrev left to Belgrade, capital of the Serb Republic.    "He told the foreign minister that, given the situation on  the ground in Bosnia, it was quite likely that NATO would have  to respond to a U.N. request for 'close air support,'" the  official said.    "And he urged Foreign Minister Kozyrev to use his influence  with the Serbs to keep this from being necessary."    Meanwhile, U.S. President Bill Clinton was briefed by  Christopher, Defense Secretary William Perry and National  Security Adviser Anthony Lake on the Bosnian situation.    A British warplane was shot down today over Gorazde, a  Bosnian town mainly populated by the Muslims and was on the  verge of being taken by the Serbs.    The plane was trying to retaliate against a tank that  reportedly fired directly into Gorazde, a U.N.-designated "safe  area" for the Bosnian Muslims, NATO said. The pilot ejected as  the plane exploded.</p>

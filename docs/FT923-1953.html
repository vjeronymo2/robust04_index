			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Fashion: Women who boldly tread beyond the sex barrier - A woman in a man's suit? Ugh. But a woman in suiting cut to fit the female form  ... well that's another matter, as Avril Groom discovers THEY stride boldly through social history in their trousers, toppers and boots. They are the great cross-dressers, women who have become famous for, among other things, recognising the indisputable fashion paradox that dressing like a man can make you more of a woman. They are also the role-models for this autumn's definitive fashion image. As lifestyle models they are more of a problem. Some go rather too far down the path to androgyny, if the history of Vita Sackville-West is anything to go by. But cross-dressing is absolutely no indication of sexual proclivity and, as women such as Marlene Dietrich, Sarah Bernhardt and even Shakespeare's Rosalind found, it adds a heady amount of feminine allure. Donning male-inspired garb is, of course, nothing new. In the 15th century Joan of Arc wore armour which, although her captors complained of her masculine dress, appears to have been moulded to her female figure. And, in essence, the rules have not changed since. A woman in a man's suit risks looking unattractively butch. A woman in men's suiting, cut to follow and flatter the feminine form, is another matter altogether. The secret of success is the witty juxtaposition of items traditionally considered either a male or female preserve. Wearing pinstripe pants with lace-up brogues is far too literal; this is the first time for ages that trousers with high heels have been stylistically correct - aficionados choose a slightly chunky heel and a small platform. Likewise, why wear a shirt and tie with your grey double-breasted jacket when you could surprise the chaps with a lace-trimmed 'body'? Hair is another area for attention, the bigger, softer or more carelessly piled-up the better. But sport an Eton crop with pinstripes and your intentions could be misinterpreted. Make-up, too, is a factor - remember Liza Minelli's dark eyes peering from under her bowler in Cabaret. And cross-dressing need not even include trousers. The most obvious way to feminise a mannish jacket is with the new long skirt, provided it is cut sinuously tight across the hips and lengthily split for ease of movement and for a glimpse of legs that, after years of the short skirt, most women no longer feel they need to hide. How these juxtapositions work psychologically is explained by fashion historian Colin McDowell, whose new book Hats published next month (Pounds 24.95, Thames and Hudson) contains several examples of women highly glamourised by wearing men's hats. 'Traditional men's dress, and especially hats, are still symbols of authority and dignity in our society,' he says. 'Add that to the feminine glamour which is the basis of women's sex appeal and you pack a very powerful punch. Men's styles are usually covered up which, on a woman, is extremely sexy. Conversely, men in women's clothes lose their authority and become figures of fun.' It is tempting to ascribe serious sociological motives to 1992's rash of cross-dressing. Perhaps women wish to celebrate their increasing power in the professions by wresting the clothes from men's backs as well as the jobs from their grasp. The truth, though, is more prosaic, just another turn in the fashion cycle. After several years of colourful near-vulgarity and clanking gilt accessories, spawned by the conspicuously consuming Eighties, what could look more perfectly new for the restrained Nineties than a plain, grey John Major-style suit? Inevitably, this is the style which designers and stores have most taken to heart. Apart from racy Marks and Spencer pinstripes, you can find this look at every level, from Kookai's budget hairline stripe polyester/viscose trouser suit at Pounds 108.99 and Alexon's birdseye check wool at Pounds 198.95, to Jaeger's sleekly-cut grey wool twill suit at Pounds 378 and Ralph Lauren's feminine, wide-trousered style at Pounds 960. But there are many other ways to play the man's lady. Designers have let their fantasies run riot on male stereotypes from the country squire to the motorcycle courier. Take your pick but bear in mind that the final effect should always be that of a strictly female male. And if anyone tells you to walk like a man, ignore them.</p>

			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / The sleeping giant awakes: China and its neighbours are poised to become the next economic heavyweight. How should the world respond, asks Martin Wolf I suggest we abandon the absolutism of free trade. This was the doctrine established in our most glorious period of economic growth, when the coolies of Asia were restricted to pulling rickshaws. These times have passed: the coolies now sit at computer screens. Claude Imbert, editor of Le Point. China? There lies a sleeping giant - let him sleep] For when he wakes he will move the world. Napoleon, emperor of the French. China is waking. The shape of the world in the next century will be determined by how the advanced industrial countries respond. The industrial countries dominate the world economy. They generate 54 per cent of world gross product, measured at common international prices. At market exchange rates, their share of global GDP is 73 per cent. Some 79 per cent of world merchandise exports and 87 per cent of exports of manufactures come from the industrial countries. Even excluding trade in manufactures within the European Community, the advanced country share of manufactured exports is 82 per cent. The most important change in relative economic position this century has been Japan's move to become the world's second largest economy. This was important in itself, but also for what it foreshadowed. Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea have followed Japan's path. But their chief importance is as an example. With combined populations of less than 70m, these four small economies will never shake the world. The potential for further rapid economic development in Asia, particularly in China, is vast. Asia contains more than half of the world's population. The gap in real income per head between the large Asian developing countries and industrial countries has grown very large. The gulf in labour costs, at market exchange rates, is larger still. Gaps in output per head indicate the economic potential of poorer countries. They also show that catching up is difficult. Most Asian countries, including the largest, have only recently begun to make the leap into what Nobel-laureate Simon Kuznets called 'modern economic growth'. The reasons for their long delay have included imperialism, internal instability (notably in China), two world wars, inter-war chaos and, partly in reaction to all of these, the inward-looking and etatiste development ideologies of the postwar era. Today's transformation is symbolised by the fate of the Soviet Union. This is an era not of a great leap forward, but more of a great leap outward. Many developing countries are going where Taiwan and South Korea have led. China has already shown it can do so. According to admittedly imperfect national statistics, Chinese economic growth was 9 1/2 per cent a year in the 1980s. At this rate an economy doubles every seven to eight years. The World Bank talks of a greater China or 'Chinese Economic Area', which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan: At the market exchange rate, its GDP was Dollars 600bn (Pounds 400bn) in 1991, about half that of France. But measured at common international prices (that is, by revaluing output in all countries using the same prices) its GDP was greater than Japan's. Its imports are already two-thirds as large as Japan's and could exceed them within 10 years. 1 If China were to sustain growth of income per head at 7-8 per cent a year for another 20 years, it would only attain the real income per head achieved by Japan in the mid-1970s. But between now and 2012, its GDP would grow six-fold. Expressed in international prices, its economy would be as big as the US and Japanese combined, but should still have opportunities for relatively rapid growth. China is not alone. In the 1980s, rapid growth was also achieved by South Korea (9.7 per cent a year), Taiwan (8.0 per cent), Thailand (7.6 per cent), Hong Kong (7.1 per cent), Singapore (6.4 per cent), Indonesia (5.5 per cent) and Malaysia (5.2 per cent). Vietnam is taking off, while even India managed growth averaging 5.3 per cent. The combined populations of these countries is, it should be remembered, close to 2.5bn. What could stop their onward march? Political instability is one threat. But it is difficult to stop industrial development once it is entrenched. Protectionism abroad is another. But Asian countries can support each other. Their manufactured exports to Japan and one another are already as large as to the US. The world is at the beginning of the fourth great change in the relative economic weight of countries since the industrial revolution. The first was the rise of the UK. The second was the onset of the US and, to a lesser extent, Germany. Japan's rise though not as important as the earlier two, made the third. Brian Reading of Lombard Street Research makes a persuasive comparison of the present epoch with the late 19th century. 2 1873-96 was a period of falling prices and, for that reason, was widely thought of as a depression. But it was, in fact, a period of rapid expansion. Between the civil war and the first world war US industrial output increased some 10-fold. By 1913 the US generated a third of global industrial output, more than Germany and the UK together. Such upheavals have potentially devastating effects: They transform relative power, leading often to war: the US ended up in conflicts, hot or cold, with Germany, Japan and Russia. They destabilise the world economy: the great depression of the 1930s, the failure to restore the gold standard and the collapse of the treaty-based commercial policy system of the 19th century were largely explained by the refusal of the US to abide by the old rules. They also impose painful economic adjustments. The rise of Asian economies may create still greater difficulties for established powers than did the previous changes. The rise of the US and Germany were associated with the rapid growth of new industries, such as chemicals. The same has been partly true of Japan. But Asian development is based on making things more cheaply. Its principal resource is diligent and, by industrial country standards, frighteningly cheap labour. The growth of global income inequality has created a new opportunity for specialisation, within manufacturing, on the basis of relative labour costs. Between 1981 and 1991 exports of manufactures from east Asian developing countries grew at 12.8 per cent a year in real terms, while those from industrial countries grew at only 4.4 per cent. Nevertheless, manufactured exports from east Asian economies still accounted for only 18 per cent of world exports in 1991, even with trade inside the EC excluded. The advent of competitive exports from developing countries has, inevitably, led to resurrection of the 'pauper labour fallacy'. But: Low wages do not mean Asian developing countries can undercut everything industrial countries produce; those wages reflect low productivity. The majority of Chinese would not benefit from having their wages pushed up prematurely and they would also not gain from a Gatt social chapter aimed at depriving them of their best hope of escape from mass poverty. Advanced countries would not lose all export opportunities. On the contrary, between 1981 and 1991 industrial country manufactured exports to east Asian developing countries grew at 8.6 per cent a year, faster than to any other markets. Growth of labour-intensive exports from Asia offers substantial overall benefits to industrial countries, as well as to owners of physical capital and to skilled labour. But it is also likely to lower the relative wages of unskilled workers. A classic theorem in international trade, 'factor price equalisation', suggests that incomes from labour and capital would be equalised by free trade. The assumptions underlying the theorem are unrealistic. Yet there could well be a tendency towards equalisation, as labour-intensive industries shrink. Apart from the size of the wage gap between North and South, there are two other reasons why this tendency may now be more important than before: most developing countries are, for the first time, trying to exploit their comparative advantage, rather than fight it; and the capacity to transfer technology, communicate with far-flung factories and transport their output to distant markets has also steadily increased. The extent to which exports of manufactures have already driven down demand for - and relative wages of - unskilled labour in rich countries is controversial. Adrian Wood of the Institute of Development Studies at Sussex University argues that the cumulative effect, to 1990, of North-South trade in manufactures was to lower demand for unskilled labour in Northern economies, as a proportion of 1985 employment, by 6 per cent and demand for manufacturing labour by 12 per cent. 3 These are not negligible figures. More recently, two American academics, Robert Lawrence of Harvard University and Matthew Slaughter of MIT, conclude for the US, where trade has been frequently invoked as an explanation, that it 'has not been the major source of US average and relative wage performance in the 1980s'. 4 Whatever the truth about the past, continued rapid expansion of exports of manufactures from developing countries is likely to have a significant effect on future demand for unskilled labour. The idiot's answer is protection. But the piecemeal protection reluctantly suggested by Jean-Claude Paye, secretary-general of the OECD, would be irrelevant. High and sustained protection against all imports of labour-intensive manufactures would be needed. Such a policy would be open to powerful objections: Protection would fail to preserve lost export markets, unless rich countries were to create a discriminatory free trade area against poorer ones. It would shift resources from efficient export industry to inefficient import-competing industry; It would lower aggregate economic welfare and impose a large tax on rich country consumers of labour-intensive products; and It would create growing friction between old economic powers and new ones. A far better response would be a mixture of investment in education with subsidies to unskilled employment. But pressures to retreat behind a protectionist wall against Asian exporters of manufactures are bound to grow. Defeating those pressures will need courage and imagination. Morally, it would be wrong to block the peaceful commercial road to economic progress. Practically, the growth of China and its neighbours offers enticing economic opportunities. In deciding which way to turn, Europe and North America should remember that China was once the world's richest civilisation. In the 15th century the imperial court decided to halt commercial contact with those they thought barbarians. The rest is 500 years of unhappy history. 1 Global Economic Prospects and the Developing Countries 1993 (Washington DC: World Bank). 2 Brian Reading, Monthly International Review 18, Lombard Street Research, June 3 1993. 3 Adrian Wood, The Factor Content of North-South Trade in Manufactures Reconsidered, Weltwirtschaftliches Archiv, Volume 127, Number 4, 1991, pp. 719-43. 4 Robert Z.

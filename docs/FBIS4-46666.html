A. Andrianov, V. P. Gorobets, Ye. V. Korablev </F> and V. M. Smirnov; UDC 621.396.96]    [Abstract] The problem examined is a reduction of the  distorting influence of the atmosphere due to the refraction of  radio waves on electronic measurements of the parameters of  vehicular motion: the atmospheric refraction correction problem.  The theory of the problem is examined. The method proposed for  most effective solution of the problem is an iteration scheme  for taking into account tropospheric refraction corrections  which operates on the principle of successive (step-by-step)  refinement of the influence of the troposphere on electronic  measurements of the range to the spacecraft and its radial  velocity of motion. A block diagram of the method is given. In  the first step the correction of electronic measurements is made  on the basis of the surface value of the atmospheric refractive  index without using a tropospheric model. The second step, based  on the surface value of the refractive index and an exponential  model of the troposphere, yields refraction corrections with  allowance for the real values of the electronic measurements of  range and velocity. The use of direct measurement data makes it  possible to take the real influence of the troposphere partially  into account. The third step, based on application of an  algorithm for the inversion of experimental data from electronic  measurements, makes it possible to determine the vertical  profile of the troposphere corresponding to its real state. This  makes it possible to predict highly accurate refraction  corrections for electronic measurements. Specific information is  given on the accuracies achieved. These determinations can be  used in effectively solving problems in space geodesy and  radionavigation. Variants of the method are discussed. Figures  2; references: 7 Russian.</p>

			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Repairing the fault line Sir, It hardly needed the latest Tory tiff over a single European currency - a natural corollary of the single European market already in being, but still a remote prospect - to drive home Philip Stephens's point about the re-emerging 'Tory fault-line over Europe' ('The clock starts to tick for Major', April 30). We have, of course, had other alleged fault-lines, notably with regard to the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (though here, in the events leading up to Black Wednesday, Britain's own behaviour was at least as much at fault as anything else). But the real fault-line in British politics now, it seems to me, runs through No 10 Downing Street, whose occupier - to adapt a remark about an earlier ruler by the Roman historian Tacitus - seemed eminently fit to hold the job that goes with it had he not done so. Clearly, it is up to the Tory party itself, in the first place, to repair that basic shortcoming. Walter Grey, 12 Arden Road, Finchley, London N3 3AN</p>

			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BERLIN WALL BITS USED AS RADIO GIMMICKS  </P> <P> Two Twin Cities radio stations say they have made deals to acquire small pieces  of the Berlin Wall and will give them away to listeners.  </P> <P> A third station called the idea "pretty tacky."  </P> <P> KDWB-FM made the first offer Monday morning when announcer Steve Cochran  invited listeners to win a piece of the wall by calling the station. The 25th  caller wins.  </P> <P> KJJO-FM expects to start its promotion Friday. It will give away its 40 small  pieces by asking listeners to call when they hear songs with wall in the  titles.  </P> <P> Mike Boen, general manager at KTCZ, said he was noncommittal when a radio  syndicate offered 40 pieces of the wall for $500.  </P> <P> The promotion "trivializes the whole episode," he said. "It kind of hit us as  pretty tacky."  </P></p>

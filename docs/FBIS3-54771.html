			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Economy Minister Yegor Gaydar by Tatyana </F> Chemodanova; place and date not given -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Chemodanova] Yegor Timurovich, what are your views  on Russia in the new year?    [Gaydar] Well, about the Russian economy next year. In  principle it depends on the economic and political conclusions  that are drawn from the 1993 events. In our economy 1993 was a  year of the gradual formation of market relations structures, of  very slow progress, of vacillations and inconsistency. In spite  of the mild policy our opponents were not strong enough to  decisively and consistently switch our economy onto a course,  lets say, of restoration of traditional mechanisms, or even to  the Ukrainian course of development. We did not have enough  power and opportunities to consistently accomplish the policy of  reforms.    At present we are at the crossroads. Naturally, one can get  scared once more, and, naturally, one can now choose a course of  fueling inflation, masking it with words about the need to  support industry structures, [words indistinct] and so on. Then  in the spring inflation will gradually gain momentum and by  summer it will once again reach an extremely high level. After  that it will turn out that it is very hard to live in these  conditions, that there is nothing nice in it, and there will be  another budgetary crisis.    In short, 1994 will develop approximately along the lines of  1993. We are at the turning point. Considering the first stage  as mainly completed, it possible to bring to completion the part  that remains -- that is the trajectory that we have consistently  adopted from September when we started bringing down inflation  from 29 percent to about 12 percent in December, and to continue  along that line in the first six months, and on that basis  gradually supplement the economic prerequisites for stable  market growth.    This means a new system of financing and stimulating  investments, a gradual redistribution of budget allocations from  the support of enterprises to the support of social programs, a  gradual widening of the range of programs that can be supported  up to the already planned reform of family benefits and the  pension reform that is being prepared, and gradual preparation  for the introduction of benefits for the poor that will replace  a large number of badly coordinated benefits.    At the same time it is increasing the efficiency of the  system for encouraging small businesses which there is no sense  in setting up with a monthly inflation of 25 percent. But when  we are now already talking about inflation that is predicted to  become less than 10 percent, those tax privileges that are,  let's say, stipulated in the latest decree make sense.    In short, we must try to develop a basis that will provide  stable economic growth. Then 1994 will be a year of gradual  reduction of the rate of inflation, well, at least by five to  seven percent per month by the end of the year, and a year of  gradual reduction of the slump in industry which could be  stopped in the main by around the end of the year, by the fourth  quarter. It will be a year of developing preconditions for  stabilizing growth in 1995. It will also be a year for the  gradual development of a more or less sensible social policy and  the development of prerequisites for, strictly speaking, growth.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xu Yang: "Enterprise Changes Sure To Expand Unions' </F> Role"]    [Text] The All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) is  finishing a document that defines the unions' expanded role in  the modern enterprise system.    Trade unions and individual workers are to be empowered with  rights involving labour contracts, freedom to express opinions  about the firms management, and representation on boards of  directors and supervisors.    Entitled "Suggestions on the Trade Unions' Role and Workers'  Democratic Management under the Modern Enterprise System," the  document will be submitted to the State Council for approval  this month.    The modern enterprise system, put forward by the Chinese  Communist Party Central Committee last November calls on  enterprises to operate in line with international practices.    The State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System  launched a pilot project earlier this year to establish the  system initially in 100 State-owned enterprises. Most of these  State firms will be restructured into limited-liability  companies.    On behalf of workers', ACFTU "warmly" supports the pilot  project, said Wang Chidong, Deputy Director of the Grass-Roots  Work Department of ACFTU.    In such a system, trade unions have an even bigger role to  play, said Wang.    The workers should enjoy the freedom to attend and organize  trade unions.    They are also entitled to sign labour contracts with the  company on the basis of free will and equality, to express  disagreement on management policies and criticize managers, and  to enjoy reasonable pay, work hours, labour safety, professional  training, labour insurance, and welfare.    In the 100 enterprises, trade unions are given authority to  negotiate with the representatives of the board on labour  disputes.</p>

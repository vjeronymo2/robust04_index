			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Letter: Another measure of Hungary's creditworthiness Sir, I congratulate Nicholas Denton and the Financial Times for the comprehensiveness and insight of the article, 'A kiss of life from across the border' (April 21). However, while the article presented the most pertinent issues in their complexities, it failed to extract one key issue. From economic or credit perspective analysis, rather than citing just the per capita indebtedness. A more relative and demonstrative measure of Hungary's creditworthiness emerges through the application of the debt/service ratio. Hungary was able almost to double its hard currency export in about a year, which contributed significantly to reducing the debt/service ratio to less than 40 per cent at the end of 1991. Moreover, the net debt has also bean reduced to Dollars 13bn in this year, while inflation was kept at below the 30 per cent level. Finally, industrial exports may prove less problematic with low wages, yet the existing high science-education level in Hungary is the relevant factor for the future.

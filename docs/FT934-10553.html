			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Amsterdam rises as Akzo exceeds expectations THE Continental accent switched again yesterday, as Frankfurt subsided and Amsterdam extended this week's relative strength, writes Our Markets Staff. AMSTERDAM was surprised and generally wrong-footed as Akzo's third quarter results exceeded expectations. The chemicals group soared nearly 7 per cent, closing Fl 13.30 higher at Fl 194.20, helping the the CBS Tendency index to a gain of 2.3 or 1.7 per cent at 140.0. Most analysts had been expecting Akzo to show profits of between Fl 120m-Fl 140m, up from Fl 162m. Instead, the company turned in Fl 169m and, said Mr Shaw Bridges, European chemicals analyst at Merrill Lynch, the figures revealed that the management had come to grips with priorities like restructuring measures. According to other analysts, Akzo's announcement suggested that the bottom had now been reached in its decline and that it was well placed to reap the benefits once Europe emerged from recession. The results had been helped, they added, by a stronger dollar and improvement in the PVC market. DSM was pulled along in Akzo's wake, adding Fl 2.30 to Fl 105.30. KLM and Philips are due to report today and some analysts commented that a set of good results from both could be in store. KLM, which remains subject to gains and losses on rumours surrounding the progress or otherwise of the Alcazar talks - an announcement may come this weekend - rose Fl 1.90 to Fl 41.90. Philips put on Fl 1.00 to Fl 40.30. FRANKFURT registered an intraday high of 2,101.60, but the DAX index fell back to close 11.22 lower at 2,084.36 after Tuesday's 33.46 gain. Turnover declined from DM11.1bn to DM8.9bn. Dealers fell back on sector rotation, moving to construction, one of the few areas where prices are not at their high for the year. Strabag Bau jumped DM19.00 to DM610.00 and Bilfinger &amp; Berger by DM25.00 to DM942.00; Hochtief put on DM37.00, or 3.4 per cent to DM1,123.00 and Holzmann byDM38.00, or 4.1 per cent to DM967.00. Among blue-chips, Daimler reacted to Tuesday's news of a possible dividend cut by falling DM9 to DM743, but Volkswagen, strongly higher on Monday and Tuesday, shed proportionately more, closing DM7.50 down at DM400. PARIS was little changed on the day, the CAC-40 index rising just 1.45 to 2,171.16. Peugeot generated some interest in reaction to a rise in third quarter turnover, reported after Tuesday's close, and the shares advanced FFr23 to FFr669, still some 5.2 per cent down from the year's high recorded in mid-August. James Capel remains bearish on the vehicle group: Mr Bob Barber noted that in spite of a good month in July, when sales benefited from the availability of diesel versions of two popular models, the following two months revealed a loss of market share. He concluded that fourth quarter results would be disappointing, should this trend continue. MILAN felt constrained by political uncertainties ahead of local elections on November 21 and worries about the budget's passage through parliament; the Comit index eased 0.94 to 578.68. Olivetti tried to pick up some of Tuesday's declines before the shares again turned lower, down L18 at L1,730. Fiat shed L144 to L1,730 on arbitrage trade with the rights. ZURICH survived a late bout of profit-taking to finish at another record high, the SMI index adding 7.0 to 2,749.9. The insurance sector continued to benefit from Winterthur's forecast on Tuesday of higher full-year profits. Winterthur added SFr13 to SFr862. SBC rose SFr3 to SFr499 in response to its forecast of substantially higher full year profits. Swissair added SFr28 to SFr725 as its chief executive was quoted as saying there could be a breakthrough in the Alcazar talks by the end of the week. DUBLIN advanced 1.6 per cent to a new year high, the ISEQ overall index rising 28.93 to 1,849.27. The market has been driven higher in recent days by Smurfit on expectations of an improved pricing structure in the US paper and packaging sector. Its shares added 12p or 5 per cent to IPounds 2.52. Nordic forestry stocks rose sharply, by 5.4 per cent in STOCKHOLM on the view that the sector had underperformed the broad market, and by 3.9 per cent in HELSINKI in a direct response to the industry's price rise plans. Swedish equities were lifted, additionally, by lower bond yields, the Affarsvarlden General index rising 19.30 to a new high of 1,443.30; in Finland, the Hex index peaked 38.3, or 2.4 per cent higher at 1,607.7.

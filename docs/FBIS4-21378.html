Obviously, the percentage should be lower in ecologically sound  regions and much higher in zones of ecological problems and  crises (and at least 15 percent of Russia's territory falls into  these categories). It is also obvious that someone must take  responsibility for health impairments beyond the citizen's  control.    Finally, it is also obvious that the protracted absence of  state concern for this connection between the state of public  health and the state of the environment has led to one of the  most substantial threats to national security because the  average lifespan--one of the general statistical indicators of  national health--has been plunging disastrously since 1986.    When we say that the state must defend the rights and  freedoms of the individual and that individual rights are above  all other rights and freedoms, we are also referring to the now  constitutionally secured right to compensation for health  impairments resulting from the deterioration of environmental  quality.    At the beginning of 1992, just after the Russian Federation  laws "On Sanitary-Epidemiological Welfare" and "On Environmental  Protection" were passed, it became obvious that the exercise of  the right of citizens, declared in these laws, to compensation  for health impairments caused by environmental factors would  require additional legal and analytical work. We need standards  and rules stipulating the actions that victims can take to  protect themselves from the unfair judicial actions of polluting  enterprises. What these victims need even more, however, is  reliable proof that a specific impairment is caused directly by  the pollution of the environment from a specific source. Without  this information, they cannot expect a court to hear the case  and rule in favor of the injured party. As a result of the  intense work of a team of specialists, mainly connected with  Gossanepidnadzor [State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological  Oversight] and begun in spring 1992 under the auspices of the  Russian Presidential Council on Ecological Policy, a set of  standards and rules was drafted. The draft has already been  "under discussion" in the Ministry of Justice and Ministry of  Economics for more than a year, and the end of this process is  not in sight. I can appreciate the difficulties this kind of  deliberation entails: This document would grant citizens rights  comparable to the right to protect personal inviolability and  the right to own property.    In view of these difficulties, a decision was made to enlist  the aid of epidemiologists in the codification of the effects of  specific environmental pollutants on various health  indicators--in a format suitable for a judicial hearing.    It was not possible to achieve all of these goals: The  information that is being published today sometimes sounds more  like a scientific treatise than the anticipated set of  guidelines, but even the results to date are important enough to  publish. The effects of other ecological factors of human origin  on human health--chemicals, as well as noise, radiation, and  others--will also be analyzed in the future. We hope that this  research will eventually be recognized as the official set of  standards and guidelines.    Armed with an awareness of the general state of affairs  and the effects of pollution on his own health and the health of  his children and grandchildren, each individual will choose his  own method of avoiding this potential danger--by leaving the  zone affected by the pollutant or be uniting with other affected  citizens and forcing the polluter (through various channels,  including judicial proceedings) to stop the pollution.    Therefore, the report that is being published today was  written, on the one hand, for the public--to inform each citizen  and offer more effective protection of the right of each citizen  to a healthy environment--and, on the other, for the  administrators and owners of sources (irrespective of forms of  ownership) of dangerous chemical pollution, so that they will  stop the hazardous emissions and dumping without waiting for  legal judgments against them.    We wish to thank the newspaper and its special  "Prescription"  supplement for this publication--it is addressed to literally  each person in Russia.    An applied science conference will be held soon on "Problems  of Public Rehabilitation in Zones of Ecological Damage." The  conference will be held by an association of trade unions in  regions with unhealthy ecological conditions and by the  International Fund for Socioecological Aid. Through the efforts  of these organizations, the participants in the conference  should receive our report in the form of a brochure to be used  as a guide for action. These may just be the first tentative  steps, but they are signs of progress....</p>

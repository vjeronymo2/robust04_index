			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Italy has the highest number of AIDS-infected [as  received] babies in Europe, with 397 cases reported to present.  This information comes from "The Italian Register of HIV Cases  in Pediatrics," founded in 1985.    This was discussed at the "Biotechnology and AIDS"  convention  in Florence. The high number of pediatric cases is due to  infection between drug addicts and among heterosexuals.  HIV-positive mothers have given birth to 2,700 babies. [passage  omitted]</p>

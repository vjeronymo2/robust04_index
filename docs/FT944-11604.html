			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Saudis reject US arms base Saudi Arabia has refused to accept basing of arms for US troops who might again be sent to the Gulf, but the US will press the Saudis to reverse that position, a senior US defence official said yesterday. The official also said Kuwait would pay the largest share of the estimated Dollars 600m cost of a recent US military build-up in the Gulf against Iraq, but that Washington also expected Saudi Arabia to help pay the bill. Kuwait and Qatar have each agreed to provide basing for enough tanks and other supplies for a US brigade and the Pentagon is searching for a base in the region for enough equipment for a third brigade. The Saudis currently provide basing for dozens of US military aircraft but have been reluctant to accept supplies for American ground troops because of opposition to such a move by Moslem fundamentalists.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, June 28 (AFP) -- Libyan leader Mu'ammar  al-Qadhdhafi is prepared to hand over to Egypt two men suspected  in the Lockerbie bombing provided they are not tried in either  the United States or Britain, Egyptian papers reported Tuesday  [28 June].    Al-Qadhdhafi told journalists late Monday that he had agreed  with Egyptian President Husni Mubarak "to transfer the two  suspects to Egypt" during meetings between the two leaders in  Libya.    "Egypt would then be responsible for them and would  guarantee  to transfer them to the place fixed for their trial,"  al-Qadhdhafi said, stressing that any trial would have to be  "elsewhere other than the United States and Great Britain."    The two men are accused of being behind the bombing of a  Pan-Am Boeing which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, in  December 1988, killing 270 people.    Al-Qadhdhafi said an Arab League proposal for Scottish  magistrates to try the men in the International Court of Justice  in The Hague have been well received in the West.    But Washington and London have both rejected the idea,  saying  the United Nations had called for the men to be extradited for  trial either in the United States or in Britain.    "It seems a solution has been found" and that the proposal  "will be submitted as a resolution to the UN Security Council  for adoption," al-Qadhdhafi said.    He said the proposal was backed by Egypt and the  Organisation  of African Unity as well as the Arab League.    UN sanctions have been imposed on Libya following its  refusal  to handover the men and those involved in the bombing of a  French private plane over Niger in 1989 which killed 170 people.</p>

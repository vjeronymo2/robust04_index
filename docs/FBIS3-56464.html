Other business people told ITAR-TASS about their anxiety  over  the growing instability on the Russian market, which will  inevitably follow the resignation of Yegor Gaydar from the post  of first deputy prime minister.    In the opinion of Mikhail Dunin, vice president of the  Moscow  Commodity Exchange, "Gaydar's resignation will trigger panic at  commodity and stock exchanges, as a result of which the dollar  exchange rate may reach 1,500 - 1,600 roubles before the end of  January." The growth of the dollar exchange rate will  "automatically lead to another round of inflation, to the growth  of prices, including hard currency prices." Dunin stated with  regret that "hopes for the stabilisation of the situation on the  Russian market, that emerged after December 12, are not coming  true, which may enhance the prestige of Zhirinovskiy." Aside  from it Dunin, the same as other business people, complained  that "endless cataclysms in the Russian Government do not allow  business people to implement long-term programmes, because the  unpredictable character of the policy, pursued by the Cabinet of  Ministers, does not make it possible to forecast the situation  on the Russian market."    Oleg Vinogradov, chairman of the board of directors of the  Mosexpo joint-stock company, regards Gaydar's announcement of  his resignation as an "untimely step". He accused the first  deputy prime minister of giving up the attempts to form a  government, which would guarantee the continuation of the  reform."    Sergey Popov, adviser to the president of the Association of  Russian Banks, has an opinion of his own about Gaydar's  statement. He believes that Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, a possible  successor of Gaydar on the post of first deputy prime minister,  "is more adequate to Russian realities." Popov likes  Yavlinskiy's desire to get from the prime minister the  guarantees of the implementation of a clear programme of actions  and to take upon himself the responsibility for the reform  course.</p>

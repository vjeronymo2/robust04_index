			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 13 (YONHAP) -- Chongwadae, the  presidential office, Wednesday handed down to all government  offices a set of measures to better produce or secure  specialized personnel with a view to building up the nation's  overall international competitiveness.    Yi Eui-kon, senior presidential secretary for government  affairs, said the steps had been prepared after confusion  surfaced in key government programs such as Uruguay Round  negotiations and dealing with the North Korean nuclear question.    "All government offices are expected to work out detailed  programs based on the steps to secure specialized manpower on  their own," Yi said.    The measures given by Chongwadae include the idea of  restructuring public officials training programs in a way that  gives more emphasis on the training of specialized personnel,  and sending more public officials to international organizations  for temporary duties there.    Another measure calls for the rotation of officials among  externally related offices like the Economic Planning Board,  Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry and Foreign Ministry.    Also under one of the measures, special allowances are to be  given to qualified recruits to reduce wage gap between public  officials and private industry people.</p>

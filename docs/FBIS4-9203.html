			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with presidential adviser Ivic Pasalic by Tihomir </F> Dujmovic; place and date not given: "Manolic Convicted Himself"]    [Text] The time has come for those who have adhered  to firm communist positions, as well as those who have adhered  to extreme right-wing positions, to give way to those who will  build Croatia and the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community] on  centrist positions. Accordingly, one can speak of a certain  decommunization of Croatia in both the state administration and  the ruling structure.    Josip Manolic's departure from all duties in the ruling  Croatian political party is certainly one of the biggest  personnel changes in the Croatian state since its emergence.  That is why we asked Ivic Pasalic, the republic president's  adviser on domestic policy and a member of the HDZ Presidency,  and the party's new "personnel officer," as some better informed  journalists claim, for a more detailed interpretation of  Manolic's departure.    [Dujmovic] Why did Josip Manolic have to leave? Are the  newspaper analyses correct which are emphasizing three possible  reasons for Manolic's departure these days: the open conflict  with Gojko Susak, the revival of the old divisions between the  winners and losers from 1945--which was mentioned in one of  Manolic's controversial interviews--or a real and open conflict  with the republic president?    [Pasalic] Josip Manolic did not have to leave. Everything  that has happened is his choice, and the motives are primarily  known to him personally. The decision on removing Mr. Manolic  from his party duties clearly cites the reasons, namely  disagreement with the HDZ's policy. In the last few months, on  several occasions he has publicly, as a party official,  expressed positions contrary to the established party policy and  to the decisions of central party policy. Since Mr. Manolic even  said very clearly at the last meeting of the HDZ Presidency that  he was not retreating from his political positions, and he did  not accept a compromise offer from President Tudjman (that he  would remain an HDZ deputy in the Chamber of Parishes, but not  its president), the decision that was adopted by the party  leadership is completely logical and based on the HDZ Statute. I  am mentioning this because this does not have anything to do  with any sort of personal conflicts, or conflicts between the  "left" and "right," but rather an attempt to impose a parallel  policy contrary to the one conducted by the president and the  HDZ Presidency.    [Dujmovic] What is the difference between the political  positions of Mr. Manolic and the HDZ Presidency? Manolic is  stubbornly emphasizing that he advocates a law-governed state,  an integral Bosnia-Herzegovina....    [Pasalic] Those are mere political phrases. Every policy  occurs in a specific time and area, and is governed by domestic  and international circumstances. When someone says now that he  advocated an integral Bosnia-Herzegovina, then the following  question arises: Who did not advocate an integral  Bosnia-Herzegovina? The HDZ's fundamental goal, very clearly  expressed in the first multiparty elections, was the  establishment of an independent and sovereign Croatian state. At  the same time, our policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina was  conducted by ensuring the strategic interests of the Croatian  state, and by ensuring for the Croatian people in  Bosnia-Herzegovina the rights of an equal constituent people  within the internal order of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a complex  state, without calling into question Bosnia-Herzegovina's  territorial integrity. The situation, however, was such that it  was questionable how that policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina could  be carried out, especially since the solution to that problem  did not depend and still does not depend solely on Croatian  political positions and interests. Therefore, there simply had  to be a back-up possibility in circumstances in which the  Muslims wanted to create their own state, in which the Serbs did  so, and in the event that the international community adopted  different solutions. Croatia was simply in a situation in which  it also had to be prepared for that possibility. In spite of all  that, in all the international plans that were offered Croatia  did not aim for a single moment at the partition of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. We accepted Cutilheiro's plan, the  Vance-Owen plan, and the plan for Bosnia-Herzegovina as a union  of republics, but we did not want to accept in any way the  establishment of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a civil (Muslim) state.  Consequently, when Mr. Manolic wants to show today that the  policy of an integral Bosnia-Herzegovina is "his" policy,  contrary to any other policy, then it is obviously just throwing  dust in people's eyes.    [Dujmovic] When it is said that Manolic was in conflict with  the established state policy, what, specifically, does that mean?    [Pasalic] Consequently, if we are talking about  Bosnia-Herzegovina, then the conflict is evident in the fact  that Mr. Manolic, in all his statements in the last few months,  has said that Croatian policy turned around after Washington,  and "that that policy first had to run up against a wall" and  only then could be changed. You see, that is quite incorrect; it  is petty politics, and in the end, it is directly contrary to  the policy that we really did conduct toward Bosnia-Herzegovina.  We conducted a principled but realistic policy in the given  framework. Consequently, that assessment of Manolic's is simply  not true. Furthermore, at the Presidency meeting, Josip Manolic  took Mr. Susak solely as a symbol of that mistaken policy in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Consequently, if Mr. Susak is only a symbol  of a mistaken policy, that means that the president of the  Republic is conducting a mistaken policy! Accordingly, he spoke  out directly against the policy that President Tudjman is  conducting! All of the statements made by Manolic in support of  this were incorrect, and this was simply a case of manipulating  the facts. Next, Mr. Manolic was also stating that he advocated  a law-governed state. Putting the matter that way indicates that  the Croatian state leadership presumably does not advocate a  law-governed state, and that the Croatian authorities are  opposing it!? In one interview, Manolic said that the  perpetrators of crimes are not prosecuted in Croatia, and that  the state has a tolerant attitude toward violence, smuggling,  drugs, and planting explosives, which is untrue, which can be  verified, after all, by comparing the data of the Interior  Ministry, the State Attorney's Office, and the courts.    Furthermore, Mr. Manolic was the prime minister, he was  chief  of the Office for Protection of the Constitutional Order, from  the beginning of the party's establishment he was the vice  president of the HDZ, and if we are talking about a law-governed  state, it is precisely Mr. Manolic who was in the most sensitive  positions, where a law-governed state had to be realized.  Accordingly, even if what Mr. Manolic is saying is true, then  that also indicates his own irresponsibility, since for three  years he was in jobs that regulated those issues. In one  interview, I think directly before leaving the position of head  of the Office for Protection of the Constitutional Order, he  stated that he was not satisfied with the military and civilian  police! But that was his job then! The third thing that Mr.  Manolic is talking about is his disagreement with how the party  was being led. You see, the HDZ's supreme party body is the  party congress. At the last congress the HDZ's statute and  program were adopted, and arguments and different political  solutions and different personnel solutions could be confronted  and clarified at that congress. At that congress President  Tudjman openly invited Mr. Manolic, as the alleged head of the  so-called left wing in the party, and Mr. Seks, as the alleged  head of the so-called right wing in the party, to campaign  openly as candidates opposing President Tudjman, if they did not  agree with the declared policy. Accordingly, if Mr. Manolic  thought that that policy was not the policy that was backed by  the membership at large, then he could have verified that by  presenting himself as a rival candidate. He did not, however.  The congress occurred partly because an atmosphere of dissension  had started to be created within the party, and when a program  is adopted at the congress, then the only thing left is to carry  it out, or else to leave the party.    [Dujmovic] Manolic is mostly criticizing the conduct of the  policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina. Talking about the Washington  agreement, he is expressing fear that people will start to  obstruct it. After all, the opposition is also emphasizing that  the same people cannot support a Bosnia-Herzegovina union and a  cantonal Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that personnel replacements are  logical.    [Pasalic] Those are all political insinuations. The  Washington agreement was signed by President Tudjman on behalf  of Croatia, and by Kresimir Zubak on behalf of the leadership of  the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina. What are the arguments that  would indicate anyone's opposing implementation of that  agreement? Accordingly, this assessment of his once again  suffers from a lack of arguments, but unfortunately, in some  political circles it will be interpreted as a statement by  someone who was at the very top of the Croatian government. Even  though that assessment is completely wrong, it can inflict both  damage and problems on Croatian interests. With respect to  Herceg-Bosna, for the most part the same people there have been  conducting policy since 1990, and as the political situation  changed, because both the Serbs, the Muslims, and the  international community changed their positions, they also had  to adapt to that. The whole problem is that he is stubbornly  insinuating that there has now been some sort of reversal in  policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina, and from that fundamental  distorted viewpoint he is deriving conclusions that necessarily  have to be wrong.    [Dujmovic] Is is true that at the HDZ Presidency meeting the  departure of Mesic, Greguric, and Valentic was mentioned?    [Pasalic] That is completely untrue; there was not a word  about it. Of course, all the Presidency members, in their  statements, supported the established party policy and appealed  to Mr. Manolic to take a reasonable step.    [Dujmovic] How do you view the assessment that this is the  beginning of a schism in the HDZ?    [Pasalic] Those are the wishes of certain people who want to  strengthen their own political position in that way, but  unfortunately for them, and fortunately for the HDZ and Croatia,  none of the preconditions for that to happen exist. It is worth  noting, however, that different political and interest groups  have attempted and are attempting to bring about a schism within  the HDZ. Their goal is to bring about a split within the  parliamentary majority in order to achieve a different balance  of power and a different parliamentary majority in the Assembly.  Then they would probably either aim at early elections or at  changing the constitutional position of the president of the  Republic. Certain opposition parties have held this political  platform, and even made plans to cause such a situation. The  immediate occasion for carrying out those plans was supposed to  be a universal staged uproar, even within the HDZ, over the  failed policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina. Those who are more  intelligent and politically experienced enough gave up those  ideas, because of the obvious successes of Croatian state  policy, but some people are obviously on a path of no return and  are still acting in accordance with the planned scenario. The  HDZ came out of the second general congress stronger, the  membership fully accepted the program, and the parliamentary  majority is completely stable. The proof is the voting in the  deputies' club in the Chamber of Parishes, where 36 deputies  were in favor of replacing Mr. Manolic as president of the  Chamber of Parishes, and only three were opposed. Of those  three, two deputies clearly stated that they would respect the  party decision and vote for replacement at the meeting of the  Chamber of Parishes. Certainly the HDZ majority in the Chamber  of Deputies is absolutely stable, and thus those estimates that  about 30 HDZ deputies would go over to certain other political  options turned out to be completely wrong. Accordingly, there is  no schism in the HDZ, there is no parliamentary crisis, and  there will be no early elections.    [Dujmovic] That would mean that the newspaper ideas about  the  possible counterbalancing departure of Minister Susak are  unfounded?    [Pasalic] The defense minister enjoys the confidence of the  republic president, and thus I do not see any arguments in favor  of those ideas.    [Dujmovic] I would like to go back to the functioning of a  law-governed state. The fact is that every day we can follow  some sort of financial scandal in the press. In spite of what is  occasionally quite solid proof of financial embezzlement, I have  not yet heard of anyone being held accountable. If everyone in  the leadership really is equally supportive of a law-governed  state, how is that phenomenon possible?    [Pasalic] I would like to see any solid proof of  embezzlement  that has not been followed by sanctions. Specifically, we have  insinuations and slanders among our political public before  those issues come to trial, and even before an investigation is  conducted. I maintain that the law-governed state is  functioning, while one has to take into account the conditions  in which we are living and the situation that we inherited.    [Dujmovic] So there is no financial embezzlement in Croatia?    [Pasalic] I did not say that. After all, there is no country  in the world where those things do not happen.    [Dujmovic] For several days now, the slightly improbably  news  has been spreading in Croatian political circles that there is a  certain list of internationally objectionable Croatian  politicians, a list that was compiled at the Vatican. Is there  any truth to that?    [Pasalic] No, I am hearing that for the first time. It is  well-known what His Holiness the Pope has said on several  occasions and it is known that he sent a thank-you letter to  President Tudjman. Possibly someone might draw certain  conclusions from that, because it says that it is difficult for  the new democratic states to establish themselves on the ruins  of atheistic socialism. Perhaps this part sends certain hidden  messages to some people, and they can draw certain conclusions  from it, but there are no lists that came from the Vatican with  the names of objectionable Croatian politicians. But, you see,  we really have created a state on the ruins of atheistic  socialism. The idea of the reconciliation of all Croats,  however, has been woven into the foundations of the creation of  Croatia, and that must not be forgotten. At the same time, those  who have adhered to firm communist positions, as well as those  who have adhered to extreme right-wing positions, have to be  told that the time has come when those who have not accepted the  HDZ's centrist policy have to give way to those who will build  Croatia and the HDZ on centrist positions. Accordingly, one can  also speak of a certain decommunization of Croatia in both the  state administration and the government structure.    [Dujmovic] It is also said that Manolic's departure is the  outcome of a conflict between the Drava basin and Herzegovina  lobbies.    [Pasalic] Those are political terms by which people have  tried to depict the situation within the party for a long time.  That is said because those whose positions have not been  accepted choose stories about lobbies in order to obscure the  essence of the problem.    [Dujmovic] Does Ivic Pasalic belong to the Herzegovina  lobby?    [Pasalic] No, Ivic Pasalic does not belong to any lobby.    [Dujmovic] How much truth is there in the rumors that Mr.  Mesic could also leave his position, in view of the similarity  between his views and Manolic's?    [Pasalic] I would not like to be a prophet, but I personally  think that it will not happen. Specifically, my opinion is that  there will not be any sort of chain reactions, as people want to  insinuate now, and instead I think that we will all learn  certain political lessons from these circumstances.    [Dujmovic] Taking into account the way in which negotiations  are being conducted with representatives of the Serbs in the  UNPA's [UN Protected Areas], as well as Churkin's idea of a  "state within a state," doesn't it seem to you that a back-door  attempt is being made to impose the federalization of the state  upon Croatia? Specifically, even the U.S. representative is  talking about the UNPAs as an area with "significant" autonomy.    [Pasalic] With respect to the Croatian areas under UN  protection, there are certainly different desires: from Greater  Serbia to the confederalization of Croatia. The Croatian  position is quite clear, however: Any sort of federalization or  confederalization of Croatia is out of the question. It is the  territory of the Republic of Croatia, and we will do everything  possible to return those parts to Croatia's constitutional and  legal order through political negotiations.    [Dujmovic] On several occasions, Mr. Galbraith has  diplomatically and cautiously mentioned his own impressions that  the Serbs are particularly bothered that they have been "left  out of the constitution." In the context of these negotiations  with the Serbs, is it possible that the Croatian constitution  may be changed along those lines?    [Pasalic] No, that is out of the question, because the Serbs  cannot be a constituent people in Croatia.</p>

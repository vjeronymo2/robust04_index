			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Winnebago Industries Goes to 4-Day Week: With a gasoline rebate offer yet to  recharge stalled motor-home sales, the Forest City, Iowa, company has cut back  to a four-day work week and says it will begin laying off white-collar workers.  Sheila Davis, a Winnebago spokeswoman, said company factories in the Iowa  communities of Forest City, Hampton and Lorimor have been on Monday-to-Thursday  schedules since last week. Later this week, an austerity program will be  announced that will include layoffs among 800 office workers, supervisors and  executives, she said.  </P></p>

			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Technology: British science sells well International investment in UK science amounts to an 'invisible export' worth about Pounds 1.4bn a year, the House of Lords science committee says today. In 1992-93, the last year for which figures are available, overseas companies paid Pounds 1.1bn for industrial research and development in the UK. In addition, universities received Pounds 135m in research grants and contracts and Pounds 130m in fee income from science students. The Lords found that overseas funding of British science rose sharply during the 1980s and reached a peak of Pounds 1.6bn in 1990-91. The decline over the following two years was partly due to 'increased competition from other countries, particularly Pacific Rim countries which are rapidly building up their R&amp;D facilities', says Lord Walton of Detchant, committee chairman. International investment does not normally feature in science policy discussions, and the Lords found it difficult to gather reliable evidence for their inquiry. In particular, they failed to come up with a corresponding figure for UK spending on science abroad, though, Lord Walton says, 'our feeling is that investment coming in from overseas is greater than the amount going out'. The Lords found the issue to be controversial. 'There are those who say that by locating R&amp;D facilities in the UK, making research contracts with British universities, and placing sponsored professors and research students in leading departments, foreign countries and companies are engaged in 'overseas exploitation of UK brains'.' The report rejects that argument and concludes that foreign investment in UK science should be encouraged, with more programmes to encourage scientific links with Asian countries in particular. 'The future of British science lies in free trade, not protectionism,' it says. International Investment in UK Science, HMSO, Pounds 12.95.</p>

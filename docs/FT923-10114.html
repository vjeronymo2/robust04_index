			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: Sharp decline in Fokus Bank losses FOKUS Bank, Norway's third biggest bank, yesterday reported a sharp fall in half-year losses, before extraordinary items, to NKr165m (Dollars 28.3m) from NKr919.8m. But it warned that this autumn it would seek up to NKr800m in fresh state support. Fokus was de-listed from the Oslo bourse and acquired by the state last December in a rescue operation, after its share capital had been wiped out by large losses. Mr Leif Klevan, managing director, said that a call for fresh funds should not be seen as a dramatic move as the bank would have last year sought more capital, had the state-owned bank insurance fund had more capital at its disposal. The fund last December also transfered capital to Den norske Bank (DnB), Norway's biggest bank and Christiana Bank, the second biggest bank. Fokus reduced half-year credit losses to NKr377.9m from NKr902.4m. Mr Klevan said that the volume of non-performing loans had been slightly reduced in the first half but he cautiously forecast that they were likely to remain on the same level in the second half. Operating costs fell to NKr654m from NKr799.1m last year but Mr Klevan said that cost-cutting measures already implemented would begin to benefit the bank by the end of the year.</p>

			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Rao reshapes cabinet to silence critics MR PV Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, began to reshuffle his government at the weekend in an attempt to bolster his authority following criticism of his handling of the Ayodhya mosque crisis. Mr Rao is dismissing 14 of his 59-member Council of Ministers in the biggest mid-term reshuffle for more than a decade. Acting with uncharacteristic flamboyance, he disclosed his plan on Saturday night at a banquet - at which ministers were suddenly presented with resignation letters and asked to sign them on the spot. The prime minister was not expected to disclose the names of sacked ministers until today. However, the content of the reshuffle is expected to be considerably less dramatic than the manner in which it is being done; senior cabinet members likely to retain their portfolios include Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister and the chief architect of India's wide-ranging economic reform programme. The reshuffle is not, as opposition MPs were quick to point out, being accompanied by any policy announcements. By late last night the prime minister had not offered any new initiatives to heal the rifts caused by the inter-religious violence which has left at least 1,800 dead since Hindu militants tore down the mosque in the northern town of Ayodhya on December 6. About 600 people have died in the last two weeks in Bombay in an upsurge of violence, which was only brought under control by troops. The Bharatiya Janata party, the militant Hindu opposition whose supporters demolished the Ayodhya mosque, said the reshuffle was merely putting 'old wine into a new bottle'. Indian prime ministers frequently reshuffle ministerial jobs, occasionally to improve policy-making in a particular area but more often for party political reasons. The ruling Congress (I) party is composed of different regional, economic and social interest groups, with competing claims for power which the prime minister must try to balance. An economic report published at the weekend brought the prime minister some good news. The Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, forecast in a report that the economy could grow by 4 per cent in the year to June 1993 - about 0.5 percentage points above the government's target. The central bank forecast a 2 per cent increase in agricultural output and 4-5 per cent in industry.</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Nigerian petroleum boards are dissolved THE BOARDS of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and its four refining and distribution subsidiaries have been dissolved, removing the majority non-executive directors, the political appointees of ex-President Ibrahim Babangida. The decision is a sign that Nigeria's interim government, in its third week in office, intends to be more than a caretaker until next March and is trying to tackle some of the economy's most pressing problems. 'This is the beginning of new developments under the interim government,' an oil ministry official said. 'The direction is to more efficiency, especially in getting petroleum products to the people.' The interim government of Mr Ernest Shonekan has inherited an oil-producing industry unable to meet its cash commitments to foreign partners and a refining and distribution sector unable to supply enough fuel to the population. Nigeria has the largest oil reserves in Africa, the source of 90 per cent of its foreign earnings, and the biggest refining capacity in its region. Yet, since the aborted introduction this year of a new grade of petrol at 10 times the previous heavily subsidised cost, and a national oil workers' strike which paralysed the south of Nigeria until a week ago, long petrol queues have become common in Lagos. The marketing subsidiary PPMC sells petrol at about 2 US cents a litre, an estimated loss of revenue of Dollars 23.45 a barrel, or enough to cover last year's budget deficit. The refinery subsidiaries operated at around half their 400,000 barrels-a-day capacity. Smuggling to other African countries is estimated at more than 10,000 b/d. NNPC is about three months in arrears on cash calls for production and exploration, owing its joint venture partners about Dollars 450m (Pounds 292.2m), according to local estimates. In July NNPC sold a 5 per cent stake in its largest oil field, which produces about half the national output of 1.8m b/d, to Elf Aquitaine for around Dollars 500m to replace missing funds for a proposed liquefied natural gas project industry analysts doubt will ever take off.</p>

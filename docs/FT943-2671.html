			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Travel: Where only the Buddhas grow fat - Visitors to Burma must live with the knowledge that tourism provides currency to sustain its regime Mandalay, Rudyard Kipling's fabled city, has retained its drawing power. Its lyrical name, its status as Burma's last royal capital and its isolation from the rest of the world give it a tenacious hold over the traveller's imagination. But as the visitor jolts down the pot-holed road to the sprawling, dusty city, the enigmatic image gives way to something more sinister. 'Tatmadaw (the Burmese army) and the people crush the enemies of the union,' screams the slogan on the fort that was once the site of Mandalay's royal palace and now serves as the army's headquarters. It is an absurd but depressing reminder of the mentality of Burma's ruling junta, the State Law and Order Restoration Council, or SLORC. Having earned world opprobrium for a catalogue of human rights abuses and for repression of the democratic movement in the late 1980s, SLORC is sensitive about its image. Tour guides sign declarations that they will not talk about the government - a stricture enforced by government informers. Severe restrictions are imposed on tourists' freedom of movement. For all that, only the most blinkered tourist would fail to notice evidence of the people's suffering. For example, any visitor would be struck by the peculiarity of the Burmese currency, which is chiefly denominated in 45 and 90-kyat notes. The 50 and 100-kyat notes were abolished, without any warning, by the government a few years ago. This attempt to damage the black economy cost many people their life savings. The signs of government repression are noticeable even in sparsely-populated parts of Burma such as Pagan, an eerily beautiful, pagoda-studded city which has been largely deserted since it was sacked by the army of Kublai Khan in 1287. Its crumbling remains of over 2,000 temples and pagodas, which were erected by Burma's rulers 900 years ago, form one of the most remarkable historical sites in Asia. Until four years ago, the village of Pagan was situated by the main temples on the plain. But at the time of the elections in 1990, the villagers were ordered - without warning - to leave their village and move five miles down the road. 'We lost everything,' said one villager, gesticulating at the flimsy wooden shack he now calls home. This was not an isolated incident. In recent years, the government has evicted hundreds of thousands of people from their homes and moved them into shanty towns. The government's motive in these apparently pointless clearances is generally regarded to be revenge on areas which opposed it. Travelling around the country, tourists become acutely aware of the Burmese people's appetite for even the most basic consumer goods. They are besieged with offers to trade old lipsticks, cigarette lighters and even the shirts off their backs for opium weights and hand-crafted lacquer-ware. Further evidence of the hardship of the life of the Burmese people is provided by visiting the markets which generally offer a meagre showing of rice, dried fish, fly-blown meat, chillies, peppers and fermented fish paste. The poverty of the people is evidence of the mismanagement of a country which has sunk from being one of the richest countries in Asia to being one of its poorest - in spite of its natural wealth of rice, rubies, teak and oil. Burma's lack of development creates a sense of being in a time warp. Transport in Burma is largely confined to ox-carts, pony traps, bicycles and Jeeps left over from the second world war. Older British makes of motor vehicles, such as Hillman and Triumph, are spoken of with the enthusiasm usually reserved for the latest model. 'British cars are the best-made cars in the world,' said a tour guide solemnly. To the tourist, however, Burma's backwardness and isolation undoubtedly contribute to its beauty and charm. Travelling in Burma leaves indelible impressions of faded colonial grandeur, of gilded temples, of golden rivers snaking through paddy fields and of haughty cheroot-smoking women who pattern their faces with pale yellow make-up made from ground bark. Also striking is the exuberance of the people's religion. Burma is one of the world's most devoutly Buddhist countries, where nearly all men become monks for some part of their lives and most people donate a large proportion of their income to the temples. People's generosity is such that Buddhas grow fat with ever-increasing layers of gold leaf, while the temples' exteriors are kept glistening with gold and jewels. Burma's most important temple, the Shwedagon Pagoda in Rangoon, is plated with 8,688 solid gold slabs, with a tip set with 5,448 diamonds, 2,317 rubies, sapphires and topaz and topped with a huge emerald. However seriously religion is taken, it remains a noisy, fun affair. The atmosphere of the temples sometimes resembles that of fairgrounds, with disco-like neon lights dotted around the Buddha images, loudspeakers noisily demanding donations and a variety of astrologers, fortune-tellers and games of the sort that promise good luck if the player succeeds in throwing coins into bowls. Perhaps the most bizarre aspect of Burmese religion is the emphasis on spirit-worship. Burma has 37 of these spirits, which boast names like the Lady Bandy Legs, or the Lord of Five Elephants. Temple grounds often have an array of statues of these spirits, which are worshipped with an enthusiasm that stems from a belief that they will do mischief to those who do not pay them sufficient respect. The country's backwardness makes travelling around the country something of an ordeal. Rat-infested, mildewed hotel rooms and erratic, accident-prone airplanes are part of most tours. In some respects, travel in Burma is now easier than it has been for some years. The country is relaxing some of the restrictions it imposed after the pro-democracy demonstrations of 1988. After several years of restricting visits to a maximum of seven days, visas are now valid for 14 days. But visitors still have to contend with the exorbitant cost of visiting Burma. The official exchange rate is arbitrarily set at a level so high that buying a beer costs more than Dollars 10. Many tourists prefer to take the risk of exchanging dollars or selling whisky on the black market, which makes their money go 15 times as far. But the value of such ruses is limited: it is hard to avoid paying hard currency for large items, such as travel and hotels. Visitors must live with the knowledge that tourism provides much of the hard currency that sustains the regime. But those whose curiosity overcomes their scruples are likely to be enthralled by a country which, as Kipling said, is 'quite unlike any land you know about'.</p>

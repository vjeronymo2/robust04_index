			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / International Company News: A battle of beer giants brews in Argentina - Brazil's Brahma is muscling in on Quilmes home territory IT IS high summer in the southern hemisphere, the peak season for beer drinkers. In Argentina, this summer will also mark the first battle between two beer giants, Argentina's Quilmes brewer and Brazil's Brahma. Brahma, which in September began trucking its beer in bottles all the way from Brazil, is already reckoned to hold about 1 per cent of the Argentine market, and is aiming for 3 to 4 per cent share over the next two years. Imports began surging into Argentina last summer, when trade liberalisation combined with local industry's lack of capacity, allowed foreign can sales to take about 3.5 per cent of the market. But consumers' initial excitement over a wealth of exotic new labels is fading, leaving Brahma and Quilmes to do battle alone. As well as defending its dominant 64 per cent of the market, Quilmes, whose Bermuda-based parent company is 15 per cent owned by Heineken of the Netherlands, also imports Heineken, sales of which are roughly equivalent to Brahma's. Mr Pedro Algorta, general manager of Quilmes' Argentine operating arm, says Brahma does not bother him much: 'When the consumer is doing well, the company does well. Our biggest project is to keep up with the demand.' Beer production in Argentina has risen by about 50 per cent to 7.98m hectolitres in 1991, from 5.45m hectolitres in 1986. Per head consumption of 24.6 litres a year is now comparable with other Latin countries. The Bermuda parent - most of whose sales are in Argentina - reported sales up 25 per cent in the first half of 1992 to Dollars 203.9m, and net income up only 2.6 per cent to Dollars 20.1m. It had sales of Dollars 364.3m for all 1991, up 34 per cent over 1990, while net income rocketed to Dollars 39.4m from Dollars 16.1m. It is adding capacity with a new Dollars 70m brewery and is building a Dollars 35m malting facility. It has invested Dollars 41m over the past five years in upgrading plant. Foreign analysts rate Quilmes's management highly, lauding its approach to widening margins by improving quality and introducing new technology rather than raising prices. Quilmes has spread itself abroad. Last year, it began tackling Chile's monopolised market with a brewery in Santiago and now claims 15 to 20 per cent of Chile's rapidly-growing market. Quilmes also owns small beer and soft drinks companies in Paraguay and Uruguay. Understandably, Mr Algorta is non-committal on the possibility of entering the troubled Brazilian market. But Quilmes could import Brazilian Kaiser beer into Argentina. Kaiser is owned by its ally Heineken and Brazilian Coca-Cola bottlers. Many Argentine beer executives are deeply suspicious of Brahma's arrival on the scene. They wonder how it can truck beer 1,600km to Buenos Aires and still make money. They claim that Brahma must be dumping beer that it cannot sell in its depressed home market, or is receiving covert subsidies. Mr Ingo Ostrovsky, Brahma's public affairs manager, tells a different story: 'Brazil always had a beer shortage, so we never had the opportunity of exporting. Now we have projects to increase capacity and dedicate ourselves to foreign markets. We would be exporting even without the crisis in Brazil. The original idea is to export 10 per cent of output to (neighbouring) countries.' He says rebates on most of the 151 per cent in taxes it pays on factory gate prices enable it to sell beer in Buenos Aires at about the same price as in Brazil. From a marketing point of view, Brahma is also helped by the fact its bottles are one-third smaller than those of its local competitors which means they sell for slightly less than Quilmes bottles of almost one litre even though Brahma's beer is actually more expensive. Brahma has started an advertising campaign and is working hard on supermarket outlets. It already knows the Argentine market well through its local partner, Londrina SA, with which it owns a malting plant in Buenos Aires province. Analysts speculate that if all goes well, Brahma will seek a firmer foothold in Argentina, possibly by buying a smaller breweries. That should not be too difficult. Brahma had net income of Dollars 73m on sales of Dollars 1.8bn in 1991, although sales this year are down by over 20 per cent. The advance of beer in Argentina has come at the cost of dwindling wine sales, with consumption halving to 50 litres per head in the last 20 years. The dwindling appeal of wine is forcing some wineries to diversify into beer and mineral waters. Mr Roberto Luka, managing director of winery Finca Flichman, started a sideline distributing German Beck's beer two years ago. This summer he will start selling American Coors beer. Flichman could well increase its presence in beer. That is a fine aspiration, but it will take many a long hard summer before it can take on Quilmes and Brahma.</p>

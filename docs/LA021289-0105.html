			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S. AFRICA DISPUTES VATICAN STUDY ON APARTHEID  </P> <P> The government said Saturday that a Vatican report condemning apartheid  misrepresents South Africa's racial policies.  </P> <P> The Foreign Affairs Department, in a statement, said it had not received a copy  of the 45-page Vatican document released earlier in the day.  </P> <P> "On the basis of what is known to us, (the document) misrepresents South  African government policy, clearly restated by the newly elected leader of the  governing party in his first parliamentary statement," the statement said,  referring to Education Minister F. W. de Klerk, recently elected to replace  ailing President Pieter W. Botha as leader of the National Party.  </P> <P> In a speech Wednesday, De Klerk called for an end to white-minority domination  and racial prejudice, although he reaffirmed the government's commitment to  segregation and made no mention of establishing black voting rights.  </P> <P> The Vatican document called apartheid "institutionalized racism . . . justified  by an ideology of the superiority of persons from European stock over those of  African or Indian origin."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the government banned all protest meetings intended to show  solidarity with an estimated 300 black detainees waging a hunger strike to  protest being held without charge. The order by Gen. Hendrik de Witt,  commissioner of police, specifically banned a meeting in Johannesburg by  lawyers from three anti-apartheid groups -- the National Assn. of Democratic  Lawyers, Lawyers for Human Rights and the Black Lawyers Assn.  </P></p>

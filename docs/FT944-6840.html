			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / People (Names in the News): Pierson to sit tight in Airbus cockpit There were rumours earlier this year that Jean Pierson, chief executive of Airbus Industrie, was going to eject from the cockpit of the world's second biggest aircraft maker, writes John Ridding. However, the decision to ask him to stay on for another three years suggests that Mr Airbus may at last be able to push through a long overdue shift to a less unwieldy corporate structure. By extending Pierson's contract until March 1988, shareholders of the four-nation aerospace consortium have opted not to change both the chairman and chief executive of Airbus in the same year. Daimler-Benz chairman Edzard Reuter took over as chairman of the Airbus supervisory board last March and the renewal of Pierson's contract not only reduces the risk of turbulence in the boardroom but maintains the balance between French and German interests in the consortium. Aerospatiale of France and Dasa of Germany both hold a 37.9 per cent stake, while British Aerospace owns 20 per cent and Spain's Casa owns 4.2 per cent. The maintenance of the Franco-German division of the top two positions was not a foregone conclusion. Germany, through Dasa, has been seeking to extend its influence in the day-to-day running of the company and had considered a reshuffle of the management. British Aerospace, Dasa and Pierson have argued that a shift towards the status of an ordinary limited company is increasingly necessary. It would increase the transparency of the organisation and promote greater efficiency. Airbus is not obliged to publish audited accounts and acts more as a marketing consortium whose members own the group's assets and share manufacturing contracts. Now that the 54-year old Pierson has been reconfirmed, one of his first tasks may be to push through a reform of Airbus's legal status as a GIE or groupement d'interet economique. Such a change would help Pierson in his principal challenge - closing the gap on Boeing. In this respect 1994 has started rather well, with Airbus winning orders for 69 new aircraft, or 55 per cent of the market for aircraft of more than 100 seats. As the consortium admits, however, this is a short time by the standards of the airline industry. It is also a short time in terms of Pierson's new tenure.</p>

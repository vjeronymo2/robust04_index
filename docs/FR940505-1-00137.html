			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commercial airline emission sources include aircraft, aircraft auxiliary power units (APUs), GSE, and any other mobile sources under the control of airlines. For the purposes of this regulation, emission sources defined as ``under the control'' of a commercial airline include all sources owned or leased by the airline, and all sources whose operations are controlled under a contract agreement by the airline (for example, GSE servicing an airline that are owned and operated by a fixed-base operator under contract to the airline). <FOOTCITE>74</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 74 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> General aviation aircraft operated at commercial airports will be included in the general aviation control strategy as described in section III.D.4.e(2)(d). Today's proposal for public aircraft operated at commercial airports is described in section III.D.4.e.(2)(e). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some GSE that service aircraft are owned by fixed based operators (FBOs) rather than airlines. Emissions from these vehicles must be included in the airport bubble since they are a direct result of aircraft activity. EPA proposes today to allocate these GSE to specific airlines based on servicing provided under contract agreements, and requests comment on possible alternatives to such an allocation strategy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA proposes a target-based emission reduction program for these commercial aircraft emission sources. Each commercial airline will be required to comply with a declining emission limit, expressed in allowable emissions per passenger and freight handled. The proposed target-based program will include emission fees assessed on any airline that fails to meet this emission rate target. The proposed target has been selected so that, even with expected passenger and freight growth, compliance with the target by all airlines will result in total emissions declining at a rate and to a level equivalent to that required of many stationary sources in the same basin. EPA will through experience raise the level of the emissions fees as needed to achieve such aggregate emission reductions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As described above, EPA currently intends to establish emission reduction requirements for commercial aircraft that are generally consistent with the emission cap requirements for stationary sources in the FIP areas. Although not firmly decided, the current stationary source control strategy for the South Coast requires that VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions be reduced by 20&hyph;45 and 30&hyph;45 percent, respectively, from the 1990 baseline inventory by 2005, through a series of uniform annual reductions of baseline emissions of each pollutant: 4&hyph;9 percent per year for VOC and 6&hyph;9 percent per year for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , both starting in 2001. Stationary source requirements for the 2006&hyph;2010 period have not been established at this time. The requirements for Ventura from 2001&hyph;2005 are identical to that for the South Coast.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For Sacramento, the strategy requires a VOC reduction of 20&hyph;45 percent, with a uniform annual reduction of 4&hyph;9 percent. The timeframe for achieving this reduction is the same as for the South Coast and Ventura areas (i.e., 2001&hyph;2005). The stationary source control strategy for Sacramento does not require a NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reduction since other actions will be adequate to achieve the area-wide NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions level needed for attainment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For this proposal, the overall reduction targets are expressed as a range of percentages; the final rule will contain a specific percentage reduction target. EPA requests comment on whether the stationary source emission reduction targets are appropriate for use with the commercial aircraft control strategy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Geographic Scope. As already described, today's proposal applies to all three affected California control areas: South Coast, Ventura, and Sacramento air basins. However, EPA requests comment on the desirability of removing the Ventura and Sacramento control areas from this commercial aircraft control strategy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The Sacramento air basin includes a single commercial airport. Aircraft emissions from this airport contributed significantly less than one percent of the air basin <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s total VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  baseline emissions inventory for 1990. Current projections show that if uncontrolled, this airport <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s emissions would consume less than one percent of the basin <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s allowable 2005 inventory for VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Additionally, the SIP and FIP for Sacramento are expected to achieve VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reductions adequate for attainment, not counting additional reductions from airports. This expectation is based on the best available, but still preliminary, analysis of current and future emissions. Further analysis may change the picture. Similarly, the Ventura control area has only minimal commercial aviation activity; an extensive emissions control program for the limited emissions resulting from such activity may not be desirable given the resource expenditure necessary for implementation. The Agency, therefore, requests comment on whether it is necessary to implement a commercial aviation control program in Sacramento and Ventura.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / World Trade News: EU hopes for Uruguay Round European Commission officials last night predicted that the EU would be able to ratify the Uruguay Round accord before the end of the year, ahead of the official deadline. The news will be welcomed by governments worried that the EU would not meet its side of the billion-dollar trade agreement on time. It will also send a positive signal to the US, whose own ratification procedures are hampered by uncertainty. An announcement by the European Court of Justice that it would give its opinion on who has the power to negotiate in certain trade areas on November 15 ended a dispute between the Council of Ministers and the Commission over the legal basis for ratification. Officials, who were not expecting the judgment so early, said this allowed enough time to ratify before January 1. It has also emerged that the Council of Ministers has agreed to send the necessary paperwork to the European parliament to allow it to be consulted ahead of the deadline. 'Both reasons make it all the more likely that we will come out in time,' said the Commission. The Commission asked the court for advice after member states argued that it did not have the authority to negotiate in areas such as services and intellectual property rights where no trans-EU legislation exists. Fears that the court would not produce a verdict early enough to meet the deadline prompted the German presidency of the EU to work out a code of conduct under which the Commission would for most purposes be able to conduct trade negotiations, leaving member states to have their say in a few special circumstances.</p>

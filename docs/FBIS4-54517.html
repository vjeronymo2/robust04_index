			<p>BFN     [Text] We have just received a statement from the 42d  session of the Presidential Council for Defense and National  Security. The council discussed the recent strikes.    Discussing the strike of the workers in the budget-financed  sector, the Presidential Council for Defense and National  Security established that there are problems -- to a large  extent inherited -- but that more effective action should be  taken to solve them. The council stresses that the government  has already prepared and proposed solutions, which should be  implemented as soon as possible because, for example, there is  an agreement that grades in the salaries of budget workers are  uneven and set without a regular pattern.    The council stresses that the Croatian Government and the  trade unions have no other aim or purpose than solving the basic  problems of the workers and all Croatian citizens, and trying to  find the best possible solution to the problem, as permitted by  the level of production. Better organized trade unions could  also contribute to this by better and more clearly defining the  specific problems and interests of different groups of workers.    The council believes that we are currently at a very  sensitive stage of the implementation of the stabilization  program, and that renouncing financial discipline and  interfering with the budget would destroy the stabilization  program.    In connection with this, despite opposition, it will be  necessary to discontinue further financing of permanently  loss-making enterprises, because of our commitment to a market  and not a planned economy. We are aware of the fact that in  certain instances this will cause turmoil. However, this is  necessary in order to establish an overall healthy economic  system. It should be stressed that the processes of economic  rehabilitation or bankruptcy are in fact the processes of  healing and recovery which ultimately lead to the creation of  new production and employment, which are the only things that  can improve the standard of living.    It was reiterated that Croatia as a welfare state would  secure full social benefits to all those who face difficulties  in these processes. The council praised the government for the  results it has achieved with its economic policy so far and  concluded that work of this kind by the government was a  precondition for receiving comprehensive international financial  aid, which will contribute considerably to the overall economic  revival of Croatia.    International circumstances are increasingly favorable --  something best illustrated by the improvement of relations with  the United States, which has offered a draft agreement on  cooperation in the spheres of the economy, technology, and other  areas, which, in the light of statements by top U.S. officials,  shows that the United States is ready to develop a partnership  with the Republic of Croatia in all areas.    The council is aware of the financial situation in all  sectors of Croatian society, both in industry and in the  budget-financed sector, but warns that many people wish to use  the accumulated social discontent for the political  destabilization of Croatia.    The council wishes to praise the prime minister, who was  personally involved in the resolution of all these problems. The  council stresses and supports the government's position that the  budget endorsed by the assembly in the form of a law cannot be  increased before the volume of overall production increases, and  that a new allocation of resources from the budget for salaries  through different grades can be negotiated by all budget  beneficiaries, and a decision on this can be taken by the  assembly and the government; this should never be a cause for  petty politics and often demagogic pressures.    A precondition for international financial aid is a stable  political situation. For that reason the council calls on  everyone to take into account the overall interests of the  Croatian state. The council calls on everyone to discuss all  problems in a peaceful atmosphere, and patiently and responsibly  create conditions for a speedier economic recovery, and thus for  the overall progress of our country and each individual.</p>

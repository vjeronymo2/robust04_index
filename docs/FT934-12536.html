			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: Asset disposal helps boost Norsk Hydro NORSK HYDRO, Norway's biggest stock-listed company, yesterday reported a rise in nine-month net profit, to NKr2.89bn (Dollars 396m) from NKr2.61bn. It was helped by a large gain on the disposal of its 38.3 per cent stake in Freia Marabou, Scandinavia's biggest chocolate producer. Even discounting the gain, Hydro said group results improved during all three quarters of 1993. It attributed this primarily to lower production costs, higher crude oil production, and the effect of a higher dollar exchange rate. With this year's result affected by a pre-tax gain of NKr2.53bn on the Freia disposal, and last year's by changes to the US accounting code (GAAP), Hydro said the two figures were not directly comparable. 'When these factors are excluded, net income for the first nine months of 1993 is calculated to be NKr1.067bn compared with NKr647m for the same period last year,' it said. Group revenue in the first three quarters rose by NKr2.44bn to NKr46.07bn, as operating income climbed NKr1.11bn to NKr3.35bn. Operating costs shot up by NKr1.23bn to NKr38.73bn. 'Our business areas are still affected by difficult market conditions,' said Mr Egil Myklebust, president. He attributed the improvement in operating income to reductions in production costs and higher crude oil output. 'Oil and gas, petrochemicals and agriculture all show progress, while there was a certain decline for light metals. This was due to a particularly difficult market situation for both aluminium and magnesium. Our fertiliser operations have increased sales, but have not achieved higher prices,' Mr Myklebust said. There was still uncertainty about how European fertiliser markets would develop, he said.</p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Asda set to appoint Lazards as adviser Asda, the Leeds-based grocery chain, is likely to see a further strengthening of its board this week as Mr Archie Norman, the recently-installed chief executive, continues to construct a new management team around him. The company also seems set to appoint Lazards as its new financial advisers. Asda confirmed yesterday that Warburgs had been removed as financial advisers partly as a result of its involvement in advising Asda's arch rivals, J Sainsbury and Isosceles (which runs the Gateway chain). The move follows a close review of Asda's relations with all its professional advisers.</p>

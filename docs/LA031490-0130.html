			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IRVINE OKS MEDFLY TASK FORCE;  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT: GROUP WILL BE FORMED TO STUDY WHETHER CITY SHOULD JOIN OTHERS IN  OPPOSING AERIAL SPRAYING. ITS REPORT IS EXPECTED IN JUNE.  </P> <P> Fearing that its orange groves, avocado fields and other agricultural areas  could make Irvine Orange County's next victim of the Mediterranean fruit fly,  the City Council on Tuesday voted unanimously to establish a task force to  review the city's options for combatting the pest.  </P> <P> The task force, which includes representatives of the Irvine Co., farming  companies and educational institutions, will review aerial spraying and debate  whether or not Irvine should join with other Orange County cities in opposing  it. It is expected to issue its report in June.  </P> <P> So far, aerial spraying in the county is restricted to an eight-square-mile  area around Brea and a 36-square-mile area that includes parts of Garden Grove,  Westminster, Huntington Beach and six other central county cities.  </P> <P> "This council is trying to get out front of this issue before they discover a  Medfly here," said Michael S. Brown, the city's environmental program  administrator. If Medflies do appear within the city limits, Brown added,  Irvine would be "left with very little time to react."  </P> <P> The task force, which will be an advisory body to the council, faces a delicate  balancing act, as Irvine has a large and influential agricultural community --  more than 10,000 acres of land in and around the city are farmed -- in addition  to a powerful environmental constituency. Satisfying both those groups will  prove challenging and could make Irvine one of Southern California's most  volatile battlegrounds over the aerial spraying, observers agreed.  </P> <P> What's more, the City Council could find itself in an uncomfortable situation.  The council has lobbied to keep a portion of Irvine in agricultural production,  but at the same time, many council members, including Mayor Larry Agran, enjoy  strong support from environmentalists. Malathion spraying could divide those  constituencies before the city's June 5 election.  </P> <P> "I think a lot of pressure could be brought to bear," said Howard Fishbein, an  Irvine physician who has volunteered to serve on the task force. "But before we  start spraying a substance like malathion, I'd like to see us have some more  objective information about it."  </P> <P> On the other side, farmers said Irvine's strong environmental constituency  could make it a powerful adversary of spraying. However, the farmers added,  they have a huge economic stake in doing everything possible to control the  pest.  </P> <P> "This is going to be an interesting case study if it comes down to spraying in  this area," said Peter Changala, manager of the agricultural division of the  Irvine Co. "It's a very tough thing to address in this community."  </P> <P> Carl Lindgren, general manager of Treasure Farms, said farmers would prefer not  to spray but that they have few options once Medflies appear.  </P></p>

			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Berlusconi besieged on all fronts: Robert Graham watches the Italian prime minister lurch from crisis to crisis For Silvio Berlusconi even a day is beginning to look like a long time in Italian politics. The media magnate turned prime minister is stumbling from crisis to crisis at bewildering speed. A week ago his credibility as a political leader was in question. Now the fate of his 10-week-old government is at stake. Besieged on all fronts, Mr Berlusconi is hanging on to power only because the opposition is weak and no one inside or outside his right-wing coalition government has come up with an alternative. The judiciary may yet force his hand as it digs deeper into his Fininvest media empire. The arrest warrant issued yesterday for his younger brother, Paolo, on charges of paying bribes to the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police, to settle tax inspections in key companies belonging to the Fininvest group, has brought the law perilously close to the prime minister. Mr Paolo Berlusconi is alleged to have approved payments of L330m (Pounds 137,000) to be handed over to members of the Guardia di Finanza between 1989 and 1992 to ensure friendly inspections. Mr Berlusconi's 42-year-old brother has faced corruption charges before. In February he was arrested and admitted to paying some L1bn in bribes on property sold to the pension fund of Cariplo, the Milan savings bank. He has already been sent for trial on another charge related to bribes paid on waste treatment contracts. The previous charges related to construction business operations which Mr Paolo Berlusconi has handled since the early 1980s and which were formally hived off to him two years ago. The new charges concern core Fininvest companies in publishing, television programme-making and life assurance. Although Mr Silvio Berlusconi began to withdraw from daily management of Fininvest last autumn, he did not step down as chairman until January, when he announced his entry into politics. In the public eye Mr Paolo Berlusconi has always been seen as the faithful servant of his high-profile elder brother. Even after Mr Silvio Berlusconi transferred his newspaper publishing interests to him for anti-trust reasons, he still called the shots. In the present circumstances, the problems of his brother will inevitably reflect upon him. Mr Berlusconi has sought to portray the investigation into Fininvest as a vendetta conducted by Milan magistrates who have exceeded the bounds of their authority. The anti-corruption magistrates have undoubtedly behaved politically - most notably when they threatened to resign on July 14 over the government's introduction of a controversial decree restricting their powers of preventive detention. They have also abused these powers of preventive detention to extract confessions. But their inquiry into the activities of the Guardia di Finanza in Lombardy cannot be seen as aimed solely at Fininvest. It is a huge investigation designed to demonstrate that in a system where companies paid out (willingly or unwillingly) large sums to secure contracts and to keep the politicians happy, these moneys had to be accounted for in company balance sheets. So far more than 50 prominent businessmen, accountants and tax experts have been arrested as well as more than 20 members of the Guardia di Finanza. Three members of the corps have committed suicide in the past month. Mr Berlusconi has found cross-party support in his worries about a confrontation between the executive and the legislature on the one hand and the judiciary on the other. The opposition ex-communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) was even critical of the Milan magistrates' threat to resign over the preventive detention decree. But his position has been seriously undermined by the patent conflict of interest. The prime minister cannot attack the Milan magistrates and appear disinterested. Matters have been made worse by the ill conceived meeting he held at his Arcore villa near Milan on Sunday. Present as 'friends' were Mr Gianni Letta, former deputy chairman of Fininvest and currently his chief of staff; Mr Ceseare Previtti, his former Fininvest lawyer and now defence minister; Mr Fidele Confalonieri, the chairman of Fininvest; his brother Paolo and, at least for part of the time, the latter's lawyers along with the lawyer of the head of Fininvest's tax department against whose client an arrest warrant was outstanding. Conflict of interest lies at the heart of the present crisis as it limits the credibility of almost every action by Mr Berlusconi. Is he seeking to help Italy or protect himself when he seeks to reform the RAI, the state broadcasting corporation? Is he trying to guarantee individual rights or insulate his friends and family when he introduces a decree on preventive detention? Was the meeting at Arcore a harmless Sunday gathering of old cronies or a council of war involving key ministers directed against the Milan magistrates? It is argueably too late to undo the damage and achieve a satisfactory separation of his ownership of Fininvest from his role as prime minister. His TV interests are too interwoven with those of RAI to permit any sale without a concurrent reform of the entire system of Italian TV. In the short term he can survive as early elections suit nobody. The opposition is weak and undecided. The PDS has just acquired a new leader, Mr Massimo D'Alema, who has yet to establish himself within his own party. The PDS is divided between those who want to see Mr Berlusconi even more thoroughly discredited (and so politically finished) and those who want to cut a deal with the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi. A PDS-League alliance backed by former Christian Democrat deputies in the centre could form a government. But the PDS is wary of the League as an ally. The League meanwhile is pretending to be loyal to Mr Berlusconi, anxious to avoid being seen as catalyst for bringing down the government. This suggests the government will try to limp through until the summer break and then hope for a change of a fortune in the autumn: a bleak scenario at best and profoundly unsettling for the financial markets.</p>

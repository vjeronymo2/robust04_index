			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by ANC Elections Press Center on the SAPA </F> PR Wire Service; place and date not given: "The Path to Peace  Without Fear"]    [Text] Our country and people are now reaping the violence  that the National Party [NP] government has sown.    We South Africans are reaping an unwelcome harvest of  violence, and of fear. Its seeds were sown by those who dreamed  up the notion of apartheid; and when the crop turned out to be  ever rising resistance from the people, they set out to suppress  it using force and violence. A decade of suppression was a total  failure.    But it created a new South African culture, in which the  state wielded arbitrary armed power without constraint of law,  and in which all opposition and resistance was suppressed with  violence. The National Party's state spread the new culture in  the streets: disputes over power are to be settled by force, and  opponents are to be eliminated by violence. It enshrined the new  culture in the statute book, with a maze of laws which suppress  the right to speak or organise or meet or publish, and which  permit the security forces to banish, imprison, torture or  assassinate with impunity.    Apartheid culture legitimated violence for political ends.  And now we live with the fall-out in the AWB [Afrikaner  Weerstandsbeweging; Afrikaner Resistance Movement], the third  force, and Inkatha. Today, violence is the chosen way of  politics for all those who seek to preserve their own power by  preventing the holding of free and fair elections. Their methods  are political murder and house-burning, terror by assault, and  by uncontrolled armed impi's. Their threats to the security of  all the people have not just grown up naturally. They have been  deliberately incited in an attempt to win through violence and  fear what they know they will never through the ballot box.    This culture of terrorism on one side and fear on the other  is the culture we inherit from the era of apartheid. It cannot  be wiped out by a simple announcement that we have now a "new"  NP. Nor will it be instantly wiped out even by the election of  the new ANC led government. But the election of a new government  untainted by the apartheid culture of the past, would be a start.    We need that start if we are to build a country at peace and  a people freed from fear.    The ANC does not have to claim that it is "new", and  therefore disconnected from its own past. We have pride in our  past. We were the party of resistance and of opposition  throughout the apartheid era. Our members were the men and women  who suffered most directly from the oppressive terror in the era  of apartheid violence. We do not want to paint our organization  as apartheid and suppression, old in the fight against the  culture of violence.    We have stood firm against the worst terror the apartheid  state could bring against us. We have come through with our  ideals intact. Our history is a matter of pride, not to be  brushed under the carpet. Throughout the years when the culture  of violence was being created, ours was the organization that  struggled for the way forward, even though all the force and  violence of the apartheid state was mustered to turn the country  back. We pioneered the ideal of a non-racial country. We built  our party on the unity of white, brown and black members. We  pioneered the ideal of votes for all, and an all-inclusive  democracy, while the NP clung to its racist ideas. Our past  gives the credentials for the carrying out of our promises for  the future.    April 27th can mark the beginning of the end of the culture  of violence. A massive vote of confidence in the policies of the  ANC is the starting point for weeding out the culture of  violence and terror. It will make it possible once and for all,  after all De Klerk's indecisions and inaction, to strip the  protective cover the third force and the inciters of violence,  and from the terrorist campaigns of Inkatha and the AWB.    Voting ANC on April 27th means a start to the weeding out of  fear and violence from our country. We will not repeat the  failures of the past decade. We will not place reliance on all  those failed "safety measures" of reliance on more armed guards,  more police immunity, more fire-power; on "security" behind the  high walls and razor wire, the guard-dogs and the "armed  response" teams.    The internal stability units and armed police have failed to  make us safer. But they have made the violent men more ruthless,  more violent, more desperate, and the security force men more  reliant on violence alone to counter violence. It is time for a  new way.  The ANC proposes    To create a new defence force, whose watchwords will be  `defence of the people', not suppression of opposition.    To reorganise the police force by eliminating "political  policing" as exemplified by the third force and the ISU's  [Internal Stability Unit], and by encouraging policing for the  community and in full consultation with local communities.    Instituting a new regime of gun control, to end gun  smuggling  and minimise the number of firearms held in individual hands.    This not an instant cure for the violence which has become  deeply embedded in our culture, and which has created the  climate of fear everywhere in the country. But it is the only  way forward. Curbing the men of violence, empowering the  community to defend itself, spreading democratic control into  every aspect of public life is the only ground in which a new  culture of peace and security can be securely planted in the  country.    This is not a "quick fix." It is a pledge of immediate  action  and of long-term reconstruction from the ANC in government.    Many of those who vote on April 27th may well be fearful in  today's South Africa. They should vote to live freed from fear  in the South Africa of the future.</p>

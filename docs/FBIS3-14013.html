			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Poser To Washington"] </F>   [Text] Putting on record the first strong criticism by an  Indian Government leader of the Clinton administration's stand  on Kashmir, Home Minister S.B. Chavan sought to mark a watershed  in Indo-U.S. relations when he told the Lok Sabha on Wednesday  [March 2] that New Delhi would have to find out what  Washington's intentions are. Mr. Chavan chose his words  carefully. When he said it was absolutely clear the U.S. was  not interested in helping either Pakistan or India but its own  self, the Home Minister was suggesting that U.S. objectives in  Kashmir were neither the protection of human rights of Kashmiris  nor the elimination of a decades-old feud between two South  Asian neighbours. That raises the question how the U.S. seeks  to further its own interests in Kashmir and what these interests  are. Mr. Chavan's statement is unlikely to elicit more than a  staid explanation from Washington that its objective is to  ensure human rights in Kashmir and elimination of tension  between Pakistan and India which has the potential of a nuclear  conflagration. But such officialese will not help in lifting  the cloud of misunderstanding that is creeping into Indo-U.S.  relations. Mr. Chavan's statement should be read in the context  of two others that Indian ambassador in Washington Siddhartha  Shankar Ray made in recent weeks. The import of Mr. Ray's first  pronouncement was that India is aware of the grey areas of  America's human rights record and the nature of possible  minority demands, but has refrained from mentioning them. The  second statement was that the idea of holding a plebiscite in  Kashmir is an absurdity. Together, these assertions mean,  first, that none should pelt stones at others while sitting in a  glass house and, secondly, that to be able to help common  friends engaged in a feud, one must be aware of the ground  realities to acquire the minimum credentials to be an honest  broker.    The Clinton administration is astonishingly out of touch  with  the realities in South Asia. Unless Washington wants a  strategic base in an independent Kashmir, it is difficult to see  why it must persist in making statements at the level of Mr.  Clinton and Ms. Raphel the only consequence of which can be  boosting the sagging morale of the militants. Mr. Chavan has  asked Washington to explain its stand on Kashmir because Ms.  Raphel questions the validity of Kashmir's accession to India  and claims that she is reflecting the administration's view. At  the same time, the U.S. charge d'affaires in New Delhi asserts  that Washington's stand is different from what she says. The  American explanation needs to be unambiguous. Unless it is so,  doubts will grow about a carefully executed programme of  disinformation to confuse India opinion-makers (politicians,  media and professionals) and thereby weaken the Government's  resolve to withstand extraneous pressure over Kashmir or  non-proliferation. If the U.S. can demand Indian transparency  over human rights in Kashmir, New Delhi can use a matching right  to ask the U.S. to be transparent about its intentions in  Kashmir. It is not polemics but a necessity, especially because  the U.S. sense of involvement in Kashmir shows no signs of  waning although its role as an honest broker has carried it  nowhere.  *</p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Portillo seeks to repel Labour's tax attack Labour's campaign to discredit the Conservative party's claim to be the party of low taxation would boomerang by the time of the next general election, Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, forecast in the Commons last night. He told jeering Labour MPs that while they were 'sitting pretty' now they would not be feeling so clever when they had to face the voters with their plans for increasing public spending on health, education and other projects. Mr Portillo, moving the second reading of the Finance Bill implementing the Budget proposals, insisted: 'There is an unbreakable link between what governments spend and what they must raise in taxation'. He met a barrage of protests from Labour MPs when, like Mr John Major, the prime minister, he refused to accept that the Conservatives had won the last general election on a false prospectus, involving promises of further tax cuts. Mr Portillo condemned the refusal of Labour leaders to follow normal practice by negotiating a voluntary timetable for the discussion of the bill  -the longest introduced to the Commons since the second world war - and left little doubt that the government would use the parliamentary guillotine to curtail debate on its line-by-line committee stage consideration. Ms Harriet Harman, Labour's shadow chief secretary, said in a hard-hitting speech that the bill increased 12 significant taxes and represented a historic moment. It marked a decisive turning point against the Conservative party, clearly demonstrating that its pledges on tax cuts had been betrayed. To Labour cheers she told Conservative MPs that their integrity 'lies in tatters' and that they had nothing left. She firmly rebuffed Tory backbenchers who challenged her indictment by quoting the promises to cut taxes which they made to their own constituents. Ms Harman called on Tory backbenchers who had attacked the imposition of VAT on domestic fuel to vote for a Labour amendment to the bill which sought to remove it. Mr Portillo argued that it was the natural instinct of the Conservative party to control public expenditure and reduce taxation while, in sharp contrast, Labour had a perpetual desire to increase spending and raise taxes. He said: 'Nothing since the last election changes the validity of that choice put before the British people.' Appealing to the loyalty of Tory backbenchers, Mr Portillo warned: 'Our recovery will depend on a clear, sustained determination to take difficult decisions now in order to provide the basis for long-term prosperity'. Pressed about the impact of the tax increases imposed by the bill on the economy, he endorsed the judgment of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, that the recovery now in progress was strong enough to be proof against them. Mr Portillo acknowledged that the extension of value added tax to domestic fuel had been 'a most difficult decision' and thanked Tory backbenchers for supporting it.</p>

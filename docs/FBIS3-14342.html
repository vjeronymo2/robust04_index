			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the </F> Palestinian delegation to the Arab-Israeli peace talks, in  Jerusalem, by Muhammad al-Aswad, in Cairo; date not given --  recorded]    [Text] [Al-Aswad] Welcome to our program.    ['Urayqat] Thank you.    [Al-Aswad] Dr. 'Urayqat, let us begin with the situation in  the occupied territories. The occupied territories are  simmering with tension as a result of the Israeli repression of  the Palestinians. You live in the occupied territories; how do  you assess the situation there?    ['Urayqat] The situation is this: Since the terrorist attack  in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque, massacres have occurred daily. The  Israeli Army is using live ammunition against the Palestinians,  leading to the deaths of dozens and the wounding of hundreds.  It is a picture of daily carnage. A residential neighborhood  in Hebron has been hit by 168 antitank rockets. The unjustified  measures taken by the Israeli army are exacerbating the  situation. A curfew is in force and all the occupied  territories live under siege, all of which seriously undermine  the economic, educational and health conditions.    [Al-Aswad] Dr. 'Urayqat, Palestinian and Israeli negotiators  speak of progress concerning the deployment of foreign observers  and Palestinian police in Hebron and the occupied West Bank.  Palestinian and Israeli negotiators, having held 14 hours of  talks in Cairo, agreed to meet again on Tuesday [29 March] in an  effort to reach a final agreement. How do you see this  development?    ['Urayqat] First of all, I would like to make this clear:  The talks recently held in Tunisia and Cairo aimed to find a  mechanism for implementing Resolution 904, particularly with  regard to international protection for the Palestinian people.  These talks do not involve negotiations with regard to the  Gaza-Jericho or Oslo agreements. Second, with a view to the  practical steps on the basic level, there are measures that  still need to be taken. To focus on the Palestinian police and  international presence but overlook the need to remove the  settlers from the heart of Hebron will, in my opinion,  complicate matters further.    Efforts should now be focused on evacuating the settlers  from  the heart of Hebron because they create a flash point of tension  and trouble. Looking back, it was the settlers who attacked  Hebron University, killing four people; who set fire to shops;  who rampaged through the city; and who harassed the population.    I am afraid that deployment of Palestinian or even  international forces while the status quo remains unchanged in  Hebron will fail to resolve any problem. Israel should  therefore take a major step by evacuating the Jewish settlers  from the heart of Hebron.    [Al-Asad] Dr. 'Urayqat, Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi  Beilin announced that it is possible to cut short the  transitional period, which was supposed to last for five years.  He said that the Israelis and Palestinians should start talking  about a permanent settlement a few months after the Gaza-Jericho  agreement is implemented. What do you think of this statement?    ['Urayqat] Our position has always been that we should enter  into the final phase of negotiations immediately. This has been  the Palestinian position right from the beginning. As you know,  conditions were imposed on us in Madrid and we were forced to  enter into a transitional and then a final phase.    As for Beilin's statement, let me be frank. Israel is  speaking with too many tongues all at once: Israeli Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says one thing, Israeli Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres says another thing, Beilin comes up with a third  view; and Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur expresses a  fourth opinion, and so on and so forth.    What the Israeli Government must do is turn the statement by  the deputy foreign minister into official policy. It happened  in the past that officials, other than the deputy foreign  minister, made proposals that could have boosted the peace  process, but the Israeli cabinet silenced them. I fear that  Beilin's proposal will meet the same fate once it is brought  before the Israeli cabinet.    [Al-Aswad] Dr. 'Urayqat, Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat's political adviser Dr. Nabil Sha'th and [chief Israeli  negotiator at the Cairo talks] Amnon Shahaq have announced that  they agreed on a draft joint document which will be submitted to  the Palestinian and Israeli leaders. Do you know anything about  this agreement?    ['Urayqat] I have no information about this document. What I  wish to make clear is that the current talks in Cairo seek to  find a mechanism to implement UN Security Council Resolution  904. They are not talks about the Gaza-Jericho plan or the Oslo  agreement. I believe it is too early to speak of an agreement,  even an initial one, because the Israeli Government remains  intransigent on the basic issue of evacuating the settlers from  Hebron. I personally believe that it is too early to make  optimistic statements.    [Al-Aswad] Do you think current Arab backing for the  Palestinian negotiators is sufficient or adequate? What further  backing are the Arabs required to offer to the Palestinian  position?    ['Urayqat] First of all, inter-Arab coordination is flawed,  although this is not the time to speak of it. Two days ago,  U.S. President Clinton made a statement about the status of  Jerusalem. For this reason, on behalf of all Arabs and  Palestinians, I urge all Arab leaders, notably Egyptian  President Husni Mubarak, to send an urgent message to President  Clinton asking him to clarify his position on the remarks  attributed to him about Jerusalem. If it is true that Clinton  said Jerusalem is Israel's eternal capital, then I believe that  the Arab nation and Arab leaders should rally together and  reassert their united position that there can be no peace  without Jerusalem. We should keep in mind brother Abu-'Ammar's  [Yasir 'Arafat] pronouncement that four red lines surround  Jerusalem: an Arab line, a Muslim line, a Palestinian line, and  a Christian line. The current peace process and the current  events concern every Arab. At least, we hope that is so. This  is not a purely Palestinian-Israeli affair. We are looking for  total Arab coordination that will lay down strategic Arab  guidelines for the bilateral and multilateral negotiations. We  hope this will happen because what we do now will determine the  region's fate for many years to come. This should concern every  Arab from the Atlantic to the Gulf.    [Al-Aswad] Dr. 'Urayqat, you referred to the U.S.  President's  position on Jerusalem. This position and the reports  circulating about it have really provoked widespread Arab  reaction. However, when correspondents representing the  international media asked the U.S President about the substance  of his remarks on the status of Jerusalem to the leaders of the  U.S. Jewish lobby, he replied in these exact words: I told them  what I also say publicly; namely, that the PLO-Israeli  Declaration of Principles states that the fate of Jerusalem will  be determined by the final status talks. What is your comment?    ['Urayqat] Even this is a retraction of former U.S.  positions. When we say that Jerusalem's final status will be  determined by the negotiations, we mean both East and West  Jerusalem and an ultimate decision on sovereignty over the city.  Since 1967 the U.S. position has been that East Jerusalem is an  integral part of the occupied territories. This situation  continues. We would like the Arab leaders to send a message to  President Clinton urging him to reiterate this U.S. position.  Failing to reiterate this position constitutes a retraction in  itself, a very serious matter.    [Al-Aswad] Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, thank you every much.    ['Urayqat] You are welcome.</p>

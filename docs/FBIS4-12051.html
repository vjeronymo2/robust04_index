			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said this morning  that anyone who thought that the negotiations with the  Palestinians could be concluded within a matter of days was  wrong. Rabin said that there is no room for a meeting between  himself and Yasir 'Arafat at the present time.    [Begin recording] [Rabin] Did anyone expect some kind of  hocus-pocus? Anyone who thought that everything could be  wrapped up within two or six days was simply wrong and did not  understand the situation. If an agreement is not reached or, at  least, until such an agreement is secured, we will have to  clarify to the Palestinians how the economic side of things will  be implemented.    [Economic affairs correspondent Shlomi Stein] In your  opinion, is there room for another meeting between Yasir 'Arafat  and yourself at the present time?    [Rabin] I think it is preferable to prepare such a meeting  -- if and when it takes place -- in such a way as to preclude  the possibility of another meeting between 'Arafat and myself  ending unsuccessfully. [end recording]    Our economic affairs correspondent Shlomi Stein reports that  the prime minister was speaking after a ceremony marking the  sale of the Bet Shemesh engine factory to the Ormat company.</p>

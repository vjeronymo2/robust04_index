			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Knesset endorses PLO accord ISRAEL'S historic peace agreement with Palestinians was solidly endorsed by the Knesset (parliament) yesterday, allowing the process to continue without a referendum or early elections on the accord. The vote of 61 to 50, with eight abstentions and one absent, was a good result for Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, and will take momentum away from the right-wing campaign to scuttle the peace process. Among the eight abstentions were three members of the right-wing Likud party, exposing divisions within the opposition over the Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. Mr Meir Sheetrit, one of the three Likud abstainers, said after the vote that a further seven parliamentarians from his party would also have abstained if Likud had not imposed party discipline but allowed a free vote. 'A gap of 11 members of the Knesset between the supporters and the opponents gives the government the freedom of action to implement (the agreement),' Mr Rabin said. Under yesterday's vote the Knesset formally approved three separate agreements: recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, the peace accord with Palestinians providing for self-government and Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, and an agenda for peace negotiations with Jordan. The ultra-orthodox Shas party, one of Mr Rabin's coalition partners which broadly supports the peace process, also abstained after failing to win support for a referendum. Mr Arye Deri, leader of Shas and a former interior minister, said in the debate that although there were many 'worrying points' about the agreement regarding the security of Jewish settlers in the occupied territories, the accord remained the key to peace with Arabs. 'It is impossible to vote against a chance. . . to reduce the possibility of war, the threat of war against Israel,' he said. Winding up the debate, Mr Shimon Peres, facing regular outbursts of heckling from right-wing opponents, said: 'We can buy a ticket. . . to the dark and gloomy 19th century, to the middle ages of fundamentalism, or to the 21st century. The 20th century is over. Either backward or forward.' The right-wing opposition, led by Likud and backed by tens of thousands of demonstrators outside the Knesset, vowed to continue the campaign against the peace agreement. Mr Benjamin Netanyahu, Likud leader, said the opposition would continue to press the government to call elections before deciding more sensitive issues such as the status of Jerusalem, a Palestinian state, and the right of return of Palestinian refugees.</p>

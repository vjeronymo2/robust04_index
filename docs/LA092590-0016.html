			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KILLING KUWAIT: BRUTAL IRAQIZATION;  </P> <P> IF SADDAM WITHDRAWS, WHAT'LL HE LEAVE BEHIND?  </P> <P> Relentlessly, pitilessly, Iraq is moving to enforce its imperialistic claim  that Kuwait has ceased to exist as a sovereign state. By acting with methodical  brutality to destroy Kuwait's social, political and economic foundations, Iraq  is seeking to make it impossible to restore the conditions that existed before  Saddam Hussein's Aug. 2 invasion.  </P> <P> The latest step in Iraqization has come with the decree that Kuwaiti dinars  will no longer be recognized as legitimate currency. Kuwaitis and resident  foreigners have been given just a few days to turn in their money for Iraqi  dinars, an exchange that will effectively slash the value of private savings by  two-thirds. This confiscatory measure continues the pillage that began when  Iraq, immediately after its invasion, looted Kuwait's banks and unilaterally  canceled the billions of dollars in debts Iraq owes.  </P> <P> Only a very rapid international response to freeze Kuwait's overseas liquid  assets prevented Iraq from transferring to itself even more billions in Kuwaiti  cash and securities.  </P> <P> Efforts at politicide -- at the wiping out of an entire country -- are not new.  Three times in the late 18th Century, for example, Poland's neighbors conspired  to partition the country and literally remove it from the map of Europe. In our  own time, the Soviet Union acted to destroy the independence of Estonia, Latvia  and Lithuania. Iraq alleges that Kuwait is simply one of its former provinces,  ripped from the motherland by British imperialism. That claim is historically  untrue and politically insupportable.  </P> <P> Imperialism, as it happens, played a big part in creating the present-day  boundaries of many countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East  and, yes, North America. But the argument that imperially created borders are  invalid -- because a powerful neighboring country says they are -- is a  prescription for international anarchy. Kuwait's national independence has in  any event long been recognized by scores of countries and by the United  Nations. In no way can Iraq's aggression be justified simply as an effort to  regain what is legitimately its own.  </P> <P> But while the United Nations passes more condemnatory resolutions and  international economic sanctions increase the costs to Iraq of its aggression,  the process of reshaping Kuwait into just another Iraqi province goes on.  </P> <P> Native Kuwaiti citizens made up only about 40% of the country's pre-invasion  population of 1.7 million. Now, no more than 250,000 of them are believed to  remain in the country. The places of those who have fled or been forced out are  reportedly being filled by Iraqis and Palestinians. At the same time, Kuwaiti  sources say, the country's vital records, even the very names of its streets,  are being systematically eradicated.  </P> <P> Iraq, sooner or later, will probably be forced to withdraw its occupying army  from Kuwait. But the ruthless measures it is taking now almost surely mean that  it will leave behind conditions of administrative, economic and demographic  chaos. To that degree, one aim of Saddam Hussein's aggression will have been  achieved.  </P></p>

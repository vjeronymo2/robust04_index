			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Arts: Weir and Britten in St Louis - Opera Judith Weir's The Vanishing Bride groom had its American premiere in St Louis this month. Scott Bergeson conducted. There was a pretty good young cast. Francesca Zambello produced, and Alison Chitty designed; they stressed the narrative plainness of the tales rather than the strangeness of the actions related (a bridegroom lured into fairyland, a maiden wooed by the devil). 'The magic,' Weir wrote of the Scottish folktale collection that was her main source, 'lies in the tension between extraordinary stories and the ordinary people who tell them.' There was little magic in the staging, but much in the music. This is an uncommonly skilful score - lucid, economical, cleverly designed, imaginative in sound. Stravinsky inspires it; Messiaen and Britten lend touches. What I missed at a first hearing was much emotional engagement; perhaps that will emerge when the sheer dexterity of planning and writing no longer dazzles. The next day, Colin Graham's new pro duction of Britten's Midsummer Night's Dream was electric. This opera's structure, too, is very carefully planned, almost schematic in its motivic assignments of sonorities, harmonies, and types of melodic motion. Yet it is not only the most beautiful of Britten's scores but also - in such production as this - one of the most powerfully affecting. Derek McClane's decor showed a world reversed: an upside-down city skyline in the distance, trees descending from the flies. Glow-worms glittered the stage. The lovely, enchanted wood could have been near Athens, near London, or in New York, where Central Park has lately been the scene of passionate murder and brutal rape. Cruder modern stagings of the play, building crassly on Peter Brook's vigorous and famous production, abjure prettiness, stress the donkey-mounts-lady sexuality and the cruelty. Some productions of the opera, on the other hand, have been merely decorative. Graham's holds the romantic and the dark aspects in balance; after pangs as keen as those in Figaro, a reconciliation equally moving is reached. Robert Spano conducted a fine-grained instrumental performance. Derek Lee Ragin was an exact and exquisite Oberon. There was an able young cast; Thomas Barrett, as Bottom, was the outstanding singer. The Dream is less often heard in this country than Albert Herring, The Turn of the Screw and Death in Venice (while Peter Grimes and Billy Budd are the big-company modern staples). This production should bring it forward in favour. Graham, the artistic director of the company, has - in reaction against the over-decoration of our day - commissioned a new, permanent back-wall for the St Louis theatre. Before it, the actors are required to carry the burden of the drama. 'Shakespeare had no scenery,' he writes, and 'many productions that seem wonderfully exciting in the rehearsal room are compromised, even wrecked, by the addition of scenery onstage.' Shakespeare, one might retort, was not writing opera - that multi-media form of dramatic communication in which decor has often been a essential element, one on which composers counted. The wall, designed by McClane, is a handsome, architecturally interesting structure, built apparently of solid brick (though in fact of glass fibre). It closed McClane's own Dream settings effectively. Miss Chitty veiled it from view in the Bridegroom. It served Butterfly and Il Turco in Italia less well, and I can imagine future designers finding it as intractable as the Teatro Olimpico's handsome fixed set (built in 1585 for Oedipus) is for most 19th and 20th-century pieces. ***** Butterfly was this year's standard opera, played nine times (against five Bridegrooms and five Dreams). The Brescia score was used. Graham's production was careful, but the principals, Guiping Deng and Rick Moon, did not have pleasing voices, and Stephen Lord's conducting was summary. For once, there was no Mozart; Rossini's 'Mozartian' Turco was given: the Turco libretto, set by Seydelmann, played in Vienna in 1789 and evidently influenced that of Cos fan tutte; Cos, in turn, played at La Scala in 1814 while Rossini was composing his version (with the Fiordiligi and Guglielmo as his Fiorilla and Selim). Little was Mozartian - or Rossinian - about the St Louis performance, however. Since it was done in my English translation, I'll not review it. Enough, perhaps, to report that the opera was presented as 'Prosdocimo's Dream,' and that the rival ladies donned boxing gloves in the first-act finale while the chorus erected a ring around them.</p>

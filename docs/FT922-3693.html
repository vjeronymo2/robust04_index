			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Vodafone rings up 11% advance VODAFONE GROUP, the mobile telephone company which was demerged from Racal Electronics, yesterday announced that it is to double annual capital expenditure as it reported an 11 per cent increase in profits for the year to end-March. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 244.7m to Pounds 271.8m on the back of an increase in sales from Pounds 536.8m to Pounds 585.3m. Capital expenditure is expected to double this year to Pounds 120m with a further Pounds 120m earmarked for the following year. This is mainly to fund the switch to digital equipment, allowing pan-European use of its portable phones, and the introduction of the next generation of micro-cellular phones to be introduced in about 18 months. Mr Gerry Whent, Vodafone's chief executive, said that after an initial recovery, the economy was 'bumping along on a plateau with little sign of a real upturn'. The pessimistic outlook was reflected in the proportion of customers leaving the network each year, which rose from 21 per cent to 24 per cent, although it has currently been reduced to 22 per cent. It was 15 per cent before the start of the recession. Revenue per customer also fell year-on-year from Pounds 730 to Pounds 711, although it was up on last summer's figure of Pounds 700. The total number of subscribers The group said it had maintained its lead over Cellnet with 56 per cent of the cellular market. Mr Whent described the micro-cellular service which it plans to introduce in 18 months as a 'reduced service at a reduced price' aimed at the retail market. About 95 per cent of the group's present customers are businessmen. Micro-cellular networks are being designed to compete with personal communication networks, owned by Mercury PCN, a consortium led by Mercury Communications and Hutchinson. The group does not believe it will face significant competition until 1994. Mr Whent said the group's continued growth through the recession proved the media wrong in thinking that mobile telephones were 'yuppie inventions'. He added: 'We do not have a single yuppie among our customers; the portable phone is a required business tool.' The group improved its cash position from Pounds 34m to Pounds 65m, which reflected the increase in interest receivable to Pounds 8.3m (Pounds 2.4m). The number of shares held in the US in the form of ADRs, has risen by 2 per cent to 18 per cent. Earnings per share rose to 18.38p (16.86p). A final dividend of 2.94p makes a total of 5.8p (5.27p), excluding the special dividend paid on demerger from Racal.</p>

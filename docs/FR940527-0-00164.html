			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The information requirements of parts, 779, 780, 783, and 784 accord with the prescriptions of sections 507, 508, 515, and 516 of the Act in two ways: First, the permit application submitted pursuant to these parts must contain sufficient information to meet the public disclosure requirements of the Act. Second, the permit application must also contain sufficient information for the regulatory authority to be able to find in writing, on the basis of that information and information otherwise available, whether the proposed operation should be permitted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The level of detail and scope of information required in the permit application will vary depending on the needs of the regulatory authority to fulfill its responsibility to make sound approval decisions based on the findings prescribed under section 510(b) or SMCRA and 30 CFR 773.15(c). The information required in a permit application is, in the main, intended to assist the regulatory authority in determining whether the applicant can comply with the performance standards for surface and underground mining and whether reclamation of these areas is feasible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The information requirements of parts 779, 780, 783, and 784 impose a significant reporting burden on permit applicants to obtain, analyze, and present information to both the regulatory authority and the public when seeking to permit a surface coal mining operation. Under the Paperwork Reduction Reauthorization Act of 1986, OSM is responsible for ensuring that its rules do not impose any unnecessary reporting burden on the permit applicant (44 U.S.C. 3507(a)(1)(B)). In 1987, OSM established a work group to review its regulatory program and permitting rules. One purpose of the review was to determine whether changes to the information requirements of the permitting rules could be made to reduce the reporting burden on the permit applicant without compromising the implementation of the purposes and provisions of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After reviewing the work group's recommendations regarding rule changes, OSM identified two changes to its regulations governing surface and underground mining activities which are the subject of this rulemaking. While OSM recognizes its obligation under the Paperwork Reduction Reauthorization Act of 1986 to ensure that public reporting burden be minimized, the Office also recognizes the need to maintain a stable regulatory program implementing the Act. On this basis, the balance of the work group's recommended rule changes were rejected because OSM felt the insignificant reduction in reporting burden which they would afford did not justify the potential disruption to the regulatory program which would be caused by such changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 8, 1993 (57 FR 3458), OSM proposed a rulemaking based on two of these recommendations. The public comment period closed on March 9, 1993. For surface mining activities, this final rulemaking consolidates the land use information requirements of sections 30 CFR 779.22 and 30 CFR 780.23 into final 30 CFR 780.23 and deletes the slope measurement requirements of 30 CFR 779.25(a)(11). For the counterpart regulations governing underground mining activities, this rulemaking consolidates the land use information requirmeents of 30 CFR 783.22 and 30 CFR 784.15 into final 30 CFR 784.15 and deletes the slope measurement requirements of 30 CFR 783.25 (a)(11). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the cited regulations governing underground activities are identical to counterpart regulations governing surface mining activities, the discussion of changes or deletions to 30 CFR 779.22, 779.25(a)(11) and 780.23 will also apply to 30 CFR 783.22, 783.25(a)(11) and 784.15. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Land Use Information Rules <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 30 CFR 779.22 identified the premining land use information required in a permit application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 779.22(a) required that the application contain a statement of the condition, capability, and productivity of the land within the proposed permit area. Section 779.22(a)(1) required that the application contain a map and a narrative that describes the use of the proposed permit area at the time of filing and the premining land use if its use was changed within five years before the date of application. The map was used to compare premining land uses with proposed postmining land uses. Section 779.22(a)(1) implemented section 508(a)(2)(A) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 779.22(a)(2) required that the permit application include a narrative of the capability and productivity of the land to support a number of uses which can be used in analyzing the land use description contained in section 779.22(a)(1). Environmental information from &sect;779.22(a)(2) together with land use information from &sect;779.22(a)(1) provided a foundation for the reclamation plan required by former section 30 CFR 780.23 (Reclamation plan: Postmining land uses). Section 779.22(a)(2) and its two subsections, (i) and (ii), implemented sections 508 (a)(2) (B) and (C) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 779.22(b) required a description of premining land use conditions for previously mined areas. These regulations provided that an application for a previously mined area identify the type of mining method used, the coal seams or other mineral strata mined, the extent of coal or minerals removed, the approximate dates of past mining, and the uses of the land preceding mining. According to the 1979 Preamble, this information, if available, was intended to be used by the operator and the regulatory authority to assure that the mining operation will be conducted in a manner which mitigates the environmental damage caused by the previous mining activities (44 FR 15041, March 13, 1979). The 779.22(b)(5) informational requirements as to the uses of land preceding prior mining implemented sections 508(a)(2)(A) and 515(b)(2) of the Act. The balance of &sect;779.22(b) is not specifically required by the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 779.22(c) required that the application describe the proposed mining area's existing land uses and their classifications under local law. Information from this section was used by the regulatory authority to evaluate the proposed postmining land uses and to assess the compatibility of the proposed land use with the existing land use policies and plans. The information required by this section was essentially the same information required by former &sect;780.23(a)(4) and (b). Section 779.22(c) implemented Section 508(a)(3) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 30 CFR 780.23 established the criteria used to approve a postmining land use analysis and plan. Section 780.23 implemented Section 508(a) (3) and (4) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 780.23(a) required that the applicant's reclamation plan describe the proposed postmining land use. Included must be a discussion of the utility and capacity of the reclaimed land to support a variety of alternative uses which must conform to the existing land use policies and plans. Section 780.23(a) implemented Section 508(a)(3) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

NODONG SINMUN today says this revealed the intention of the  U.S. bellicose quarters to dominate and control this region by  perpetuating the U.S. military presence there and intensifying  military intervention in those countries which follow the road  of independence.    The news analyst says:    The United States is reinforcing military forces in  Northeast  Asia, especially in South Korea, to control the Asia-Pacific  Region. It is obvious that Larson had in mind the provocation of  war on the Korean peninsula when preaching the need of the U.S.  military presence and meddling in the region.    The bellicose quarters of the United States openly reveal  their intention to make a military adventure against the DPRK.    The U.S. military is examining the deployment of U.S.  nuclear  submarines and unmanned spy planes around the Korean peninsula  and scheming to build a "theatre missile defence system"  together with Japan under the pretext of coping with the  "nuclear and missile threat" from the DPRK.    This move shows that the U.S. bellicose quarters have not  yet  given up their ulterior intention to impede the DPRK-USA talks  and stifle the DPRK with strength.    If they think military threat and pressure can work on the  Korean people, it is a miscalculation.    They must renounce the anachronistic ambition for dominating  the Asia-Pacific Region and stop the anti-DPRK campaign.</p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Markets Report: Exchanges wait for Fed The dollar traded steadily yesterday ahead of the important meeting today of the Federal Open Market Committee, which is expected to announce a further tightening of US monetary policy, writes Philip Gawith. An aggressive tightening, of 50 basis points in the discount and federal funds rates, plus a statement that neutrality has been reached, is expected to support the dollar. Anything less, and there is a danger that the US currency will weaken again. The dollar closed in London at DM1.6740 from DM1.6671, and Y104.580 against the yen from Y104.755. In New York it ended at DM1.6732 and Y104.75. Trading was generally very quiet, with most of the market preferring to direct its focus towards today's events. Elsewhere, the Greek drachma was the focus of attention as the Bank of Greece lifted interest rates to protect the currency from speculative pressures. The Bank of England's exchange rate index finished at 80.5, from 80.1 last Friday. US economic data released were in line with expectations and had little impact on the currency. April industrial production rose by 0.3 per cent, as expected, while capacity utilisation was 83.6 per cent, unchanged from March. Analysts are fairly evenly divided about whether the Fed will raise the federal funds rate, currently 3.7 per cent, by 25 or 50 basis points. The three tightenings so far this year, commencing on February 4, were all by 25 basis points. Many analysts contend that recent weakness in currency and bond markets, which have fed off each other, results from this gradual tightening process. This, it is argued, unsettles markets because the continual spectre of a further monetary tightening acts as a disincentive for new investors to enter the market. But the argument for a short, sharp shock, convincing the market that policy neutrality had been achieved, lost some of its force with the release of good inflation data. Mr Mark Austin, treasury strategist at Midland Global Markets, said that with this backdrop 'there would probably be little surprise if the Fed continued its gradualist approach and raised the funds target by only 25 basis points to 4 per cent'. In a note to customers yesterday, JP Morgan, the US investment bank, pointed out that there were also political and tactical reasons to follow this course. 'An aggressive rate hike on the heels of a report suggesting stable to slightly declining consumer price inflation will surely draw attacks from Fed critics in congress,' the report noted. Whatever the Fed chooses to do, it is not yet clear that the worst is over for the dollar. Although the spectre of intervention remains, Mr Austin noted: 'The reduction in speculative capital committed to markets following the collapse in bonds earlier this year has reduced one area of support for the dollar, and the longer term capital and current account flows are still negative.' The support for sterling is related to the death last week of Mr John Smith, the UK Labour party leader. By drawing attention away from the troubles of the Conservative party and the prime minister, his death is seen as having contributed to greater political stability in the short term. This change in the political landscape has been supplemented by the view that, compared to Germany, interest rate differentials appear increasingly to be moving in the UK's favour. The pound ended in London at DM2.5174, more than 1 1/2 pfennigs above Friday's close of DM2.5012. It was also higher against the US dollar, finishing at Dollars 1.5039 from Dollars 1.5004. In Europe, attention focused on Greece, where banks lifted interest rates sharply to protect the drachma. The National Bank of Greece - the largest state bank - raised short-term deposit rates to 35-45 per cent, from 23 per cent last Friday. Other short-term rates were also lifted. The currency came under speculative attack last week when the announcement that the country was lifting remaining capital controls on July 1 prompted a sell-off of the currency, in anticipation of a likely devaluation as capital left the country. The central bank's measures appeared to have achieved some success, with traders reporting quiet conditions and little pressure on the currency. Yesterday afternoon the drachma was being quoted at 148.10/20 after being fixed at Dr148, compared to the previous fix of Dr147.70. Elsewhere, the D-Mark's performance was mixed. It was unchanged at FFr3.429 against the French franc, but stronger, at L961.5 from L957.2, against the Italian lira. The Bank of England provided the UK money markets with Pounds 615m of assistance after forecasting a Pounds 600m shortage. The overnight rate moved in the 3 to 5 per cent range. In Germany, call money eased to 5.40/50 per cent, from 5.45/55 per cent on Friday, ahead of this week's repo. The futures markets were 'listless', in the words of one participant.</p>

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Swans wins frigate work SWAN HUNTER, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership, will be allowed to complete work on three Type 23 frigates, the Ministry of Defence and receivers Price Waterhouse said yesterday The contract, which Swans won against bids from other naval shipyards, gives the company work until November next year and enhances its prospects of being sold as a going concern. Announcing the deal, Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, said it was subject to the maintenance of 'satisfactory levels of productivity'. Joint receiver Mr Gordon Horsfield, who finalised the deal with the MoD, said he was hopeful Swans would be sold within weeks. 'We are in active discussions with several interested parties,' he said. Mr Horsfield said those who had expressed serious interest in buying Swans were companies with international activities, intending to continue shipbuilding on the Tyne. He said he was 'reasonably optimistic' that shipbuilding on the river would be retained. The agreement with the MoD 'substantially increases the confidence level in the yard', he said. Swans went into receivership in mid May after failing to win a helicopter carrier order from the government. Its survival chances have hinged on completing the outfitting of the frigates, its only substantial current workload. News of the agreement, which also strengthens Swans' chances of winning a Pounds 40m Omani order for two patrol boats, was released just before Labour leader Mr John Smith visited the yard. He said the deal was welcome but belated. Labour suggestions that the news was timed to overshadow Mr Smith's visit were dismissed by the MoD as 'absolute rubbish'. Mr Smith said the government should take positive action to assure the Oman government that there was no difficulty in providing the bonds necessary to secure the patrol boats order. The government must also push Swans' case for intervention funding with the European Community he said. 'It's vital we save the shipbuilding potential here, not only for industrial reasons but for national security reasons,' he said. 'It would be a tragedy if it were to close and at some time in the future we had to order a large naval vessel from abroad. It's unthinkable that any government could allow that to happen.'</p>

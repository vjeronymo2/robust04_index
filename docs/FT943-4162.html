			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / First Family ties flourish Two men with family ties to the White House survived primary elections in Florida on Thursday. Mr Hugh Rodham, brother of the First Lady, finished first in the Democratic contest to field a candidate against Republican Senator Connie Mack in November. But his 34 per cent forces him into a run-off poll on October 4. If he wins then, his chances against Ms Mack are still reckoned small. Mr Jeb Bush, second son of former President George Bush, won the Republican primary in the governor's race with 46 per cent and also faces a run-off for the right to fight Mr Lawton Chiles, the incumbent Democrat, in what is predicted to be a close race. Mr Jeb Bush's older brother, George Jr, is also in a governor's race as a Republican - in Texas against the incumbent Ms Ann Richards.</p>

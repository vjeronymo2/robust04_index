			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / The last laugh for the honest joker: Politicians are so afraid of offending that they no longer dare tell the truth Alexander Downer is about to lose his job. No, I had not heard of him either, but apparently Downer, 42, is the leader of Australia's opposition Liberal Party. Downer has held down this job for only four months, so one might be forgiven for wondering what this Tony Blair of the antipodes had done to deserve such treatment. The answer is: he has made one joke too many, in public. According to the Daily Telegraph 'he has made a series of gaffes since becoming leader, affronting women's and civil rights groups, Aborigines and homosexuals . . . 'The most damaging incident occurred last week when he outlined to guests at a fund-raising dinner his Liberal party's new policy document called 'The Things That Matter'. Attempting some light-hearted banter, he caused outrage by describing the party's policy on domestic violence as 'the things that batter'.' Not the best joke I have ever heard, but is it such an excruciating pun that the man responsible should be sacked? Alas, the outrage was not at the quality of Downer's sense of humour, but at the fact that he was prepared to laugh at the over-seriousness of his own party workers, with their portentous pamphlets called 'The Things That Matter'. It is a gloomy day when a political leader of a right of centre party, in robust Australia, of all places, is deemed unelectable because he is prepared to mock such ghastly totems of political correctness as 'women's and civil rights groups, Aborigines and homosexuals'. In the mother country last week our own Jeremy Hanley, having scarcely had time to register that he had become Conservative Party chairman, was being declared unfit for his office because he good-humouredly described some violent yobs as 'exuberant'. Like his contemporary, Downer, Hanley's unforgivable crime was levity. We are in an age when a sense of humour has been designated the eighth deadly sin, at least as far as politicians are concerned. There can be no doubt that Norman Lamont's announcement, two years ago this week, that he was singing in his bath on the morning after sterling's forced exit from the exchange rate mechanism, was responsible for most of the abuse which the ex-chancellor subsequently received. The paradoxical truth is that, in private, politicians tend to have an acerbic, often tasteless, and sometimes genuinely very funny sense of humour. Their cynical and mordant wit makes them good company. And yet they are forced to neuter themselves in public, all for fear of offending one or another of the growing band of one-issue pressure groups. Blunt telling of home truths is similarly unpalatable, and must be recanted at all costs. Michael Portillo tells some university students that they are living in the least corrupt country in Europe, and is immediately forced to apologise. William Waldegrave reveals to a House of Commons select committee that governments sometimes lie, and is henceforth considered unsuitable for promotion. As one politician wryly told me, in modern public discourse 'gaffe' is the word used by journalists to describe a politician telling the truth. I am afraid that journalists must take a large measure of blame for this. They are as cynical a breed as the politicians they write about, but all too often they adopt a tone of outraged surprise when a government minister blurts out in public the truth which he will have told the same journalists countless times in unattributable briefings. It is as if they regard the public as children, unfit to be exposed to the murky realism which characterises the private discourse of those who write about politics for a living. Yet the extraordinary public success and acclaim for Alan Clark's diaries is clear evidence that the public is capable of appreciating political dialogue stripped bare of euphemism and mock-seriousness. Clark, you will observe , left political life with neither a peerage nor a knighthood. But at least he had fun. As I have had, over the past 3 1/2 years, in writing this column. Good bye, and thank you for reading to the end. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.</p>

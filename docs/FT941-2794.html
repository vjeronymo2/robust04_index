			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent weakens after Buba holds ground Bourses were mildly higher in the morning, but tended to ease after the Bundesbank left key interest rates unchanged, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT led the way with the Dax index 2.33 higher at 2,175.06 on the session, but falling to 2,160.45 as bund and index futures weakened in the afternoon. Turnover fell from DM9.7bn to DM8bn. Financials, which had risen earlier this week on interest rate hopes, came back on the Buba news, Deutsche Bank weakening from a close of DM823 to DM808.50. Chemicals were also weak after gains earlier in the day, and there was a suggestion of nervousness ahead of today's 'triple-witching' expiry of stock and Dax future options. BMW came in the afternoon with a one-for-eleven rights issue and a comparatively gentle fall in 1993 profits, according to Mr Christopher Will at Lehman Brothers, who noted the comparison with Volkswagen's DM1.9bn loss, confirmed at around the same time. The rights issue took BMW down to DM855 at one point from its earlier close of DM871, before the profits brought it back to DM859.50 at the end of the day. Lufthansa had a better reception for a substantially reduced parent company loss for 1993, which took the shares in the airline up DM2 to DM197 in floor trading. In specialty chemicals, Beiersdorf jumped DM26, or 3.1 per cent to DM878 on a better than expected 13 per cent rise in net profits. PARIS remained in positive territory, although the CAC-40 index ended off the day's high of 2,260.60 with a rise of 5.13 to 2,247.84. Turnover was a little under FFr4bn. LVMH and its associates were the day's main story as the luxury goods group pleased the market with its results, lifting the shares FFr208 or 5 per cent to FFr4,389. The effect rubbed off on associates Christian Dior, up FFr16.4 or 4.4 per cent at FFr389.90 and Bon Marche, the supermarket chain, up FFr41 or 5.3 per cent at FFr809. Merrill Lynch, in a note issued earlier this week, upgraded LVMH from neutral to above average, reckoning that after two years of underperformance, all the bad news was out. AMSTERDAM closed slightly lower in line with the trend elsewhere on the continent, the AEX index slipping just 0.74 to 424.50 after an earlier session high of 427.84. Results came in from Elsevier, Hoogovens, and Ahold; the first two fell back and the latter rose against the trend. Elsevier was one of the day's biggest fallers, off Fl 4.30 at Fl 177.40, although its results came broadly in line with expectations. Some brokers expressed disappointment over its cautious forecast for 1994. Hoogovens off Fl 1.20 at Fl 64.80, suffered on news of a convertible bond launch, while Ahold, the retailer, up 50 cents at Fl 51.30, pleased investors with its forecast of improved earnings in 1994. MILAN pulled ahead on the first day of the April account amid strong demand for industrials as investors begin to focus on the prospects for improved 1994 corporate results. The Comit index rose 3.85 to 680.60. BCI opened at L5,900 as the new shares, sold at L5,400 in the bank's privatisation, were admitted to the market. The shares closed at L5,898, a net fall of L149 for the old shares, trading ex-dividend. The shares were sold on the open outcry system early in the day to cope with a flood of profit-taking by small investors on their privatisation allocations. Pirelli, seen as a recent underperformer, rose L126 or 5.5 per cent to L2,428, helped by recurrent talk that the group could be considering making a capital increase. Stet added L58 to L4,993 in response to comments by the industry minister that he hoped a merchant bank would be appointed before the elections at the end of the month to advise on the privatisation. ZURICH marked time in moderate volume as investors adjusted positions ahead of today's expiry of Soffex options and futures. The SMI index edged 0.6 higher to 2,887.7, restrained by a SFr19 loss to SFr1,250 by the heavily weighted Nestle and a SFr12 fall to SFr828 by Ciba. Schindler certificates rose SFr60 or 3.7 per cent to SFr1,670 as the elevator producer announced better than expected 1993 results. SMH bearers bounced SFr34 to SFr870 on the view that Wednesday's fall had been overdone. MADRID's general index ended just 0.20 lower at 339.97. Continente, the hypermarket operator, closed at Pta2,720 on its market debut against an offer price of Pta2,650.

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: ERM eases fear of Pounds devaluation STERLING has steadied this week as investors have reasoned that, should Labour form a government, it would be unlikely to devalue the pound from its central rate in the exchange rate mechanism of DM2.95. Entry into the ERM 18 months ago, fixing the pound within set limits linked to the D-Mark, has reduced the opportunities for the pound to lose value as nervous financial markets have contemplated Labour's lead in the polls. The ERM link has removed a lingering Labour nightmare: that should it be poised to take power, huge sums of money would flow out of Britain because of investors' antagonism to a change of government. For much of the 1980s, that nightmare was made more credible by the globalisation of financial markets and the impact of telecommunications technology, allowing millions of pounds to be switched between countries in seconds. When Labour was last in office in 1979, the potential to do this was limited by exchange controls and less-advanced technology. Last night in London, sterling closed at DM2.8425, unchanged on the day and up from DM2.835 on Friday night. Sterling's relative steadiness has been due to judgments by currency dealers about what would happen should sterling approach its ERM floor at about DM2.78. Unless Labour chose to devalue, the Bank of England and other European central banks would be forced, under the system's rules, to support the pound. As a result, at a point close to the lower limit, the pound would look undervalued, and would be bought by investors. Mr John Shepperd, an economist at investment bank SG Warburg Securities, said: 'The ERM has made politics less of a threat to the exchange rate.' Mr Paul Chertkow, chief currency analyst at the London office of Citibank, the US bank, said that few main players on currency markets appeared to believe that Labour would devalue. He said that among the big banks and institutions active in the market, 'there is little evidence that anyone is ready to sell the pound'.</p>

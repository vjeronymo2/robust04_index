			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Arts: Arts face Budget blues - Antony Thorncroft argues the case for cash-strapped companies Can the beleaguered wagon train hold out until the cavalry arrives. 'No', says Mary Allen, secretary general of the Arts Council. 'Yes', says Stephen Dorrell, the heritage minister. The nation's arts companies are grappling with unprecedented debts of at least Pounds 12m. The National Lottery is coming to their rescue, with the first grants in April. By then it could be too late for some. The lights are going out in January at the Salisbury Playhouse and the Redgrave at Farnham. The Yvonne Arnaud in Guildford is under threat. The Everyman in Cheltenham has been forced to embark on co-productions with the nearby Bristol Old Vic. The Northcote at Exeter has become a receiving house, not daring to risk its own productions. Regional theatres have collective debts of Pounds 4m. Regional orchestras have deficits totalling Pounds 1.8m. Of the flagship companies, the RSC, the National Theatre, the ENO, and the Royal Opera House Covent Garden have combined debts of over Pounds 5m and the South Bank Centre is Pounds 370,000 in the red. The trouble is that the arts have cried wolf so many times before that the Treasury , not their most stalwart supporter, is likely to be indifferent to their fate in Tuesday's Budget. But even if there is nothing but an inflation increase in Stephen Dorrell's paltry budget of around Pounds 1b, he still has the power to divide it up, giving more to the arts at the expense of sport, heritage or the British Library. He can, at the very least, restore the Pounds 3.2m axed from the Arts Council of England a year ago. This, plus an inflation increase of around Pounds 4m, should be enough to keep the shows on the road. Dennis Marks, director of the ENO, sums up the problem. The ENO is having a good season, playing to 78 per cent of capacity, way above the 60 per cent of a year ago. 'If we get a grant that reflects inflation, in three years time we will have reduced our current deficit of Pounds 3.1m to just Pounds 1m. If we get the standstill grant we are promised our deficit will stay the same: we will be throwing money into a black pit'. The return of the Pounds 3.2m, which is what Arts Council chairman Lord Gowrie has modestly put in for, could be enough. It would tide the arts over a real, but temporary, crisis. For, if London is any indicator, the recession is over. The Big Four, which absorb over Pounds 50m of the English Arts Council's Pounds 186m budget, are doing rather well. The Royal Opera House is currently hitting 90 per cent of its financial capacity and hopes to knock another Pounds 600,000 off its Pounds 1.3m deficit while the RSC is matching the 83 per cent houses it achieved last season. The National Theatre had a bad summer, partly because one production, Johnny on the Spot, proved a box office disaster, but bringing back the money spinning The Wind in the Willows should keep any deficit on the year to under Pounds 500,000. The South Bank is reporting a sudden uplift in support, with the LPO, its house orchestra, attracting audiences of 83 per cent. In the regions, however, audiences are staying at home. The enervating financial struggle forces artistic directors to walk a tight rope between imaginative work and commercial fare that might guarantee good box office receipts. But as Covent Garden and the ENO discovered a year or so ago, there is a limited market even for traditional favourites. Such a safe approach is anathema to the committed modernists, like the 87 playwrights who this week bemoaned, in a newspaper letter, the lack of new plays being produced and sought a nationally ordained quota of new works. In fact the proportion of new plays put on in 1993-94 - just over 3,000 out of 14,613 productions in the 70 theatres aided by subsidy - is roughly the same as a decade ago, but theatre managements dare not risk presenting plays which are likely to lose money. This is the leap of imagination demanded of Stephen Dorrell. His first comments suggest he judges artistic success by the size of the audience. This bottom-line approach makes sense if the audiences are attracted by dynamic new productions, but is artistic suicide if companies go for short-term box office salvation. Risk is what the arts are all about. A diet of safe productions - theatres putting on Ayckbourn and Willie Russell, opera houses reaching for their Puccini and Mozart - soon becomes stale, the bedrock audience withers and the young are not attracted.</p>

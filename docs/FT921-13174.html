			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Brussels move on 'dual-use' goods THE European Commission is pressing for the abolition by the end of this year of internal EC border controls on the export of goods and technologies which could be used for military as well as civilian purposes. Yesterday it approved a paper by Mr Martin Bangemann, internal market commissioner, advocating the rapid removal of barriers to the free movement of 'dual-use' goods and technologies, which can include, for example, personal computers and high-technology machine tools. However, certain member states - notably German and Britain - are not convinced their EC partners will be able to bring their export controls up to the required standard quickly enough. EC officials concede that a gradual reduction in internal controls may prove preferable to immediate opening of the market. Internal EC export of dual-use goods and technologies is said to represent between 5 and 8 per cent of total intra-Community trade, but member states still impose on such exports a variety of controls often prepared according to widely differing criteria. 'We want a reduction not an increase of bureaucracy,' said one Commission official yesterday. Having talked to all member states over the past 18 months, the Commission is calling for: a common list of dual-use goods and technologies subject to control; a common list of non-EC destinations for which controls might have to be applied; common criteria for the issuing of licences for EC exports; some mechanism for co-ordinating licensing and enforcement procedures; explicit procedures for administrative co-operation between member states. Foreign and internal market ministers will discuss the Commission paper next month, and Brussels is expected to produce firm legislative proposals later in the year. Until recently, EC states excluded the Commission from any talks about export controls. The scope of controls on dual-use exports to the old Warsaw Pact countries is set by the Paris-based Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (Cocom), members of which include most of Nato, Japan and Australia.</p>

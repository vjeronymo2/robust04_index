Abkhaz separatists killed, insulted, and robbed thousands of  people. According to the recent information, certain people are  still calling on the refugees from the Gali Rayon and other  parts of Abkhazia to return to their homes in Abkhazia.    The provisional committee is making this authoritative  statement urging people not to be guided by such provocations.  The committee warns categorically all forcibly displaced  persons to stop entering the territory occupied by the  separatists until the government adopts a relevant resolution.</p>

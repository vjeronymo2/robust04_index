			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Sinn Fein talks may open by Christmas The government might be engaged in preliminary talks with Sinn Fein leaders by Christmas, Mr John Major, the prime minister, acknowledged yesterday. His comments came as it emerged at Westminster that the government is unlikely to insist that all IRA weapons are surrendered in exchange for allowing Sinn Fein to join political talks on Northern Ireland's future. Hopes of further progress on the UK-Irish peace initiative were reinforced by the upbeat tone adopted by the British and Irish governments after the first meeting under the terms of the Anglo-Irish conference since last month's IRA ceasefire. Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, said after his talks with Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, in London that the two governments were coming closer in their attitude to the ceasefire. He hoped the two sides would have completed their work on the framework document designed to inject momentum into political talks involving the province's main political parties 'long before' Christmas. Questioned on the prospects for talks between the government and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, Mr Major noted that republican leaders had still not provided sufficient assurances that the IRA had renounced violence for good. But if the assurances demanded by the government were given without delay, 'clearly we could be talking at or around Christmas-time', he said. Yesterday's developments came on the eve of the arrival in Boston of Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president. London has promised to start preliminary talks on how to admit Sinn Fein to the political process within three months of a permanent end to IRA violence. The ground covered would include what to do about the IRA's extensive armoury. Anything short of a full surrender of IRA weapons would probably disappoint unionists, many of whom remain profoundly suspicious of the IRA's intentions. According to Whitehall officials, London is unlikely to regard a refusal by republican leaders to guarantee that all IRA weapons have been handed in as a potential deal-breaker. There is widespread acceptance, however, that London is likely to take a much tougher line over caches of explosives and military equipment such as semi-automatic rifles and rocket launchers. That is the minimum that would be demanded by the moderate unionists whom it is vital for London to keep on board. According to Mr John Taylor, the Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, there is 'no way in which the UUP could recognise Sinn Fein as a normal democratic political party . . . until those guns are accounted for'. Questioned on the issue yesterday, Sir Patrick Mayhew said nobody who had given up violence had 'any possible need for these things'. Gerry Adams to land in US today, Page 6</p>

Ministry spokesman Captain Craig Kotze says  this will be part of ensuring free and fair elections on the  East Rand. Kotze has been reacting to newspaper and radio  reports quoting an East Rand SDU member who said killing  particular people does not worry him. The member, code named  Tembu, reportedly said when they kill particular people, for him  it is like he has killed a chicken. He reportedly said this is  because he sees no reason for people to live if they do not  understand what the will of the people is. Kotze says the  statement is a cause for extreme concern. He says it will be  brought to the attention of the Goldstone Commission:    [Begin Kotze recording] Such statements highlight the  inherently uncontrollable killer instincts of ANC [African  National Congress] SDU's, and the fact that ANC supporters, and  not the South African Police as the ANC is fond of claiming,  play a large role in the East Rand carnage. If free and fair  elections are to be held on the East Rand in April, it is  essential that these units be disbanded as quickly as possible  by the ANC, and that the illegal weapons be handed over to the  South African Police, and that the killers in their ranks be  brought to justice as soon as possible.

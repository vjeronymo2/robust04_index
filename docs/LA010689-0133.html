			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WYSE TO LAY OFF 560; PRESIDENT RESIGNS  </P> <P> Wyse Technology Inc., struggling in the fiercely competitive market for  IBM-compatible personal computers, announced Thursday the resignation of  President and Chief Operating Officer Phillip E. White and disclosed plans to  dismiss about 560 workers.  </P> <P> The San Jose, Calif.-based company also said it expects to report a loss for  the nine months ended Dec. 30.  </P> <P> Bernard Tse, chairman and chief executive of Wyse, will assume White's  day-to-day responsibilities at the computer manufacturing company.  </P> <P> White, who joined Wyse in 1986, left to become chief executive of Informix  Corp., a database management and software products company based in Menlo Park,  but will remain on Wyse's board.  </P> <P> "White is extremely good and competent, but he became frustrated at Wyse  because it is in a bad situation that's going to get worse" because of stiff  competition, said Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock  Letter.  </P> <P> Wyse has a good distribution outlet through BusinessLand, Murphy said, but  needs to diversify its product line and come up with a clone of International  Business Machine's more advanced personal computer.  </P> <P> "I think they will cut more jobs," Murphy said. "They have to do some serious  strategic reorienting. I wouldn't be surprised to see them shut down some  product lines."  </P> <P> Wyse built a lucrative business selling computer display terminals, but its  efforts to translate that success into the market for complete PCs has largely  failed, other analysts said.  </P> <P> Wyse said it would slash the 560 jobs -- about 15% of its work force -- through  cutbacks and attrition in reaction to a sharp decline in third-quarter sales.  The company said the reduction includes about 400 positions in its Far East  manufacturing operations.  </P> <P> Wyse said sales in the third quarter ended Dec. 30 would be between $60 million  to $70 million. That is less than half what it forecast in early October,  computer analysts said.  </P> <P> It said a loss in the quarter would wipe out profits of $11.7 million, or 78  cents a share, earned in the first six months.  </P> <P> Wyse's shares closed down $1.00 at $6.625 in trading on the New York Stock  Exchange.  </P> <P> Computer analysts blamed the company's problems on several factors -- lack of  PC expertise, a late entry into the field and initial quality problems.  </P></p>

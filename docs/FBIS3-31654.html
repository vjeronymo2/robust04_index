			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Feb 20 (CTK) -- The visit of Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev to this country confirmed both sides'  interest in a more businesslike approach to bilateral questions,  a statement issued by the Czech Foreign Ministry says.    The ministry's statement on the results of Kozyrev's visit  was given to CTK today.    Kozyrev's successive meetings with President Vaclav Havel,  Premier Vaclav Klaus and Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec showed  the need for a dialogue on the top and high levels, the ministry  says.    The Czech explained motives and goals of their foreign  policy, their efforts to obtain, as soon as possible, membership  of NATO, the European Union and the Western European Union, and  their negative attitude towards attempts to create spheres of  influence.    The Czechs heard Russian notions on European security that  might be centered, Russians say, around the Conference on  Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).    Kozyrev's visit is understood as part of the ongoing  intensive discussion on European security and in this respect  the Czech Foreign Ministry considers it to be very important,  the statement says.</p>

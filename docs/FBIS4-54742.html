			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 3 (CTK) -- Since last July, Slovak  Radio (SRo) has received no state subsidies provided for by the  law, SRo Director Vladimir Stefko told a press conference today.  Although the law describes SRo as a "national, independent,  public, informational, cultural and educational corporation", it  monthly lacks 8 million korunas ($258,000) necessary for  fulfilling its duties, Stefko said. If the critical situation  is not solved, SRo could face a collapse in a short time, he  added.    He pointed to the unnatural number of inspections,  invectives, demands for staff changes and other interferences  with the independence of SRo by state power. The previous  government of Vladimir Meciar deprived SRo of 120 million  korunas ($3,8 million) by direct interventions alone, he said.    The situation sharpened last September, when SRo had to  resort to drastic measures for economic reasons. It abolished  one of the three broadcasting circuits, almost halted the  production of its own drama programs, regular popular programs  were replaced by music, the broadcasting time was shortened, all  investments were stopped. There is no more money for the  modernization and maintenance of the equipment. The existence  of the two SRo orchestras is also threatened, Stefko said.    Last year, SRo had to dismiss 160 editors and creative  workers. The monthly wage of those remaining dropped by 1,500  korunas ($48), and now it is an average of 4,500 korunas ($145).  Stefko compared the subsidy of 30 million korunas (about $1  million), earmarked for SRo by the present government with "the  first pill of aspirin offered to a patient running a temperature  of 40 degrees."</p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> FIFTH-GRADERS SCORE WITH ANTI-DRUG FILM  </P> <P> A 26-minute drug-fighting video written, produced and enacted by 10  fifth-graders at Top of the World Elementary School has won second place in a  statewide competition.  </P> <P> In the film, the students dramatize, in skits, essays and song, the rewards of  remaining drug-free.  </P> <P> The Top of the World class competed in the largest category (75 entries from  fourth- through sixth-grades) in the contest, sponsored by the California Media  and Library Educators Assn. The association encourages student expression in  media technology.  </P> <P> The festival, now in its 24th year, focused on video, film, slides, animation,  "claymation" and computer-generated production from elementary schools through  colleges.  </P> <P> Funding for the Kid Vid, as participants dubbed it, came principally from a PTA  grant by First American Capital Bank of Laguna Beach and Corona del Mar.  Production was an after-school activity by volunteers who learned about  cameras, script writing and filming from Cathy Krinsky, a former owner of a  video production firm and a PTA chairwoman, and Linda Jarhaus, PTA president  and teacher.  </P></p>

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Construction Contracts: German power station generator order GEC ALSTHOM's Man Energie GmbH subsidiary has been awarded a Pounds 31m order by RWE Energie AG to design and supply a 155MW steam turbine generator for the KoBra combined cycle demonstration plant which is to be built at the Goldenberg power station south of Cologne. Man Energie already has overall engineering responsibility for the plant. EVT, another GEC-Alsthom German subsidiary, has been selected to design and supply components for KoBra's integrated lignite gasificafion plant. The KoBra demonstration plant will be the first plant in Germany to produce electricity using both coal gasification and combined cycle technology. It is hoped that the project will lead to further orders for fullscale commercial plants which would herald a new generation of clean, high-efficiency power stations in Germany. Compared with conventional power stations, the KoBra prototype is expected to attain 30 per cent higher efficiency when it starts commercial operation in 1996. It will also reduce emissions of sulphur and nitrous oxides to well under statutory levels whilst the improvement in efficiency will lower carbon dioxide emissions.</p>

			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SAFETY GROUPS BLAST U.S. AIR-BAG EFFORTS  </P> <P> Three auto safety groups accused the federal government Tuesday of failing to  promote and enforce air-bag rules, but a government highway safety spokesman  countered that passenger safety remains its top priority.  </P> <P> Public Citizen, the Center for Auto Safety and Motor Voters also issued a  "report card" on air bags that gave failing grades to all but four auto  manufacturers for laxity in installation of the passenger-protection devices.  </P> <P> The auto safety groups gave Chrysler the highest score on its "report card" of  the 12 major manufacturers selling cars in the United States, followed by  Mercedes. Ford and Volvo tied for third. All other auto makers "failed."  </P> <P> Ranking at the bottom, after General Motors, were Toyota, Volkswagen, Mazda,  Nissan, Honda, Hyundai and Subaru.  </P> <P> The groups said the rankings were based on the number of 1990 models equipped  with the safety devices as standard equipment, plans for future installation of  air bags, protection devices used in all seating positions of cars, information  provided to dealers and the contents of company ads.  </P> <P> The groups estimated that nearly one-third of the 10 million 1990 cars to be  sold in the United States will be equipped with driver's-side air bags,  compared to about 400,000 for the 1989 models. A new rule of the National  Highway Traffic Safety Administration requires that all 1990-model cars must  provide either a driver's air bag or lap-and-shoulder belts that automatically  encircle both front-seat occupants.  </P> <P> "NHTSA's engine seems to be stuck in neutral on air bags," said Joan Claybrook,  head of Public Citizen. She said the administration, which she once headed,  should promote air bags and closely monitor their use to perfect the several  systems being installed. Claybrook said the agency should conduct its crash  tests at higher speeds and upgrade its standards to mandate air bags for small  vans as well as cars.  </P> <P> "We are dumbfounded and mystified by her criticism," said administration  spokesman Barry McCahill. Promotion of all types of occupant protection systems  has been made the agency's "No. 1 priority," he said.  </P> <P> McCahill said the agency's decision to allow manufacturers the option of  installing air bags on the driver's side in combination with automatic belts on  the passenger side initially has accelerated the program. Eventually,  passenger-side air bags will also be required, he said.  </P></p>

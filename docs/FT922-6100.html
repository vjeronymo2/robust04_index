			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Yale chief quits to build US schools for profit THE PRESIDENT of Yale University, Mr Benno Schmidt, is resigning to lead a controversial project aimed at revitalising US education by building a national network of profit-making private schools. Mr Schmidt, a 50-year-old law scholar, is to become president and chief executive of the Edison Project, the brainchild of Mr Christopher Whittle, a Tennessee entrepreneur best known for his Channel One TV news programme beamed to classrooms. The project plans to break the mould of US education by creating 1,000 technologically advanced schools offering pre-school to high school education. Mr Whittle hopes to open 100 of the schools by 1996 and the rest by 2010. It aims to rethink the assumptions behind conventional schooling - from the length of the school day to classroom teaching methods. The Whittle schools hope to capitalise on deep-seated worries about the quality of America's state schools. A series of recent tests has shown US students languishing at the bottom of international league tables in subjects such as maths and science. The schools plan to charge fees of about Dollars 5,500 (Pounds 3,000) a year, roughly the average cost per child in the state school system. They expect to generate healthy profits by using fewer teachers and support staff than public schools and by making better use of new technology. About a fifth of pupils at the schools would be needy students funded by scholarships. The project has initial financing of Dollars 60m from a consortium including Whittle Communications, Mr Whittle's company, Time-Warner, Philips Electronics and Associated Newspapers of the UK. The Edison Project closely parallels the Bush administration's 'America 2000' initiative, which is financing pilot projects to design a new breed of public schools. Mr Schmidt will head a design team that includes Mr Chester Finn, a former top aide at the Department of Education, and Mr John Chubb, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and co- author of Politics, Markets and America's Schools, an influential book that made a powerful case for more competition and parental choice in US education. Mr Schmidt's surprise departure was the latest of several recent blows for Yale, which has lost two other senior officials in recent months. It recently announced controversial plans to close several academic departments in an effort to curb a Dollars 12m budget deficit.</p>

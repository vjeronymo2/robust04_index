			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 3 (CTK) -- Marian Andel, Slovak  National Party (SNS) parliamentary deputy, has told CTK he knows  nothing when asked whether the SNS leadership sent SNS Deputy  Chairman Juraj Molnar to the World Slavonic Congress held in  Moscow today.    "I personally know nothing. Neither me, nor (SNS Honorary  Chairman Jozef) Prokes, nobody," Andel said.    The World Slavonic Congress was initiated by the leader of  Russia's extreme nationalist Liberal Democratic Party (LDP),  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, as continuation of his party's congress  held yesterday.    Andel, deputy premier under the former government of  Vladimir  Meciar, said that he knew from official sources that a sole  person from Slovakia attending Zhirinovskiy's party congress was  Jozef Lauko. But he is there as a private person, Andel added.    Andel said there was no need to be hunting for any  sensations, even though "a sensation may be produced, but  certainly not of this kind," he added without elaborating.    Molnar, along with other foreign guests, was today sitting  in  the presidium of the World Slavonic Congress at which  Zhirinovskiy proposed the creation of an "Eastern European  Community of Slavonic Nations" spreading "from the Adriatic Sea  to the Kurile Islands."</p>

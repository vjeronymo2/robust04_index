			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Yelagin, section chief in the Russian </F> Federation Foreign Ministry Press and Information Department:  "Russia-Germany: Growing Mutual Interest"]    [Text] After the collapse of the former USSR, foreign  analysts and some Russian political scientists maintained that  it would take many years for Russian-German ties to become  consistent and dynamic in nature. But those forecasts were not  to be realized.    The regular meetings held between our countries' leaders are  the best indicator of the scale of bilateral relations in the  political sphere. Perhaps no other state leader in Europe  maintains such close contacts with the Russian Federation  president as Chancellor Kohl: There are reciprocal visits and a  constant exchange of opinions with Boris Yeltsin by telephone  and in the form of personal messages. Yesterday the Russian  president arrived in Germany on an official visit, and in August  he will take part in the send-off ceremony for the Russian  troops.    The cooperation between the two states rests on a  strengthening treaty and legal basis. Twenty five  intergovernmental and interdepartmental agreements have been  signed in the recent period alone.    Germany is now one of Russia's main economic partners. It  accounts for 17 percent of our foreign trade turnover. Russia  is a very important partner for the FRG in the east. Fifty-five  production-sharing contracts, mainly in machine building, are  now in operation between the two countries' companies. More  than 100 companies in production, trade, transport and dispatch,  insurance, and other areas of cooperation have been set up in  Germany using Russian capital. A considerable amount of our  exports to the FRG go via them.    The German side is helping the process of privatization in  Russia. The spectrum is diverse, ranging from the formation of  the legal bases of private enterprise to joint research efforts  and specific projects. For example, a company promoting  economic reforms in the Moscow Oblast is operating with active  German government department support and oversight. The  Wintershall Erdgas Handelshaus joint venture is functioning  successfully.    Enterprises with German share capital on Russian Federation  territory number more than 1,700. Germany is entering into  cooperation with Russia in the implementation of international  space projects. It also intends to make its contribution to the  program of implementing projects of ours in chemical production,  power generation, capital construction, and aircraft  construction. Business relations are being set up between our  two states' regions.    Sessions of the Russian-German Cooperation Council for  Economic, Scientific, and Technical Cooperation are held  regularly. A bureau for a representative [delegat] of the  German economy has been opened in St. Petersburg. Special  bursaries for Russian graduates of higher educational  institutions studying management, economics, and production  organization are being established in a number of German  concerns, for example, Daimler-Benz AG.    The FRG government intends to promote the involvement of  German private capital in Russian reforms. According to  experts' figures, German companies, with a total capital of $4.2  billion, make up 60 percent of foreign investors in Russia.    The FRG has helped in no small way the development of  relations between Russia and the EU. Moscow and Bonn are  stepping up their cooperation at the UN and CSCE level. It has  stated its readiness to support Russia's membership application  to the Council of Europe and is in favor of the creation of  strategic partnership relations between Russia and NATO.    Bonn has welcomed Russian diplomacy's efforts to unblock  the crisis situation over Sarajevo. The stances of Russia and  the FRG regarding the solution of the Yugoslav crisis coincide  to a large extent and there are no substantial disagreements.    All-around contacts are maintained in the military sphere.  Joint maritime exercises involving naval combined units will be  conducted this year. Troop exercises at the level of tactical  subunits are planned in the future. A center for training and  retraining our servicemen returning from Germany in civilian  specialisms was recently opened in the Russian capital with FRG  financial assistance. The sides are cooperating effectively in  the sphere of eliminating nuclear and chemical weapons.    A joint Russian-German commission for the reciprocal return  of cultural treasures removed during World War II has begun  work. Consultations on events to mark its 50th anniversary are  being held.    The problem of the ethnic Germans on Russian Federation  territory is a very important aspect of Russian-German  relations. A protocol was signed in July 1992 which envisages  cooperation in the phased restoration of the Russian Germans'  statehood and better provision of facilities in areas where they  represent a high proportion of the population. This year the  FRG will allocate 65 million German marks [DM] for these  purposes. For the first time Russia's draft budget earmarks 30  billion rubles likewise. Thanks to these measures, it has been  possible to check somewhat the growth of repatriation of Russian  Germans to Germany.    But our relations are not unclouded. Touching on problems in  the economic sphere, reciprocal trade turnover last year,  according to preliminary figures, was DM20.5 billion as against  DM21.8 billion in 1992. The worrying thing is that Moscow has  not to date been able to repay the debt of approximately DM40  billion accumulated since Soviet times. True, an  intergovernmental accord consolidating the foreign debts of  Russia and the former USSR was signed in September 1993. We  have been granted a 10-year deferment of payment on DM8  billions' worth of debt.    The question of German investments in the Russian economy is  critical. The amount of investment is substantially less than  in, say, a country like Hungary. This year new arrangements  regulating the cost of export credit guarantees have been  introduced through the well-known FRG company Hermes: We now  have to put 15 percent up-front in order to obtain credit  guarantees. This makes it less interesting for us to take them  up.    But these sore points can be treated. Boris Yeltsin's visit  to our friendly neighboring country will undoubtedly make a  substantial contribution to further deepening all-around  Russian-German parnership links.</p>

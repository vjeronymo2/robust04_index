			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> DESIGN STANDARDS DECISION DELAYED  </P> <P> The City Council has postponed for three months a decision on setting new  design standards for gasoline stations and automobile repair shops.  </P> <P> The council had been scheduled to vote on an ordinance that would affect future  stations or those planning extensive remodeling.  </P> <P> "It's something we really want to get right," said City Manager David N. Ream.  </P> <P> The ordinance, in its current form, would require stations to have such  features as 15 feet of frontage landscaping, five-foot planters around all  buildings, parking next to convenience stores, and a wall at least six feet  high along the rear and side property lines.  </P> <P> The requirements drew fire from an Arco representative at a council meeting  last week and from an engineering company that specializes in designing auto  service stations.  </P> <P> Leo Urquiza, president of Da Vinci Engineering Inc., said the ordinance doesn't  take into consideration the acreage of individual sites, traffic flow and the  amount of room needed for a tanker truck to deliver fuel.  </P> <P> Assistant Planning Director Kenneth Adams defended the proposed standards,  saying: "We consider this set of standards a generic set of standards  applicable across the board," Adams said.

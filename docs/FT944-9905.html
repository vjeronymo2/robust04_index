			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Gaullism's rivals suffer setbacks: Chirac and Balladur dent presidential hopes Gaullism's rival candidates for the French presidency next year each took a serious knock at the weekend, with prime minister Edouard Balladur losing a third minister to a political funding scandal and Mr Jacques Chirac winning only partial party backing in his campaign for for the Elysee. Mr Michel Roussin resigned on Saturday as aid minister in advance of the expected move by a magistrate to charge him this week in a case involving alleged bribes on housing contracts in 1992 when he headed Mr Chirac's office as mayor of Paris. Mr Balladur has appointed Professor Bernard Debre to replace him. As he did to plug the earlier ministerial gaps left by Mr Gerard Longuet and Mr Alain Carignon, the prime minister has simply replaced one Gaullist RPR party supporter of his with another. Several other ministers have been fleetingly mentioned in the context of various current inquiries into political funding, and Mr Charles Pasqua, the interior minister, had urged Mr Balladur to reshuffle his government. But the RPR prime minister preferred not to disturb the delicate political balance of his government in coalition with the centre-right UDF less than six months before the presidential election. The extraordinary feature of Prof Debre's appointment is that he has a parallel medical career as head of the Cochin hospital's urological unit, and that in 1992 and again this year it was he who led the team that operated on President Francois Mitterrand for prostate cancer. In the Balladur government, therefore, now sits someone who probably knows more than anyone else about the president's illness - the chief factor that has unleashed ferocious presidential rivalries so far ahead of the final voting round on May 7. Meanwhile, Mr Chirac's plan to organise a rousing send-off from the RPR to his presidential campaign partially misfired on Saturday. The 1,700 RPR delegates at a special meeting in Paris cheered Mr Chirac's often bitter and scarcely veiled swipes at Mr Balladur, but barely passed a motion of 'testimony and confidence' in the man who created the RPR in its present form 18 years ago and led the party until his resignation on Saturday. The worrying fact for Mr Chirac was not that the special congress was boycotted by Mr Balladur, who chose to attend a mountain rescue demonstration near his Alpine chalet, or by the prime minister's backers, but that it was shunned by several Gaullist heavyweights, notably Mr Philippe Seguin, the National Assembly president, who with Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign minister, co-presides over the new Chirac-for-President committee. Mr Seguin's real objection is said to be jealousy that Mr Juppe has now become interim president of the RPR. But, publicly, Mr Seguin complained that the Saturday meeting smacked of an attempt to get the RPR to endorse Mr Chirac as its only candidate, going against the spirit of De Gaulle's Fifth Republic. This held that presidential elections are a matter between candidates and the people, with little or no formal role for party machines. Mr Seguin warned that 'in refusing to publicly own up to each other's candidacy', Mr Chirac and Mr Balladur were 'engaged in a suicidal logic' and weakening each other and 'smoothing the way for a third man - Jacques Delors'. If the European Commission president were rapidly to give in to the Socialist party's blandishments and to declare that he will start running for the Elysee when he leaves Brussels late next January, this could quickly shock the warring Gaullists into closing ranks. Mr Delors is running level with Mr Balladur in the opinion polls, with Mr Chirac still a bit behind both. But last week in Paris Mr Delors said he was still 'not at the end of my reflection'. This includes weighing personal factors such as his desire for a rest after 10 years of hard service for the European Union. There are also electoral uncertainties - such as the real odds on him winning and subsequently gaining a governing majority after 14 years of socialism in the Elysee and after the socialists suffered such a parliamentary landslide defeat only 18 months ago.</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Management: 'Turf warfare' among the tourists ONE of the prime competitive advantages of multinational companies over regional or local rivals is supposed to be the ability to transfer knowledge and experience between their operations across the globe. Yet far too many of them are singularly inept at this 'worldwide learning', as business school academics call it. Take General Motors and Ford. In the 1980s GM's European operations were transformed under Opel's leadership from laggard into thriving powerhouse. Yet back home in Detroit things went from bad to worse, and then awful. The parent company was stubbornly resistant to any form of change, but especially to the notion that it had anything to learn from an upstart offshoot several thousand miles away. Only when GM had slumped almost to its knees a couple of years ago was Jack Smith, an American who had run the European operation some years before, finally able to start importing some lessons from there. His most dramatic European import, a few months before he became chief executive last autumn, was Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who had slashed Opel's costs and boosted its quality by revolutionising relations with its suppliers. What followed is fast becoming the stuff of legend - or nightmare, depending on your point of view. Lopez stayed less than a year, and then decamped for Volkswagen. GM's ire at this, which waxed still further this week as extreme allegations flew between it and VW, is not just over his alleged stealing of its secret plans. It is also because, in a more general sense, he embodies much of the Opel learning that the parent company still needs so badly. By contrast, one might expect Ford's internal difficulties with transatlantic learning to seem anodyne. But they have had their own share of intrigue, and are also more instructive for other companies with similar problems. For one thing, the necessary flow of learning should have been far easier than at GM, since it was in a more acceptable direction for the newly-revitalised Ford US: from itself to its ailing European offspring. For another, Ford tried far harder than GM to achieve the flow. A key facet of its problem, the incessant turnover of top managers at Ford of Europe and the consequent lack of a consistent push for change, is revealed in vivid inside detail for the first time in a discussion paper by Kenneth Starkey, reader in organisational analysis at the University of Nottingham's school of management and finance. Borrowing a phrase from many European cynics within Ford of Europe, Starkey calls the phenomenon 'executive tourism': the constant recycling of senior American managers, especially through the two top posts of chairman and president, as they clambered their way up the ladder towards greater things back home in Dearborn. In Ford US there was considerable stability in the equivalent two jobs: the pair most credited with its revival, Don Petersen and Harold Poling, were in post for nine and six years respectively between 1980 and 1989, and in tandem for five. The creative tension between them was also vital: Petersen was the visionary champion of change, while the efficiency-minded Poling 'kept the company's feet on the floor', as Starkey puts it. In Europe there were lots of Polings but no Petersen - apart from one change-minded chairman whose credibility with Dearborn was damaged by the early problems of the Ford Sierra. Not only that, but the instability of the chairmanship and presidency gave enormous clout to the one manager immediately beneath them who did stay in post throughout the 1980s, Bill Hayden, the vice-president of manufacturing. Hayden represented Ford's old obsession with cost, efficiency and control. And he resisted 'programme management' - the vital bridging of design, engineering, production and other specialist departments - until the late 1980s, when his change of heart gave it a very belated boost. Starkey's account of all this is replete with remarkable quotations from Ford managers at all levels. One of them complains that the European executive committee travelled around 'as a cloistered group', and that 'they never meet plant managers - they're like high-level tourists'. Hayden groans about top managers constantly winging their way over from the US and back again. 'When they arrived I'd usually go and introduce myself,' he says. 'But with time - it would register that a new guy had arrived but I didn't bother going down the corridor to knock on his door. The business went on as before, new chairman or not.' A further factor also put a brake on change in Ford of Europe: that for much of the 1980s its profits kept its parent afloat. 'The pressure was to keep producing profit, and keep doing the job that you're doing,' says one manager. So although various US change initiatives were exported to Europe, and adapted for local consumption, advocacy of them was not nearly as strong. The result is that Ford's European arm is in far worse shape today than its parent. At GM, where the boot is manifestly on the other foot, executives attribute much of its European success to a similar combination of top-level stability and championship of change as at Ford US. As Starkey argues, if top teams want to avoid 'groupthink' they must encourage constructive dissent within their organisations, rather than the all-too-common practice of 'turf warfare'. Smith and Lopez clearly thrived on that 'constructive dissent', and GM was feeling the benefit mightily. Which is partly why the Detroit giant feels it has lost so much by Lopez's defection, and such a bitter form of turf warfare has erupted with VW.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>   [Excerpt] The Foreign Ministry recently prepared its first  working paper on security arrangements for the Golan Heights in  the framework of a peace a agreement with Syria. The document  does not address the issue of withdrawal from the Golan Heights  or its extent in the framework of the arrangement; rather, it  examines the foundations of security arrangements between Israel  and Syria, such as demilitarizing territories, thinning out  forces, setting up early warning stations, and deploying  international supervisors.    The document was presented to Foreign Minister Shim'on  Peres,  Foreign Ministry top echelons, and senior members of the defense  establishment. The document is based on analyses of research by  HA'ARETZ's military commentator Ze'ev Schiff and by Brigadier  General (Reserves) Arye Shalev and which examined possible  security arrangements between Israel and Syria.    Two days ago, Peres held a discussion with his ministry's  top  officials on an arrangement with Syria. Over the past few days,  sources in the ministry have been saying that after completing  the agreement with the PLO, "we will race toward Syria."    In the discussion, Peres told the ministry staffers to  prepare proposals for the development of characteristics of  normalization in the arrangement with Syria, such as economic  ties between the two countries. Several ideas in this respect  have already been raised at the Foreign Ministry. [passage  omitted]</p>

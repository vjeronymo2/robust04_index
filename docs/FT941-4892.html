			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Observer: Car ping Clearly the people at Ford who invent brand names have run out of steam. At the Geneva motor show Ford has displayed its latest offering, called Ka; really inventive, boys. Still, what can we expect from the company which in the past has given us the Tudor (two-door) and its sister Fordor, and colours such as Hulla Blue, Thanks Vermilion and Freudian gilt. Next year? The Heep, the Dogg, the Skrapp?</p>

Maragay] </F>   [Text] The Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabayan  [Nationalist Revolutionary Alliance -- RAM] will not surrender  light anti-tank weapons and other high powered fire arms in its  possession despite a declaration by the government of a general  amnesty, its leader Gregorio "Gringo" Honasan said yesterday.    In an interview with the Manila Standard, Honasan reiterated  the RAM's stand against an amnesty proclamation by the  government for all rebels, opting instead for a "comprehensive  peace settlement" so that substantive issues addressed by the  RAM during the peace negotiations can be fully resolved.    "Even with an amnesty proclamation, we will not surrender  any  of our weapons. We will only turn over once a peace settlement  is reached," Honasan said. Earlier, the RAM claimed it still  possesses more than 30 light anti-tank weapons and several  high-powered arms, stressing that the movement is far from being  a spent force as the government alleged.    Honasan said that aside from the RAM's considerable  firepower, its influence over the armed forces remains and  continues to pervade down the line even over new graduates of  the Philippine Military Academy.    He said the "civilian component" of RAM has increased and  even exceeded its military component.    Despite claims it still has the strength and the manpower,  Honasan said the RAM does not rely on any outside funding from  abroad, but on its "support within the AFP [Armed Forces of the  Philippines]."    The RAM has indefinitely suspended peace talks with the  government since December last year, after Honasan raised issues  which he said should be resolved first before the negotiations  can continue.    The issues being questioned by the RAM include the arrest  and  continued detention of six RAM members by the military,  apprehended for illegal possession of ammunitions while the  peace negotiations were ongoing. The RAM also asked the  government for a reorganization in the armed forces and to allow  members of the RAM panel to the peace talks to carry firearms  for their security.    The movement has addressed several talking points in its  peace talks with the government: political reforms, economic  reforms, electoral reforms, a campaign to weed out graft and  corruption in the government and the implementation of a "true"  land reform program.    Before the suspension of the talks, the RAM and government  peace panels concentrated discussions on the implementation of  electoral reforms, in preparation for the forthcoming 1995  elections. The RAM wanted the government to "rotate" officials  in Comelec [Commission on Elections] nationwide as an initial  step to eliminating irregularities and fraud in the coming polls.    In pushing for a negotiated peace settlement instead of an  amnesty proclamation, Honasan said a declaration of a general  amnesty will only preempt the issues being addressed by the RAM  and government peace panels during the talks.    "If you declare an amnesty, that's it. But what we are  pushing for is the implementation of the reforms that we want.  People will tend to forget that there are still issues to be  resolved once an amnesty proclamation is announced," Honasan  said.    Meanwhile, President Ramos said yesterday a presidential  panel has not yet completed the draft of the second amnesty  proclamation covering members of all insurgent forces.    The president told his weekly press conference that the  proposal draft is still being refined by the panel composed of  officials of the Department of Interior and Local Government,  Department of National Defense and Office of the Presidential  Adviser on the Peace Process.    The draft of the amnesty proclamation was supposed to be  submitted to the president last 11 March. But apparently  several thorny issues have not yet been resolved by the  president and his advisers.    Among the unresolved issues are whether the amnesty should  be  unconditional or conditional, what common crimes can be absorbed  by the crime of rebellion, and the implications of declaring a  second round of amnesty on the ongoing peace negotiations with  the various rebel groups.</p>

			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Letter: Industry urged to support manadatory green audits Sir, While it may be true that a leading company such as Guinness could suffer negative public relations if it did not sign up to the proposed voluntary 'green' audit scheme, while Carlsberg did, ('Industrial controls must back greening incentives', Letters April 11), this would not be true, or even important, for the two-thirds of companies which are not important in commercial or industrial markets. The public may therefore be entitled to remain sceptical of the voluntary environmental charter which was recently launched by the International Chamber of Commerce ('Leading companies in green pledge', April 11). If industry is to be believed about both wanting to 'green up' its act and to achieve the kind of 'level playing field' that Josiah Wedgwood wanted when he asked government to extend the Factories Act from textiles to potteries, then it should support our call for a mandatory environmental auditing scheme. David Gee, director, Friends of the Earth, 26-28 Underwood Street, N1</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pietermaritzburg June 18 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom  Party [IFP] leader and Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu  Buthelezi on Saturday [18 June] accused the African National  Congress of using the KwaZulu/Natal provincial capital issue to  try and "demonise" him and his party. Speaking at an IFP  victory rally at Taylor's Halt near Pietermaritzburg, Mr  Buthelezi said: "If the people of this province wish to have  Ulundi as their capital, Ulundi shall be the capital".    He said the ANC's opposition to Ulundi as capital was rooted  more in political anger and resentment than in rational and  sound political argument.    He said the attitude was "extremely destructive,  counter-productive and contrary to the spirit of provincial  reconciliation".    According to Mr Buthelezi, the Ulundi controversy was a  smokescreen which the ANC was using for a new campaign to try  "once again to demonise me and demonise the IFP".    He added if the people chose Ulundi as the capital and this  created administrative problems, corrective compromises and  interim measures would be sought to solve them. He said the  resources in administrative offices and infrastructures  available in pietermaritzburg would be fully utilised,  irrespective of where the seat of government would be.    Turning to problems within the IFP, Mr Buthelezi said there  were certain party members who were also trying to boycott  provincial Premier Dr Frank Mdlalose "because of their own  personal convenience".    "I wish to warn these members of the IFP and remind them  that  their primary responsibility is to serve those who elected them  into office.    "They were put where they are by me and the IFP. There is  such a thing as party discipline.    "They should therefore not force us to ask them to resign",  he added.</p>

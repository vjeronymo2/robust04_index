			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US grain sales to Russia eased ANOTHER SUBTLE adjustment in US Department of Agriculture credit guarantee policy this week will allow more grain to be shipped to Russia during the next few months. The action seems to be part of a programme to warm up US export channels that froze when the former Soviet Union stopped making interest payments on its US-backed grain loans four months ago. The move comes before President Clinton's meeting with President Boris Yeltsin this weekend. Grain traders expect the US to produce a new aid package at that meeting facilitating additional grain shipments to Russia. The USDA amended its credit guarantees to exporters so that 600,000 tonnes of US maize and - sold before interest payments on US-backed loans stopped in late November - could be shipped. Banks had been reluctant to issue letters of credit to back the USDA-registered sales for fear of incurring non-guaranteed risk. Without the letters, exporters were unable to deliver the grain. The USDA amendments will move the grain, but increases the agency's exposure to Russia's grain defaults, which are expected to reach Dollars 1 bn by June. The restored sales, which are worth about Dollars 250m, and this month's massive US food donations will keep grain flowing to Russia while the Clinton administration and G7 policy makers review debt rescheduling options. During March, the US announced donations of 520,000 tonnes of wheat, 210,000 of corn, and 87,000 of rice. An cash sale to Russia of 120,000 tonnes of soyameal, made last week, will also enter shipping channels soon. Separately, Canada is arranging barter sales of its feed wheat to Russia. Canada suspended grain sales to the the Soviet Union in September when it fell behind on its Dollars 1.5 bn credit line with the Canadian Wheat Board. All of this was bullish news to farmers who would like to see the US-Russian grain trade normalised. But prices for next year's maize and soyabean crops were lower after the USDA announcement, while wheat prices received only a minor boost.</p>

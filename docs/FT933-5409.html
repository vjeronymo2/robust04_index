			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Up for grabs: Raymond Snoddy on a price-cutting strategy at The Times The public announcement that The Daily Telegraph newspaper was going to halve its cover price could not have been more unexpected. There had, of course, been a lively debate within the organisation over such a drastic step. Some senior executives pointed to an intractable dilemma. To get a higher circulation, you might have to alter the content and make the paper less demanding. Do that and advertisers might not want to pay so much. But the price-cutters, led by Lord Camrose, got their way. On December 1 1930 The Daily Telegraph reduced its price from 2p to 1p, joining the popular dailies and leaving The Times at 2p. The result was phenomenal. In a month, its circulation jumped from 100,000 to 175,000, and two weeks later to 190,000, at least some of the gain coming from The Times. Thus was the future of the modern Daily Telegraph laid. It is unlikely that anything so significant will happen on Monday when The Times cuts its cover price from 45p to 30p - and from 50p to 40p on Saturdays. Ironically, one of its targets will be The Daily Telegraph, price 48p on weekdays. The move was personally authorised by Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation which owns The Times, who has become convinced that newspapers may be too expensive. It will herald an autumn of intense competition in the broadsheet newspaper market in the UK. The initial industry reaction is that Mr Peter Stothard, editor of The Times, and Mr Murdoch, must have gone mad. The common wisdom is that the price of newspapers - particularly broadsheet newspapers - is not a main factor in the decision to buy. Mr Harold Lind, the newspaper consultant who has warned of declining readership, is not so sure. 'I think it (The Times) has a sporting chance. Cutting the price of The Sun was silly,' he said yesterday. In July, Mr Murdoch cut the price of his mass-market tabloid Sun from 25p to 20p for the summer, and has now extended the discount into 1994. The difference between the two price cuts, in Mr Lind's judgment, lies in the distinct economics of tabloid and broadsheet newspapers. Only about 30 per cent of the revenues of newspapers like The Times comes from their cover price, with the rest from advertising. With popular tabloids the ratios are reversed. 'The Times' price cut amounts to only 8 or 9 per cent of total revenues,' Mr Lind said. Nevertheless, the cut is likely to cost News Corporation millions of pounds in lost revenue, particularly because payments to wholesalers and newsagents are being held at their old level, based on a cover price of 45p. The extent of the losses will depend on how many extra copies are sold and whether advertisers will pay more as a result. 'You get 50,000 copies ahead of the nearest competitor and it doesn't matter what the total circulation is. You are the cock on the dunghill,' said Mr Lind. Official average sales for The Times from February to July this year give The Times a circulation of 363,799, which represents a 6.5 per cent drop over the same period last year. The Independent, price 45p, the closest rival of The Times, fell by 9 per cent to 343,308, while the left-of-centre Guardian, price 45p, held on to most of its circulation - 411,981, down 1.16 per cent. The Daily Telegraph fell 1.6 per cent to 1.2m, with The Financial Times, at 65p, down 0.67 per cent to 289,826. Apart from Mr Murdoch's instinct and propensity for rejecting conventional business wisdom, he has been struck by the success of Lord Camrose in the 1930s. He is also relying on the results of a month-long price-cutting experiment in the county of Kent, which saw sales of The Times increase by an average 14 per cent, according to News Corporation. A check of four representative wholesalers in Kent in the week ending August 15 found that The Times had increased sales by 12.5 per cent compared with the week ending July 31, when it was still at the old price. In this check The Independent suffered worst - down 7.2 per cent, followed by The Guardian, which showed a 5.6 per cent loss. The Telegraph was much less badly affected, at 2.6 per cent down, and the FT was scarcely hit with a 0.7 per cent loss. The number one target of The Times is clearly The Independent, which plans a relaunch with new sections at the beginning of next month and will almost certainly have to raise new finance later in the year. The paper reacted angrily to The Times' move and changed its front page to accuse Mr Murdoch of trying to put The Independent and the Independent on Sunday out of business. The Guardian decided not to comment. The successors of Lord Camrose at The Daily Telegraph were dismissive and made it clear they had no intention of getting involved in a price war. Mr Joe Cooke, managing director of The Telegraph group, said yesterday: 'We think it's sad to see a British institution in such an undignified state, marketing itself not as a paper of record, not for its wide coverage or fine writing, not even for its integrity but 'Buy Me, I'm Cheap'.' Mr Murdoch has identified The Telegraph as his prime target over the next decade because it has so many readers to try to lure away. The hope at News Corporation is that the price cut will relatively quickly take the circulation of The Times above 400,000 again by winning back old Times readers, persuading occasional readers to buy more frequently, and poaching readers from other titles. Apart from the other broadsheets, some new sales could come from readers of middle-market titles such as the Daily Mail and Daily Express, now 2p a day more expensive than The Times. The price-cutting strategy was greeted with some scepticism in the City. Ms Lorna Tilbian, media observer at S G Warburg, the stockbroker, said: 'I don't understand the policy. What they really ought to do is concentrate on the quality of the editorial rather than trying to turn a premium product into a commodity.'</p>

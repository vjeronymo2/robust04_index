			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto by </F> unidentified correspondent; place and date not given --  recorded, in English with superimposed German translation]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Correspondent] In view of the  great poverty in your country and the poor economic situation,  it is difficult to understand why you spend so much money on  your army. Could you please explain this. Do you perhaps feel  threatened by India?    [Bhutto] We don't like to spend so much money on our army,  but because of the threat by India we are forced to do so.  Germany was very lucky in the sense that its defense was taken  on by others and it could therefore tackle social and economic  needs. But up to now we have had to survive three wars, and in  1971 Pakistan was split in two, into Bangladesh and Pakistan.  It is therefore very important for us to protect our  territorial integrity. That's why we spend so much money on our  defense.    India has incidentally just raised its defence budget by 20  percent, and that exerts great pressure on a country such as  Pakistan. We have therefore proposed many times that the  outstanding contentious issues between India and Pakistan should  finally be settled. The most important conflict is the conflict  over Kashmir. This is what led to the wars between our two  countries, and if this dispute is resolved, then both India and  Pakistan can turn to the more productive uses of their resources.    [Correspondent] Is there a dialogue between India and  Pakistan about the Kashmiri conflict at the moment? Can we  expect a solution soon?    [Bhutto] Well, we would like to have a political dialogue  and  solve the dispute over Kashmir. We have tried to start a  dialogue, but as in the case of my predecessors, I have  unfortunately not succeeded either. When I became prime  minister the two countries, India and Pakistan, had not talked  to each other for 18 months and I said, my God, that's an  incredibly long time. We agreed to conduct talks at foreign  minister level. I told the foreign ministers, let's not waste  the opportunity for dialogue, we must end what is going on in  Kashmir tomorrow. But we were greatly disappointed. Instead of  the murders ending within 48 hours, 50 people were killed in  Sopor and even more in Kupwara. We were forced to break off the  talks because of those murders. But we made it clear to India  that we are prepared for negotiations again as soon as they take  measures against the oppression.    But we cannot talk just for the same of talking, especially  not when people are murdered and women are raped. That is the  worst thing about war. I don't know if it was always the case,  but now in Bosnia and in Kashmir, we've seen that rape is being  used as a weapon by the forces of occupation, and that's a  double crime, a crime not only of aggression, but a crime  against women too.    [Correspondent] Do you need nuclear weapons against India,  since you obviously have these weapons and this is something  which is strongly criticized here in the West?    [Bhutto] Pakistan has not detonated its nuclear weapons, and  I believe that people respect Pakistan for this restraint, in  spite of the fact that we have had three wars with India and  India itself has detonated nuclear weapons. Pakistan has  exercised restraint, but we have the technology, and if we  wanted to we could detonate an atomic weapon. But because we  back the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and because we are  not in favor of a nuclear arms race on our subcontinent, we have  exercised restraint.    However, at the same time we cannot pursue a policy of  unilateral disarmament. We are afraid that India could attack  us and that we would have no deterrent. After all, India is  five times as large as we are, as are its army and defense  expenditure. We have proposed regional talks on the  non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, but India has refused. We  have proposed negotiations about our weapons, but India refused  to accept this as well, and the message I should like to send  out to the world is that Pakistan is a sensible and responsible  actor on the world stage, a country which has not detonated its  nuclear weapons, despite provocation. The world community must  bring pressure on India to have a meaningful dialogue on  Kashmir, on nonproliferation and on missiles.    [Correspondent] You know that Western investors fear nothing  more than political instability. What can you promise these  investors? Is your country so stable that investors have  nothing to be afraid of?    [Bhutto] They don't need to be afraid. Pakistan is a stable  society. We have a consensus that foreign capital can flow back  into the country and that companies can indeed be fully owned by  foreigners. But what has created most confidence in Pakistan's  industry is our state management, and the fact that we have  reduced the budget deficit. [passage omitted]</p>

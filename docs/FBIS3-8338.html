			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Labor Minister Leszek Miller has called the  statement by Solidarity leaders--that the union intended, by  staging strikes, to make the government commence talks--forcing  open the door that is already open. Leszek Miller rejected the  union's accusations, pointing out a number of negotiations that  have been conducted with the unions since the moment this  government was formed.    [Begin Miller recording] From the moment the government was  formed, talks have been taking place in various ministries on  the restructuring of plants in Mielec, Lodz, and Walbrzych.  Talks have been taking place on the restructuring of Polish  State Railways. In January, talks began with the mining trade  union federations, in the form of both a review and  negotiations. As a result of those talks, an agreement on  social protection in the mining industry was signed last week.  Finally, on 18 January, the Council of Ministers made a  decision on beginning talks on social guarantees for citizens.  These talks are still taking place, and significant progress  has already been achieved.    In conclusion, let me also mention a fact that is of great  importance also from the point of view of the political system:  On 15 February, the Council of Ministers made a decision on the  setting up of a tripartite commission for socioeconomic affairs.  This is an event that is significant for the political system  because a platform for negotiating and resolving disputes has  now been built into the sociopolitical landscape of our country.  What is more, this will happen with the future in mind, because  this is a tripartite setup, characteristic of West European  systems, where employers, trade unions, and the government have  an opportunity to hold serious talks and search for ways to  ensure social peace.    When it comes to the other two demands that have been  surfacing--the demand for the budget to be amended--the  government cannot negotiate this demand because the parliament  recently approved the budget. If the government wanted to  influence the Sejm now, in order to make it work out radical  changes in the budget, the government would not only fail to be  acting in a serious way, but would also breach the democratic  principles of a law-abiding state.    The second demand concerns the Enterprise Pact. The  government cannot influence the pace at which the pact  regulations are approved by the parliament. The government has  already submitted five bills. One of them has been passed and is  in force. The second bill on the enterprise social fund is  awaiting the president's signature. The remaining ones are  currently being examined by the extraordinary commission working  on the Enterprise Pact. [end recording]    Eugeniusz Morawski, deputy minister of industry and trade,  and Aleksander Janiszewski, director general of Polish State  Railways, who took part in the meeting with journalists, both  agreed that strategic areas of economy such as the power and  mining industries, as well as the railways, were not a scene of  social conflict but an instrument of political struggle.</p>

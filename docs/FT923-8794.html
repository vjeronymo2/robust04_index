			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Major's crisis of confidence THE LONDON stock market's Duke of York march in the past 10 days, which began with a sharp rally, and then wearily jolted back to its starting point, has a wider message. In a period when the chairman of Barclays Bank warned of at least another year of recession, in which the voters showed their first poll majority for Labour, and in which the Washington Post wrote what amounted to an obituary of the whole of British society, nobody any longer expects good news in the foreseeable future. This mood is itself a crisis: confidence will not recover until the economy shows some sign of bounce, but the economy will find it hard to progress as long as the mood persists. The Washington Post views Britain as a society in terminal decline, throttled by its own class system which is hardly novel; but there is no need for such a fatalistic diagnosis. The present crisis has clear and immediate causes in the economic and financial cycle, in the operation of the ERM, and in British politics. These are intractable problems, but not as intractable as the British class system. The government might take a first step towards restoring confidence in its judgment, if not in its policies, by admitting the facts, as Sir John Quinton did, rather than inviting satire by proclaiming yet again that recovery is just round the corner. It isn't. Sir John did not denounce the government, and indeed supported its present policies; his warning amounted to a well-merited mea culpa. The wave of bankruptcies which is making most employees feel unsafe in their jobs, and the high borrowing costs of which industry complains so loudly, are almost entirely the result of reckless lending in the 1980s. In this respect Barclays is simply the first among British banking equals, and all of them could point to far worse examples in the US, where whole regions have lost all their independent banks, in Australia, and above all in Japan. Mass hysteria Financial crises of this kind, the result of a kind of mass hysteria, are hard to explain, for the warnings - in London in 1973-74, in third world lending in the later 1970s, in Texas in the early 1980s and in New England at the end of the decade - were loud and insistent. This is supposed to be the information age; but as James Grant, the New York credit analyst, has remarked, the banks do not seem to have joined in. They lent regardlessly to over-extended companies, on the supposed security of unsustainable collateral values, and we have yet to get the measure of their losses. This is one reason why a downturn of this kind is so obstinate, and so unlike the normal cyclical economic models which have misled the British Treasury. Banks, once they have woken up to their own past follies, do not immediately make provision for all their doubtful claims; they cannot afford to. Instead, they try to recoup their ravaged capital through higher charges and wider margins - the main reason why borrowing costs remain high. As fast as their balance sheet will bear, they allow the truth to emerge; but this is only the visible tip of the iceberg which will keep the economy chilled until the whole mass has melted. Other terminal risks are kept, sometimes for years, on financial life support to avoid fatally embarrassing write-downs (which explains why the normal sign of a recovery is a sudden climax in bankruptcies). Meanwhile lending costs remain high, and lending confidence low; and no analyst has yet been able to put a term on the 'meanwhile'. Further, as long as depressed conditions drive down profits and prices, the stock market will find it hard to rally, and even those consumers who feel safe in their jobs will have good reason to defer purchases. Reducing inflation is not all joy. Unusually mild Compared with these deep-seated problems, the difficulties of holding sterling within the ERM are a temporary embarrassment. The slowdown in Germany, which inspired an unusually mild briefing from the Bundesbank president last week, offers some hope of relief. But the hesitant recovery in the US, which provoked the usual complaints from an embattled President Bush yesterday, shows how long it takes even low interest rates and a super-competitive exchange rate to overcome financial gloom. Meanwhile, confidence is largely in the hands of the politicians; and it is here that Mr Major is failing at present. He does a little good by stealth - for example, by trimming rates on National Savings to take the pressure off building societies, a sensible step despite the usual grumbles from foreign exchange dealers. An open season on motorway stops may provoke some activity. But he risks looking helpless, whether in the face of recession or of Bosnian atrocities, and calling it a virtue. He could try harder: through the British presidency of the EC, urging more action to address a deepening international recession; at home, through even a modest programme of public investment, financed perhaps through public sector pay restraint. The economic impact would be small, but the psychological effect could be large.</p>

The proposed amendment would permit a bank holding company or its nonbank subsidiary to discount any of its products or services on condition that a customer obtain another product or service from that company or subsidiary or from any of its nonbank affiliates, provided that all products offered in the package arrangement are separately available for purchase. This exception would not apply when any product in the arrangement is offered by a bank. The board believes that this will increase the efficiency with which banking organizations can deliver banking services. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be submitted on or before September 17, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments should refer to Docket No. R&hyph;0843, and may be mailed to William W.

In addition to comments on the proposed rule, which is being made final in a separate document published elsewhere in this issue of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the Board received various requests for interpretation or extension of regulatory exceptions to the tying restrictions imposed by section 106 and Regulation Y. In particular, commenters urged the Board to reconsider its extension of the tying restrictions of section 106 to bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Amendments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After considering those requests, the Board has decided to propose an amendment to its anti-tying regulation to conform it more closely to section 106 and its focus on tying by banks. Under the proposed rule, bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries would be permitted to offer discounts on packaged products when: (1) Both the tying and tied products <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  are offered by bank holding companies or their nonbanking subsidiaries_in other words, where no affiliated bank is involved in the arrangement; and (2) both the tying and tied products are separately available. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In cases that do not qualify for this (or some other) exception, the general restrictions of section 106 and Regulation Y would continue to apply; for example, if the package arrangement involved a product offered by an affiliated bank, the exception would not apply and the nonbanking subsidiary could only offer discount package arrangements involving exclusively traditional bank products or securities brokerage services, under exceptions recently adopted by the Board and to take effect in thirty days. The antitrust laws also would continue to apply in all cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  The ``tying'' product is the product whose consideration is being varied or whose availability is being conditioned. The ``tied'' product is the product that must be purchased in order to receive a discount on the tying product or become eligible to purchase the tying product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  The Board recognizes that requiring the products to be separately available effectively requires that the exception be limited to discounting, and vice versa, but is proposing both conditions in order to avoid any ambiguity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>
